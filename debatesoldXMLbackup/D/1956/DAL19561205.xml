      <P>I should like to make this short observation respecting supplementary questions.  Members are aware that there are 108 questions for oral answer on to-day's Order Paper and that the time allotted to them is only one hour.  There are 24 questions on to-morrow's Paper.  This being so the Chair urges the exercise of some degree of self-restraint in asking supplementary questions. Deputies should bear in mind the rights of Members whose questions are at the end of the paper and who are anxious to hear their replies to-day and not to-morrow.  In the interests of the latter Members, the Chair must occasionally intervene to secure that their rights are preserved by limiting supplementary questions.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will enumerate and name, stating the purpose and function of each one, the several advisory or consultative councils, commissions, committees and similar bodies appointed by the Government or by him since 1st June, 1954.</P>

      <P>One such body, namely the Atomic Energy Committee, has been appointed by the Government since the 1st June, 1954.  The Committee's function is to advise the Government on certain matters concerning the peaceful uses of atomic energy.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that I put down one question to the Taoiseach about the consultative bodies and could the Taoiseach say why it was necessary to break up my question into a separate question for each of the Ministers, as apparently was done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that in the County Dublin area a big number of homes has been broken up as a result of the unemployment position and that there is large scale emigration from the area; and, if so, what particular steps the Government will take to prevent the break-up of so many homes in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>While there has, regrettably, been some increase recently in the numbers on the Live Register in County Dublin, no statistics of emigration are available since those based on the Preliminary Report of the Census of Population of April, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to questions addressed to me in this House on the 24th and 31st October, 1956, I referred to the Government's decisions publicly announced by me on the 5th October, which, as I pointed out, constitute a practical, constructive programme designed to give effect to our policy of promoting an expanding economy, a lasting reduction in unemployment and a lasting and progressive increase in productive employment.  Since then&mdash; on the 23rd November&mdash;details were <Col N="1831" /> announced of the apportionment of the sum of £1,000,000 which the Government decided to make available for expenditure on certain works during the remainder of the current financial year.  As the House has already been informed, where local authorities are concerned with projects to which this money is to be applied, the allocations to the different local authorities will be made in the manner and subject to the conditions applicable to previous similar allocations, and the time at which payment from such allocations will be made to a local authority concerned will depend, as heretofore, on the progress made by the local authority within the purposes for which the allocations have been made.</P>
    <P>The following list of works of a public character in the County Dublin area that either are already in progress or will commence in the early future includes, in the case of certain items, allocations out of the sum of £1,000,000 to which I have referred:-</P>

    <P>I expect that the foregoing list will help to satisfy the Deputy that the County Dublin area is very far from being neglected so far as employment-giving works of a public character are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should add, in regard to industrial developments, that, quite apart from proposals affecting the County Borough <Col N="1832" /> of Dublin it is estimated that new industrial undertakings or extensions to existing concerns to go into production before the end of 1957 will ultimately provide employment for about 100 persons in the County Dublin area.  This estimate is based on the industrial proposals at present before the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Industrial Development Authority and, of course, takes no account of any further proposals that may come forward for consideration. In addition, the allocation of £100,000 which is being made to the E.S.B. out of the sum of £1,000,000 already mentioned, to enable the board to purchase further supplies from home sources for the purposes of rural electrification, may be expected to have favourable effects on employment in the County Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he was not aware that there was a large number of homes broken up in County Dublin as a result of unemployment. I want to ask him will he carry out a survey of my constituency? He will find that there is a number of homes broken up as a result of unemployment and the position is very serious.  While the Taoiseach has read out a very glowing statement here of all the works in County Dublin, it is very little good to the people who have been thrown out of employment and who are emigrating day after day.  I suggest that the position is very serious in County Dublin and I want the Taoiseach to carry out a survey, to prove that the statements I have made here are true.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to this question must, necessarily, be subject to any rulings by the Ceann Comhairle &mdash;who, under Standing Order No. 49, &ldquo;is the sole judge of order in the <Col N="1833" /> Dáil&rdquo;&mdash;as to the application of Standing Order No. 31, which states that &ldquo;Questions addressed to a member of the Government must relate to public affairs connected with his Department, or to matters of administration for which he is officially responsible.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subject to what I have just said, I take the view that general questions relating to broad issues of Government policy should, ordinarily, be answered by me, but that questions relating to particular aspects of a matter such as the unemployment problem should be answered by the Minister or Ministers immediately concerned: for example, questions relating to industrial unemployment, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and questions relating to unemployment alleged to be caused by the Government's fiscal or financial policies, by the Minister for Finance. Questions of a purely statistical nature relating to unemployment are answered by my Parliamentary Secretary on my behalf or by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the recent statement by the new owner of the Kenmare estate that he proposes to establish a colony of rich Americans on Ross Island on the shores of the Lower Lake, Killarney, he will state if the Government have considered whether or not the national interests may be prejudiced by the implementation of the proposal, and if they propose to take any steps in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the announcement made by the new owner of the Kenmare estate of plans in relation to Ross Island.  I have also noted that he has repeated his earlier undertaking to do nothing which would harm the traditions of Killarney or spoil its natural beauty.  The Government have no reason to doubt that this undertaking will be honoured in full, and the question of their taking any steps in relation to these plans will, therefore, not arise unless, in the carrying out of the plans, any consideration directly affecting the national interest should emerge.  I have no reason to believe that, in such an event, the owner of the property would be otherwise than co-operative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

Is it not a fact that the present occupier&mdash;and I use the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;&mdash;intends without doubt to establish a rest camp in Kenmare estate for the purpose of facilitating a bunch of neurotic Hollywood personalities in between their matrimonial swopping activities?</P>

      <P>The entry in Item 23 of the Balance of International Payments Statement in respect of shipping charges, etc., is the balance between a credit item representing the payments to Irish concerns for freight and insurance on imports and exports of merchandise and a debit item for payments to externs covering the cost of repairs, bunkers, stores, purchases of new ships, etc. This net entry amounted to £0.3 million in 1953, £1.0 million in 1954 and £1.0 million in 1955.</P>
      <P>This item does not relate to all freight and insurance charges on merchandise trade or to charges for passenger traffic.  Imports are valued on a c.i.f. basis in the Balance of International Payments and therefore take account of all freight and insurance charges to the place of importation. Allowance is also made in Item 14, &ldquo;Net receipts in respect of tourism, travel, etc.&rdquo;, for the receipts of Irish transport companies and for the payment to externs by Irish residents in respect of passenger traffic.</P>

      <P>It is estimated from the official consumer price index numbers that £1 at mid-August, 1956, would have purchased at retail prices the same quantum of goods and services as 8/- at mid-August, 1938, 14/8 at mid-August, 1948, and 18/8 at mid-August, 1954.  Particulars for mid-October are not available since the index number is compiled only for the middle of the months of February, May, August and November.

I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement furnishing the information in so far as it is available.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Percentage which the net tonnage of Irish-registered vessels entering or clearing ports in Ireland with cargo while engaged on direct trade with Britain, including their repeated voyages, bore to the net tonnage of all vessels engaged on such trade, including their repeated voyages, in the years 1953, 1954 and 1955.</P>

      <P>Census of Industrial Production returns made by wholesale boot and shoe factories in respect of years after 1952 do not distinguish, among the materials used, home produced from imported leather.  For previous years this information was available and in 1950 the value of home-produced leather constituted 75 per cent. of the value of all leather used by such concerns, the corresponding figures in 1951 and 1952 being 76 per cent. and 80 per cent. respectively.  An examination of the general statistics for leather production, imports, etc., suggests that the proportion in question did not vary much from its earlier level in 1953 and 1954.  Particulars for 1955 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any such experts as he mentions are operating on behalf of private enterprise and that it is a matter for the experts and their principals to decide which areas they will examine.  I may say, however, that visiting experts invariably contact the Geological Survey.  The Geological Survey has a considerable amount of information about mineral deposits in the areas referred to by the Deputy, and this information has been brought to the notice of all persons likely to be interested in undertaking minerals exploration and development work in these areas.  I may also say that a digest of information on the subject has already been given at their request to an industrial development group from County Leitrim and that the same facility will be extended to any other group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce from what areas or counties the 220 logs of ash, oak and sycamore were exported for testing their suitability for the production of veneers; what firm obtained the licence to export them, and the names of the directors of this firm; if there is any reason why so many logs were exported for the experiment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the counties or areas from which the logs in question were obtained.  The quantity of logs licensed for export was in accordance with the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority.  With regard to the other parts of the question, I would remind the Deputy that it is not the practice to publish information which would identify the sponsors of new industrial proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the 220 logs included 80 logs for which a previous licence was issued prior to the 1st April, 1956?  Will he also answer the latter portion of the question: is there any reason why so many logs were exported for this experiment? It appears that the value of the logs exported was up to £4,000 and people engaged in the business seem to think that was an abnormal amount.  Would the Minister further <Col N="1845" /> say if the Industrial Development Authority consulted with the Irish timber merchants before the licence was issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This export was permitted on the specific recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority which has been charged, not merely by this Government but by the previous Government, with endeavouring to establish a mill here for the production of veneers from Irish timber.  The Industrial Development Authority felt that it was desirable to grant this permit so as to gain experience in the use of certain Irish timber in the manufacture of veneers. The total quantity involved would not, of course, keep a veneer factory going for one day and the quantity is relatively small in that context.  All I can tell the Deputy is that when the matter had been thoroughly examined by the Industrial Development Authority, a recommendation was accepted by the Department of Industry and Commerce purely on advice of the body which, having surveyed the whole potentiality of establishing a veneer mill here, felt this was a worthwhile permit to grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand, the I.D.A. discussed with the firm to which the licence was issued, the question of establishing a veneer mill here.  The firm reported to the I.D.A. that they, in turn, were in consultation with a group which had experience in the manufacture of veneer and the question at issue was: would Irish timber be suitable for conversion into veneer.  The I.D.A., having discussed that with the firm, recommended to the Department of Industry and Commerce that the licence should be granted and it was on the recommendation of the I.D.A. that the licence was granted so as to try out the question which was then at issue.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer given by the Taoiseach to a question asked by the Deputy in Dáil Éireann on 21st November concerning the economic and financial consequences likely to follow from the Middle East situation and the blockage of the Suez Canal.  In the course of his reply the Taoiseach dealt with the possible repercussions on shipping, on freight charges and on supplies and prices of imported goods. The situation has not yet clarified to an extent that would make me wish to add anything to what the Taoiseach said on that occasion beyond saying that, except in the case of petroleum products, we do not so far appear to have experienced any immediately adverse effects either as regards availability of shipping space for our trade or the maintenance of supplies.</P>

      <P>The allocation of petroleum oils to this country as well as to other member countries will be made by the O.E.E.C. which is at present considering the basis on which allocations generally should be made. For the purpose of planning rationing and distribution controls, I have had to assume certain overall levels of supply; but, pending the decision of O.E.E.C., I do not consider it to be desirable or likely to serve any useful purpose that I should announce what these levels are; nor would it be practicable at this stage to make forward estimates of monthly supplies as requested by the Deputy.  I would refer the Deputy to the fact that when forecasting petrol rations, I made it clear that should there be any material alteration in the supply position the coupon values will be varied upwards or downwards according as is appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) why the current tree planting distance has been increased from 5' × 5' to 6' × 6', (b) the technical reasons for such change, (c) the number and location of the experiments, and the soil types on which such experiments were carried out, (d) whether the quality of the ground to be planted is similar to that planted heretofore, and (e) the reduction in the number of working days in the current financial year caused by the difference between a lay-out per acre of 1,750 plants and 1,250 plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension.  There has in fact been no general increase in planting distances but the practice of using 6' x 6' spacing for certain species when planted pure has been extended. The only important species in question are Sitka Spruce, Douglas Fir, and Japanese Larch but 6' spacings are <Col N="1863" /> used also for some numerically less significant species, e.g. Silver Fir, Abies Grandis and Ash.  Six foot spacing cannot be termed revolutionary from a silvicultural point of view.  In forestry wide spacing is usually considered to mean spacings in the region of 10' x 10' such as are widely used in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.  The limited silvicultural difference between 6' and 5' spacing can best be illustrated by the fact that on the 6' spacing the side branches have only to spread a further 6&rdquo; (from 2½' to 3') before closing of canopy is effected.  In terms of growth, other things being equal, this would probably mean a delay in closing the canopy of from one to two years.</P>
      <P>The species for which the wider spacing has been specified are the Pacific and Japanese conifers which are of more rapid growth rate both in height and lateral spread than the European conifers.  The only exceptions are Pinus Contorta and Abies Mobilis. In the case of the Pinus Contorta the closer 5' spacing is used on account of the mutual shelter which is thus provided on the exposed sites where this species is normally used, and also to provide a wider field of selection of final crop stems in a species which is prone to crooked growth.  In the case of Abies Nobilis growth in the early years is very slow and the closer spacing hastens closing of canopy. Mutual shelter is also important in this species as it is largely used on exposed sites.</P>
      <P>Of the plantings for which 6' spacing is used Sitka Spruce accounts for some 85 per cent. of the total.  It has been possible in recent years to prepare the planting site more intensively for this species by ploughing and to hasten initial growth on poorer sites by the application of phosphates.  Close canopy stage can now be reached in the same time at 6' spacing as was possible in the past with less intensive site preparation at 5' spacing.</P>
      <P>In the case of Japanese Larch planted on suitable soils, early growth is rapid and competing weed growth is soon controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> General Irish experience of Douglas Fir has been that it responds well to wide planting on suitable sites and satisfactory quality can be obtained from plantations established at 6' x 6'. The same applies to Silver Fir and Abies Grandis.</P>
    <P>The planting of Ash at wider spacing is being carried out with a view to promoting rapid girth growth for the purpose of producing timber of sports quality on a short rotation.</P>
    <P>The remaining species planted at 6' x 6' spacings are used only to a limited extent and largely as edgings and screens where special considerations apply.</P>
    <P>It should be emphasised that the total production in cubic feet per acre over the rotation is not affected by the adoption of 5' or 6' spacings.</P>
    <P>One of the chief arguments in favour of close spacing is the early closing of the canopy and elimination of weed growth but these beneficial effects are now obtained by the more intensive site preparation generally adopted, especially with the principal species-Sitka Spruce.</P>
    <P>Closer spacing is also conducive to the production of cleaner timber but this is not affected in any significant way by a difference of one foot in the planting spacing.  On the other hand the wider spacing allows of the first thinnings being deferred by about two years, thus giving produce of a larger size which is more economical to handle.  Very small first thinnings are more difficult to dispose of since some of them are under minimum pulp wood size and they cost more to handle per cubic foot.  Thinning must be carried out whether the material is saleable or not.  With the wider spacing the produce will be of larger dimension both in girth and length and thus will afford a better monetary return.</P>
    <P>A wider selection for the final crop is obtained by closer spacing but sufficient stems of reasonable form can be obtained from the 6' by 6' planting in the case of the species concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department's technical experts are still in the process of working out the best silvicultural treatment for <Col N="1865" /> these exotic species of which we have very limited experience of pure crops over a full rotation but the use of 6' planting for these species under suitable conditions cannot be described as experimental.</P>
    <P>Wider spacing enables a saving to be made in the cost of establishing plantations under the heads of plants and planting, estimated in the current year at £25,000.</P>

      <P>The section sets out to improve the rules governing the <Col N="1875" /> determination of wear and tear allowance for plant used in the case of mines and smelters associated with mines.  It seems to me that the improvement proposed here is required in the case of all concerns which are working wasting assets.  I cannot see that there is any justification for a distinction in that regard between a mine and a quarry.  The basic considerations which apply in both cases are precisely the same.  The rules should, it seems to me, conform to sound commercial practice and, any company operating a quarry would, in accordance with sound commercial practice, endeavour to write off the cost of the plant in a reasonable time, having regard to the period in which the quarry will be worked out and with allowance for the scrap value of the plant at that time. The amendment of the rules in relation to plant used in a mine is justifiable and desirable, but I cannot see that there is any justification for not applying a similar amendment to a quarry or any concern working wasting assets.  It is to enable the cost of plant to be written off during the lifetime of the asset.  In that regard, I cannot see a difference between a mine and a quarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difference between plant normally used in a mine and plant normally used in a quarry.  Plant used in a mine is far less capable of being shifted from one place to another after a particular mine had been worked out.  In the nature of events, machinery in a quarry is moved on all the time.  That, I think, is an undoubted fact, but I do not think it matters much in this respect because it is made clear in the provisons that the transfer value, if I might term it such, could be taken into account in the assessment.  Having regard to that, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3) (a), line 48, to delete the definition of &ldquo;standard output of coal&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;standard output of coal&rsquo; means the average output of coal from the existing coal mining operation in each of the three periods of 12 months ending on the 30th day of September, 1954, 1955 and 1956.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill purports to give certain tax reliefs to coal mining concerns which increase their output.  There is remission of 50 per cent. of the tax payable on the profits in the case of new concerns and a similar remission of tax upon additional profits earned by an existing company which increases its output.  In order to determine whether a coal mining concern has increased its output a standard year is taken, the year ended on the 30th September, 1956.  If, in the period during which this Bill is operative, a company produces more coal than it produced in that period of 12 months, then it will earn the relief, and if it does not, it will not.  The profits made by the company do not matter.  It may have made a loss in the 12 months ended in September and it may make profits on a smaller output in subsequent years. The entitlement to relief, however, turns entirely upon the question of the volume of coal produced in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every coal mining concern there is always a possibility of temporary factors causing a rise or a fall in the output of coal in a certain year.  The volume of production can increase if work is proceeding in a particularly favourable section of the seem and if a minimum of development expenditure is required.  In every coal mine the coal face has to be opened up to enable coal to be produced and, as sections of the face are worked out, new development work has to be undertaken to open up a new face.  The production of the mine depends entirely in any year upon the accident whether that development work was completed before the beginning of the year so that production could continue uninterruptedly during the year, or whether <Col N="1878" /> the company in that year had to do a great deal of development work opening up new production areas and getting itself organised to expand its output.  There are, of course, always the possibilities of curtailed output due to strikes, breakdown in plant and factors of that kind.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it seems to me to be undesirable to pick a particular year as the standard year in determining the entitlement of existing coal mining concerns to these tax concessions. My suggestion in the amendment is that the standard output should be the average annual output of the past three years.  In the case of coal mining that is the better basis. However, if the Minister preferred to adopt the proposal I am putting forward in relation to export industries, that the concern should be entitled to choose one of a number of years as its basic year, I would not object.  In the case of coal mining it is a comparatively easy matter to determine the actual quantity of coal produced, and the average output over a period of years is a fair indication of what the mine is capable of producing.  If the period is long enough&mdash;and I think three years would be long enough&mdash;it would tend to eliminate all those purely accidental factors to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not be apprehensive of adopting this suggestion on the grounds of what it will cost.  I do not think the proposals in this Bill will cost very much.  I have already expressed here the view that the factors limiting coal production are not likely to be affected at all by this Bill.  The present position is such that every coal mining concern is trying to produce coal in the maximum volume.  The price has gone up; the demand is strong, and there are far more substantial inducements operating at present to expand production than this Bill affords.  The mere enactment of this Bill will not increase coal production at all.  The limiting factor at present is inability to get a sufficient number of competent workers on the coal face. If any new concern is induced to get into coal mining by reason of this Bill it will only be able to increase production by drawing workers from existing <Col N="1879" /> concerns and reducing the output of the existing concerns.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that the Bill does operate to increase the output of coal or that the combination of the Bill and of the other factors I have mentioned, the higher prices prevailing and the very strong demand for coal, secures a position in which coal mine proprietors will be able to overcome those practical difficulties of expanding output and get an increase in production of, say, 10 per cent., and see what that involves.  The total quantity of coal produced from Irish coal mines during the 12 months specified in the Bill would be about 150,000 tons.  No official figures are available but having regard to past experience and relating that to knowledge of the situation during the past year, 150,000 tons are in or about what the output probably was. A 10 per cent. increase in production would, therefore, be 15,000 tons.  It is fair to assume that a coal mine would be doing quite well if it earned taxable profits at the rate of 10/- per ton produced. There are coal mines that are not making 10/- per ton and some of them are doing better than that, but taking the average of all coal mines, it would probably be regarded as optimistic to assume that they would make taxable profits at the rate of 10/- per ton.  The total additional profits earned at the rate of 10/- per ton would be £7,500.  The tax on that might amount to £3,000 and a 50 per cent. remission of the tax would cost the Exchequer £1,500.</P>
    <P>With present inducements of rising prices and active demand, there is a stimulus to output far stronger operating now than the possibility of gaining £1,500 in tax remission.  In view, however, of the very small cost of this proposal to the Exchequer, I think the Minister can afford to be fairly reasonable in the determination of the basis year in relation to which the increase in output would be measured.  I do not know whether I would be in order in extending my arguments, but I think there would be a much better chance of expansion in coal production and a greater investment of capital in Irish coalpits, if <Col N="1880" /> there was a change in the tax laws which would provide for the introduction of a reasonable, even a generous, depletion allowance so that those who put their money into coal mines would have a reasonable possibility of getting that money back.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Reading, the greater part of the capital outlay required to permit of coal production takes place before a ton of coal comes out of the ground.  All that outlay has to be recovered in appropriations from profits during the lifetime of the deposit.  Our laws do not provide for any deductions from profits against that expenditure before tax is assessed by which the capital investment can be recovered, except out of taxed profits during the lifetime of the mines. I urge that there should be on the part of the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the laws&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;a more realistic interpretation of what constitutes capital expenditure on a coal mine.  Expenditure which does not anticipate increasing the value of the output is not an investment and it is not capital expenditure to be regarded as such, but a necessary working cost.  In the instance I gave, the information came to me from the managing director of the mines concerned.  The expenditure, which had necessarily to be incurred upon the extension of the conveyor system, because over the years the coal face had gone further and further away from the shaft, was classified as capital investment, although it did not increase the output of the mine by a single ton and, indeed, involved an increase in the operating costs.</P>
    <P>If the new equipment, the new plant installed, tended to increase production, then it would be properly classified as a new investment, but, as every coal mine manager knows, it is an unavoidable working cost and should be so regarded.  If there was introduced into the law a depletion allowance, coupled with this improvement which has been introduced in the rules regarding depreciation, plus a more liberal interpretation of working costs, then the inducement to production would be far greater than the tax allowance proposed here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> I am not saying that the tax allowance will not be welcomed.  I think the Minister would be well advised to have a consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that regard, because I know he has had an opportunity recently of meeting the representatives of the various Irish coal mines who have put their difficulties to him, difficulties which are in some instances completely removed from any operation of the tax laws, but, if the whole position were examined thoroughly, it would be possible to help these companies to expand output.  They are all willing to do it and there is certainly every reason at the present time that they should, but they are up against real difficulties. They regard it as sarcastic to offer them a tax concession if they increase output when they are trying to do so and find themselves up against real practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is a bad principle to pick one year in relation to this industry as a basis year.  An average of a number of years should be adopted or, alternatively, the company should be allowed to pick itself one of three or five years which would be the basis year for that individual company.</P>

      <P>I must confess, as I said at the conclusion of the Second Reading, that I was a little amused at Deputy Lemass suggesting at this stage that what I should do is to introduce an amendment to the 1946 Finance Act provisions in relation to depreciation and average over a period, which he was not able to get through at that time because the 1946 <Col N="1882" /> Finance Act deliberately excluded acquisition, as the Deputy is probably well aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I was going to go on that.  I do not think it is desirable that either Deputy Lemass or I should discuss what might be identified as individual concerns across the floor of the House, any more than it is desirable that I should comment on the Deputy's description of himself in regard to that coal mine on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this part of the Bill is to endeavour to get an increased output of coal.  It is quite inevitable that that must be the overriding viewpoint to be considered rather than the individual concern of any particular company.  I can see from Deputy Lemass's point of view that perhaps a company from its own point of view might find it more satisfactory to work on an average of three years rather than the basic period which I have determined.  It might be a matter which one could only decide in relation to each individual company, seeing the figures of each individual company.</P>
      <P>Let me take the example in Deputy Lemass's amendment, the case of the company that produced 40,000 tons in 1954, 30,000 tons in 1955 and because they ran into a bad period only 11,000 tons in 1956.  The average would be 27,000 tons.  If it came back a bit, it would lose on Deputy Lemass's amendment by everything between that average and the 11,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back to the type of mine which I think will be assisted by this legislation.  The other type that is gradually going forward all the time has got its impetus. That impetus will carry it forward and it will also get a benefit under this Bill.  Its impetus is carrying it forward and each year it has a rising output. The other type of mine that has met with difficulty will, I think, have a <Col N="1883" /> chance of being brought back to its earlier output.</P>
      <P>I do not know anything about the figures in the individual case the Deputy mentioned.  If they were making profits in 1946 of the sort the Deputy suggested, presumably their output must have been better then and under this Bill they will get a chance of coming back again with benefit to themselves.  The essential thing we all want at the present time in the interests of the national economy is greater output.  Greater output really means greater output and it is from the point of view of endeavouring to achieve greater output, rather than from the point of view of considering the affairs of individual companies, that this Bill and this part of the Bill is brought before the House. I do not think it unfair to say that Deputy Lemass is considering this, not from the point of view of greater output and the benefits it would bring to the economy as a whole, but from the point of view of individual concerns. That is not the purpose of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say I recognise that taking a three-year average instead of the single year's figure would operate to the benefit of some companies and the disadvantage of others.  I do not know how individual companies would be affected.  In relation to one company I know about, the provisions of the Bill would probably be the better.  I think the Minister's argument is based on an understandable lack of knowledge of the problems that arise in the Irish coal mine&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The periods of maximum and minimum production alternate fairly regularly.  In the manager's report that will come up before the board of directors there will be an indication that a new face 100 yards or 200 yards long has been opened up; that production is in full swing at that face and is likely to continue for 12 or 18 months or perhaps 24 months. But at that stage no planning by the <Col N="1884" /> management or no increase in managerial efficiency will avoid a curtailment of production.</P>
      <P>At that stage the new development work has to be undertaken anyway. Periods of maximum and minimum production are an inevitable feature of the working of Irish coal mines.  Apart altogether from new companies, it is unfair to pick a particular year as the base year.  It would be far wiser to take an average over a number of years.  I do not want to press the point because I might find myself in argument with the representatives of some coal mines adversely affected by the change.  From the point of view of enacting good legislation here, however, the Minister would be well advised to take an average period rather than a particular year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 30, to delete &ldquo;1961&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1966&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This part of the Bill deals with relief from income-tax on profits earned on increased export business.  The Bill proposes that that relief shall operate only for a period of five years.  I think it is perfectly futile to expect that any inducement will be provided to engage in a substantial way in new export business on the basis of a small tax relief extending only over a five-year period.  Again it is necessary to bear in mind that the actual cash benefits secured by industry are fairly meagre and the Minister need not be worried about the possible extension of the provisions of the Bill costing the Exchequer very much money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to my calculations, the total value of all the categories of goods that might be regarded as manufactured goods within the meaning of the definition of the Bill&mdash;including <Col N="1885" /> beer and spirits and commodities of that kind, the export of which is not likely to be affected very much by the Bill&mdash;would be about £25,000,000.  It would be a considerable achievement to get a 10 per cent. increase in the export of these goods in any period of time and that would mean that the value of the exports of these industries would increase by £2,500,000.</P>
    <P>Again let me say that the company that made net taxable profits equivalent to 2 per cent. of the f.o.b. value of its exports would be doing very well.  In the majority of cases the taxable profits earned would be a smaller percentage of sales value than that.  Assuming that the profits earned on exports average 2 per cent. of the f.o.b. value of the goods shipped, then the total additional profits of all these manufacturing companies in the country would be about £50,000.  The tax on that would be £20,000 and the 50 per cent. remission of tax would cost the Exchequer £10,000.</P>
    <P>That is the measure of the inducement which has been given to Irish industry under this Bill to expand its exports.  Even that inducement is considerably reduced by the Minister's proposal that this remission will apply only for a period of five years.  It seems to me that the inducement is very slight and the effect is not likely to be even as considerable as I suggested. Any chance it has of leading directly to an expansion of production is greatly minimised by the curtailment of the period.  In my first amendment the proposal is that the firms concerned, who may engage in new export business or endeavour to expand existing export business, should at least be given the assurance that this system of taxation will apply for ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the end of discussion on Finance Bills.  The Deputy and I will both agree in that respect.  I think that for the purpose of an appraisal of the benefits that will accrue if industrialists go out and look for export markets, my period of five years rather than the Deputy's, would be quite sufficient; and I think it would be quite sufficient at this stage to deal with this on that basis of time. <Col N="1886" /> The Deputy will remember himself when he was speaking on the Second Stage that he was worried from another angle&mdash;an angle which I agree he covered in the amendments&mdash;as to what people might say three, four or five years hence.  They might forget the circumstances in which it had been deemed necessary to bring in proposals of this kind.  Without in any way committing myself as to what I would feel coming up to the end of the period, one way or the other, I think at this stage it would be desirable to keep it on that basis.</P>
      <P>There is another point of view also which should be brought into it.  In relation to exports, because of the variety, as apart from the question of coal, which is a homogeneous or virtually homogeneous commodity, for the purposes of this Bill at any rate, we must work on the basis of value. Values change a great deal.  It is desirable, therefore, that we should have our provisions tied as far as possible to the most recent value available. The standard year we have fixed here is one that may perhaps, I admit, be out of date in five years' time.  Whatever may be the position about that, it will certainly be out of date in ten years' time and if one were considering it on a ten-year basis, one would have to consider it on an entirely different basis from that which is included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has begun to understand the mind of the average industrial manager. The main deterrent, as I understand it, to the development of export trade in manufactured goods is the disposition of our industrial managements to think of exports as merely a depository for surplus produce.  A firm organises its output mainly in relation to its anticipated sales in the home market and only if it finds that, for some reason, it can push output ahead of its target figure, or that sales on the home market are less than they anticipated, does it look around for possibilities of selling some of that production abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we need to get in this country is a complete change round of that outlook of managements.  We have to <Col N="1887" /> get as many of them as possible thinking of exports as the normal outlet for their goods, even if it should mean that, in circumstances, they will forgo the opportunity of home market sales in order to expand exports, to open up new contacts, to build up the possibility of permanent trade with some customer abroad.  I do not think there is any likelihood of producing that change of outlook on the part of our industrial leaders, unless the indocements given to them are considerable and there is a reasonable expectation of their permanence.</P>
    <P>It is true that trading conditions change and that trade that may be possible to-day may not be possible at all in five or ten years' time, but the whole purpose of our tax laws should clearly be to develop that spirit of enterprise in relation to exports which, with the exception of a few firms, does not generally exist at the present time.  That is why I think the proposals in the Bill are completely inadequate, on the one hand, and that they are being made less effective than they might otherwise be by the various limitations and restrictions which the Minister has thought fit to impose.</P>
    <P>I do not think the argument about the unsuitability of the basis year for determining the increased exports really applies.  In the first place, it clearly does not apply at all to firms that go into export business for the first time.  So far as they are concerned, there is no question of a basis year at all; they get the 50 per cent. remission on all their profits, provided they do not pay any dividends to their shareholders.</P>

      <P>In the case of existing companies, I agree fully, that the <Col N="1888" /> adoption of a single year as the basis year is likely to lead to anomalies and inequities, and that is why I propose that that should be changed and my suggestion in this case, which I think is justified in all the circumstances, is that the company should be allowed to pick for itself any year in the past five years as its basis year.  That certainly would not operate to penalise those companies who have responded to the many appeals already made to them to take a chance and get into export business.  However, I will stick to the one amendment now.</P>

      <P>The first one.  The Minister says that this is not the last Finance Bill.  That is perfectly true. He said that as implying that this concession can be continued in five years' time.  That prospect is not likely to induce anybody to invest a penny in industrial expansion, but that argument cuts the other way.  I fully accept the right of the Government to change the tax laws and to withdraw tax concessions if changing circumstances justify that.  If this drive to increase export business in manufactured goods should go ahead to such an extent that the maintenance of this concession involved a serious loss of revenue to the Exchequer, then the Exchequer would be quite entitled to reconsider that position, but the total loss that is anticipated here is something about £10,000 a year, and, while the Government may be in dire financial straits, it is not in such a situation that £10,000 more or less will make the slightest difference to it and, if we got a 10 per cent.  increase in export trade by the expenditure of £10,000, it would be the best value that this country ever got for £10,000.  That is why I think the Minister can quite reasonably commit the Government and all future Governments to continuing this concession for at least ten years.</P>

      <P>There is no question of the consideration of limiting the period to one of five years being the consideration of the amount involved, <Col N="1889" /> as has been suggested by Deputy Lemass.  I am not going to be drawn by him with his red herring about financial straits.  It does seem to me that it would be quite outrageous for anybody to suggest, or for it to get any currency as a suggestion, that there was any possibility of any Government &mdash;this or any succeeding Government&mdash; withdrawing a concession of a type like this that had been given for the purpose of getting people to go into any particular trade.</P>

On the basis of the experience of the past 35 years of this State, where people have been deliberately induced to go into a particular type of thing as a result of specific legislative action, any commitment so made has always been honoured by succeeding Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of general taxation is one that is entirely different.  The question of general taxation is not involved in this amendment or in this Bill.  The Deputy is quite well aware of that and I suspect that he just threw out that last little suggestion of his for <Col N="1890" /> the purpose of a rather dirty innuendo and causing trouble.</P>

This concession is introduced for a period of five years and I am quite certain that it will be left there for five years, no matter what Government there is and people have that certainty of knowing it but, under the Deputy's suggestion, there would not be that certainty.  I think a period of five years is better than a period of ten years because it may be quite easily found that the experience of the next five years is such as to warrant some change.</P>

    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the definition of &ldquo;goods&rdquo;, lines 36 and 37, to delete &ldquo;by the person who exports them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposal in the Bill is that this relief from income-tax should be given to a company that increases its export of goods, goods being defined as &ldquo;goods manufactured within the State by the person who exports them.&rdquo;  I am moving to delete &ldquo;by the person who exports them.&rdquo;  I am at a complete loss to understand why that limitation should be imposed, why only a firm which itself exports the goods it manufactures should be entitled to this relief.  I mentioned the point during the course of the Second Reading debate.  I expressed the view that it was desirable to encourage the development of merchanting houses which would seek to handle for export the products of a number of Irish concerns. I pointed out that the operation of this definition would be to discourage, if not absolutely prevent, any such development.</P>
      <P>One of the main difficulties in securing export trade for Irish products is the relatively small size of the individual manufacturing units.  Córas Tráchtála, the Department of Industry and Commerce and other organisations which have from time to time examined the possibility of increasing exports have all turned their minds to the possibility of grouping the exports of all firms in a single industry through one wholesaling organisation, which would represent all the producers concerned in foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> One disquieting development in recent times in connection with Irish exports has been the tendency of Irish firms to market their goods abroad through British merchanting houses. That was the old practice in the woollen trade where the products of Irish woollen mills were sent around the world in the sample books of English merchants, without its even being indicated on them that they were of Irish manufacture.  The inclusion of these samples in the books of the English merchants may have increased the trade of the English merchants, but it brought no goodwill to Irish industry and no hope of retaining the trade secured on the strength of the samples, if the intervention of the British merchanting houses was, for any reason, unavailable.</P>
    <P>The effect of this limitation in the section is to give the premium to the firm that markets its goods abroad through the British merchants as against the firm that sells through an Irish merchant.  If it exports its goods to the warehouses of the British merchant, it qualifies for tax relief.  If it sells through a merchant here, a merchant who ultimately exports these goods, then it does not qualify.  The whole effect of the section is to force development of Irish export trade into the wrong channels.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which I want to bring to the attention of the Minister.  I happen to know of the plans of a particular firm.  These plans involve export business.  The firm in question has a subsidiary sales company. The central company does the manufacturing, but the sales are conducted through a subsidiary company which is the selling organisation.  For income-tax purposes, the accounts of the two companies are combined.  If I understand the possible effect of this provision correctly, that company will not be able to qualify for tax relief, unless it changes its selling methods. The company which it is contemplated will sell the products abroad is a different entity in the legal sense from the company that manufactures.  I do not know whether an administrative decision can be made by which the <Col N="1894" /> subsidiary company can be classified as the same person for the purposes of this concession.</P>
    <P>If that is the intention, then I think it should be made clear in the section, but, on the whole, it seems to me that the limitation is both unnecessary and undesirable; that it tends to limit the inducement to firms to enter the export trade, and, in the case of those who do, to encourage them into the wrong type of development.  Quite a number of our firms who have been doing an export trade in recent times have established warehouses and selling organisations in England.  There is undoubtedly a clear advantage to them in so doing, because London is one of the great merchandising centres of the world, but it seems to me that there is no reason of public policy why they should be benefited by so doing as against the firm that tries the more difficult task of merchandising its goods through Irish wholesale firms.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to see the establishment in this country of enterprising wholesaling merchants who would seek orders abroad for the products of Irish factories, get these products made to suitable design by Irish manufacturers, and who would deal with the manufacturers and suppliers of commodities and themselves be responsible for the successful sale of the products in export markets.  On many occasions in the past, I have tried to consider the measures that might be adopted by the Government to encourage a development of that kind.  This measure, however, is going in the opposite direction and that is why I urge strongly that it is undesirable and that the words should be deleted from the paragraph and the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to press the Minister to reconsider this also. Apart from the cases mentioned by Deputy Lemass, there are other examples of cases in which it is virtually impossible for a manufacturing firm to do direct exports itself.  In the case of firms using certain types of international trade mark, or, shall we say, foreign trade marks, frequently the company which has control of the <Col N="1895" /> trade mark will not allow the firm that makes the goods to export them under that trade mark.  The reasons are of a technical character which relate to trade mark laws, and the firm insists on establishing a separate marketing company to administer the marketing of those goods in this country, and any goods manufactured for export have, first of all, to be purchased and resold by the company which has the right of exploiting the market in this country.</P>
      <P>That applies not only to trade marks, but in many cases to machine processes and to various technical devices.  It is all linked with international recognition of patents, trade marks and licences, and the Minister must be aware that, if we are to get increased industrial exports of the magnitude required to solve this country's problems, any legislation that is passed must be highly flexible in order to admit of our particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>I would also like to reiterate what Deputy Lemass said about encouraging the merchant converter of textiles. There is a great number of small hosiery and woollen concerns here for whom the cost of sending an expert abroad seeking attractive designs and indulging in all that promotional expenditure is utterly impossible.  If, for example, we are to have the maximum expansion of textile exports there should be a place for the merchant converter, the merchant who specialises in designing cloth for export to various countries or even to a group of countries and who has the capital and the facilities to send his people abroad so that they can come back and give orders to a number of different manufacturers to supply that cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that is the only way by which we can export textiles: they can be exported individually by firms at the same time, but it is quite obvious that if large-scale manufacturers in Great Britain, with her enormous tradition of textile exports, find it impossible to export individually and work through converters, if we are to get a genuine expansion of exports, we must make use of all those <Col N="1896" /> devices and give encouragements which are far beyond the ambit of this Bill to our firms so that they can do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Lemass and Deputy Childers have said in relation to this amendment.  I know personally that there are manufacturing concerns that have established separate subsidiary companies for the special purposes of their export trade.  These, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, are, for the purposes of the income-tax code, separate persons and therefore subject to separate assessment, but these companies have built up separate organisations to handle their exports and to explore the possibilities of new and hitherto untried markets.  With the definition as it stands, I fear all these companies would secure no benefit at all from Part III of the Bill. I think, perhaps, the definition has been drawn without adverting to these facts and I am sure that the Minister, when the matter has been brought to his notice, will see that so far from encouraging industrial exportation the definition, as it stands, will in some instances, not discourage them, but certainly not give that relief which he is seeking to give to those who engage in the export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, of course, as the three Deputies opposite have said, many cases in which manufacturing concerns here have set up subsidiary companies for the purpose of carrying out sales in the export and even in the home markets.  Those subsidiary companies are acting as agents for the principal or primary manufacturing company, and, so long as that is the situation, I think it is virtually certain&mdash;certainly it is the case in regard to all the subsidiary companies I know in that respect&mdash;if it is the position that they are merely acting as agents who have built up a specialised type of service to which Deputy MacEntee referred, then they will be able to qualify for the relief under this Part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want it to be quite clear in that respect that, in so far as they are subsidiary companies acting as a sales organisation of that sort for their <Col N="1897" /> parent company, I intend, where they deal with the goods as agents for the parent company for the export market, that they shall be covered and if there is any difficulty in the drafting, and if any alteration is necessary to make sure that that is clear, I shall have the matter examined between now and Report Stage.  I most certainly intend to cover subsidiary sales companies of that sort.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass's amendment, however, goes on a wider front than that. We must remember, particularly when dealing with our industrial arm, that a great deal of it is not based, shall I say, on home-grown materials.  It would seem to me that if I adopted the suggestion contained in the amendment of Deputy Lemass, I would be putting a premium on the least possible manufacture and processing of goods that might be imported here and re-exported.  I do not think that is desirable and I honestly do not think Deputy Lemass intended that effect.</P>
    <P>There may be a certain amount to be said in favour of the line taken by Deputies opposite that we should have wholesale purchasing here and that that should be dealt with by re-export sales.  I do not think, in fact, however, that exists here at all at present and I certainly do not think the special provisions of this Bill are the appropriate medium at this stage for introducing that system.</P>
    <P>I will not argue for or against the system.  As things are, however, that does not arise.  What does arise is that there are certain firms here who act as commercial agents for Irish manufacturing concerns who are concerned with placing their goods abroad.  That position is dealt with on a commission basis.  Offhand, I can think of two such cases where the goods remain the property of the manufacturing company and are placed abroad by persons who are paid on commission for that work. The concessions given to manufacturing companies under this Bill will enable the manufacturing company, if it so desires, to arrange the terms of the commission it will pay and will enable that type of commercial agent to build up contacts on the export <Col N="1898" /> market, if that is the way the company concerned wants it.</P>
    <P>If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment, it would mean that the manufacturing company might not get any benefit under the provisions of the Bill.  I think it is desirable that the manufacturer of goods should be the primary person to get relief so that he would gear his market in that way. I accept the view put forward by Deputy Lemass that in the past there has been far too much of an acceptance of the soft home market under tariff protection and not enough expansion into outside export markets.  I do not think this amendment would serve to reverse that trend.  Rather to the contrary, because the benefits would not necessarily go to the manufacturer at all.  Be that as it may, I want it to be quite clear that I feel that subsidiary companies, acting as agents for their parent company, should be covered.  I believe they are, and, if they are not, I shall certainly take steps to correct the matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has produced some curious arguments, if I may so describe them, to counter the case put forward for the deletion of the words.  I do not know if it is correct to say that a subsidiary company would be regarded as the agent of the manufacturer.  That would apply only in the case where the subsidiary company was handling the produce of one manufacturer only.  I do not feel I should deal with any existing organisation in this matter, so I think I should go back a few years when there was quite an export trade in sweetened fat and minced meat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will suit my point all the same.  It will help me to emphasise the matter I have in mind.  A very large number of firms engaged in the production of these commodities but exported none of them.  It was other merchant concerns and single individuals who gave the manufacturers the orders, bought the <Col N="1899" /> goods from them and exported them. Such manufacturers could not qualify under the terms of this Bill for tax reliefs.  A similar situation may exist in quite legitimate trades to-day.  I think I am correct in saying that Córas Tráchtála, in the course of exploiting the American markets, induced manufacturers of similar lines of goods to combine and set up a central organisation to handle the sale in America of the produce of more than one Irish manufacturer.  As I understand it, that organisation, set up in the interests of the manufacturers by Córas Tráchtála, might now operate to prevent these manufacturers from getting reliefs under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I said that Córas Tráchtála advised manufacturers of similar lines of goods to combine in the establishment of an organisation here to sell in America certain produce in greater quantities than any one manufacturer could produce on his own. Whether that organisation is functioning now, I do not know, but I do know an effort was made by Córas Tráchtála to have such an organisation established. If there is any trading of that kind being done, the definition now in the Bill would prevent the manufacturers from getting the tax reliefs proposed. The Minister talked about the desirability of preventing goods being imported for the purpose of re-export qualifying for these reliefs.  In my calculation, the total amount of money involved is about £10,000.</P>

      <P>If I were drafting this Bill, I would provide a definition of the term &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;.  I am quite certain that administrative difficulties will arise in the application of this Bill, unless there is a better definition.  However, that has nothing to do with the question of whether the goods must be exported by the manufacturer or through some marketing organisation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made no case whatever for the retention of the words.  If the Minister can show the House that there is some issue of policy, some safeguard, which makes it desirable that goods should be exported by manufacturers, then we can argue with him.  I think the Minister will admit there is no issue of policy, no safeguard, involved.  Then why retain the words?  Their retention will restrict the benefits of these provisions to certain firms, or, alternatively, require firms not to use independent selling organisations or operate through wholesale firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said in regard to the export subsidiary which acts as an agent for the parent company is satisfactory in so far as it goes.  However, what would be the position of the export company which was acting not merely for the parent company, but also for sister subsidiary companies which are manufacturing goods different in kind from those made by the parent company? There, you see, there will be this relationship.  There will be the export subsidiary of the parent company and this export subsidiary is a sister subsidiary of another subsidiary producing company.  How will they stand in relation to this matter?  That is very important because, in most cases, the subsidiary manufacturing company is, in fact, a large customer&mdash;not always the principal customer, but a large customer&mdash;of the parent concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the export subsidiary as the agent for the parent concern.  Would he consider the position of an export subsidiary&mdash;I must keep on qualifying the various subsidiaries, in order to make myself quite clear&mdash;which buys from the parent company, most often on a nominal <Col N="1901" /> margin just above the all&mdash;in cost of production, and then sells to the customer abroad at the best price it can get?  The profits of that export subsidiary are not derived from commission in the way in which an agent will derive his income or revenue but from its ability to sell goods at more than was paid for them.  That, I think, is of particular importance.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter arises. Very often there are companies which are not related in the sense that one company has been formed by a parent company or that the parent company owns a controlling interest in the second company but which are associated by interlocking directorates, by the fact that the directors of one company may be shareholders and directors in another company.  Where these companies decide that, for their own purposes, they will avail for the purposes of export trade of the organisation which has been brought into being for that particular purpose, that is of the export subsidiary which has been formed by one of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I will put it in more or less chronological order. One company as been established: we will call it the parent company, the first company.  It finds that, in order to charge certain members of its organisation with the special duty of trying to develop an export trade, the most convenient way of doing that is to set up a separate company and call it an export company.  Then the parent company decides it will enlarge the scope of its operations.  It begins, perhaps, by taking a minority interest in another concern or establishing another industry in co-operation with some people from abroad.  As time goes on, the parent company, the first company, becomes the sole holder of the shares in the second manufacturing company.  Then it decides that the <Col N="1902" /> second manufacturing company will utilise, for the purposes of its export trade, the services of the first export subsidiary.  This is a commonplace of recent industrial development in this country.  Then the matter goes a stage further.  Some of the people, interested in the first and second companies, establish other industries.  In the course of time, the directorates, which are more or less common&mdash;there are shareholdings which are not common but where there are directors of the associated concerns, that is concerns some of whose directors may have shareholdings in some other of the companies&mdash;say to the parent of the export company: &ldquo;We are anxious to develop an export trade.  Can we have the services of your original export subsidiary company?&rdquo;  Then the question is what will happen the profits?</P>
      <P>This export subsidiary will not be so closely associated with some of the manufacturing concerns as it was to its parent.  It was quite clear originally that it was, in fact, a part of the parent's organisation.  It is now, however, in this position in relation to the associated concerns.  It may happen that there are members of the boards of the other companies and these members being familiar with the organisation which has been established for export purposes, knowing that the staff of that organisation is efficient and that it has a wide knowledge of export markets, will ask: &ldquo;Can we use your subsidiary for the purpose of our export trade?&rdquo;  The export subsidiary will naturally endeavour to develop an export market for these other concerns which are coming along and anxious to avail of its services.  What will be the position in relation to the profits which that export subsidiary will make?  I think, in all cases, at least, in all cases which I can visualise, it will buy from the manufacturing concerns at prices which would naturally leave the manufacturers very little profit, it is true, but the manufacturing concern will seek by selling abroad at the best prices it can get from the export concern to reduce the unit burden of the overheads upon the goods offered for sale in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is this: Will an export subsidiary with these <Col N="1903" /> associations&mdash;the direct affiliation with the parent company, the direct affiliation with the sister subsidiary, then with arrangements with other concerns in which there is no interlocking of shareholdings or indeed complete identity of directorates but where there nevertheless is a very definite association with each other, an association of common interest in a number of concerns which, so to speak, circle around or form around the export subsidiary and try to avail of its services &mdash;will an export subsidiary with these arrangements be entitled to relief?</P>

      <P>In the first part of his speech, Deputy Lemass said that if he were dealing with the definition of &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; in this Bill he would do so by way of providing that goods were only manufactured goods after a certain percentage of their value had been processed here.  I shudder to think of the administrative army any such definition would build up.  I would have to get very much larger premises for the Revenue Commissioners if I were to operate on a definition like that.  It would virtually mean that you would have to have an examination of every single export invoice. That examination would mean getting the breakdown of the particular goods in question and, perhaps, with that breakdown, analysing it right down the line.  That definition suggested by the Deputy would be utterly and absolutely unworkable.</P>

Perhaps if Deputy Corry were here, he might even raise it seriously.  I do not visualise any difficulty at all in relation to the definition of manufacturer, and I am quite clear on this, that the widest scope given to the definition of manufacturer here in this Bill will be to the benefit of the firms concerned and any limitation such as Deputy Lemass has suggested would be against the interests of the firms concerned.</P>
      <P>So far as the trilogy of companies raised by Deputy MacEntee are concerned, I think it is a question which I must consider, and, though I rather pride myself that I am able to understand arguments thrown at me across the House, I am afraid that in relation to this series of companies, I will have to wait until I read the Deputy's speech in the Official Report and then call the companies A, B and so on, and see where I am.  It seems to me that in relation to the company that was not either a brother or a parent company, but only an &ldquo;in-law&rdquo; in association, the line, in practice, would be more likely that they would work on commission rather than on direct sales.  I am quite prepared to consider the point raised by Deputy MacEntee.  We will number the companies and trace them to the ultimate conclusion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In lines 48 and 49, to delete &ldquo;the period of one year ending on the 30th day of September, 1956&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;&ldquo;any one period of 12 months, as the company may select, ending on the 30th day of September in any year between 1951 and 1956, inclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a question of the base year. The Minister's proposal is that a company which, in any year of the next five years, exports more goods than it exported in the base year, will get the relief which the Bill contemplates.  If a firm exports only the same amount, or a lesser quantity, it gets no relief. I think that is very unfair to companies which have already pioneered in export markets.  This is not the first time that the Government of the country has urged manufacturers to increase export trade.  We set up Córas <Col N="1907" /> Tráchtála, Teoranta, a State organisation, with substantial funds to develop exports and gave it powers to help them in various ways.  Some manufacturers responded to these urgings; others did not.  The Minister's proposal means that the manufacturers who responded already can get no advantage or only a very slight advantage under this Bill, whereas those who delayed until this tax concession was held out to them can get full advantage.  It seems to me to be a device for penalising those who are most enterprising and most responsive to appeals to them in the national interest to do what they can to increase their exports.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that instead of taking the past 12 months as the basic year and calculating the increase in export business, and so forth, in relation to that basis, we go back over five years and say to any company that qualifies for relief under this Bill that it may base its claim on any one of those years chosen by it.  It would also mean that those who got into the export business in that period and countered the initial difficulties involved will not be penalised because they moved too soon.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the cost of that modification cannot be very much.  The maximum inducement which can be secured and which can be held out to industries under this Bill will cost a very trifling sum of money.  If my calculation is correct, the enactment of the Bill will not cost the Exchequer £10,000 a year.  The Minister, therefore, need not be afraid that this suggestion will cost any serious sum of money.  It will provide that those who have been most active in this field will not find themselves at a disadvantage as compared with newcomers in it.  They can be at a disadvantage. Two firms making the same class of goods, seeking sale for those goods in the same market, may be contacting the same customers. One will be getting a substantial tax remission; the other will not, and the newcomer will be able to offer terms which will take the customers away from the firm that was supplying before. <Col N="1908" /> It is quite wrong from the point of view of good national policy that this discrimination should be allowed to operate.  I believe that the effect of maintaining this provision in the Bill will be to negative it completely in its effects.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows there will be a change of Government some time and everybody knows that the new Government coming in considers the provisions in this Bill inadequate to achieve any substantial results and seeing the effect of establishing this principle that those who move too soon will be penalised, it may mean that the more cautious firm will still hold back.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a very easy way of circumventing that if that is my purpose, and that is by accepting my amendment.  If the Government wants to do something real instead of appearing to do something, then all the proposals I have made for amending this Bill will be accepted by him.  It seems to me the Government do not care whether the action they take has any results or not so long as they can present it to the public as well conceived.  The Minister has introduced a Bill here which he says is designed to increase exports and increase production, and which is so surrounded by limitations and restrictions that it is quite clear that the Government do not expect it to produce any results or perhaps do not even want them.  They are quite satisfied as long as they can go to the public and say: &ldquo;Look what we are doing to increase exports.&rdquo;  They are doing very little in this Bill and my efforts are directed towards amending the Bill in some degree so that it will not be completely ineffective.  The Minister sits there and produces <Col N="1909" /> foolish arguments which show he has not given any serious consideration to this matter and has no idea as to the machinery needed in order to produce the results which he stated as desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass at times even surpasses himself in the white heat of annoyance which he can reach at his own failure to persuade his colleagues to introduce similar provisions in the past.  I do not propose to discuss this amendment on that basis at all.  There is always the danger when you introduce a tax concession that its very introduction means that people who have gone before have not got the benefit of that concession.  Take, for example, the discussion we had in relation to the initial allowances in the Budget.  It was clear then that there might be two factories at any point of time, one of which had modernised its machinery and the other which had not.  The one which modernised its machinery before. the operative date was admittedly a go-ahead concern but inevitably it meant that such a concern would not obtain the benefits as from the operative date on which initial allowances were introduced.  That is always the case in respect of any tax concession. It is inevitable that there will be some date that will have to be taken as the overriding date and that those who did the particular job concerned, whether it is in installing new machinery or obtaining exports, will not be in quite as good a position as those who had sat back up to that point.  That is what does happen in relation to every tax concession and always has in relation to concessions on the broad industrial front of which this is but an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is really wrong is that the Deputy is looking at this from the point of view of the company rather than the point of view of the national economy.  The Bill is not from the point of view of giving individual concessions to individual concerns.  The purpose of the Bill is to give concessions in the interest of the national economy, where exports are increased. Obviously, the concession that the Deputy suggests is a concession considered <Col N="1910" /> from the point of view of individual companies, not from the point of view of increasing national exports as a whole.  That is where the specific difference between the Deputy's point of view and mine arises.</P>
    <P>In relation to his remarks as regards whether it is desirable to choose a fixed datum year ending 30th September last or whether it is desirable to pick another period, there might perhaps be arguments but I think it is better to take as the datum year the last period before the announcement was made that the concession would be introduced.  This is slightly different from the Deputy's earlier amendment in relation to coal where he suggested an average.  He does not suggest an average here but an option.  Is it not the very essence of the suggestion of an option that he is looking at it from the point of view of the concern rather than from the point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can the Minister visualise a board of directors sitting round a table to decide whether they are going to allocate a substantial part of their reserve funds for the purpose of extending their export business? They will ask whether it will be to the advantage of the company to do so or not.  Some of them will perhaps be more responsive to appeals to make the effort in the national interest than others but that will not do if they are going to incur losses.  They will have a duty to the shareholders to avoid those losses.  It is foolish to think of any appeals addressed to business people producing results unless it can be shown that the individuals will benefit.  That is why it is futile to talk about framing this Bill without regard to its effect upon the outlook and actions of individuals.  The individual cannot be left out.</P>

      <P>Unless this amendment or at least the spirit is adopted <Col N="1912" /> to some degree, those companies which have been most successful which have reached a certain point in regard to their exports, and have run into difficulties&mdash;those companies which have run greater risks and greater difficulties in exploiting the markets&mdash;are not going to get the advantage of this Bill.  They will only get the remission of taxation on the exports.  They will get no advantage from the success which they had from the time they started to export.</P>
      <P>The Minister should know that of our total industrial production our industrial exports are negligible.  They are tiny and yet the whole future of this State is bound up with a massive increase of industrial exports no matter what the difficulties and no matter what are the problems involved. The Minister knows that, since the war, we have invested less capital in industry than most other European countries and our production has increased less.  The Minister should realise that the companies which succeeded are the ones likely to go on succeeding.  The Minister will lose nothing by accepting this amendment. All the companies which up till now have exported will still be encouraged to export.  All the companies that will come into existence in the future and want to export will be able to do so and get the benefit of the relaxation of taxation.  At the same time, the small groups of companies which have already succeeded and have shown initiative will be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Looking at the whole field of export and examining it in the light of trade statistics&mdash;I wish I had them with me &mdash;it is quite obvious that those who have been in the business spent money on sales efforts abroad, experienced difficulties, and triumphed.  The Minister ought to include that small group and let them go from success to success.  That does not prevent other companies from taking part and going ahead also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something to be said for this amendment from the point of view of trying to reward those who had the enterprise to break into the export market and <Col N="1913" /> not merely maintain their position but to expand.  The position is rather curious because five or six years ago we had a sellers' market everywhere and there was a demand for some products made in this country which were easily sold abroad.  I am referring to more durable articles than those mentioned by Deputy Lemass.  It was comparatively more easy then, in the trading conditions obtaining, to sell.  As time went on it became more difficult and the people who had developed an easy and profitable business allowed it in many cases to taper off and are doing comparatively little export business at the moment until they get this inducement. There will be a definite encouragement for the people who took the easy money and the markets when they were available and did not seek to retain the foothold which they had secured in those markets because of the easy trading conditions to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Take the case of another company which went into the market perhaps induced by the firm set of circumstances and found their trade dwindling but fought to retain their markets and ultimately began to expand their business in the export market.  They will get less advantage from the provisions of Part III than the first class of person to whom I have referred.  The people who went into the market, fought to hold their place there and eventually began to expand their export trade, will get a relief which will be based on the period of one year to the 30th September.  The other people who also went into the market but allowed their business to taper off will probably be in a position to secure greater relief under this section than the enterprising exporters who maintained and expanded their business in the export market.  That is the case for the amendment.  In equity those who have shown their ability to expand should be given such an option in relation to the choice of period as will give them some advantage or reward for the fight they made to maintain their export position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case Deputy MacEntee has in mind would <Col N="1914" /> get some advantage by reason of the method of the choice of period for the commencement of the relief to which I have referred.  I could think of one particular case myself where it could be operated in such a way as to give benefit to the person who was building up, as the Deputy said, but would not give the benefit in the other case.</P>
      <P>The case put by Deputy MacEntee was put on a slightly different basis from that put by Deputy Lemass.  His case&mdash;again from the point of view of the concern&mdash;was that it was desirable to give a reward to those who had shown a pioneering spirit.  Deputy MacEntee can appreciate as well as I can that, without going into the amount involved, whatever amount is involved in any remission of taxation always has to be made up elsewhere.  It is a question of holding a balance as between those who need a concession and those from whom the money has to be taken.  It has always been one of the fundamental precepts of the basis of taxation that it is not right to take money in taxation from persons who are perhaps hard pressed and to give it to those who do not require it. As I understand the basis of the Deputy's argument, the concern building up over the years does not require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that basis it would seem very difficult indeed for me to justify what the Deputy has in mind.  However, I do not mind admitting quite frankly that, in relation to any tax concession, there is always the hard case on the border line when the concession starts. One particular case worried me very much when I was introducing the initial allowances this year.  It is a case of an industry that I happen to know had gone out to modernise itself but had done so at an earlier date and was not entitled to the benefit of the initial allowances.  One has to draw the line somewhere and at some point of time.  Even if I took the five-year option in this, I am quite sure I would meet hard-luck cases of people who had gone on even earlier than that and who would come to me and say: &ldquo;When you took five years, why not take six, seven or eight years?&rdquo; People will say: &ldquo;You should take <Col N="1915" /> 1947, the first year after the virtual termination of the emergency period.&rdquo;  No matter where you start, there always will be some hard-luck story.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will at least admit that if some such device as I suggest here, a choice of a limited number of years, is given, the chance of hardship is substantially reduced, if not entirely eliminated.  Surely it <Col N="1916" /> should be his desire to minimise the prospect of hardship rather than to stick pat on his own scheme even when it can be shown it will have undesirable consequences generally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 all refer to the same point.  It seems to me that this is the most futile and unworkable provision in the Bill.  I do not think it is possible for any firm doing any sort of substantial business to keep entirely separate in its accounts the profits earned on export and on home sales.  When a firm has to try to segregate, in a form which will be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners, profits earned upon increased exports, it becomes a completely impossible operation.</P>
      <P>No one who had given any thought to the practical day to day working of industry would conceive of this provision. What is there in it?  The Bill proposes that a company which enters export business for the first time will get, in respect of profits earned upon its export business, a 50 per cent. remission of taxation, or a company already engaged in the export business will get a 50 per cent. remission on any increased profit it may earn through the increased operations of the company, provided that no part of the additional profit so earned is distributed by way of dividend but has been used for the development of the company's business in the State.</P>
      <P>I said on the Second Reading that a child of ten would think out a way of evading that obligation, but why it is there at all is a complete puzzle to me. Take the case of a company which makes, one year with another, profits of, say, £100,000.  That company, in the normal working of its concern, would probably allocate £50,000 of those profits to various reserves and distribute the other £50,000 in dividends to its shareholders.  Now, let us consider that company doing an increased export business and still making £100,000 profit and still wishing to appropriate half of that to reserves of one kind or another and distribute the other half.  In order to qualify for the relief under this Bill, it merely has to ensure that out of the profits attributed to exports or increased exports goes the whole of the reserve allocations, and that out of the remainder of the profits goes the whole of the dividend distribution.  How it is thought the section can be made workable I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the purpose of the section? Surely the Government appreciate that any firm, if it is going to get into export business for the first time or to increase its activity in the export market, will have to get increased capital from somewhere.  If it goes to its existing shareholders with a supplementary issue of shares, to get more capital for its contemplated extension of business, is it going to have to tell them there and then: &ldquo;We are asking you to put up more capital, but we want you to understand that, under <Col N="1919" /> the law, no dividends can be paid upon these additional shares&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is likely that we can, by any modification of our laws here or by any tax concessions that might conceivably be given, induce foreign firms to come here, to use this country as a base for their export trade, firms that might not be interested in the home market at all but which would do the manufacturing here of goods intended for markets all over the world.  I know some members of the Government have known that I have interested myself in that possibility; and, while nothing has come of it yet, there is, I suppose, the chance that something might come of it some time, if our tax laws are modified sufficiently. What is the hope of getting that done if we have to tell those firms: &ldquo;Of course, the concessions which we give under those tax laws of Ireland are conditional on your shareholders never getting a dividend from their operations in this country.&rdquo; Surely it is a nonsensical provision, unworkable on the one hand and misdirected on the other.  Therefore, I urge strongly that these amendments be accepted, that these limitations should be removed.</P>
    <P>I hope Ministers and their advisers do not think that the people controlling the business of this country are irresponsible people who cannot be trusted to manage their affairs properly and that they must be told what to do by some Government Department. The great majority of business concerns will not allocate to dividend purposes funds which can be used for the extension and development of the business.  The practice has grown up in most other countries of utilisation for dividend purposes of only a proportion of the profits earned in any year.  Indeed, most of our existing Irish concerns have reached the present stage of their development because of the conservative policy of their boards in holding back for utilisation in their concerns a substantial part&mdash;if not the bulk&mdash;of the profits earned.  There is no need to devise this legislative signpost to good business management&mdash;at any rate in respect of the concerns likely to take <Col N="1920" /> any interest in the provisions of the Bill, or which have the enterprise and ability to enter export trade with a chance of success and a chance of earning profits.</P>
    <P>I cannot think of any reason why this paragraph is put in this section, unless there is some belief in the minds of the Government that business people cannot be trusted to manage their affairs properly.  The type of firm that will go into export, the type of firm that will make any profit in the export trade&mdash;and there can be no concession under this Bill, unless they are making a profit&mdash;can be trusted to look after the affairs of their companies without any legislative restrictions of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The position which Deputy Lemass has indicated in respect of this amendment is not the accurate position at all.  I agree wholeheartedly that it is desirable that companies should make reasonable profits and I accept the view without question that many companies are at present able to expand in business because of the fact that, over the years, they have ploughed back profits into their businesses.  I think it is entirely desirable that that should be so and it is entirely desirable that the practice so built up in that way should be continued.</P>
      <P>In relation to this concession, what I want to ensure is that a person who gets into the export business will get into it to stay, that he will not get into it merely for a very transient period in which he might just see one opportunity and, having seen and taken that single opportunity, not bother himself about it any more.  One of the desirable things in that respect is that one should utilise the effect of this concession&mdash;and it is a concession&mdash; towards building up similar business in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree, of course, with Deputy Lemass that the effect of this amendment is that the total overall allocation of profit to reserves is what is covered rather than a specific part of it.  But I do not propose in this section to measure what allocation to reserves was made prior to the obtaining by the person concerned of the excess <Col N="1921" /> export profits.  I do not think it would be desirable to do that.  It is by quite deliberate intent that I am enabling the switch from existing reserves to be made in place of these excess export profits.</P>
    <P>There is another point apart from the desirability of ploughing back profits into business, which Deputy Lemass accepts as so desirable.  There is another point and it is that, if the situation were not such that the reserves that were taken out of profits were of such a figure that the distribution was restricted to the amount of the gross profit otherwise earned, you would at once get into a very, very obscure dividend distribution problem. You would have a situation then in which one company might be deducting tax from its dividends at 7/3, another at 7/-, another down to 6/6, and so forth.  The whole basis of our income-tax code, in so far as it affects companies, is based on the provision that the company pays the tax and, having paid the tax, deducts it from its dividend payments.  If the provision were not in this Bill that there would be sufficient so paid by the company before distribution of dividends to account for the full tax to be deducted from the dividends distributed one would have to have dividends paid under varying rates of income-tax.  I think that would be undesirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  What harm is there in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;quite apart from its administrative difficulty because then, when one goes from the actual payment of the dividend concerned to the grossing up that I have provided so as to ensure that the relief is carried right through, one would have considerable further difficulties and one would arrive at a situation in which the administrative cost would be quite out of proportion to the benefit involved for the individual company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will notice that I have taken a different line in this respect in relation to coal, partly because a coal mine is a wasting asset and I do not think it would be desirable to introduce this provision where there is <Col N="1922" /> a wasting asset, and also because the number of coal mines is so small, and is likely to continue to be so small, that the administrative problem created would be very great.  I think it is desirable, in so far as this restriction is concerned, that people should plough back profits particularly when they obtain those profits by way of tax concession. From what I can gather, Deputy Lemass differs from me on that.  His point of view is that I should not signpost by statute what is a desirable practice.  I think by doing that we are achieving very, very desirable economies and it is desirable to do it from that point of view so as to avoid cases in which people might go into business on a transitory basis only and get out again just as quickly.  What I am anxious to do is to establish the principle that those who go into exports will go into them on a permanent basis because, as a result of the concessions they will get here, they will have to plough back such profits as they may make through that concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously contemplate the picture of a company being established here who do an export business only, never paying a dividend without losing this concession? Does he think it is likely any company will be established on that basis?  There have been companies of that kind in the past.  In my time, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I gave new manufacturing licences on the basis that the entire output would be exported.  If any such proposition arises in the future one will have to tell those interested: &ldquo;But, of course, if you ever pay a dividend to your shareholders you lose the tax concession.&rdquo; Does the Minister think that is a feasible proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I seriously to believe that the reason why no profits, to qualify for this concession under this Bill, can ever be distributed to shareholders is because some slight trouble might be caused for the companies concerned in determining the appropriate rate of tax deduction from the dividend warrant? I should imagine most companies will be delighted to be able to tell their shareholders that, because of <Col N="1923" /> increased export trade, their rate of tax deduction has been reduced.  No doubt that will have a very considerable repercussion on the value of the shares concerned on the stock market.</P>
    <P>If this proposition is to work at all it must work on some rational basis. Again, I emphasise the need for getting more capital if more business is to be done.  Any concern of any size which wants to get into export trade on a substantial scale will have to raise money somewhere.  A few of the more fortunate will have to use resources they have which they can devote to that purpose.  Most will have to get more money by going to their existing shareholders, to the public or to friends of the directors to ask them to put up the additional money required to enable the increased export trade plan to be financed.  That additional capital cannot be remunerated unless the total amount available for distribution is increased as a result of these operations.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from its repercussion on the amount of dividend, it must be open to companies to remunerate the additional capital.  The question of the desirability of a company appropriating a reasonable part of its earned profits to the maintenance of its assets and to develop its business is there.  But companies will do that of their own accord. Ministers do not have to tell them to do it, and, therefore, that cannot be the reason why this section is here.  If there is some idea of administrative convenience it seems to me strange to introduce a Bill which is purported to be directed towards encouraging increased exports and then nullify the whole thing for an administrative reason.  That seems to me a foolish proceeding.</P>

I suggest to the Deputy that as far as that is concerned where you are giving a concession, you are entitled to make a provision in relation to that concession which you would not be entitled to make if there was another concession there.  But Deputy Lemass has put a third case to me, that is in relation to the new company which does solely export business.  My understanding of that position is that in relation to that I would be entitled to deal with it on the basis of 50 per cent.  plough-back, because the basis of tax remission is 50 per cent.  If, however, that does not appear to be the case, and if there is an obligation in relation to a new concern so entering on the export business and solely export business, I must confess at once I see there might be a new concern given a new manufacturing licence solely on condition that they would engage on the export trade and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so far as that problem emerges, I shall certainly consider it between now and Report Stage.  But on general principles, it is desirable that firms when they get a special concession from the State should utilise that concession to plough-back into the business or to build up the business.  I do not think <Col N="1926" /> there should be any disagreement on any side of the House on that.</P>

      <P>I am only instancing the case of a company doing nothing but export trade merely to simplify the picture, but the Minister cannot be unaware of the fact that during the past year some people came here associated with big concerns elsewhere because they were asked to consider the possibility of transferring some part of their world trade to a manufacturing concern in this country. They might sell something here.  For instance, if the Du Pont Company that is coming to Derry had come here instead, no doubt 97 or 98 per cent. of their products would be sold abroad but some percentage would be sold here.  It is because of the possibility that we may be able, at some time, to attract people of that kind through holding out the inducement of remission of tax that I do not want to see that possibility defeated by this unnecessary condition, that in order to qualify they must never pay dividends. They come here to make a profit and they get money from their shareholders on the assumption that they will pay dividends.  This strikes at the whole possibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am somewhat perturbed at the prospect of the wrangling that may arise between the taxpayers and the revenue authorities in regard to development expenditure.  I think it would be desirable to be a little more explicit as to what we mean by development expenditure. Have we in mind capital expenditure only?  Is advertising on the foreign market, for example, development expenditure? I do suggest that the term should be more explicitly dealt with. I can see the Minister's reluctance to accept this amendment in full but I would strongly urge him to the view that the three words &ldquo;in this State&rdquo; are completely out of accord with the <Col N="1927" /> aim of the Bill.  Surely it is possible to develop a company's business outside the State?  Surely a company which, for example, opens an export office incurs expenditure?

      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;so&rdquo; in line 16 down to the end of the sub-section and substitute: &ldquo;shall be reduced by 100 per cent. in respect of such proportion of the total profit on the sale of goods manufactured by the company as the goods exported by it bears to the total quantity of goods sold by it&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know to what extent it is possible to get the Minister to consider this proposal now.  I presume he has considered it already because this was the proposal put to the Commission on Industrial Taxation by the Irish Exporters' Association.  Admittedly, adoption of this amendment would alter in a fundamental way the proposal in the Bill.  The Bill proposes <Col N="1928" /> that a company will get a 50 per cent. remission of tax on new export business, export business it has not had previously, in excess of anything it did before, subject to that business yielding taxable profits.  The proposal here, I think, is justifiable on two grounds.  So far as the Bill is concerned, many business people have criticised it on the grounds that it provides a very complicated method of determining the amount of tax relief given in any individual instance.</P>
    <P>A company which had 75 per cent. of its sales on the home market and 25 per cent. abroad and increases that 25 per cent. until it is doing, say, 72 per cent. of its sales at home and 28 per cent. abroad would have a most complicated procedure to follow before being able to calculate the amount of tax relief which it could obtain.  Communications addressed to me by some firms and organisations have criticised the Bill on that ground. They urge that tax laws should be simple so that members of the public will know exactly what they are obliged to pay and that they should not have to depend on the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of the position.  One of the advantages of the change in the Bill which I propose is to give a simpler code of tax laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will permit me to differ from him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely. The proposal in the amendment is a very simple one from the point of view of the individual firm.  Instead of a 50 per cent. remission of tax on export trade profits, my proposal is that they should get a complete remission of their total tax bill in the same proportion as their exports are to their total sales.  A firm which had 90 per cent. home sales and 10 per cent. export sales of their total production would be entitled to 10 per cent. remission, and a firm exporting 50 per cent. of their total production and selling 50 per cent. on the home market would be entitled to a 50 per cent. remission. In the same way, a firm that exported its entire output would be entitled to 100 per cent. remission. <Col N="1929" /> That would be a very substantial inducement to firms to export.  It would be a simple method of determining the extent of the remission and would be immediately understood by business managements.  If the Minister would agree to accept the amendment, it would bring a number of business firms very quickly to the detailed consideration of the possibility of doing an export trade, even in the case of firms who did not think they could do it very profitably.  I do not know whether it is fully appreciated by the Government that any new export business in manufactured goods is not possible without a considerable outlay, not merely on production equipment, but upon market research, upon the establishment of a sales organisation, upon advertising abroad in a number of instances, and that risks in the export trade exist on a sufficient scale to discourage many Irish business firms from operating other than they have been doing up to now in a protected market.</P>
      <P>If we are to have any substantial increase in our export trade, we have got to give quite substantial inducement. We must give something far more substantial than £10,000 or £15,000.  We have got to be prepared to take risks with the revenue, if necessary, for a time, until the industrial firms have been given every chance of exploring the export market possibilities before incurring the initial risks which will arise in getting an export trade established.</P>
      <P>When Irish export business in manufactured goods is as well founded as the export trade of other countries, then we might withdraw some of these concessions in whole or in part, but if we are to have any substantial upward trend in industrial exports conditions we have got to do something far more extensive, something far more dramatic than the Minister proposes here.  My proposal is that the tax of firms should be remitted in the same proportion as their export trade is to their total output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there would be any substantial difficulties in administering an arrangement of that kind.  From <Col N="1930" /> my own contacts with firms who have export possibilities, I believe such an arrangement would get them thinking seriously.  It would not get them all into the export trade, but, as I have said, it would get them thinking seriously, whereas the proposals set out in the Bill will produce very inadequate results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find it is there all right.  He can take it from me that is the basis.  It will not be an individual costing of each item that is sent for export.  I think the Deputy must agree, as anybody who has any business experience must, that that would not be desirable.  If it is not done in that way, there is the way <Col N="1931" /> the Deputy has suggested, which is that the total profits from the sale of goods manufactured by a company would be divided in the ratio of the volume of exports to the volume of the total goods sold.  The effect of that would be that goods can be sold at a loss on the export market and that the loss would have to be borne by profits on home sales.</P>
      <P>I can easily see how objectionable that would be.  If there is to be an express subsidy paid for exports, it should be the Government and the House who determine that subsidy rather than the individual companies. Under the Deputy's amendment, any company would be entitled itself to determine that it was going to subsidise its exports, sell them at a loss and that the loss would be met out of the profit on home sales.  That would be the precise effect of the proposed arrangement of Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>It does not relate the proportion of profits on exports to the proportion of total profits.  It does not do that, probably for the reason I indicated. Deputy Lemass merely takes the value of goods sold in the export market and relates the value of concessions solely to that as the proportion of the total goods sold.  If, therefore, a company, trading both on the home front and on the export front, wished in any year to bring down its rate of home taxation for its own benefit it could achieve that by selling on the export market at a loss, and under Deputy Lemass's amendment the Exchequer would have to provide the subvention to meet that export sale so carried on at a loss. Obviously, no Minister for Finance and no Government could expect that.  If there is to be any subsidy on exports, the determination of that subsidy must be made by the Government of the day and not by the individual concern, and that is what the Deputy's amendment would mean.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the introduction of the initial allowance of 10 per cent. on capital expenditure incurred on the provision of industrial buildings.  I have already asked the Minister to indicate whether the introduction of this part of the Bill in this form is to be taken as meaning that the other recommendations of the Industrial Taxation Committee have been rejected by the Government.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will remember, the committee made recommendations governing the definition of industrial buildings for the purposes of the introduction of a depreciation allowance and also recommended the granting of an annual wear and tear allowance of 2 per cent., in addition to the initial allowance of 10 per cent. The Minister did not act upon these recommendations in the Finance Bill of this year on the plea that he then had not had time fully to consider these recommendations.  Presumably he has had time by now and the introduction of this Bill, of itself, is an indication that the other recommendations have been rejected.  If not, it is desirable that the Minister should make that clear, if it is intended to act upon these recommendations in the main Finance Bill next year.</P>

      <P>When we were on the Second Stage of the Bill, I asked the Minister if he could not see his way to fix the qualifying date as 30th June.  I think most people anticipated that any allowance which would be given would run as from that date.  I do not know whether or not the Minister has considered it but, in existing circumstances, I think it would not be a very costly concession and it is one which might, say, compensate some concerns which, despite the rather doubtful outlook, did proceed to incur expenditure on new industrial buildings.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether he has given any consideration to that point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, this is a very objectionable provision.  I assume the Minister is committed to this project of the prize bonds.  As I said on the Second Reading, it is a very unfortunate thing for the country that we have been reduced to these straits.  One cannot discuss the proposal in terms of ethics.  I do not think there is any harm in any person having a gamble or speculation if he so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never taken the line that a person ought not make a wager but I do think there is something distasteful in the Minister for Finance, as representing the Government, entering into what amounts to a wager with members of the public who will subscribe to these bonds.  We have taken steps in relation to games of chance and lotteries and subjected them to very strict regulation.  We have done that because of the social evils to which these undertakings have given rise.  I do not suggest that people are going to reduce themselves, by purchasing these bonds, to the same straits as some people have done by gambling. What I am pointing out is that I do not suppose that those who participate in the purchase of prize bonds with the hope that they will at some time or another draw a big prize are going to reduce themselves to the same straits as those generally do who engage excessively in gambling, but still the two undertakings are of the same nature.  A bookmaker may bleed a silly <Col N="1935" /> improvident client.  I do not suppose the Minister for Finance will bleed those who subscribe to these bonds but still the bait is the same.</P>
    <P>The unwise gambler gambles because he hopes to get a large and easy return. The subscribers, or nearly all of them, to these bonds will be precisely in that position.  It will be the lure of the big prize, and not the intrinsic value of the bond, that will attract them.  Formerly, the attraction of our national loans was their intrinsic value; subscribers knew that each unit of stock was certain of a secure and, in the conditions of the time, a fair and adequate return.  That feature does not characterise the prize bonds.  As far as I know, there will be no specific rate of interest attached to any of the bonds.  Their one attraction, as I have said, will be the possibility that the holder will draw a substantial prize.  If he does this, however, he will draw it at the expense of his fellow-contributors to these bonds; it will not be at the expense of the State.  He will enter into a gamble in which the Minister for Finance will be, in one way, the beneficiary, but in which the great majority of those who participate with him in the scheme will be losers.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to speak on this matter because I realise that the Minister is himself a victim of circumstances. I am perfectly certain that, were it not for the financial straits in which the country finds itself, the Minister would not have sponsored a scheme of this sort.  I do not want to apportion blame to the Minister.  As I have said so often in this House, it is the public demand for expenditure which the community as a whole could not afford, could not continue to maintain, that has reduced us to this condition. At the same time, looking at it from the point of view of the general public interest, it would have been better for the Minister for Finance to eschew a scheme of this sort.  It would have been better if he had made his issue for the last loan on more attractive terms than to have created this precedent which others may follow but which I sincerely hope they will not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> A great number of matters could be raised in relation to these bonds and there is one which I would like to raise.  Is it fair to the community as a whole, to the Minister, or to his successors, who may find it hard to terminate this scheme, to have established a principle that Government stock, having been issued a little while before at a discount, should be accepted by the Minister at its par value in subscription to bonds of this sort?  I do not think that the Minister, even for the purpose of making either the loan or this scheme&mdash;which is a complementary part of the borrowing operation&mdash; so attractive was wise or justified in giving an untaxable capital appreciation of £2 per cent., to the subscribers to the last national loan.  It is very hard to be specific but I think he has again created a very undesirable precedent there.</P>
    <P>I assume that if a prize is drawn under this scheme, it will not be subject to tax, that it will be regarded as a windfall and accordingly will go tax free.  I think it has been the custom and the tradition that where a windfall occurs the Revenue Commissioners do not pursue the person who has experienced the good fortune too rigorously in relation to tax.  I hope that will continue to be the situation, but it seems again in this connection that the prize drawn is gained at the expense of the general body of subscribers.</P>
    <P>The tax remission in the same way is gained at their expense also, in, I grant you, a rather indirect way. They derive no immediate income from their bonds.  I suppose in that way they are not subject to tax.  If, instead of having an arrangement of that sort, we had pursued what was the more normal way&mdash;to use the Minister's own phrase&mdash;of providing funds for the Exchequer by the issue of a loan which would carry a rate of interest, then the interest, if the person was otherwise assessable, would be subject to taxation. That, of course, is not the case here.  He escapes taxation if he draws a prize and it is that fact which makes me say that even his exemption from income-tax is secured at the expense of those who participate with him in <Col N="1937" /> the pool.  It is very difficult, having regard to my general attitude towards betting and games of chance and things of that sort, to formulate the precise way in which one feels this is not the sort of thing we ought to do, that it is not the sort of thing we are justified in doing.  It invokes in me at any rate a very strong feeling of dislike and distaste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy MacEntee has said in regard to the distaste which this section of the Bill has caused in the minds of the people.  At the time the British Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced a similar measure, there was a good deal of unfavourable comment throughout this country and in Britain.  One is always led to believe and led to expect that the most important thing in State finance is public confidence.  The introduction of the word &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; into State finance does not make for confidence and, goodness knows, confidence at the present time is a minus quantity.</P>
      <P>When the Minister flattered his counterpart in England by introducing this measure&mdash;imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&mdash;he had, I am sure, examined what were the results accruing from the measure in force across the water.  He must have been very much enthused by the result when he embarked on the gamble in the finances here.  I do not know what the people in the cities think about it but in the country we have known a system whereby, when you wanted to raise the wind for any project that was in a shaky form, you resorted to what was known as a raffle.  At the time this system was introduced by the British Chancellor it was being sneered at by many people in this country as the raffle system in British finance.  They tried to justify it at the time by pointing out that the gambling instinct had grown in the minds of the people. They were inclined to gamble and it was to capture some of the results of that inclination to send money after the chance of winning a prize and thereby capture some of the loose money floating around, that this measure was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> I do not think even the British people themselves were satisfied, after the scheme was introduced, that it would be worthwhile.  The Minister should be able to tell us otherwise but it does seem to be a matter of creating a feeling of distrust to introduce gambling into State Finances.  A gamble is all it is.  One takes a chance and one may win a prize.  Deputy MacEntee has said a prize has to be provided out of some finance and the money which goes to the making of a prize must be the public finance.  Somebody stands to lose as a result of the good luck of those who will be fortunate to win a prize.</P>
    <P>I have not yet heard the Minister making any statement in defence of the introduction of these prize bonds. Perhaps there is something in it that does not meet the eye but it certainly would need to have a lot if it is to counteract the feeling of distrust that has been aroused by resorting to what in the minds of the country folk is the last resort, the raffle.  If the results are not worthwhile this is a section which the Minister might be well advised to delete from the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan was allowed to raise the question of confidence as the basis upon which it was essential to carry on State finances. However, I do not mind in the slightest dealing with it now or on any other occasion, but if I might turn from the remarks of Deputy Brennan to those of Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy MacEntee said at the beginning that he liked a little flutter, as indeed I do myself, as indeed does the present occupant of the Opposition Front Bench.  We all have that weakness, shall we call it, but perhaps one of the essential differences in relation to any such scheme of prize bonds, a scheme which, I may add, was suggested by the present Taoiseach long before the system of premium bonds was introduced in England, is that there is not the same element of complete gamble or the same element of lottery underlying this scheme as underlies the other things that were mentioned.</P>
      <P>The essential thing here is that the applicant's money remains intact and that the subscriber to the prize bond scheme will be able to get back his subscription at any of the stated periods on giving the prescribed notice. It cannot, therefore, have the same effect on the person throwing away his substance, so to speak, on a wild gamble.  On the contrary, this scheme provides that the person's substance will be kept intact.  If he is not successful in obtaining a prize, he will still have his funds kept intact.  If he subscribes £100, he will still have his £100 which he can draw out of the fund at a later stage, if he gives the prescribed notice.  It seems to me that that is a fundamental difference and is the answer to the point made by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly in present circumstances and quite apart from the capital concerned, I think it is desirable to utilise every means that keeps a person's savings intact to get them to increase their savings.  That is one of the things that the prize fund or scheme will, I hope, do.  It is clearly, in my view, desirable at present that every inducement that can reasonably be offered should be offered for the purpose of getting people to save more. <Col N="1940" /> If we are to be able to channel their funds into savings of this sort, it is far better that they should do so than that they should put their money into football pools, or some type of coupon arrangement such as that, because in this case the money is held there for them in the fund and they can withdraw it.</P>

When Fianna Fáil were in a position not nearly so bad as the present Government is in but bad enough, and when they were telling the people of the measures they took to correct the serious state of the balance of payments, the Opposition said they were entirely unnecessary and that Fianna Fáil were introducing a hair-shirt policy.  Deputy Lemass gave a warning in Letterkenny in 1947 as to what was in store for the people if they were not prepared to do certain things to bring about a better position with regard to exports and promote greater efficiency.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I want to make it clear beyond question in relation to this section and to this scheme of prize bonds that it is a scheme by virtue of which moneys will be obtained by prize bonds, premium bonds&mdash;call them what you may&mdash;for the purpose of financing the capital programme.  It was suggested by the present Taoiseach some two years before this Government was formed when he was on the opposite benches and when Fianna Fáil were over here.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the development of industrial production as a means of providing employment and easing the balance of payments' position by the production of goods here which would <Col N="1942" /> otherwise have to be imported and by contributing to our export potential. Successive Governments have accepted the need for creating conditions favourable to the expansion of manufacturing activity; these conditions have taken a number of forms including the grant of protection where necessary, the provision of facilities for securing capital and the provision of information and advice to industrial promoters. More important perhaps than the form of assistance which I have mentioned is the fact that persons contemplating the establishment of industries here know that if they invest their capital and use their abilities in establishing efficient manufacturing units they can be sure that at all stages of their operations they will enjoy the goodwill and encouragement of whatever Government is in power.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the field of industrial development.  But the need for increased employment, reduced dependence on imports and the expansion of exports requires that further steps should be taken to stimulate and if possible speed up the tempo of industrial development.  The Government have therefore decided on certain measures to afford additional incentives for industrial development.  Deputies have recently been considering proposals for tax relief in respect of industrial exports and for industrial buildings and the present Bill is designed to implement the Government's proposals for grants to aid industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Industrial Development Authority to make grants of up to two-thirds of the cost of factory buildings and other works required for the establishment of industrial undertakings, subject to a maximum grant of £50,000 in any one case.  Before the grant is given, the authority must satisfy itself that the project concerned will be reasonably permanent and is likely to be carried on efficiently and that its establishment will be in the interests of the national economy and is likely to provide substantial employment or to make available substantial quantities of the goods concerned or to provide an <Col N="1943" /> opportunity for exports.  I do not think that any promoter of a worthwhile project should have the slightest difficulty in satisfying the authority under these heads as they are in effect the essential prerequisites for the establishment of a sound industrial project.  The assistance to be given by the authority under the Bill will, as I have said, take the form of a grant and once the project has got under way and the grant has been paid the industrialist concerned will be free to manage his affairs in whatever way he thinks best.</P>
    <P>When it was decided to introduce the scheme of industrial grants we were conscious that there might be some fears among existing manufacturers that their position might be worsened by competition in a saturated market from new units established with the help of grant moneys.  While I could not conceive that the authority would make grants available in such circumstances nevertheless I thought it well to have a provision written into the Bill which would allay any fears on the part of existing manufacturers.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that when considering applications for grants the authority shall have regard to the extent to which the requirements of the public in respect of the commodities to be manufactured are sufficiently met by undertakings already established.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Taoiseach on 5th October of the Government's intention to introduce a scheme for industrial grants indicated that it would be administered in accordance with the accepted policy of decentralisation. The Bill does not contain a specific provision to this effect but it is my intention when the legislation has been enacted to issue a policy directive in the matter to the authority.  The directive will be in the sense of the reply given in Dáil Éireann to a question on 25th October, 1956, when it was indicated that the accepted policy of decentralisation of industry is to encourage so far as it is practical to do so the dispersal of industry throughout the country so that areas away from the centres of largest population <Col N="1944" /> shall secure industrial projects and thereby share in the employment and other advantages resulting from industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a maximum aggregate of grants of £2,000,000 for the seven years to the 31st December, 1963, but I must admit that this estimate may fall wide of the mark as the volume of grants will, of course, depend on the extent to which projects come forward for consideration by the authority.  I would be very gratified if the estimate should prove to be too low as I cannot think of a better way of spending money than on industries which will provide permanent employment for our people, reduce our expenditure abroad on the goods which we need and increase our export potential.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not apply to areas to which the Undeveloped Areas Act applies; these areas will continue to enjoy the benefits of that Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other matters arising on the Bill which call for comment by me at this stage and I will conclude by expressing the hope that, as the Bill is one which should commend itself to the Deputies of all Parties, it will be given a speedy passage as an agreed measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question that arises on this Bill is why it was considered necessary at all.  The Undeveloped Areas Act which the Minister referred to provides for the giving of grants and other forms of State assistance to industrial undertakings established in counties west of the Shannon, along the western seaboard. That Act provides that it can be extended by Ministerial Order to any other area.  So far as the Minister desired to take power to give grants to aid the establishment of new industries in other areas, he could have done so at any time by making an Order under Section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did he not do it that way?  I think the decision to avoid making an Order under the Undeveloped Areas Act and introducing a new Bill was a political one.  The Minister did not want to appear to be merely relying <Col N="1945" /> on the Undeveloped Areas Act and did not want to draw attention to the effect of the introduction of this measure on the policy which the Undeveloped Areas Act was intended to implement. I think that fact must be fully considered by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In 1951, the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed by the Dáil for the express purpose of giving a particular inducement to persons proposing to establish new industries in this country to go to the West.  It was deemed to be in the national interest that there should exist some attraction to intending industrialists to locate their activities in that part of the country. Reference was had to the fact that the West of Ireland had failed to secure advantages from the industrial development programme launched in 1932 to the same extent as other parts of the country and to the fact that, at least at that time, emigration from the West was far heavier than from other parts of Ireland.  There was a general acceptance of the argument that it was to the advantage of the nation as a whole that the balance of industry should be more equitably distributed and that Government policy should be directly aimed at encouraging industrial development in that region.</P>
    <P>We put into that Undeveloped Areas Act this provision which enabled Orders to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce extending the Act to other areas for particular reasons.  The old congested districts, which were the areas deemed as being undeveloped, were not, perhaps, very scientifically delineated and it was realised that adjacent areas had equal claim for State assistance in the promotion of new industries and that the national aim, to which I referred, would be just as well served by getting them into these adjacent areas as into districts clearly within the limits of the old congested districts.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion on that Bill and many times since its enactment, Deputies have urged in the House that Orders should be made extending the Undeveloped Areas Act to other parts of the country.  For myself, I was inclined to resist most of these representations.  At any rate, I refused <Col N="1946" /> to consider the making of an Order of that kind until a specific industrial proposal was in the picture and it was clear that the furtherance of that proposition depended upon the making of the Order, because, as I explained on many occasions, the whole effect of the Undeveloped Areas Act, the whole policy enshrined in it, was weakened by every extension of the area to which the Act applied.  The Minister has now come with a Bill to introduce virtually similar provisions for State aid in the form of free grants to industrial projects in any part of Ireland.  I suggest that the reason he is doing that by a separate Bill is that he realises quite well that it involves the virtual abandonment of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the policy it represents.  That may be a good thing or a bad thing but it is undesirable that the effect of what is proposed here should be concealed.</P>
    <P>Why is it considered necessary at this stage that State aid to new industries should be given in the form of free grants?  One would have thought that the Minister himself would have felt obliged to give some explanation of his own change of attitude in that regard.  When the Undeveloped Areas Act was being discussed here and when a proposition was made by Deputy Dillon that aid to existing concerns in the West of Ireland should not be given by way of free grant but should be given only by way of loan, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was the strongest advocate of that point of view and divided the House on the principle of giving free grants to industries even in the most remote western districts.</P>
    <P>At column 1063, Volume 128 of the Dáil Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are now engaged in passing a Bill the object of which is to make £2,000,000 available to promote private enterprise in the undeveloped areas.  That £2,000,000 does not belong to private enterprise.  It is £2,000,000 of public money which has to be raised from the pockets of the taxpayers and which may be raised in such a form that every citizen, and particularly the lowly <Col N="1947" /> section of our community, will have to contribute.  As custodians of the public interest, we ought to concern ourselves with how this public money will be spent.  While it may be necessary, in order to encourage industry in the undeveloped areas, to give grants in special cases where no other method of inducement will encourage the establishment of an industry, we ought to be careful, I think, when it comes to giving a grant to any person, firm or corporation which, in fact, may not need a grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he went on to argue that it would be sufficient to give aid to industries, even in the West of Ireland, by way of interest-free loans, loans which would be repayable, the money coming back, as he said, into the kitty.</P>
    <P>His suggestion at that time was not acceptable to the Dáil.  The amendment, which he supported, was defeated, but it was not because of any lack of strength in his advocacy against the policy of giving free grants to private industry.  Now, however, we have this proposition to give free grants to private industry anywhere. No statement has been made to the House to lead us to believe that anything will come of it.  No argument has been advanced to show that it is necessary and no attempt has been made to analyse the possible consequences of the provision.</P>
    <P>Is it true that industry is being held up anywhere by shortage of capital? It may be so.  Here and there, in the past, it did happen that individual industrial concerns which appeared to have the possibilities of expansion were held down by inability to get sufficient capital.  To meet that situation, the Industrial Credit Company was set up, the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was passed.  Various devices were adopted, to make it possible for industrial concerns to get whatever capital was required, either by way of investment or by way of loan, to enable them to proceed.</P>
    <P>I have urged already here that, in present circumstances, having regard to the policy being pursued by the <Col N="1948" /> commercial banks, the general tightness of money now existing, it is desirable that the resources and, perhaps, the powers of the Industrial Credit Company should be extended, that that undertaking should be enabled to provide money for industrial expansion through investment in the shares of private undertakings, shares which it might not be desirable to market at the present time, or to deal with smaller concerns by way of repayable loans or the purchase of debentures.  I think that is necessary but I think that is all that is necessary and, indeed, I am quite certain that, if that were done, it could be said that no industrial concern with any prospect of development, any prospect of making a profit, would not be able to proceed because of shortage of money.</P>
    <P>What is the danger we are facing because of this proposal?  The Minister is taking power for the Industrial Development Authority to give grants to any new industrial enterprise anywhere. The danger is that no industrial enterprise will ever start again without getting this free grant from public funds.  We have a provision in this Bill which obliges the Industrial Development Authority to take certain things into account and a section which also gives them power to impose conditions.  These are provisions which I think are likely to be far more effective in retarding industrial development than helping it.  I believe that over the main part of the industrial field, private enterprise is the best force on which to rely.</P>
    <P>I recognise that private enterprise is frequently unable to operate fully effectively in present circumstances and I have been urging courses of action which will tend to make it more effective but it seems to me that getting industrial concerns into a position where they are under the thumb of the Government, where they must conform to conditions, and keeping them there by the inducement of free grants, is a bad policy.</P>
    <P>If it could be shown that any single industrial proposition that would not otherwise proceed was likely to go ahead quickly because of the provisions of this Bill, I would say that that is an <Col N="1949" /> argument in its favour.  We have not been told that.  Indeed, no reason has been advanced for the Bill at all. There is an implied assumption that industrial development has been held up by the absence of free grants.  That is not true.  Industrial development has been held up to some extent by inability to get capital.  Meet that by making it possible for it to get capital. You do not have to meet it by going into the pockets of the taxpayers to hand out grants of this kind when, by doing so, you are creating a situation in which concerns that might otherwise develop will not develop unless this grant is given to them and where the policy of western development is negative at the same time.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I have a very considerable dislike of most of these proposals for money for nothing and, in the past, whenever I had as Minister to bring propositions here involving Government grants of any kind, for any purpose, I felt obliged to defend the proposal in full, and the absence of any attempt to defend this Bill by the Minister in introducing it, the unwarranted assumption upon which he based his remarks, indicate to me that no very great thought has been given to this proposition at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Finance Bill that we have just been discussing. The implication is that this Finance Bill gives some enormous financial aid to industry.  I have calculated that the maximum amount of money that it could possibly cost the Government, even if we assume that we will get a 10 per cent. increase in industrial exports and a 10 per cent. increase in coal production, is less than £10,000. It is quite obvious to me that, some time in September or October last, the Government panicked about its political position and Ministers were called together and told: &ldquo;We have to produce some sort of programme.  It does not matter whether it is a good or a bad programme, whether the propositions we put forward are likely to get results, as long as they look good.&rdquo;  That was the whole purpose of all the announcements made by the Taoiseach-to produce something that looked good&mdash;and we have the proposal <Col N="1950" /> embodied in the Finance Bill, that means nothing, that will achieve nothing, and this proposal, which was obviously adopted without any consideration of its possible consequences much less of the need for it.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for a Party in opposition to vote against a measure introduced by a Government in office to give money for nothing to anybody and Deputies will appreciate my political difficulty in that regard but, speaking quite frankly and honestly, I believe that this Bill introduces an undesirable principle in the operation of industrial policy, that it is unnecessary, that the aid which industry requires is not this type of aid and that the whole origin of the Bill is the inability of the Government to think beyond the surface of things, to get down to an understanding of the real causes which are holding up national development, their desire to appear to be doing something, whether they get results or not, in order to safeguard their political position for the time being.</P>
    <P>The Minister can have his Bill, as far as I am concerned, but I want to make it clear that, in my view&mdash;and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy&mdash;I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development and it represents a completely wrong approach to the problems of Irish industry as they exist to-day.</P>

      <P>I think every Deputy on the western seaboard must deprecate and deplore the introduction of this Bill to-night.  For the first time in the history of the undeveloped areas, the congested areas in the country, we saw hope for revival in the introduction here of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  It was the first tangible step taken to bring industry to the areas which are fast becoming deprived of their entire population, where houses are becoming vacant, where homes are broken up and from which the people are fleeing in thousands. The farmers' sons cannot remain at home, as there is no employment; one boy remains on the farm, the others have to find employment elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> We found the position where the population of Dublin and other cities, all the large centres of population, were growing yearly and the increasing population required greater housing and even created traffic problems on the streets of the city, while the population of the area west of the Shannon, from Donegal to Kerry, is sinking so fast that soon it will not be necessary for more than two or three Deputies to come to this House to represent that area.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act was welcomed by all of us at that time.  Some of us could not see how the Opposition could find reason to object to it, but they went out of their way to do so. The present Minister found reason to condemn it and other Ministers were viciously against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with it, the present Minister advocated loans instead of grants.  Does the Minister deny that?  I think it was Deputy Blowick who said at the time that it was a Fianna Fáil stunt to try to get extra seats in some of the counties west of the Shannon.  It was the first genuine effort ever made to bring industries to those areas and the only fault I felt with the Bill, when I spoke at the time, was a fault which I still find, that it did not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any private person were putting money into industry in this country to-morrow, the advantages to be derived by being close to this city, to Cork or some of the other large centres of population, are so much in advance of some of the undeveloped areas that he would require no inducement whatever.  In fact, the grants available under the Undeveloped Areas Act, to induce private enterprise to put manufacturing concerns into areas like Donegal, are not good enough, because the disadvantage of freight alone may <Col N="1952" /> take away the benefits derived from the initial grant in the course of a few years.  I would like to see those grants extended.  I would like to see the Act amended.  It was promised at the time that, when experience had been derived from the working of the Act over a period, certain changes could be made if necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the changes I would have liked to advocate was that the further back industry went the bigger the grants should be, to prevent people going just across the fringe of that area in order to safeguard the industry and still try to reap benefits from the Act, as compared with the case of areas like Glencolumbkille, the Rosses, Blacksod or Ballina, or some of the outlying areas of Kerry.  I believe the grant should be increased for the outer margin of the area.  The bringing in of grants now, to induce people to stay in the areas where the population is growing unnecessarily, when these other areas are being denuded of population, is something that should be condemned by every western Deputy in this House.</P>
    <P>There are certain qualifications required before a grant may be paid.  In fact, the industrial authority may never pay a grant, if they so desire. The Bill can be used as a means of nullifying the good effect of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  In order to qualify for a grant, for instance, any concern must be in a position to prove that it is going to provide employment on a substantial scale, to make available to the State substantial quantities of the commodity or to provide an opportunity for developing an export market.  Any firm or projected firm which can prove these things in advance can also prove that it is going into a sound concern which will show good returns for the money being put into it and that the concern from the outset is a success and therefore it should not require any assistance, simply because it is able to prove already that it is going into a sound project which is going to succeed.</P>
    <P>I cannot see hope of any industrialist or potential industrialist taking any interest whatever in opening any new industries in the western <Col N="1953" /> areas when a provision like that is being provided as an inducement to establish industry in and around Dublin and the other thickly populated areas which are near to the hub of things, near the source of supply, better placed for distribution, which have all the facilities at their command, and which have all the amenities required for workers and the people concerned in those industries.</P>
    <P>It is the death knell of the Undeveloped Areas Act, an Act which we believed&mdash;as a result of a recent statement by the Taoiseach-was due for very considerable improvement, in the light of the experience gained by the Government since the time when the Act first went into operation.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be doing a good day's work for the stricken areas of this country if he would withdraw this Bill from the House and, instead, make further and better provision for bringing industry to the undeveloped areas before it is too late.</P>
    <P>We have had industries in Donegal which had to close recently because they had not the necessary working capital to carry on.  They had to go into voluntary liquidation and pay off workers, give them a single ticket on the boat to England, just because they had not working capital, just because &ldquo;the bank squeeze&rdquo; came on and credit was no longer available.  If something were done about the bank restrictions with regard to industry, we would really be in a position to congratulate the Minister on any effort he would make in that respect.</P>
    <P>If this Government has decided that the western seaboard is no longer worthy of attention, that the people there are being forgotten for ever, that they should now be satisfied just because a Minister for the Gaeltacht has been appointed, that nothing further must be done about them, that their loans for housing and schools and everything else and the provision for constructional work must be retarded and discontinued, I think the sooner the whole question is put in charge of another Government the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is so little in this Bill in the way of detail and there was <Col N="1954" /> so much less in the Minister's statement that it is not easy to make anything in the nature of a detailed statement on this proposal.  The statements made by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Brennan are so obvious that they need no emphasis.  Indeed, it seems a bit of a joke that the Government should have pretended to take far-reaching steps of a kind never contemplated before in establishing a Gaeltacht Ministry for the permanent economic betterment of the Gaeltacht, because, when one comes to talk about permanent betterment, one has in mind a measure such as the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
      <P>Nobody who has been in public life for the last 20 years will deny that an enormous amount of good has been done and that the standard of living of the people in the poorer parts of these areas has been improved by the cumulative effect of a number of measures in the past, no one of which could be regarded as of a really permanent character.  After the stress of an economic war followed by a World War, when some prospect of the world settling down had dawned, the previous Government did apply itself to remedying defects in industrial development, defects which showed up in relation to those areas most in need of development.  In consequence of that we were given the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Lemass has pointed out, there is power under that Act to extend by Order what was then generally recognised, and is still generally recognised, as the undeveloped areas.  They are coterminus with the scheduled congested districts.  This Bill is not a formal revocation of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If it is not a formal repeal, as Deputy Brennan says, the repeal is nevertheless going to be very real and very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that there is a limit on the amount of assistance which can be given under this Bill and that much larger assistance could, of course, be given under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  In the more remote areas, to which Deputy Brennan referred, the smaller industries are the ones most likely to prove attractive.  Larger undertakings will locate themselves <Col N="1955" /> inevitably in the larger centres of population.  Under this Bill the prospect of the smaller and more remote areas getting their innings in relation to the smaller undertakings will be filched from them if this proposal is enacted.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, in effect, the making of an Order under the Undeveloped Areas Act making the whole country an undeveloped area, even if there are modifications in the type of help to be given.  Two-thirds of the cost of establishing an industry is a substantial inducement even if there is an overall restriction of £50,000 and the industries which will be financed to the order indicated under this Bill are the ones which would be most suitable for providing permanent employment in those areas in which one does not wish to see the worst type of industrialisation. When one comes to applying the fruits of industrial development to those areas which are still largely Irish speaking, that modification on all-out industrial development is essential.  We know that because of the predominance of the English language in the country as a whole.  We know that in large-scale undertakings there is a tendency to promote the English language.  It was for that reason that it was visualised, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, that the larger industries would be located on the outer fringes.  I think that was very, very sound policy.  But the smaller industries are certainly desirable and they are vitally necessary if we are to check the haemorrhage of emigration.</P>
    <P>Permanence is most desirable in measures such as this if one is to visualise the young people who are now going abroad settling down in their own country.  They go abroad very largely to get employment which will ultimately enable them to found their own homes.  Would the Minister reconsider the effect of this measure on the other measure to which we have referred?</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the principle of giving free grants to industries all over the country, a principle not readily accepted by this side of the House, and quite apart from the desirability of <Col N="1956" /> accepting that principle and admitting that industrial development is so slowed up that free grants have now become necessary, I would appeal, representing an undeveloped area, that this Bill would be reconsidered in the light of its possible adverse effect on those areas in which some hope of development dawned when the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed.</P>
    <P>It is in no begrudging frame of mind that we are offering these criticisms here.  We do not think that benefits conferred on places east of the Shannon have been undeserved.  We believe that a country that is undeveloped generally is in need of more development so that there will be an inducement towards that very desirable development in agriculture about which everybody is talking.</P>
    <P>We feel, however, that the western seaboard deserves some special consideration and the necessity for that special consideration arises from the fact that Providence has not smiled on it as Providence has smiled on the great Central Plain or the more prosperous eastern areas.  Therein lies the justification for the departure from practice and custom in relation to industrial development of the giving of free money.</P>
    <P>But even in relation to the undeveloped areas, that was not to continue forever.  It was visualised under the Act that the time would come when industry would have so gained in momentum in those areas that it would be able to carry on with that momentum.  It is certainly a very sad commentary on the present situation that, instead of that desirable development being waited for, we have now come to the conclusion that in fact whatever momentum did exist in the better-favoured parts of the country has now ceased and that an artificial prop or aid or incentive of this sort has to be supplied.  Having said that, I think I have said enough by way of commentary on the deterioration which has taken place in recent times in regard to this very important matter of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>On the question of grants, let me say this for the poorest people in the country: they are no great believes in <Col N="1957" /> grants.  There is only one form of grant, so far as I can ascertain, which is accepted anyway generally by everybody as being completely justifiable&mdash;I am now referring to grants for private persons for private purposes&mdash;and that is the grant which is given for building dwelling houses.  When it comes to any other form of grant for private purposes, even in the poorest part of the country, these grants are looked upon askance.  These are accepted only where grave necessity exists for them. The most recent case of doubt that I have come across is in regard to the grant providing free meals in schools. Even the parents of the children who get free meals are not at all enthusiastic about its justification and there is a growing conviction that the scheme is one that ought to be revised.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to other forms of grant, and while each in its own way has done a fair amount of good, the public mind here is not one which approves whole-heartedly of the grant and I think the extent to which that can be said with truth indicates that there is self-respect and confidence on the part of the people in their own ability that has not been undermined even by the modern conditions which have produced so much socialism in so many countries.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased, in relation to the assistance being given for the provision of fishing boats, that in very few cases have I heard even the poorest fisherman recommending that there should be grants for the provision of these fishing boats.  They all felt that while assistance should be given in the form of loans, they hoped deep down in their breasts that their own industry would enable them to repay these loans.  I do not recall any fisherman asking to have facilities given to him for nothing.  However, that is talking in the abstract on the principle involved in this measure, and I would be hypocritical if I did not say that is because of the danger which I see&mdash;and which other Deputies representing areas in the West see&mdash; of the prospects of industrialisation giving permanent employment and therefore enabling a larger proportion of the young people to settle in their <Col N="1958" /> home areas, not being realised that I have spoken as I have spoken.</P>
    <P>I again endorse what has been said from this side of the House and I support the requests that this measure should be revised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from the western seaboard, from the undeveloped areas, I rise to endorse everything said by Deputy Brennan because I believe that the effect of this Bill will be to nullify completely the benefits of the Undeveloped Areas Act. Sub-section (4) of Section 2 of this Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Grants shall not be made under this section in respect of the establishment of undertakings in an area to which the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952 (No. 1 of 1952) applies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If this Bill were brought in and applied to the whole country, leaving the Undeveloped Areas Act to do the work for which it was introduced, we might understand it.</P>
      <P>Why was the Undeveloped Areas Act introduced in the first place?  It was introduced because the then Government felt Dublin was becoming top-heavy and that the population was clearing out from the western seaboard and coming into the cities and towns.  It was to stop that and in an effort to bring some of the industries back to the West, to these undeveloped areas, and away from the cities that the Undeveloped Areas Act was introduced. I stand here to-night as a representative from Sligo and I thank the man who brought in that Bill because I say it had the effect he desired it should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Sligo alone, we have had, I think, six or seven new industries started as a result of that Act.  Quite recently, the Minister was down in Tubbercurry opening a new factory and I had the pleasure of being at a dinner with him a few weeks ago, given by Sligo Chamber of Commerce.  He thanked the Sligo Chamber of Commerce for the work they were doing under that Act and for the number of factories it was instrumental in getting them. At that party, he told them about sub missions he had made to the Government for the remission of taxation and <Col N="1959" /> other things.  I wonder if the Minister on that night had told them he was bringing in a Bill to nullify the effects of the Undeveloped Areas Act what kind of reception he would have got from the Sligo Chamber of Commerce? I do not think&mdash;in fact, I am sure&mdash;it would have been as warm as he did get.</P>
    <P>I repeat with Deputy Brennan that this Bill will nullify the effect of that Act.  There is no question about it. The Act was attacked in this House when it was going through, and some members who are now sitting on the Government Front Benches said of it that it was a couple of millions of &ldquo;slush&rdquo; money for Fianna Fáil supporters. That was how one man described it.  Deputy Lemass pointed out the Minister's own approach to it. It was attacked also by vested interests later on and I suspect it is because of these attacks we now have this Bill being brought in to pacify the people and to kill initiative in the West.</P>
    <P>As I said before, it was brought in to keep the people from the western seaboard from flying from that area and coming into the cities.  It might be interesting for the Minister to let me read a few extracts from a letter in to-day's <i>Irish Press</i> from a former colleague of the Minister.  It is signed &ldquo;Peadar Cowan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  I will say, though, that it has been pointed out, not alone by this gentleman but by various people, that the amount of money spent on housing in Dublin is enormous and that the people along the western seaboard have to contribute to that expenditure. Two weeks ago, I travelled through Leitrim and found that every second house was vacant.  The Undeveloped Areas Act was the first hope brought to the people along the western seaboard.  It brought about results and the Minister went down recently and congratulated the people in Sligo and in Tubbercurry on the advances they had made under that Act.  Now he brings in a Bill to nullify the effects of that Act.</P>

For those reasons, I want to protest against it.  I cannot understand how any Deputy from the West of Ireland could support it.  It is noticeable that there is not a single Deputy from the western seaboard behind the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCarew" hpid="Mr. Carew Mr. Carew">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and to welcome it.  I am surprised to hear Deputies from the western part of Ireland opposing the measure and asserting that it will nullify the effects of the Undeveloped Areas Act brought in a few years ago to encourage industries in the West.  Coming here as I do representing Limerick City, I should like to say I do not begrudge any city in Ireland any industries that have been established in them because I believe that industries are built on enterprise.  If you have enterprising people, whether they are in Limerick, Dublin or the western seaboard, they will attract industrialists to their towns if those industrialists are engaged in some form of business suited to the particular districts to which they are sought to be attracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time in Limerick there are large numbers of unemployed people.  We feel that we are entitled to some encouragement for the establishment of industries.  Under present conditions, there is no financial inducement to start industries in Limerick, while, seven miles away, the people can enjoy the benefits of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Since that Act <Col N="1962" /> has been in operation for some years now, I feel the Minister is justified in his decision to bring in this Bill extending the operations of that Act to places like Limerick City.</P>
    <P>No new industry has been established in Limerick since the Undeveloped Areas Act was brought before the House.  We have a grievance.  All the time our Chamber of Commerce have been putting forward the plea that they are entitled to consideration. Limerick is a city 60 miles inland. That is a serious disadvantage not shared by such cities as Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Galway, which are all situated on the sea and which reap the advantages from a shipping point of view.  Ships are reluctant to come into Limerick because of the 60-mile journey up the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I welcome this measure.  I think it will benefit such cities as Limerick.  It should be remembered by Deputies who speak of this Bill as nullifying the effects of the Undeveloped Areas Act that cities like Limerick, Cork, Dublin and Waterford are finding it very difficult to provide employment.  Large sums of relief moneys have from time to time been voted by the House.  I believe it is not relief we should be discussing but employment, and for that reason I welcome the Government's decision to give the same facilities to cities like Limerick as were given to other places under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I am an industrialist myself and as such I am proud now to be able to go back to Limerick and say to the people that under this Bill industrialists can spend up to £75,000 and get a grant of £50,000 on the establishment of an industry. That is a challenge to enterprise, a challenge perhaps that enterprising people need.  If we have not succeeded in getting industrialists to come forward on the basis of their getting two-thirds of a £75,000 grant to establish an industry, then these same people cannot quarrel if we have to have State industries.  I am an advocate of private enterprise.  I know and I agree that Government-sponsored industries have, to a great extent, to depend perhaps on the advice they get from people in private enterprise for the conduct of national industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> I should like to see all sections of this House welcome this Bill.  It is a most attractive Bill to the people of Limerick City and it is really overdue, so far as we are concerned.  I would ask Deputies from the West to consider our position in Limerick.  Undoubtedly, we are a very important distributing centre.  We have some very old-established industries there.  Some of these old-established industries have changed somewhat in character and, as a result, fewer people are now employed in them.  I feel that, as a result of this Bill, some worthwhile industry will be established in Limerick.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister and the Government on its introduction.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to talk about unemployment and curing unemployment. To my mind, the only cure for unemployment in this country is industry. Industry is an attraction for some people, if they can get it in their own areas.  It was very gratifying to hear Deputy Gilbride say that six industries were established in the West.  That is a tribute to the enterprise of those western people who put up the necessary capital in addition to that supplied by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to nullify the effect of any benefit which any town may get. For some time past, I have been travelling to Dublin regularly by car, though now, because of petrol restrictions, I have decided to come by rail. However, travelling by car, I pass through many towns on my way to Dublin&mdash;Nenagh, Roscrea, Portlaoise, Newbridge and Naas.  All these towns have their industries and that is very gratifying indeed.</P>
    <P>I agree that industrialists are more attracted to Dublin from the point of view of ease of distribution.  There should be no parochialism in the establishment of industries.  I feel that industries which are established in the West are, perhaps, suited to the West and that industries that can be established in Limerick, for instance, are suited to Limerick and that an industrialist will not have his industry anywhere else because, perhaps, somebody can work up an opposition at a decided <Col N="1964" /> advantage in getting up to £50,000 by way of free grant.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people of Limerick and on behalf of my fellow-industrialists there, I want to welcome this Bill.  For some considerable time past, we have felt we were entitled to an extension of the Act that was in operation for years and, whether the benefit comes by way of an extension of that Act or through a new Bill, we welcome it.  We sincerely trust this Bill will be the means of bringing a number of industries to our country, thus providing more employment for those who need it.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that every city is catering for a quota of people from other parts of the country.  That is particularly so in relation to Dublin. People from all parts of the country are coming into Dublin and some of them are creating a problem.  Let us be fair and frank and open in this matter: there is no use in being parochial about it.</P>
    <P>We, in Limerick, felt we were entitled to encouragement in respect of the establishment of some industrial enterprise.  As an industrialist there, and having the honour to be a director of an industry which pays a substantial amount in wages, I may say that we look upon industry as being our national need.  I do not regard relief grants or relief works as an efficacious cure for unemployment.  Much lip-service has been paid to relief grants in this House and as to what amount should be given in one area as against another.  Undoubtedly, relief grants are necessary when there is unemployment, but I feel that each and every section of the community should combine with the Government of the day&mdash; no matter what Government may be in office&mdash;to provide suitable and permanent employment for our people, so that, as time goes on, our children at least will be able to say that we used our experience and knowledge in a national effort to provide a livelihood for them in the land of their parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country, the mere mention of an industry has a great appeal to people in general.  The reason is obvious.  Everybody recognises that, without some addition to <Col N="1965" /> our agricultural economy, there is a poor prospect of maintaining the population here without a further dwindling.</P>
      <P>We propose to give money in a large way.  To my mind, to give £50,000 to establish an industry is dangerous.  It is dangerous in so far as the Government, having invested so much money in an industry, will be very careful to preserve that industry from any keen competition.  We may find, therefore, that our industries are restricted.  Our Government may find it necessary to protect their money by restricting, so far as they reasonably can, further competition from similar industries arising in the country.</P>
      <P>There is also the danger that people who get large sums of money to develop industries may be tempted to undertake schemes with prospects that are only transitory.  When such grants are being given, they are not confronted with the same necessity for founding an industry on a sound basis as are people when they are founding an industry largely on their own capital and initiative.  The same remarks about a happy-go-lucky system apply to our workers.  Our workers, who are mainly inexperienced in industrial undertakings, must, of stern necessity, train themselves in industry and build up valuable experience in it.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Afforestation Programme&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was proposed by Deputy MacBride on 21st November, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann considers that the aim of the afforestation programme of the State should be to plant a minimum of 1,000,000 acres at a rate of not less than 25,000 acres per year and requests the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of this minimum annual rate of plantation as soon as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate was resumed on the following <Col N="1966" /> amendment proposed by the Minister for Lands on that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann welcomes the very substantial progress in afforestation made since 1948 under the impetus of the forestry policy of the inter-Party Governments and agrees that hereafter there should be an annual increase of 2,500 acres in the rate of planting until an annual planting rate of 25,000 acres shall have been attained, whereupon consideration shall be given to the future rate of planting to be pursued, in the light of our forest and general economic requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House very much longer on this motion, inasmuch as, in effect, the Minister has accepted the annual target of 25,000 acres per year, provided that that target could be reached over the next three years by an annual increase in the present plantation rate of 2,500 acres.  As I explained when introducing the motion, those who have been working and pushing forestry ahead for a great many years have been doing so in the belief that it provides one of the simplest methods and one of the surest methods of expanding production and at the same time of providing employment, as well, of course, as providing the production of the raw material on which a great many industries can be based.  We have felt that this aspect had been neglected and that it was essential to reach the stage when we could, at least in a simple sector of our economy, plan for definite progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would much rather see a higher annual plantation rate than 25,000 acres, but I am prepared to accept this, and when we reach this target, to examine whether we should expand still further or not.  It has been the practice of those who did not really believe in afforestation to suggest that men like Mackey and others who have advocated afforestation, and that I and those who have been associated with me in pushing forestry forward, were idealists, idealists who lived with their <Col N="1967" /> heads in the clouds and who did not know what they were talking about. I challenge that.  I think that the many thousands of people who are deeply concerned about afforestation are not merely idealists but realists who realise that, by forestry, we can make a concrete contribution to our economic development.  Supposing we are idealists as well, is there anything wrong with being an idealist?  I readily confess that I am an idealist about many things.  I am an idealist about my religion and about my Church; I am an idealist about my country; I am an idealist, too, because I believe that, with proper economic development, this nation can be rendered prosperous. Those, I think, are good ideals to have. In regard to forestry, I believe in it as a practical proposition and, because of that and because of its value to our economy, I am an idealist and I make no apology for being an idealist in regard to forestry.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Afforestation Programme: Transfer of Responsibility&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the importance of afforestation to the national economy and of the necessity for securing a rapid expansion of the afforestation programme, Dáil Éireann requests the Government to examine the advisability of transferring the responsibility for the carrying out of the national afforestation programme to any one of the following: (1) a separate Ministry, (2) a separate State sponsored corporation analogous to Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., (3) a specially constituted forestry commission, (4) Bord na Móna; and Dáil Éireann requests the Government to report the result of such examination as soon as it is completed to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having, by the last motion, determined what our immediate objectives should be in regard to forestry, we felt it was <Col N="1968" /> desirable to ask the Government to examine the advisability of transferring the responsibility for the carrying out of the afforestation programme decided upon from the Department of Lands to one of four different bodies. I would prefer to set up a separate Ministry to deal with it, to set up an independent State corporation, analogous to Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., or to transfer it to a forestry commission somewhat analogous to the British Forestry Commission or, as a final alternative, to transfer it to Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this motion, I want first of all to make it quite clear that this motion is not intended to be a condemnation of either the present Minister for Lands or any of his predecessors. It is a motion which asks that the future carrying out of the forestry programme should be examined by the Government.  I will very briefly set forth the reasons which prompted us to put forward this motion.  Forestry carried on on a large scale, as we hope it will now be carried on, is really a vast commercial undertaking.  As it is, this year there will be some 5,000 men employed in forestry work.  The financial turnover will very shortly, I hope, run into over a couple of million pounds a year.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I do not believe that the Civil Service organisation was ever intended to undertake the carrying on of a vast business undertaking such as this, nor indeed, I should say, do we consider that the Civil Service organisation is competent to carry out work of this kind.  It was never intended that it should.  The Civil Service is obviously hemmed in by all kinds of very praiseworthy rules.  It has to follow a routine.  These rules and this routine probably would not be tolerated in any modern, up-to-date business undertaking.  I think it is not unfair to the Civil Service to say that, by and large, the business community would regard the Civil Service as being highly incompetent to carry out commercial undertakings.  It is not its function; it was never devised for that purpose.</P>
    <P>People are recruited into the Civil Service not because of their interest or <Col N="1969" /> ability in any field of Government administration but usually merely because of their clerical competence. Initiative and independence of thought and action are not encouraged in the Civil Service.  Naturally, the Civil Service maintains very strict discipline and it would be regarded as harmful to that discipline, I suppose, were civil servants encouraged to display any initiative or to adopt progressive business methods which would be adopted by business firms outside.</P>
    <P>I do not want on this occasion to widen the debate by having a discussion on our Civil Service in general, but I think I would be entitled to express the view that our own Civil Service organisation has not progressed with the times as much as in other countries.  It appears to me to be hemmed in by many rather outworn and old-fashioned bundles of red tape. Other countries, probably by having had to work under emergency conditions in wartime, and so on, were able to shed many of the cobwebs of red tape and green tape that we have maintained.</P>
    <P>Forestry carried on on a large scale of 25,000 acres a year, which means we will be planting 100,000 acres every four years, is a vast commercial undertaking. Apart from the planting of the timber and the maintenance, the question of the disposal of the proceeds from the forests would become increasingly important.  Frankly, I do not think our Civil Service is capable of handling problems connected with the disposal of the harvests which will come from our forests.  That is essentially a commercial undertaking.  A large-scale operation involving the employment of over 10,000 men in a few years' time is not the type of work for which our Civil Service was designed. The Governments responsible for the setting up of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, were all wise when they decided to set those bodies free from the trammels of the Civil Service.  All the arguments which can be advanced for keeping forestry within the Civil Service could have been advanced in regard to Bord na Móna.  It could have been said that the development of our bogs, of <Col N="1970" /> our turf, should have been left in the hands of the Department of Industry and Commerce, on the same basis as it could be said, as I presume it will be suggested, that forestry should be left in the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>I want to be as little controversial as possible in putting forward this motion.  I would like to see a motion of this kind agreed to by the House and I would like to see an objective examination of what is the best organisation to ensure the rapid and economic expansion of our forestry development; but let me say that the present Minister and, I think, each one of his predecessors, have, time after time, assured the House that the lack of progress in forestry was not due to lack of finance.  Over and over again, successive Ministers have told us that.  I presume the Ministers who tell us that are truthful men and are telling us what is the truth.  I presume they would not come here and misstate the position.</P>
    <P>If that is so, what is the cause of the slowness of the progress made?  All Parties not only in this Dáil but in every successive Dáil have vociferously proclaimed their adherence to forestry.  They said they want to see ie going ahead.  They said that the Government was prepared to make all the funds necessary available.  Yet the progress has been extremely slow.  I cannot help thinking that the progress has been made slow by reason of the fact that we are asking the Civil Service to carry out a large commercial undertaking which it was not fit or equipped to carry out.</P>
    <P>After all, put it this way.  When a young man decides to enter for the Civil Service, he sits for an examination for writing assistant or something like that, and then it is a matter of the toss of a coin whether he will be assigned to the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of External Affairs or the Department of Lands.  That does not seem to me to be the ideal method of recruiting the business executives of a vast undertaking such as forestry.</P>
    <P>Ministers come and Ministers go.  We <Col N="1971" /> all know in this House that no Minister is permanent.  It is probably just as well.  You have the different Ministers and again they have not any special training for their task.  The Ministers are transient heads of the Department; they are transient political heads of the Department.  A Minister may be full of good intentions about forestry, but he is not necessarily a good executive head.  I do not think that any of the Ministers who form our present Government claim to have any special qualifications to act as managing director of one of the biggest firms in the country which now employs 5,000 people and which in a few years' time will employ some 10,000 people, so that you cannot say that, even if the Civil Service is not the best machine, at least there is an active intelligent Minister at the head who will see that the work is done.  Every Minister has to work with the machine available to him.</P>
    <P>Having decided that forestry is essential and that we want to achieve the target of 25,000 acres within the next three years, surely we must now examine objectively what is the best way of ensuring that that afforestation programme will not only go ahead but go ahead in the most efficient and economic fashion possible.</P>
    <P>Again, without wishing to be overcritical of the Civil Service machine, I would say this: From my experience as a member of the public, from my experience as a lawyer, as a member of this House and from whatever experience I may have gained as a member of the Government, I cannot conceive of a less economic machine than the Civil Service.  It was not devised to be an economic machine.  In many respects, I think it can be said to be extremely wasteful.  It is hide-bound and tied up with all kinds of rules and regulations which may be extremely necessary in some Government Departments but which can only serve to retard commercial progress and also to increase, probably substantially, the costs of getting commercial objectives achieved.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should also refer.  I think I referred to <Col N="1972" /> it before in this House.  It is that afforestation depends very largely upon the technical staff and the proper relationship between the technical and the administrative staffs.  Until, I think, 1952, there was a Director of Forestry.  He retired in 1952 and we waited, but there was no Director of Forestry appointed.  Then I noticed that the usual Civil Service device was resorted to.  The post was left vacant, but there was another assistant secretary appointed to the Department.  I do not know whether another assistant secretary was necessary or not. Maybe he was, but I do know that we now have no Director of Forestry and I would have thought that a Director of Forestry was absolutely essential to ensure the planning and progress of large-scale afforestation.</P>
    <P>Many references were made in the course of discussions on afforestation to the Cameron Report, that is, the report made by an expert sent by the F.A.O. here to examine our afforestation programme and advise on it.  I think it has been overlooked that in his report Mr. Cameron advocated, I think, the establishment of a separate Ministry of Forests, which has been adopted in many other countries.  I think I should place on the records of this House what Mr. Cameron said in his report in that regard.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should say that he emphasised and attached a lot of importance to the need for continual financial support and says at page 26, paragraph 68 of his report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A great afforestation programme requires planning in advance and assurance of continuous availability of the necessary funds.  Expenditures year by year cannot be unduly varied to meet the exigencies of passing budgetary difficulties.  The yearly financial demands must be judged in the light of requirements for the whole 40-year programme. Temporary setbacks may well jeopardise the success of an undertaking on which the nation is committed to make capital investments over a term of years of the order of £100,000,000.  It is particularly stressed that large expenditures will be required as initial outlays for staff <Col N="1973" /> expansion, for mechanised equipment, for research, for housing and educational facilities.  The situation presents obvious dangers.  The best solution would appear to be enactment of legislation establishing at least a minimum financial commitment against yearly revenues to be included automatically in the budget of each fiscal year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then at page 27, paragraph 70, Mr. Cameron says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This report has stressed the fact that the issues involved in the Irish afforestation programme are of great importance to the nation.  They are political and social as well as technical, and can only be satisfactorily dealt with on the highest policy level.  Responsibility for the execution of the forestry programme in Ireland is at present vested in a Forestry Division, a branch of the Department of Lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the next sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A division of a Department cannot be expected to wield the authority, prestige and influence necessary for the satisfactory implementation of a national policy of such far-reaching importance.  Obviously a separate organ of Government of major importance needs to be established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 71 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two alternatives suggest themselves. The first is the creation of a Forestry Commission to which would be transferred all the functions now performed by the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands and the greatly enlarged activities which the expanded afforestation programme will entail.  There are precedents for this form of organisation in the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna, which are now functioning so satisfactorily in Ireland.  There are important advantages in the commission form of administration, including better continuity of policy, flexibility in financial matters, more freedom in staff arrangements, and perhaps better possibilities of resistance to the pressure of special interests.  From the technical standpoint of getting ahead with the programme, the commission <Col N="1974" /> approach would probably be the best.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 72 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The other alternative is the establishment of a separate Department of Forests with its own Minister as a member of the Government. The advantage of this arrangement would be that the political and social as well as the economic problems developing during the implementation of the programme could be presented directly to the Cabinet by the responsible Minister, who would also be a member of the Review Board proposed in Section 64 above.  Decisions reached would be thus at the highest policy level after due analysis of all implications. There would, therefore, be less danger of policy reverses as the result of the clamour of an uninformed section of the public or of the pressure of special interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Paragraph 75, we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately in Ireland as in other democratic countries there are difficulties inherent in a departmental form of organisation which tend to impede the undertaking of a major economic programme.  These relate particularly to obstacles imposed on the recruitment of staff, expenditures for capital investment, equipment, etc., because of the requirement for conformity with a multitude of regulations.  It is not unusual in many countries for Governments to set up boards and commissions and provide them with block grants as a means of getting ahead with a major undertaking rather than trust it to a Government department with the inherent delays from which departmental action must suffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We invited this expert to come over here to advise us on our forestry problem. He came here, spent some considerable time here, had full access to the Government, full access to the administration which is dealing with forestry, and it cannot be assumed that he lightly recommended that the present organisation should be changed, because that is the effect of his report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1975" /> He says at paragraph 76:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Forestry Division in Ireland has not been free from the frustrations of departmental procedure. The considered recommendations of technical experts, properly approved by the Minister for Lands, for the implementation of a programme for which funds have been voted by the Legislature are subjected to vexatious delays while the propriety of the expenditure is considered in the Department of Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do those paragraphs I have quoted really not provide the true explanation of the lack of progress in forestry in the course of the past 30 years?  Mr. Cameron is a very highly experienced public official employed by the United Nations, a life-long expert on forestry and on the administration of forestry programmes in different countries throughout the world.  We brought him here as an expert to advise us. His advice to us is, in effect, that the present system of organisation is unsatisfactory, that the Forestry Division has not been free from the frustration of departmental procedures, that it has been subjected to vexatious impediments. Possibly in very guarded language, I think Mr. Cameron has said far more than I have ever said against the present organisational set-up in regard to our forests.  I do not blame the civil servants involved; I do not blame the Department of Lands for it.  I merely say this: I do not think the Department of Lands was ever conceived as a satisfactory type of organisation for a huge business undertaking.</P>
    <P>There are four courses open and I have left these four open in the motion which I am submitting to the House. First of all, there is the possibility of establishing a separate Ministry to deal exclusively with forests.  By and large, from what I gathered from Mr. Cameron as a result of discussions with him and also from what I can gather from his report, he advises a separate Ministry of Forests.  He advises it for this reason, that he says the Minister in charge of the forests then has direct access to the Government <Col N="1976" /> for whatever funds are necessary and that, as forestry is his only assignment in the Government, he also has to make his name on forestry.  He favours it for that reason.  Personally, I am not particularly keen on the idea of a separate Ministry of Forestry.  I would prefer it, certainly, to the present set-up.  I think that the present position, in which forestry is the Cinderella of our Department of Lands, is not healthy for forestry.</P>
    <P>The second alternative would be the setting up of an independent board analogous to Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Irish Shipping, or any one of the many very successful State-sponsored corporations.  A proposal analogous to that is the proposal to set up a forestry commission more or less on the model of the British Forestry Commission in England, which has worked quite successfully. That would be the better alternative. The experience we have had of corporations such as the E.S.B., Bord na Móna, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, has been that these have been successful. I cannot for one instant believe that the tremendous job of work which Bord na Móna did in a short space of time would ever have been achieved if the development of turf had been left in the hands of civil servants and Government Departments.  A Government Department has not got the flexibility or the freedom of action necessary for a vast commercial undertaking.</P>
    <P>The fourth alternative&mdash;and, on the whole, that is the one which appeals to me most&mdash;is the transferring of the operations of the Forestry Division to Bord na Móna itself.  That solution appears to me to be probably the most satisfactory and the most efficient as well as the most economic.  In Bord na Móna we have an extremely competent, well-tried, State corporation which has achieved marvellous results, which is accustomed to handling large-scale works, which is accustomed to dealing with problems affecting the moving of earth, the drainage of land, the haulage of turf, the marketing of turf and the many other operations which relate to turf.  These operations may be analogous to the operations <Col N="1977" /> which our afforestation programme is bound to involve, from a commercial point of view&mdash;acquisition and draining of land, employment of seasonal labour, housing of labour, marketing of the produce from the forests.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna already has, if you like, the overhead machinery required and has the technicians on the mechanical side as regards drainage machinery, tractors and so on, but, more important than that aspect of it, the work of Bord na Móna dovetails in with the work of afforestation from a seasonal point of view.  Bord na Móna work is at its peak in summer time, when forestry is at its lowest point. Turf work is at its lowest point in the winter months, when forestry is at its peak.  By the integration of afforestation with the work of Bord na Móna, we could effect a substantial economy and secure a much greater degree of efficiency in the pursuit of our afforestation programme.</P>
    <P>I have absolutely no axe to grind in these things.  My only concern is to try to ensure that the very best machinery possible will be secured to achieve the programme which we are trying to implement.  In doing that, I must have regard to the lack of progress that has been made in the past and I want to ensure that we shall not tolerate that lack of progress in the future and that we will set up a machinery that will ensure that that lack of progress will never again occur and set up a machinery which will ensure that, from a commercial point of view, from the point of view of the utilisation of the timber, we will have a competent business organisation and not one which is subject to the vexatious frustrations referred to by Mr. Cameron in his report.</P>
    <P>I have spoken longer than I intended to, a Cheann Comhairle, but I should just like to say a couple of words about an amendment which has been tabled by Deputy Moylan.  Deputy Moylan has tabled an amendment which, in effect, suggests that, instead of my proposal, this whole question should be referred to a Select Committee of the House. I am sure it was not tabled with that intention but, frankly, I regard an amendment of that kind as a side-tracking <Col N="1978" /> move, as delaying action.  On consideration, I think Deputy Moylan should not move that amendment but should rather support me in the motion which I have put forward.</P>
    <P>The motion asks the Government to consider these questions and to report back to the Dáil.  It is time enough then, if Deputy Moylan feels that he wants a Select Committee to examine it, to make that proposition, but there is not a great deal of examination to be done.  We are asking the Government to consider the matter and to report back to us and at that time we can either accept or reject the view which the Government puts forward.</P>
    <P>In introducing this motion, I hope I have not trodden on sore corns.  Often, in the course of the years, we have had to engender a certain amount of heat in order to get things done, heat that has often provoked, probably, the Minister for Lands, whoever he happened to be, but that was done for the sole purpose of trying to get progress and I think we have got some progress as a result of it.  Now our only concern is to get the best machinery possible to carry out the afforestation programme that has been decided upon and to ensure that we will not be subjected to any more frustration or delays.</P>

      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;a Select Committee of Dáil Eireann, consisting of 15 members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, of whom five shall be a quorum, be appointed with power to send for persons, papers and records, to inquire into, consider and report upon the whole question of afforestation in relation to the national economy; to indicate, having regard to any social consequences, the objectives to be aimed at and the organisation and administration best calculated to attain these objectives; and to furnish their report to Dáil Eireann within six months from the date of their appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> Development of Irish forestry is, with me, a very serious subject.  I try to deal with it seriously in the House and anywhere I speak on it outside, but it is one of the canons of art that there shall be light and shade and even the most tragic drama has its lighter interludes.  I have a habit, and I believe it to be a salutary habit, of poking fun at myself.</P>
    <P>I have a habit, which may not always be a wise one for me, to tilt somewhat at the &ldquo;stuffed shirt&rdquo; mentality wherever I see it.  To give the Minister his due, he has learned to distinguish between words of serious import and those that are more lightly spoken.  He has developed a carapace of indifference against what might be regarded as unwise criticism.  There are other people in this House who, when under the punch, are unable to do so, who seem to be tremendously thin-skinned.  To-night, therefore, instead of trying to lighten the debate by any humour, I shall be entirely serious and deal objectively and earnestly with the motion and the amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride says&mdash;and has only repeated what he has said before&mdash; that the amendment was put down for the purpose of side-tracking the motion, by calling for a committee of inquiry.  Possibly Deputy MacBride has in mind the Emigration Commission or that famous one, the Milk Costings Committee.  Now I have not that in mind at all.  This idea of putting down an amendment for the purpose of side-tracking a motion such as Deputy MacBride's would be a wholly unworthy method of dealing with Deputy MacBride's motion.  The amendment is a considered one&mdash;set down by me and my late colleague&mdash; not to express complete disagreement with the motion but to suggest a complementary course that may, in our opinion, have very valuable results.</P>
    <P>In regard to the present forestry policy and the operation and administration of that policy, if we are to discover whether the views expressed by the critics are sound or otherwise, before we decide whether the facts <Col N="1980" /> confute or confirm the attitude of various forestry enthusiasts, we need to hold an inquiry into the facts of forestry.  The truth in regard to forestry, in my opinion, has not been elicited to any extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not fear that his acceptance of the amendment will prove any embarrassment to him or that its acceptance will be used by the people on this side of the House for any Party purposes.  We accept the fact that the Minister has shown himself to be deeply desirous of forestry progress.  We can assure him that our desire in relation to forestry is coincident with his.  We on this side of the House believe that a forest policy, properly designed and energetically pursued, will be productive of a sorely-needed and a very valuable national asset.  Our object in moving this amendment is to assure ourselves that such a policy is in operation or can be contrived.  May I say, Deputy MacBride's motion is worthy of serious consideration?  It gives voice to ideas that have been expressed elsewhere and it indicates, in a measure, the line of policy that it may be necessary to adopt at some stage in the future.  It may be desirable, even necessary, some time in the future to create an organisation analogous to one or other of those mentioned in the motion, when the work being done by the present system is sufficiently far advanced.</P>
    <P>I am fearful, of course, that the Minister might accept Deputy MacBride's idea of handing over forestry to Bord na Móna now.  The Government might be tempted, you know, with the opportunity of appointing a few more directors and it would be a good excuse to find a job for the pal. However, I would not like that Bord na Móna or any other organisation than the present one should be allotted the authority over forestry that is now in the hands of the Minister.  However, when the acquisition of the necessary land is nearing completion and when the time approaches for commercial undertakings in the timber market, then I think we might really consider the setting up of such an organisation. I think that then it will be imperative if we are to place forestry on a <Col N="1981" /> sound commercial basis.  I do not now see any reason why the Minister should not accept the idea of an inquiry such as the amendment suggests&mdash;not an immediate transfer of authority but a consideration for the future as to how forestry should be handled in this country.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at Deputy MacBride's criticism of the Civil Service.  Having some experience of the Civil Service and some experience of business, it does not seem to me that there is any reason on the part of the business men for contempt of Civil Service organisations. Deputy MacBride has mentioned Mr. Roy Cameron.  I often wondered why Mr. Roy Cameron gave us the advice he did.  There are business organisations in America controlling forests but those business organisations were able, by that big American system, to acquire, from the State, forests as a going concern, forests fully matured and fit to be exploited.  Having got these, they have been able by natural regeneration and proper felling to keep these forests as a going concern.  But, in general, the forests in America are under State control.</P>
    <P>All the intricate paraphernalia of equipment and staff, the provision of a scientist, a bacteriologist, a State forester are all under State control.  All these men are employed by the State on the wide stretches of forest owned by the United States.  The amount of forest in the hands of private enterprise in America is very small.  Mr. Roy Cameron, offering us certain advice, was at one disadvantage.  He did not know anything about Irish history. He knew nothing about the Irish system of tenure.  Again, commissions of the nature which Deputy MacBride is anxious to have are not very acceptable in the United States of America.  The Tennessee Valley Authority, having proved itself over all the years, is still under fire in America. Without any insult to Mr. Roy Cameron, I think I could say to him: &ldquo;Go back to America, examine the conditions there, and think again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride is talking to himself as far as I am concerned. I said that the creation of the organisation visualised in Deputy MacBride's motion is premature.  I think that the Minister might very definitely remember for the future that the longer we consider the more certain we are at arriving at a wise decision as to the eventual control of forestry.</P>
      <P>My amendment is directed to securing a real forestry development.  It is directed to reassuring the public mind in regard to forestry.  We want to discover what is the value of the work already done and the work in progress. We know that, in every undertaking of such a nature as forestry, there are bound to be as many failures as successes and we look for information with regard to definite failures in forestry operations.  We want to know what lessons have been learned and we want to know what remedies are being used.</P>
      <P>Mark you, any observations I have to make in relation to failure in the operations of the Forestry Branch do not constitute an attempt either to pillory the Minister or attack his officials.  It is only right, however, that there should not be a dark brotherhood inside the Forestry Branch. We here in the Dáil and the people throughout the country should know what the problems are.  We should have an assurance that they are being adequately tackled.  We have not got that.  In a business like forestry, where so much public money is being expended, and the only defence of which is its ultimate national value, the public should be assured about the work accomplished.  All the Minister's efforts are futile and unavailing if we are not directing our minds solely to the production of commercial timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride used a term during our discussion last week which caused me some uneasiness; he spoke of social forestry.  Now, social forestry has the same connotation for me as social silage, and I have the same use for it. I will admit that an unanswerable case could be made for the planting of trees for scenic purposes, but it seems to me that that is not the business of the Forestry Branch, or, if the responsibility <Col N="1983" /> for such planting is thrust upon them, the work should be completely distinct in the matter of finance and control from the ordinary question of the growing of commercial timber.</P>
    <P>Our problem is, indeed, solely one of the production of timber for sale on the public market.  Social forestry might very well be something of a smokescreen for failure.  I want the public told what success we have had in the production of commercial timber, and nothing else.  Again, the public should be told what preparations are now being made and what preparations have been made for the commercialisation of the product and the development at all its stages of the processing and preparation of timber for the public market.</P>
    <P>I like these pretty exhibits, Japanese trees in pots, shown at the Royal Dublin Society Show&mdash;very pretty&mdash; but I have been urging for years on the Minister, and I hope that he has taken my advice in the matter, the showing of seasoned, prepared Irish timber in order to demonstrate to the public that Irish timber, properly prepared, kiln dried and dressed, is as good as any similar product produced anywhere in the world.  I would suggest, if the Minister accepts my amendment&mdash;Deputy MacBride opposes it&mdash; that, instead of the disasters of the Milk Commission and the Emigration Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not know much about money.  I think we could make a success of a round-table conference.  It would be well if, instead of a motion from Deputy MacBride and an amendment from Deputy Moylan, the Minister would take us somewhat into his confidence and give us some indication of his plans.  The Minister is, of course, a political partisan and he is invariably on the defensive, even when he should not be.  If we had a discussion, such as I visualise, we would make possible a real inter-Party report&mdash;not one of these Coalition affairs.  We would have a report which would be entirely unbiassed and objective, untainted <Col N="1984" /> by any Party considerations. Such a report would make forestry an approved national matter, a thing that all of us who believe in forestry sincerely want.  However I may disagree with Deputy MacBride, I do not disagree with him at any point in his view that we need a progressive forestry policy.  I do not&mdash;I want to assure him of this very definitely now &mdash;disagree with his view as to what the annual rate of planting should be. My only reservation in regard to the rate of planting is the question of the intake of land.  I know how difficult it is, and the Minister knows that the intake of land is the controlling factor. We have had some advance in the matter of acquiring land during recent years because of certain legislation passed, because of the advent of machinery, but I am still worried in case the amount of land we are getting will not be sufficient to allow us to plant 25,000 acres per year.  Deputy McQuillan has a method of securing the land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The method of securing the land is not relevant on this motion.  It would have arisen on the previous motion on forestry, but not on this one, which deals with the question of setting up special boards to deal with the matter of afforestation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  I would say to the Minister and to Deputy MacBride that every Party in the Dáil has expressed its belief in forestry and I do not think anybody here has expressed the view that we are not right in attempting to plant 25,000 acres a year.  The only words we have heard in the Dáil from every Party are words of condemnation because there has been slackness and laziness in the production of our forest timber.  Some of us Deputies have striven to inform ourselves on forestry facts, but even those who have done so have very little or no practical experience of forestry, without which the widest reading is not sufficient, and the criticism of the Minister and the majority of his predecessors has been based rather on uninformed enthusiasm than on a clear understanding of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> Like Deputy MacBride, I do not deprecate idealism.  When idealism is really idealistic, it knows what it is being idealistic about, but many people who talk about forestry have no notion of what the problems of forestry are.  I think from the point of view of forestry the acceptance of the amendment for the purpose of ascertaining the facts and so informing the public and creating a fully informed public opinion would be of immense advantage to the Minister in trying to develop forestry for which he is now responsible.  My practical experience of forestry is very limited.  During the war years when I was with the Department of Lands the amount of planting which was possible was very limited and, of course, because of that, it was made the subject of innumerable jokes and jibes by Deputy MacBride and others and I think even Deputy Flanagan joined in with his little bugle.</P>
    <P>At that time it seemed to me and the Department of Lands that a forestry policy was empirical rather than scientific, and I do not blame the critics because it seems to me that progress was achieved in forestry as a result of external pressure and criticism rather than because of precise planning and foresight on the part of our forestry experts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the future, and somewhat in support of Deputy MacBride's view, our concern must not be merely with the planting of trees but with every aspect of the tree until it becomes a marketable product.  I do not suggest for a moment that the Department is blameworthy in not having heretofore evolved such a policy.  That the Department can be completely concerned with the acquisition of land for planting to the practical exclusion of all else is quite understandable. Some of the enthusiasts and idealists will not understand that, but it is true.  I think the Department must accept the fact that one of these days the ambit of responsibility of those in charge of forestry must be very greatly widened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> I would suggest, if the amendment is accepted, that those who move it will have provided for them a subject matter for their work.  I think it is only reasonable that we who move the amendment should indicate in broad outline the main points for elucidation and decision.  We who favour forestry believe it will be really valuable and, in economic matters, it is wise to transmute belief into certainty.  We have no compelling evidence in support of our beliefs.  Forestry in Ireland is the subject of urban enthusiasm and rural indifference, even of rural opposition, and if we are to undertake forestry on a scale adequate to supply our own needs and with the least disturbance of our agricultural economy, we must have the support of the public, and the first question the public will ask is: &ldquo;Does forestry pay? Is it a profitable undertaking?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Taking a rough average of expenditure on planted acreage, we may compute the initial cost of an acre of forest at £40.  Maintenance over the years and interest on invested capital must also be considered, and, at the end of 40 years, an acre of forest has cost £300.  Of course, this is a very rough estimate, but let us assume for a moment that it is roughly correct. There are various estimates of the value of an acre of forest.  It should be the first duty of any committee of inquiry to ascertain the financial facts, as far as they are ascertainable, and to secure information as to how costs may be lowered and returns increased, and to discover from the experience of those in charge of forestry the possibility of being able to say to the public: &ldquo;Irish forestry is a sound business proposition which will provide an adequate return for capital invested in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our first duty in this matter should be to inquire into the facts of forestry finances and to let the public know the result.  I have spoken on land acquisition already; I have been told I may not speak about it to-night, but I should like to say that I do know it is really the controlling factor in the problem of forestry.  No other problem is so great, so intricate, so difficult.  It is one of the problems to which Mr. <Col N="1987" /> Roy Cameron and other experts directed their attention.</P>
    <P>I have urged the Minister to devote more attention to forestry publicity.  I am afraid we are keeping the public at arm's length and in ignorance.  Forestry publicity has been at a minimum over the years.  We have never used the radio, the cinema; we have not even approached the schools.  We promote no lectures on forestry throughout the country and have never sought the cooperation of any outside organisation.</P>
    <P>Again, the matters of forestry research and education need examination. I spoke of the number of foresters, soil scientists, bacteriologists employed by the United States of America in their State forests.  I doubt if we have any soil scientists employed in our forests; I doubt if we have any bacteriologists.  The only bacteriologist I ever saw operating in the Department's woods was a bird, a very valuable bird, but it is about time we had a man to examine the real effects of the vermin that bird picks up.</P>
    <P>I think the question raised by Deputy Tully the other night is one that we should examine, if we are to have real progress in the country.  I am afraid I have been a bit long-winded. I should like to say that we in public life have been blamed and we blame each other for our lack of accomplishment over the past 30 years.  Eaten bread is very soon forgotten, even by people who should know better.  I think we have in forestry, if tackled properly, a very valuable opportunity for the refutation of the charges made against us.  It is an undertaking in which we can ignore Party affiliations and in which we can operate entirely clear of Party politics.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept the view that the assistance of all Parties in the Dáil is at his disposal. We all want to make the work for which he is now responsible an outstanding success.  I think, however, that a committee of inquiry into the facts surrounding forestry, into the things that are being hidden even from Deputies, the things that the public are not being told, would do very good <Col N="1988" /> work.  There are things about which there is no reason the public should not be informed.  The public need the assurance that the work of the Forestry Division is valuable work and that it is being tackled properly.</P>

Deputy Moylan has made a plea for the acceptance of his amendment, but he did not convince me there was a case for it. Deputy MacBride spoke at length on the motion and did not convince me that he had a case.  As a rule, on motions such as these, the movers state their cases and give reasons why the terms of their motions should be put into operation.  I have listened as patiently as I could here, but I have heard no case put forward.  Deputy Moylan suggested in the latter part of his speech that there are things the public do not know, that there were things they should be told.

Let me say I am quite willing to reveal anything about forestry. I agree there is no need to hide any of the facts in relation to forestry, but as far as I am concerned there is nothing hidden.  There is nothing in forestry on which I would endeavour to deny information to any member of the House or the public.  If there is anything, I am not aware of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride made four suggestions in his motion: he wanted a separate Ministry, a separate State sponsored corporation analogous to Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., a specially constituted Forestry Commission, or Bord na Móna to look after the work now being done by the Forestry Division. I want to ask Deputy MacBride one question.  Having regard to the sweeping powers Bord na Móna have of acquiring land of any kind for their purposes, I wonder did Deputy MacBride realise the full gravity of his suggestion, that the work of the division should be handed over to Bord na Móna.  Supposing Dáil Éireann agreed to-night that the work of the Forestry Division should be handed over to Bord na Móna, with all the powers that Board now has, does the Deputy realise what that would mean?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach the subject matter of the Minister's answer to this question by, as far as I can, trying to put myself in the Minister's own position in such matters.  I notice that at the end of his answer the Minister spoke of his concern to protect, shall I say, certain sponsors of industry. I have a great deal of sympathy with him in his approach to this, but my reason for raising the matter on the Adjournment is another matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actually, I have no interest in whatever individual, person or name may be concerned in this matter at all, nor do I seek, in itself, to elicit that fact. The point I do seek to elicit and do wish to bring out is that a ministerial act of the granting or the non-granting of a licence, <i>per se</i>, is an act in public administration for which the Minister should be answerable, I submit, in regard to a question.  I will go this distance with the Minister.  If the Minister claims that the proceedings of the Industrial Development Authority should be privileged under Section <Col N="1991" /> 9 of that Act&mdash;and I think he quoted that in his reply&mdash;and treated as a document of the Minister, I freely concede that.  I also think it only right that the Minister, including his document, should have privilege in relation to negotiations with him and matters of that sort: otherwise, business could not be done.  A question of principle, however, arises when it comes to the actual executive act of the granting or not granting of such a thing as a licence, where the Minister in his capacity as Minister through that very act will, in fact, confer a pecuniary benefit, or what may be a pecuniary benefit, on any individual, interest or person, where he may also refuse&mdash;for good reasons&mdash;I am not impugning in any sense the reasons for the decision &mdash;to give that pecuniary benefit to, say, some other citizen or citizens and thereby create a situation in principle where some group of citizens may, at the Minister's discretion, be favoured as against another group of citizens.</P>
    <P>I submit in the public interest, and as a matter of high public importance, that the Minister should answer such a question.  I grant him he may very well limit it.  If the Minister were to argue: &ldquo;All right.  I will say that that act was done, that that licence was granted, and I will reveal the terms and the nominee of that licence,&rdquo; that is all, I think, that could be asked of him.  The negotiations of the others are not <i>ad rem</i> perhaps.  I submit that, in the work of a democratic Parliament within the terms of the Order that says: &ldquo;Questions addressed to a member of the Government must relate to public affairs connected with Departments or matters of administration for which he is officially responsible,&rdquo; a question of principle arises if the Minister grants a licence or a concession which carries with it some pecuniary interest, and the grant of an export licence in its very nature, whether it is used or not&mdash;again, I am arguing in principle: I am not interested in the particular case here, nor do I wish to press the Minister if the Minister does not wish to be pressed in the particular details&mdash; carries that implication.  The point I want to make very clear is that when <Col N="1992" /> a Minister for State has the power to give a licence to A and refuse a licence to B, when a Minister for State can, by virtue of his authority and as Minister, perform a ministerial act which thereby will very directly give a pecuniary, a money interest or advantage to specified groups of citizens, or a citizen or a firm, and at the same time refuse such a similar thing to other groups of citizens or another citizen or another firm, I think it is a matter of public importance and that is the reason why I raise it in principle on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>It might be different if it were something like an automatic thing, say, a driving licence.  A person gets a driving licence, unless he is disqualified. Take a driving licence straightaway. Supposing I applied for a driving licence and was arbitrarily refused the licence.  I know there are remedies in the law but, supposing it was through some ministerial action that I was arbitrarily refused it, would the Minister who did that not be amenable to this House and answerable for that?  That is the net point I want to make in, I hope, a sober and responsible manner.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficult problems for the Department.  I want to give the Minister scope and I want to protect the other things that are there, and particularly we should be jealous in this House to protect the citizens or ourselves from abuse of the process of the House; but will the Minister not agree with me in principle that where he can give to any one he chooses who applies to him an export licence or some other similar concession&mdash;and it is very much in the power of a Mini ster of State nowadays and particularly a Minister for Industry and Commerce to do that&mdash;and, at the same time, refuse other citizens and therefore exercise a preference, is there not a principle involved there and is it not highly desirable that the Minister should frankly disclose, on request, such matters to the House of Parliament to which he is responsible?  In saying that, there is not a tittle of a suggestion that the Minister or his Department would in any way abuse that process.  I am making that completely clear in this matter.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will, on reflection, <Col N="1993" /> see the force that caused me to intervene on this question in which I had absolutely no interest whatever to-day. I want to take the Minister's answer to me in regard to that.  I think he was misinformed or that he did not convey his meaning across the House.  He quoted the I.D.A. as a reason for not doing it.  I understand he referred to Section 9 of the Industrial Development Authority Act.  With the permission of the Chair, I will read that section.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo; The authority shall not, without the consent of the Minister, disclose any document in their custody or under their control, production of which is sought in relation to any legal proceeding, and the Minister may claim the like privilege in respect of the document as if it were in his own custody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very proper procedure.  The Minister can claim privilege for these documents as if they were his own and, of course, he can claim privilege for his own.  If I sought to get particulars of negotiations or applications, or something of that nature, from the Minister here, the Minister would be entitled to tell me that I was not entitled to that answer.  But it is not the Industrial Authority that makes the decisions.  It is not the Industrial Authority that creates an export, an import, or an other kind of licence carrying pecuniary value.  It is a ministerial act and it is the Minister who, in his capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, exercises this act, by and with the authority of Dáil Eireann, and my plea therefore that, in principle, these questions should be answered must, I think, be heeded.  To clear up the matter, I do know that under the ordinary rules of procedure it is no function of the Chair&mdash;if the Chair will allow me to make the observation to complete the picture&mdash; to charge or compel a Minister to make an answer.  I also know that the proper way of compelling a Minister to answer is by motion, that is, also within the rules of order.</P>
    <P>If you are going to create, as a ministerial act under legislation of this House, licences or concessions for one group which are not automatically <Col N="1994" /> available to another group, and where you can refuse another group, all for good reasons, I think the Minister should be amenable to answer and the public will not understand why such answers are not given.  Public confidence in Dáil Éireann and in the Government is founded on disclosures and full confidence in the public and, of course, due responsibility on the part of Deputies also.  There is public confidence also in the Civil Service of this State and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to its integrity which, I do not think, can be beaten by any other Civil Service in the world.  The standard is extraordinarily high, but it helps to maintain the integrity of the Civil Service if such matters are disclosed publicly and are answerable here in this House.</P>
    <P>I will now sum up as I must give time to another Deputy who wishes to add a few points to what I have said. My point is that disclosures are in the public interest, even if it is only to allay suspicions.  I intervened on this question only as a result of the Tánaiste's answer to a supplementary question, where I saw a matter of principle and of public importance involved. I was sure that the Tánaiste would be as anxious as myself, or as any other Deputy, to make full and public disclosures.  I would like to stress this point of public interest.  I also want to point out categorically that the suggestion that the Minister is precluded by legislation, and in particular by Section 9 of the Industrial Development Authority Act, from giving the information here does not hold water.  There is no legislation preventing the Minister from making disclosures in this House, as no legislation can prevent him from giving information to Dáil Éireann.  No legislation can prevent a Minister from making a statement in this House.  I doubt if any legislation would be valid if it attempted to do that, within the terms of the Constitution which give an absolute privilege here.</P>

      <P>I put down this question in the public interest and in pursuance of what I felt to be my duty as a Deputy.  I put it down on behalf of vested interests.  Vested interests are very much concerned with the issue of this licence.  The Native Timber Merchants' Association have sent a deputation to the Minister's Department in connection with it.  They consulted me on this matter.  To-day the Minister could not tell me where these 220 logs of ash, oak and sycamore were exported from.  I think he did not answer the questions I put to-day, either the question or the supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that prior to April last a similar licence was issued for the export of 80 logs for a similar purpose. It is also a fact that such logs have been exported for manufacture into veneer for the past 25 to 30 years and the manufactured veneer returned to this country.  The people engaged in this business were alarmed and were very doubtful about the reason given by the Minister previously and, again now, for the issue of the licences.  I feel that the Minister should to-night give a full and detailed answer to the questions I put to-day and clear up the matter in the public interest, which is the only reason that I put down this question and I am not, as was alleged here by Deputy Tully, a &ldquo;stooge&rdquo; for anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deal with this matter in the most impartial and dispassionate way, because, in the first instance, I did not handle the matter. It was handled by an acting Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say impassioned or dispassionate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Dispassionate.  The I.D.A. were charged by the Government with the task of bringing about a situation by which we could make veneers here and possibly establish a plywood industry.  The importance of these two industries may be gauged from the fact that the annual average imports of veneers are worth about <Col N="1996" /> £60,000 and the average annual imports of plywood are in the vicinity of £630,000.  The I.D.A. were charged with the responsibility of trying to get some group interested, either on their own or with an outside group, to build up an industry for the manufacture of veneers and plywood.</P>
      <P>One approach was made to the I.D.A. with a view to having this matter considered and in the light of the possibilities of establishing an industry here.  Proposal No. 1 fell to the ground&mdash;nothing came of it.  Another effort was made with another group. The first group was an internal group; the second was an external group.  The I.D.A. negotiated with them on that matter.  They, too, evaporated and nothing came of the proposal.  Then the I.D.A. received a proposal from an existing timber industry here for the purpose of establishing what they said was a veneer industry.  That was discussed with the I.D.A. at length.  This was the only proposition left after the other two propositions had evaporated.</P>
      <P>This industry represented to the I.D.A. that they were willing to join with another group outside the country in the establishment of a veneer mill here.  They mentioned that the capital required would be in the vicinity of £140,000 and the question depended on the quantity and the quality of Irish timber which would be available for making veneers.  The Irish group said they wanted to send out of the country for testing some sample lots of oak, sycamore and ash to have these cut into veneers, so as to ascertain what the quality of those butts were when processed for the purpose of veneers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of their discussions with the Industrial Development Authority seeking a permit to export those butts for veneer manufacture, they said that all hardwoods grown in Ireland were subject to the following conditions unusual for Europe, that there was a low light factor and a high moisture content and that there was a possibility that hardwoods closely grown under these conditions might fracture when being finely cut on the veneer knife.  They said that, before cutting suitable hardwoods to veneer, <Col N="1997" /> the timber must be subjected to a high temperature to give it the necessary strength for cutting by the fusing of the eyes in the timber grain and the annual rings, and that the possibility and the degree of fusing of Irish oak, sycamore and ash must be determined before anybody could make up his mind as to the suitability of Irish timber.</P>
    <P>They also said that, in addition to Irish hardwoods being grown subject to a low light factor and a high moisture factor, they were also grown on a soil generally with a limestone basis and that it must be determined whether the alkaline content of the soil could have the effect of discolouring the veneer blue or tones of blue in the manufacture of high quality furniture when subjected to heat, high pressure and the use of chemicals and adhesives. They wanted to ascertain whether Irish oak would warp or bulge when used for the final manufactured article.  They said it must be determined whether it is possible to impart to veneers of Irish oak, sycamore and ash a fine surface on finishing similar to that possessed by French veneers from these timbers.</P>
    <P>They required permission to export 600 hardwood butts from various parts of the country so as to see whether the butts from different parts had different characteristics.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, who were consulted, verified that they had no literature about veneer logs but that it was known that the quality of logs for veneer purposes varied as between log and log much less between area and area.  It was on the basis of all these pleas they set out on technical grounds that the Industrial Development Authority recommended to the Department of Industry and Commerce that they should give a licence not to export, as they asked, 600 but to export 300, and the licence to export 300 was duly issued.  If there was any money for them in this, they would clearly have exported the whole 300, but what have they done?  They have exported only 94.  A quantity of 150 for which one licence was issued was not exported at all because the timber which they exported was, I think, winter-felled timber and they <Col N="1998" /> wanted to get summer-felled timber to see whether that had the same characteristics.</P>
    <P>The Forestry Section was consulted before the licence was issued and they said that they saw no objection to the issue of an export licence for 300 tree butts, pointing out that, as the export would be non-recurrent, it would have no appreciable effect on the home supply of hardwoods.  Having, therefore, got the view of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, having got the view of the Forestry Section, the Industrial Development Authority, which is a State-sponsored body, consisting of responsible directors, said to the Department: &ldquo;We recommend that a licence should be granted for the export of these timbers in order to try them out and let us settle once and for all whether butts got in this way from this timber would make suitable veneer tested under the latest methods of producing high-grade veneers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was only in those circumstances that the Department issued a licence for their export.  The Department took the view, while the Industrial Development Authority is the responsible body, it is charged with getting the mill set up.  It looked at the thing from a national point of view and said that the licence should be issued.</P>

      <P>The licence was issued to the firm, not to individuals.  No individual got the licence and, while the firm sought a licence to export 600 and were finally given only 300, in fact they exported only 94.  If there were fortunes to be made out of it, would you not imagine that the 300 would go out immediately?  Let me deal with this one other point.  It has never been the practice in the Department of Industry and Commerce to give the names of persons to whom licences are issued. They have never been disclosed.  That has been the invariable and traditional practice in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

That has been long-standing practice.  My predecessor took the same view as I have in respect of this matter.  In this case the circumstances were more unusual still because, if the name was disclosed, it would be disclosed who was promoting the veneer mill in this country and the Industrial Development Authority, which has responsibility in this matter, came to the conclusion that the identity of the sponsors of the veneer mill project should not be disclosed.  In the same way, if I were asked to-morrow by a Deputy, whether on this bench or that bench, who was going to establish such and such an industry, that information, being private and confidential, we would decline to disclose.  To disclose who exported these butts of timber would disclose at once in the context of this question who was starting, or hoped to start, the veneer mill here.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council applied on the 27th September, 1956, for approval to the borrowing of £15,700 from the Local Loans Fund to finance the erection of ten houses in Donegal town.  Consideration of the application has been deferred until the council's proposal in regard to the acceptance of a tender for the scheme has been examined.  A proposal to accept a tender was received in my Department on the 5th October last and on the 18th of that month the council were asked to furnish a report on the effect of rock excavation on the tender prices.

      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I am not so aware.  Donegal County Council applied on the 27th September, 1956, for permission to borrow £9,200 from the Local Loans Fund to finance the erection of six houses at St. Johnston. Consideration of the application is deferred pending a decision on the council's proposal to accept a tender for the scheme.  A proposal to accept a tender for the erection of the six houses was received in my Department on the 3rd October last.  On 11th October, the council were requested to furnish details of the existing housing conditions of the persons to be rehoused in the scheme.  When these details have been submitted there will be no avoidable delay in issuing a decision on the council's proposals regarding acceptance of a tender and the raising of a loan.</P>

      <P>Plans for the building of 84 houses at Lucan were submitted to my Department on the 4th May, 1956.  An examination of current housing needs carried out by officers of the county council and the Department indicated that approximately 40 houses would meet the urgent requirements of the area.  It was, accordingly, considered that the scheme should be confined to the provision of not more than this number initially, and that the position could be examined afresh when these houses had been completed and let.  Certain improvements in the lay-out were also suggested to the council.  A revised plan for the scheme, which was submitted to the Department on 21st November, is at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6th December, 1956.</P>
