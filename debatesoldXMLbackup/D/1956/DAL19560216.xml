      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the importance of industrial development and exports, he will state what steps he has taken, and proposes to take, to ensure that the Moulded Products Factory, Tralee, which employs 145 workers, does not go out of production.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that one week's notice, to expire on the 17th instant, has been served by the management on the staff and operatives, numbering 145, of the Moulded Products Factory, Tralee, and, if so, what steps, if any, he has taken and is taking to safeguard the employment of the workers involved.</P>

      <P>With the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>As shown in the report of An Foras Tionscal for the year ended 31st March, 1955, a grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, was made to the company referred to in the questions. I understand that the company has also received a loan from the Industrial Credit Company, Limited.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to consider sympathetically any reasonable proposal which the company may wish to put forward with a view to maintaining production and thus avoiding disemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I understand that the <Col N="496" /> company engaged an industrial consultant to carry out a survey of the cause for the economic difficulty in which it finds itself at the moment.  In the light of that and in the light of the fact that his report will be available in a day or two, would the Minister consider requesting the company to withdraw the notices issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Film Industry Inquiry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether an inquiry has been held in recent <Col N="497" /> years into the whole question of the film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No official inquiry into the whole question of the film industry has been made in recent years.  The desirability of developing a film industry has not, however, been overlooked and, at my request, the National Film Institute of Ireland some time ago convened a representative meeting of film interests to consider the possibility of developing a film industry here.  I understand that consideration of the matter by the interests concerned is proceeding and that their views will be conveyed to me in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that on the 23rd November, 1950, his predecessor in office assured the House that an inquiry was going on into the whole question of the film industry within the Department of Industry and Commerce?  Is he aware further, that on the 14th December of the same year the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce reiterated what he had said earlier in November, that a large scale inquiry was under way in order to ensure that, with regard to newsreels for a start, news of Irish interest and with a slant on Irish life would be shown in our cinemas? In view of that inquiry which was taking place, would the Minister tell the House what the result of the inquiry was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wanted detailed information of that kind, I think he should have phrased the question differently.  There was a departmental inquiry undertaken in 1938 in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information about the 1950 inquiry except that this is a matter which has from time to time been looked at by the Department. No definite steps were taken in the matter.  I felt we ought to begin some place and recently I asked the National Film Institute of Ireland to convene a meeting of the variety of interests affected in this matter.  They held that meeting and the committee is <Col N="498" /> functioning.  I expect to get a report in due course and then we will have a look at the matter in the light of the report submitted by the committee. This is the latest position in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a clash with regard to the information available to the Minister and the information conveyed to the Dáil by his predecessor.  I refer him to the actual dates&mdash;the 23rd November and the 14th December.  My question asks whether an inquiry has been held in recent years.  I do not think that 1950 is away back in the distant past.  Surely, if his predecessor in this House stated that an inquiry was going on into the whole question of the film industry, the inquiry has now finished and the results should be made known to this House&mdash; or has the Minister been misinformed by his advisers in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably reading into what was said something more than was intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was this formal inter-departmental inquiry in 1938.  A report was made by the committee then established in 1942.  Since then, there has been no further inquiry into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the President of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers at the recent annual meeting of the federation drew attention to the deep water facilities of Blacksod Bay, County Mayo, in connection with the establishment of any industry that would require the importation of raw materials from the U.S.A., and, if so, if he will draw the attention of persons interested to the suitability of this area for the establishment of a major industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the suggestion made by the President of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers. Should I receive any industrial proposal in which a site involving deep water facilities is being sought, I shall arrange, through my Department and the Industrial Development Authority, to direct the promoters' attention to Blacksod Bay and other areas having similar facilities.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be for the promoters of any particular project to consider what factors, as well as deep water facilities, would determine the choice of location.</P>

To this end I have asked the farmers of the country to collaborate in a five-year plan (1) to raise the cow and heifer population to 2,000,000; (2) to increase our output <Col N="504" /> of pigs; (3) to extend our tillage; (4) to improve our grassland.  To these ends, I have asked farmers in respect of (1) where they kept five cows heretofore, to keep seven in future, and those who kept ten, to keep 14, and those who kept 20, to keep 28; and if their equipment makes it impossible for them to milk the extra cows at present, then they should let the calves milk them, and they will find this a most profitable investment.  Those who have land suitable for sheep should increase their flocks.  It is now possible for every farmer to protect his live stock from contagious abortion, white scour, fluke and other parasitic diseases, and farmers should consult their veterinary surgeons so as to ensure that they suffer no loss from these causes in the future.  In regard to (2) I have asked farmers to breed more pigs and to feed them on barley grown on their own holdings and with skim milk, or, where that is not available, a suitable animal protein supplement.</P>
      <P>I have directed the attention of farmers to the guaranteed prices available for wheat, beet and feeding barley and I have urged them to collaborate with the agricultural instructors and parish agents for the improvement of their grasslands, with special emphasis on the need for the use of greater quantities of lime, phosphate, potash and nitrogen.  I believe that if all farmers will collaborate in this programme, we have every reason to anticipate the satisfactory increase in our agricultural output for which, I feel sure, the Deputy shares my hopes.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this sheet, published by the Central Statistics Office, shows that his activities during the last 12 months&mdash; ably helped by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I must admit&mdash; succeeded in giving the farmers a reduction in their income of between £15,000,000 and £16,000,000?  Is he aware that this sheet shows a reduction in every branch of tillage and in live stock, and the only thing left for the Minister now is to travel around with a shepherd's crook looking after the extra sheep?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering these two people applied for these pensions <Col N="507" /> roughly two and a half years ago, is it possible that the Minister will state now that we may even continue for several years with these unfortunate people still wondering whether they will ever get one penny under an Act passed here a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is bound, under an Act passed here some years ago, to observe the statutory obligations laid down in the Act.  I cannot avoid the statutory regulations laid down in that Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister used the words &ldquo;an unnecessary&rdquo; or &ldquo;undue delay&rdquo;, is it correct to say that what is wrong is that we have a shortage of certain officials in the section of his Department which is the vital section so far as this matter is concerned, and that that shortage has been, not just for the last year and a half or year and nine months, but for three or four years back and it is that which is holding up these applications?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the estimated annual cost which would be incurred as a result of the provision of link-call facilities at Valentia for the improvement of radio-telephone communications with ships at sea and the annual number of calls which it is estimated would be made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he has received a communication from the Cork Harbour Commissioners regarding the existing difficulties of radio-telephone communications with ships at sea and advocating the provision of link-call facilities at Valentia; whether such calls must at present be routed through Lands-End, and whether, in view of the fact that it is desirable that this country should have its own service, he will make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Representations have been made by the Cork Harbour Commissioners for the provision of link-call facilities with ships at sea at Valentia Coast Radio Station and they have been informed that the service would not at present be warranted.</P>
      <P>It would not, in fact, be practicable to provide telephone link-call facilities with the type of equipment at present in use at Valentia Coast Radio Station. Renewal of this equipment is now due and in this connection it may be possible to provide facilities for link-telephone calls on an economical basis in the new equipment.  The matter will be examined in due course.  Meanwhile it is not possible to estimate either the additional cost that would be involved or the additional traffic that might ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Link-telephone calls between this country and ships at sea are routed via British radio stations.  The number of calls made is negligible&mdash;only about two or three per week.  These link-telephone <Col N="513" /> calls, as well as foreign telephone calls generally, are routed via the British system because it is more economical to handle the small volume of calls in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Major underground schemes are in progress in the city and suburbs to provide additional underground cables, shortage of which has been and is the main cause of delay in installing telephones in Dublin.  All practicable steps to expedite the work, including the employment of contractors to supplement the Department's efforts are being taken.</P>
      <P>The information requested in the second part of the question is as follows:&mdash;(a) 892; (b) 1,738; (c) 718.</P>

      <P>The arrangements on the Feale are the same as on the other arterial drainage schemes, namely (1) first aid kits are readily available, (2) reasonable absence with pay is allowed to a worker who wishes to obtain medical treatment, (3) in a case of serious injury medical aid is summoned or the injured worker is conveyed to a doctor or to hospital.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the <Col N="520" /> reason for the reduction in the supplementary grant for road improvement to Mayo County Council from £22,500 in 1954-1955, to £7,500 in 1955-1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main and county road improvement grants, including supplementary grants, notified to the Mayo County Council represented a net increase of £3,100 for 1955-56 over 1954-55.  The reduction in the supplementary grant referred to by the Deputy was more than offset by the substantial increase in the total amount of the grants notified early in the year as compared with 1954-55.  The aim in distributing the additional moneys made available for supplementary grants in the current financial year was to maintain the overall total of grants at the same level approximately as in the preceding year.</P>

      <P>An order for the compulsory acquisition of lands at Carrigrohanebeg was made by the Cork County Council on the 12th May, 1955, and submitted to my Department on the 18th May.  The period set for the receipt of objections expired on the 4th June.  The inquiry opened on the 6th July; it was adjourned to the 20th July and again, at the request of the parties concerned, to the 10th August. On this latter date the inspector, on reopening the adjourned inquiry, was informed that the council and the land owner had arranged for the acquisition by agreement of a suitable alternative site.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. T.F. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with present Regulations under the Health Act, 1953, a health authority is under statutory obligation to provide the hospital services needed for any person in its <Col N="523" /> functional area who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide such services for himself and his dependents.  While possession of a medical card is ordinarily evidence of eligibility a person is not necessarily ineligible for services because he does not possess a medical card.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i>, most persons in receipt of full old age pensions would be eligible for free hospital treatment at present.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of health authorities to facilitate persons who wish to apply for any benefit under health legislation and, that being so, it is difficult for me to appreciate why any such authority should refuse to issue an application form on request.</P>

      <P>I have had several cases of this, where the home assistance officers will not give a form.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (1), lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;(of whom not less than <Col N="525" /> four shall be members of the standing committee of the club)&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(of whom not more than three shall be members of the executive committee of the club and of whom two shall have an interest in the breeding of greyhounds or in coursing or greyhound racing, and of whom one shall be a representative of the licensed bookmakers).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill states that, of the six appointed to the board by the Minister, four of them will be taken from the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  Our amendment is to the effect that, of the six taken from the general body on to the board, not more than three will be members of the Irish Coursing Club.  The others then will be left at the discretion of the Minister, as well as an independent chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Reading, I mentioned that this board, comprised of four members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, would not be a suitable board.  I mentioned that, having regard to the report submitted to the Minister by the commission dealing with coursing and track racing generally, it appeared to me that these people who now comprise the standing committee would not be suitable people to have a majority on the board.  They have been placed in the dock and have been found guilty of not being able to control their own affairs.  The Minister's intention in this Bill is to put them back into office, although he admitted that there were cases of malpractice, of neglect of duty covering greyhound racing, sales of <Col N="526" /> dogs, and so forth.  If the section inserted by the Minister were accepted by the House, it would mean that we were legislating for these people and condoning all that has been wrong, or that is believed to have been wrong, in the past by reappointing them to take complete control of greyhound racing.</P>
      <P>The industry deserves better than that.  If there is to be a board to control the industry, the most that these people would be entitled to would be three of the six.  The Labour amendment states more specifically than our amendment that the other three members could be selected from breeders, bookmakers and any other parties.  It would be very wrong to agree that the four members of the standing committee should be appointed in that way.  I know that the representatives of the standing committee were very anxious that they should get a majority.  I have had discussions with them on one or two occasions.  It was one of their very strong points that they should have four of the seven who would be appointed to the board.  That is tantamount to giving them complete control again.  Having regard to the condemnation by the commission set up to investigate the greyhound industry generally, I do not believe that that should be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not querying anything. I am merely seeking to explain to Deputies that the considerations envisaged yesterday largely apply to the issue joined here.  I want to point out to Deputy Walsh that, while it is true that the report substantially found that many matters required reform, the <Col N="527" /> historical reason for that is just as well known to Deputy Walsh as it is to me.</P>
      <P>The executive of the Irish Coursing Club was originally established in 1916 to deal with relatively simple matters arising out of the administration of coursing matches in rural Ireland, breeding and the keeping of the stud book associated with that sport.  There then arose, about 1920, an entirely new set of circumstances, arising out of greyhound racing and, in reference to the control of that new and, at the time, relatively trivial branch of the sport, there was a complete vacuum; there was no control board and the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, I think rather reluctantly, consented to undertake control of it.  Nobody foreseeing at that time the magnitude of the problem that would arise in the administration of such an industry as greyhound racing, the plain truth is they never had adequate powers to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>They took the powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They tried to adapt the constitution they had to the entirely new circumstances created by greyhound racing.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll feels that they took the powers, but the problem was that they had not power to take powers adequate to deal with so powerful and influential a vested interest as greyhound racing became, and it is because adequate powers are wanted that this Bill is before the House.  If the Irish Coursing Club were functioning satisfactorily and had the power to do what required to be done and had the sanction of the authority of the Oireachtas to enforce the regulations that were necessary, the necessity for this Bill would never have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised repeatedly in the House that I am not looking for power for myself, or any successor in the office of Minister for Agriculture, to run the greyhound racing industry.  What I am trying to do is get an agreed measure which will give a board truly representative of the whole industry effective power to run the industry <Col N="528" /> right.  If they do not use it, there is nothing we can do about it.  I am not going to run the greyhound industry; they have got to run it themselves; and what I am asking Oireachtas Éireann to do is to give them the power to run it.</P>
    <P>Why go on pouring contumely on a body of perfectly decent men and making observations suggesting that these men were in the dock.  That is not true.  The situation that grew out of the circumstances in which these men found themselves was under inquiry and was found to be unsatisfactory under the same historical background.  I should like to say that I do not see how any 21 men could do better than they did.  They had not the power necessary to control the very powerful vested interests which, it is suggested, they should have controlled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When you have a body of men dealing with small coursing clubs throughout the country, the members of which have friends and acquaintances on the Irish Coursing Club, it is a very simple thing to control the sport.  The rules required are very few, easily enforced; but when an organisation is set up to do that limited job and finds itself suddenly called upon to enforce a whole code of rules against a great industry such as the greyhound industry became, I know they were not able to do the job.  If I had thought they were, I would not have troubled the Oireachtas with this Bill.  Deputy Walsh has said he agreed he had in contemplation a Bill of this kind because he found that the powers requisite to deal with the greyhound industry as it is now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though they be men of the highest integrity, if, when they go to their clubs and tracks for election, they do not get elected, they cease to be members of the board. Is that an unreasonable requisition to make?  The requisition is that I shall be constrained to choose four honest and representative persons to go on this Racing Board.  That is all, and I do urgently and strongly press on my colleagues here that I should not be asked to sponsor the proposition that what we previously unanimously conceded to the Racing Board, at the instance of the then Minister for Finance, now President of the State, we would withhold from these people for no better reason than that they are our kind of people and that the others were not.

      <P>Are we all not very well aware of the fact that the register of litters contained the names of dogs that were never bred when greyhound racing started in England 30 years ago?  Pedigrees were given to dogs and nobody knew where these dogs were born.  Everybody is well aware that dogs without pedigrees were bought and sold across channel with pedigrees that had been dug up for them.  Many people bought dogs for £1 or 30/-, and had pedigrees found for these dogs. Surely the Minister does not think we are all fools.  That has been going on all the time, and, as far as I can see, the Minister does not know anything about it.  People that were opposed to the Irish Coursing Club at that time eventually became members of the Irish Coursing Club themselves and everything was all right for them, but I happened to be chairman of the Cork Greyhound Racing Association for a good while before the Minister became interested in greyhounds and I know a lot of difficulties arose and a lot of things were done simply because the Irish Coursing Club had too much power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a lot of repetitious speeches on this Bill and all of them on the same lines.  I believe it is on Section 9 that the whole success or failure of this Bill depends, that is the section dealing with the constitution of the new control board for the greyhound industry.  I shall not go over the ground covered by the Opposition or by the Minister, except to take up two points in the Minister's speech. He said that his main anxiety&mdash;and I do not doubt it&mdash;was that the board would be truly representative and I am afraid he is relying on his own omniscience in the selection of the men and feels that he himself will be able to select four people from the 21.</P>
      <P>As the section stands it seems even more dangerous.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Of whom not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> But if that section were left unchanged, we could reach the stage where the whole six would be composed of the Irish Coursing Club.  That is one reason why we have put down this amendment, (a) to ensure that at no time would it be possible for them to have full control of the Racing Board and (b) to diminish the amount of power being given to them by the Minister under Section 9, as it now stands.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with the Minister that these names which he mentioned as members of the standing committee are all decent, honourable people.  I know most of them individually, but, individually and collectively, you could not find a better body of men, from the point of view of honesty and integrity.  I am putting it to the Minister like this: over the years these men have had many other interests and because of that although they are the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and entrusted with running the affairs of the Irish Coursing Club, although they are the responsible body, they were not able to give the attention and interest to the day-to-day administration of Irish Coursing Club affairs that was required, and for that reason, as time went on, all the responsibility and all the powers were gradually centred in Clonmel.  I am not satisfied that, if the board is constituted in accordance with the proposals the Minister has outlined, that power will not still be left in Clonmel. That is the danger as I see it.</P>
    <P>While much credit must go to the people in Clonmel who originally gave the infant industry the necessary support, encouragement and organisation, at the risk of being platitudinous I would say: &ldquo;All power corrupts and great power corrupts greatly,&rdquo; because the Irish Coursing Club standing committee, through the Clonmel control, has certainly corrupted the greyhound industry and certainly did not act in the interests of the small dog owners and small breeders.  Things became so bad a few years ago that the Greyhound Owners' Association was formed to counteract the influence exerted by Clonmel.  The association tried to issue its own newspaper to refute the Clonmel people, but unfortunately <Col N="534" /> the association consisted of only the small &ldquo;doggy&rdquo; men to whom the greyhound industry was a sport and a means of making extra money. Unfortunately, the Clonmel people had more money and more power, and a more powerful paper, and the greyhound owners, as such, had to fade out of existence.</P>
    <P>I understood this commission was set up to go into the whole question of the dog business, with a view to putting this very important and potential export industry on a very firm and sound basis.  That, I think, was the intention of the Minister.  That was the intention of the committee investigating and it is also what we all hoped would emerge in this Bill, as a result of that report.  If Section 9 is amended as I suggest it should be in my amendment, I could almost say every other section of the Bill would then go through possibly without any bother, because it all hinges on the reconstitution of that board on proper lines.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this, that, having regard to the fact that since that report was issued some time has elapsed, and it was only after the lapse of time the Bill was given its present form, but the committee of the Irish Coursing Club, or Clonmel controlling interest&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;was well aware of the recommendations contained in that report and also well aware that the Bill would be based on that report. Yet, in spite of that, instead of pulling up its socks and turning up its sleeves and getting down at that stage to trying to do something decent for the industry, no such action was taken.  It appears they did not consider doing that; they had no ideas; they were lax and did not care what form the vote would take; they felt their power was not going to be touched.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister knows that there was some months ago a demand for greyhounds for Italy from this country.  Any body controlling an association which would get a demand like that and which would have the interests of its members at heart would immediately circularise dog owners and coursing interests in the country and tell them that there was <Col N="535" /> a demand in the Italian market for Irish greyhounds and so give these men a chance to make more money. That did not happen, although this report was issued and the Bill was in the process of being drafted.  Instead, the Clonmel section went around the country and bought up the dogs themselves at not very high prices, took them to Italy themselves and sold them at very enhanced prices.  I ask the Minister, in view of that instance which is indisputable, does he still believe that he will be able to pick four honourable men who will control the industry in the best interests of the industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am asking the Minister, in view of the practice indulged in when the small dog owners, breeders and members of coursing clubs were not informed that such a chance was going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be.  But that does not get away from the principle involved.  I would again ask the Minister to accept our amendment which is possibly a little more drastic than Deputy Ormonde's.  We ask that not more than two shall be members of <Col N="536" /> the standing committee and that the remaining four shall consist of two prominent breeders, one bookmaker and one greyhound track representative. I want to ensure that the club members will not have control.  I think the two prominent breeders or owners should also be on that board.  It might not be possible to get them from a representative body, but I am quite certain that the minutes or records of the old greyhound association are available and if these were given to the Minister, he could then use his omniscience to select names from them.</P>
      <P>I think also the bookmakers are entitled to representation on that board.  They give a good deal of employment and employ assistants who depend for their living on that employment. They do a lot of indirect bookkeeping for the Government and they are entitled to have their interests safeguarded.  I am not satisfied that the Minister could honestly feel that he would have any truly representative board without having all sections of the industry on it.  As a matter of fact I am only sorry that we cannot provide representation on that board for the punters, but I know that that is impossible.  We must not give control to the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and we must include on that board bookmakers, dog breeders, trainers and such.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked about the rules used by the Irish Coursing Club over the years.  I am sure the Minister has the rule book before him and, if he has not, I have it here.  There are about 155 of these rules, but there was no one ever to enforce them, except the people in Clonmel.  The rule book did not matter; whatever suited the people in Clonmel was what mattered. All sorts of rules were broken from time to time to suit Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite convinced that, unless the Minister changes the representation on the board and reduces the majority given to the Irish Coursing Club, the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained.  The trouble with these State or semi-State bodies is that, when a Bill goes through this House, they can be managed or mismanaged, and we <Col N="537" /> cannot even ask a question in this House about them.  I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment with a view to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept for a moment that the issue raised in this amendment is whether or not it is possible to get four honest men from a list of 21 men.  I can see that it is quite possible to get a far more extensive number than four from that list, but the issue is a simple one.  It is whether or not the House considers that the control of this new greyhound industry board should be granted in perpetuity to the Irish Coursing Club. That is the issue and not the personality or integrity of the individuals.  I am approaching the question in that way.</P>
      <P>I am not going to argue that a very strong case cannot be made by the Minister that the control should be in the Irish Coursing Club, but I am going to ask the Minister if he can adduce any argument to convince me that, on the merits of the Irish Coursing Club, that body should be given control in perpetuity of the industry. I am acknowledging without question that every one of these 21 men is an honourable man and properly elected to this body, but the Minister himself has admitted that there are four substantial interests connected with this industry.  He himself has said that these four interests consist of the coursing club, the racetrack owners, the breeders and the bookmakers. I am putting the rhetorical question to the Minister, why, on this small board, he chooses not to give representation to one of those four primarily interested bodies?</P>

      <P>Neither am I, but even though they acted improperly, I have no reason to dissent from Deputy Collins' proposition that interests such as the bookmakers' should have representation on the board, on the same principle as representation was conceded to them on the Racing Board. But for their acting up as they have been doing, that could have been said sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister has some very cogent reasons to adduce as to why control in perpetuity should be vested in the Irish Coursing Club.  If he has, I have not yet heard them.  I want to say this. The Minister is drawing the parallel that, some number of years ago, when the Racing Board was set up, a certain practice was established.  I am not going into a discussion on the question of who are the nominal members of the Turf Club or of the National Hunt Club, but I am going to say this, that were I in the House then, there would not have been unanimity in giving control in perpetuity to such a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My approach to it is this: if there is a case that can be made why control in perpetuity should be given over to a body that has already proved itself unsatisfactory in the running of its own affairs, I will accept that without question, but my view is that the control board in this whole instance is too numerically low altogether. Seven is a very small number.  Of necessity, a quorum for a meeting of that board will be substantially smaller.  I am going to approach this question completely differently from the way in which both Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party approach it, because my belief is that, if you can get willing co-operation between the people who will ultimately be concerned in the fruitful functioning of this industry, you will have an impetus that will give it a reasonable prospect of success.  I feel that, if you are <Col N="539" /> going to start off by virtually irretrievably hampering these other interests, you will start a board, the motto of which will be: &ldquo;Do as I say&rdquo;, and not &ldquo;Do as I do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These amendments and the section they purport to amend are the real kernel of the whole Bill.  The Minister comes in here, and, with his command of language, purports to put a certain point of view.  In emphatic support of that, he has, to my mind, stood on a premise which is completely untenable, because the issue in this section is not in any way connected with individual members of any lists.  The issue involved in the section is purely one of determining where the control in perpetuity is going to be under the new board to be set up to control the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister not think that I am against him on the issue as to who the controller might ultimately be, but I want to get the issue clear first before arguing it.  The Bill lays down that not less than four will be members of the Irish Coursing Club.  Let me be frank. I do not envisage the difficulties which my colleague, Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, envisages, that ultimately the number might be six, with an independent chairman, but I do envisage that it would be quite within the competence of this small, omnipotent, controlling body to manipulate meetings and everything else in connection with the board to suit the convenience of the majority.  That might often lead to the exercise of anything but fair judgment in relation to certain problems.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister not to accept these amendments but to get down to the real purpose, aided by the views drawn from the common pool of our genuine interest, and do something that will, in the ultimate analysis, be effective and good.  This is something that between now and the Report Stage of the Bill could be approached in a far less acrimonious and more practical way.  My own personal feeling on this section, dealing with the matter <i>in globo</i>, is that the design of the board is too small and that, in the ultimate analysis, the quorum required to constitute it as an authoritative <Col N="540" /> body will be too small and that we are narrowing the thing down too much to a totalitarian control.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board has a larger number, if the Minister wants to draw analogies.  It has an infinitely less number of meetings, engagements and everything else under its control.  We know the value of the horse-breeding industry to this country and we know the number of race meetings.  Has the Minister and his Department got down to the question of equating the matter of coursing and dog racing fixtures <i>vis-á-vis</i> racing?  How is it that a Bill can envisage an infinitely smaller body than the Racing Board to exercise control over this widely dispersed form of sport?</P>
    <P>This is a problem worth resolving in a cool, calm, reasoned atmosphere.  I do not know whether the Minister is very keen on dog racing or coursing, or whether he has attended any of these meetings, but looking at the industry in a straightforward manner, on the basis of the number of dog tracks, coursing fixtures, open coursing fixtures and the various types of fixtures within the control of this new board, it would appear to me that it would require, if anything, a bigger board to try to manage the affairs of dog racing and the greyhound industry generally than to look after horse racing.</P>
    <P>It was said in argument that the Irish Coursing Club up to now had not the powers to enforce certain things. Let me disillusion the Minister to this extent.  Even if this Bill is passed, as the Minister sees it now, you are ultimately going to find yourselves with this Bill law and many of the powers that would be necessary for the enforcement of decisions will still not be there.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of what happened once the Reilly-Conyngham Club case was decided on the horse racing side of the industry.  The resolution of certain problems was shelved.  Nobody has been sufficiently courageous in the greyhound section to try something on a similar line, so that I will put this point of view to the Minister.  There are wide fields that neither himself nor his advisers have cottoned on to at all <Col N="541" /> within the concept of this industry. Now is the time, before we pass control over to a board, to make sure that we are passing it over in a way that will be fair to the various sections that make their living therefrom.</P>
    <P>Finally, if there is some cogent reason other than a bad precedent of the Racing Board with its perpetuity of control for the Turf Club and National Hunt Club and if there is something that compels the Minister irretrievably to plump for control of this body to lie in the Irish Coursing Club, I should be very glad to hear it and to support the Minister, if that reason carries conviction, but I think the Minister could, no matter how truant he may have thought some elements to be, at this stage of the discussion, give us a fair and frank indication of the interests he will have represented on the board, as well as the Irish Coursing Club.  If he did that, a lot of the discussion might evaporate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing amendments Nos. 3 and 4 together. Deputy Walsh pointed out that, while we moved amendment No. 3, amendment No. 4 by the Labour Party is, in fact, more explicit.  If the Minister indicated that he was prepared to accept the Labour amendment, I am sure there would be no great disagreement between us then.  But the Minister has not given any indication other than that he proposes to stand rigidly for the section as it appears in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister admitted quite frankly that there were at least four distinct interests and, when asked to tell us what these four interests were, he gave them to us.  Now, at least three of these interests, to take it mildly, should be equal to the interest of the Irish Coursing Club. Obviously, the Minister would not have introduced the Bill with the section as it is if he either did not believe or wanted us to believe that he believed that the interest of the Irish Coursing Club on its own was far greater than all the other three interests put together.  I disagree with that point of view.  From the historical aspect, as outlined, it is true that subsequent to the establishment here of a separate, <Col N="542" /> controlled body for coursing, greyhound racing in the ordinary greyhound racetrack developed and has now in my opinion become, from the point of view of value as an interest, if not equal to then certainly not less as an interest to the nation than coursing itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the difficulty of exercising powers by the Irish Coursing Club.  The Irish Coursing Club, as Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll has pointed out, has been using its powers very extensively.  The greyhound racing tracks in this country are under licence to the Irish Coursing Club.  There are many groups who wanted to license a new greyhound track but could not because of the rules of the Irish Coursing Club and their authority to decide whether they could or could not and if, in fact, they did open up, they would not be very successful.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he wants this board to be truly representative of the whole industry.  These are his words. I am saying to the Minister that if he adds up the industry, by taking each of the four interests separately, he will find that the Irish Coursing Club certainly does not qualify for four-sixths or, in fact, for two-thirds of the control of the whole representative industry of the nation.  The Minister, I think, has not briefed himself very well when he uses the argument that he is basing this on what Deputy Collins rightly pointed out was a bad precedent.  I agree with the proposition that Deputy Collins has put to the House.  We are not at this moment in our discussion reflecting whatsoever on the membership of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  If the Deputy will read the report of the advisory committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fagan can make his own speech whenever he feels like it.  The issue here is a principle. When the Minister reads out 21 names, can he give us a guarantee that if there are changes in election to the standing committee, he will still call them his type of people?  How does he know what the future will produce?  Surely the industry as a whole and all the interests concerned are entitled to a guarantee, in legislation we pass here, that a monopoly situation in relation to any one group is not to be perpetuated?</P>
      <P>He talked about the Racing Board. If the Minister had said: &ldquo;There is the ordinary coursing side of this.  If you like, add to it, the breeding, and so forth, but there is also the greyhound track side.  Added to that, if you like, there is the bookmaking side of it&rdquo;: if there were two groups, as there are in the horse racing, and if he had said: &ldquo;Let the other interest set up a body of their own.  Let them elect a standing committee and, from the two standing committees of the two distinct groups, we will have a Racing Board&rdquo;, I could understand him.  But, throughout, this savours very much of the circular that the Irish Coursing Club sent out and in this circular, which was produced by this body and sent to members of this House, amongst others, are some of the following extracts.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is untrue to say that the Greyhound Industry Bill was introduced against the wishes of the Irish Coursing Club.  The Irish Coursing Club, in fact, took the initiative.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, they say this&mdash;and when this comes from them, we must have some regard to it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Coursing Club has a certain legal status and legal rights and it is extremely doubtful if even Dáil Éireann can ride rough-shod over them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what they say to us&mdash;the people to whom the Minister wants to give control for the benefit of everybody concerned.  It&mdash;the Irish Coursing <Col N="544" /> Club&mdash;is resigned to having some of the authority transferred to a new body, but the Irish Coursing Club is constitutionally entitled to a voice in setting the limits of transfer of authority.  Surely to goodness, if that is their approach to it, we might as well say: &ldquo;Leave things as they are. They have the authority and they are only submitting to the transfer of certain limited bits of their authority to this board, but they are indicating that they are retaining the authority and, no matter what Dáil Éireann does, it does not concern them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I also point out to the Minister that, in his own explanatory memorandum which he sent to members of Dáil Éireann with the Bill&mdash;this is his own explanatory note, such as accompanies most Bills&mdash;we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision in Section 9 that four of the seven members of the board should be appointed by the Minister from among the members of the standing/executive committee of the club was not recommended by the advisory committee,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;was not recommended&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;but is analogous to the provision in the 1945 Act that six of the 11 members of the Racing Board for horses should be members of the Irish Turf Club....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think everybody who has spoken on this matter has exploded that particular approach sky-high.  It does not arise; it is not relevant.  Even if the Minister himself wants to examine what he said yesterday, he will find he is flogging a horse in this race that he is not prepared to ride.  He ridiculed this group yesterday.  They are not his type&mdash;&ldquo;not my type of people&rdquo;. These 21 are on the Irish Coursing Club, but, nevertheless, it suits him to try and bring it in here as if anybody would accept it.  He goes on then to explain all about the transitional period; that does not arise here.  Now the Minister has heard Deputy S. Collins from his own side of the House. He has heard Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll speaking on behalf of the Labour Party.  He has heard us on this side of the House.  He has heard a majority opinion of the House on this section. <Col N="545" /> He has been talking about the truly democratic body he wants to see emerge: let him at least behave in this House in a truly democratic manner.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here with one voice, those of us who are concerned about this Section 9.  If the Minister wants this Bill to be a success from the point of view of leaving this House as an Act which will help the industry in time to come, he will have to indicate here acceptance of one or other of these amendments, preferably of the amendment tabled by the Labour Party. Deputy S. Collins says he does not believe either of these amendments is the answer to the problem and he would like to hear some suggestion emerge on the Fourth Stage.  I was hoping that Deputy S. Collins would give us an idea as to what better suggestion he could make other than either of these two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be even more unanimity.  The Deputy agrees, as we all do, that Section 9, as drafted, is not the proper way to approach this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be another way of approaching the matter, but we are all agreed that, whatever the size of the board, there shall not be a monopoly for one particular section over all the rest.  When we were considering this amendment, we thought of all these things, and I believe we have some amendments in relation to some of the points raised here by Deputy S. Collins as to the number which shall constitute a quorum, the arrangements for meetings and so forth.  That was something that struck everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested here that refusal to accept the control of the Irish Coursing <Col N="546" /> Club over this new body is a reflection on the individuals who constitute the standing committee.  May I point out to the Minister what the Irish Coursing Club thought about their critics? I do not know whether the Irish Coursing Club wants protection in this Bill, but I do know they want protection against something which was touched on by Deputy Collins; if they warn somebody off, they want to be free, as far as they are concerned, from any possible legal action subsequently. They say in their circular that they were &ldquo;aggrieved because the proceedings of the advisory committee were held in camera.  The Irish Coursing Club representatives were asked to attend a second time, and there is hardly a single page of the report that does not reflect in some way on the club and its members.&rdquo;  That is the advisory committee which the Minister set up and in relation to which he selected the personnel to examine into this matter; that is the committee which produced these reflections on the Irish Coursing Club and its members. What is most extraordinary is that some of the most outspoken members of the Irish Coursing Club themselves &ldquo;were at one time warned off or suspended under the rules of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For what purpose? Warned off because they criticised the standing committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They say you must not accept their evidence against us because we warned them off, and they do not say why they were warned off.  Here is the body to whom we are supposed to give absolute control now of a most valuable industry, affecting the livelihoods of a great many people, apart altogether from its value to the nation. These are the people who convict themselves by admitting publicly that the advisory committee set up by the Minister found them guilty of certain misconduct; and they say that there is hardly a page in the report that does not reflect in some way on the club and its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to take it that the Minister set up this advisory committee to throw mud at the Irish Coursing Club <Col N="547" /> and its members, or are we to take it that the members of this advisory committee did their work honestly and produced a factual report, to which they now take exception?  And notwithstanding this report of the advisory committee, the Minister says now, as Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll said: &ldquo;Clonmel has had control and Clonmel will continue to have control.&rdquo;  I wonder will the Minister see reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll said that Clonmel has control at the moment and that it will continue to have control.  Perhaps Deputy Collins might consult Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll.  I am only quoting what she said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has stated that he does not want a majority of the Irish Coursing Club controlling the board to be set up under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said I wanted to be convinced of some reason as to why they should have a majority in perpetuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  We are trying to give the reasons why they should not have a majority.  We are not approaching this in a negative manner.  We are approaching it in a positive manner. The Deputy is now stepping out from the railway lines he followed when he was speaking and he is now taking a negative attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is stepping out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe had better read my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Deputy's speech&mdash;it is quite clear in my mind&mdash;and I was paying due credit to the Deputy for the line he took. Now it is coming to the time when we <Col N="548" /> must decide the issue and we will have to go into the division lobbies, and the Deputy is taking the line that the Minister has not proved home that this is necessary.  The Minister has tried to prove to the best of his ability that this is necessary.  He has used every possible argument to substantiate his case, but none of his arguments has impressed itself on those of us who hold a different view.  The Deputy is asking for something which is impossible. Perhaps it might satisfy him in his subsequent decision on this issue.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not now realise that there is some substance in what has been said to him in support of these amendments?  Or does he consider what has been said as of no significance and not worth being considered by him in any event?  I can tell him that, if he agrees to recognise the overall position, as he calls it, and if he wants to make this Bill and the board truly representative of the whole industry, he must accept the point of view we are expressing.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister wasting the time of the House or wasting the pages of our verbatim reports by reading out again for the fourth time, having read it out twice yesterday, the list of the names of the present standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  They are not in issue. It is the overall, long-term position that is in issue.  The Minister cannot guarantee that, if there are 21 strictly honest men on this standing committee to-day, there will not be 21 different ones at some future date.  Let us make provision in legislation that there is a protection beyond, if you like, the elected period of people in office or even the lifetime of an individual.  I consequently, at this stage, say I am not at all impressed with a single remark made by the Minister in defence of the wording of the Bill as it stands in Section 9.  We will have to hear a great deal more to make us change from the attitude we have adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four interests.  The Minister mentioned them last night. Has the Minister&mdash;as he has indicated a minute ago, I think, in what I thought was a personal conversation <Col N="549" /> between himself and Deputy Collins and which he repeated to us here&mdash;now admitted that there must be a position on this board for a representative of the Bookmakers' Association?  Is he admitting that or is this particular interest to be left always at the outside of the door coming with their hats in their hands to ask this board with its majority of four Irish Coursing Club members if they can have this, that or the other?  I hope&mdash;I do not see any of the representatives here now&mdash;that the Labour Deputies will press their amendment to a division.</P>

      <P>I want to deal, if I may, with the specific point made by Deputy Briscoe.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the conditions pecedent to introducing this legislation was that there should be incorporated in the Schedule to the Bill and submitted to Dáil Éireann a new constitution for the Irish Coursing Club which placed upon them the obligation for a period of two and a half years to secure an executive for the Irish Coursing Club, every single member of which would be democratically <Col N="550" /> elected by the coursing clubs and racetracks in a fair proportion. Is there any other better way in which you can secure democratic control?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Do not appoint your board until you have that done.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: We are all agreed about that.  I think we are all agreed that if you get such a democratically controlled body it is a good thing that they should exercise a predominant influence.</P>

Under that new constitution of the Irish Coursing Club, they must hold elections at each and every racetrack in the country and every coursing club must take part and no coursing club can take part&mdash;so as to ensure against the creation of fake or ghost clubs&mdash; unless they have had a coursing meeting in the previous 15 months, in electing an executive truly representative of the clubs and the tracks.</P>

      <P>I am making the case without equivocation that the right people to have a predominant influence on the board are the democratically <Col N="552" /> elected representatives of those engaged in the industry.  I, therefore, propose that, under the new scheduled constitution, such persons shall be elected and that hereafter the Minister for Agriculture in choosing the board will turn to the 21 persons democratically elected and from their number take four.  Until these elections have taken place&mdash;and they cannot take place until there is a board in existence to supervise their proper conduct&mdash;<i>ad interim</i> I propose to take four from the existing board of control, subject to this proviso that seven members of the existing board of control must go for election within six months, seven more within 18 months and seven more within 30 months.</P>

I am submitting to the House that, having got that, <i>ad interim</i> I will choose four from the existing 21, subject to the overriding proviso that they must submit themselves for election and, should they fail to get elected, cease to be members of the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two other appointments to the board, outside these four, which will be used to choose good men, be they representative or not.  I did say to Deputy Collins that I believe the precedent of the Racing Board might, with prudence, be followed in that regard and on that board there is representation of the bookmaker. I have always believed that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said repeatedly on the Second Stage that I regarded that precedent of the Racing Board to be one which might, with perfect propriety, be followed in respect of this board.  The four members chosen from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club are designed to represent the owners, the trackmen and the coursing men.  There are two other vacancies which the Minister is supposed to use to complete the board, and there is the chairman.</P>
      <P>I could be arguing, I know, with the present mind of Fianna Fáil until the cows come home, and I would not change them.  I know that if Deputy Briscoe could get Deputy O'Carroll or Deputy Collins to lead him into the Lobby, he would go trotting in after them in the hope of establishing a rift in this Government.  He will not succeed. I want to assure both the Deputies who have spoken from this side of the House that my aim is to get&mdash;and that purpose will be achieved under this Bill&mdash;a fully democratically representative body on the Racing Board and fair representation upon it for all legitimate interests associated with the industry.  They will have to take my word for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to bring people's minds back.  I had 40 or 50 greyhounds at one time and I registered them in the English Stud Book.  I joined the Irish Coursing Club when Mr. Morris and others tried to start the Irish Coursing Stud Book.  I have been a member of the Irish Coursing Club since its inception.  I attended many meetings of the club.  I was the means of starting two or three coursing clubs in Westmeath.  I think I was the means of starting about the third part of coursing in all Ireland.  My memory goes back a long way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> My impression all along the line was that, in the Irish Coursing Club, the members always tried to run it straight.  All the men who met there gave their services free and were keen to run coursing for the love of it.  I won stakes.  I was the first man to walk a dog into Shelbourne Park.  I know what I am talking about.  The more we tried to run the Irish Coursing Club straight, when we began to gather in a little money, the more wolves were out to take it from us. Certain associations sprang up that wanted to take control of the Irish Coursing Club.  In one case, a man who was leading such an agitation was a man I had warned off for trying to pass me, as slip steward, with a painted dog.  That is the sort of thing that we in the Irish Coursing Club had to fight all along the line.  When dog racing started, everyone was fighting for his own interest.  The value of greyhounds was increasing.  Deputy McGrath has referred to the value of pedigrees.  It was very hard to curb abuses in that respect, but the Irish Coursing Club did curb them.  At present, they have a group of officials that it is very hard to get behind.  It is now impossible to produce a false paper in order to register a dog.  Some years ago that could be done.  A lot of these abuses have been curbed by the action of the Irish Coursing Club. That is why I am solidly behind the Minister in giving the Irish Coursing Club major representation on this new board.  This can be changed as time goes on.  At present, the Irish Coursing Club is composed of every honest breeder in Ireland.  Every coursing club is composed of the local breeders. Everybody knows that the rule of the Irish Coursing Club is that you cannot run a dog at a local meeting unless you are a member of the Irish Coursing Club.  Therefore, the Irish Coursing Club is composed of the men who breed the dogs.  Every one of these clubs sends two members every year to a meeting of the Irish Coursing Club and, from them and other parties, the board is composed.  It is just and right that the Irish Coursing Club should have four on the board, because they represent the backbone of the industry, the small farmer who breeds dogs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I have listened to Deputy Briscoe and I have attended meetings of the Irish Coursing Club.  I heard such speeches as his from those who were trying to get the grip.  The Minister is going to stop that.  In a year or two, he may have an honest, right and proper Racing Board to look after this matter.  I would ask that the Irish Coursing Club be given full representation on this board, so that it may continue its work for the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture seems to be in a bit of a fog.  He wants to know what leg Fianna Fáil stands on.  It stands, as it always stood, on the principle that it does not want corruption in public life or corruption in sport.  If ever there was a Bill designed to perpetuate corruption and to give something to those responsible for corruption, this Bill is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Minister stopped his talk about throwing mud, because after all, I did not set up this advisory committee.  I did not try to influence its findings; I did not give evidence before it; and I did not sign its report.  But Deputy Barry, sitting behind the Minister, did and Mr. Peter P. Wilkinson, well known to the Minister for Finance, did.  If the Minister wants to know on what leg we are standing, I shall tell him. It is on the leg that we want to see the conclusions of the advisory committee taken seriously by the Minister for Agriculture, and we want to clean out of this board, and we want to clean out of the industry the widespread corruption which the Minister's own inquisition found existed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let the Minister not talk about throwing mud.  This is a public document, issued by the Minister for Agriculture himself.  It is the report of the advisory committee on the greyhound industry.  Let us read from its pages. These are not my conclusions.  As I say, I was not there and I am taking the words of the Minister's nominees that the statements in this printed document as published by the <Col N="556" /> Minister himself are well founded. What do they say on page 11?  I shall give the references and any person who cares to may check for himself. In paragraph 20 of the report, there appears the statement&mdash;this is not throwing mud, except such mud as Deputy Barry and Mr. Peter P. Wilkinson and the other chosen nominees of the Minister themselves have made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although the object of having a duplicate card in the custody of the Irish Coursing Club is obviously to provide that the two cards should at all times correspond; in other words, that any records of the dog's performance entered on the owner's card should as soon as possible appear on the duplicate card, adequate steps to achieve this are not taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adequate steps are not taken to achieve this.&rdquo;  Upon whom does the responsibility rest to see that adequate steps are taken to ensure that the cards truthfully and accurately record performances of the dogs?  Who, but the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club to whom the Minister for Agriculture is about to hand over the control of the whole greyhound industry in Ireland.  In their report, the committee went on to talk about the results:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The result is that cases have occurred where record of a dog's performance, entered on the original card, has been falsified and difficulty has been experienced in providing evidence of such falsification.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears on page 11, in paragraph 20, of the Minister's own official document.  And yet he talks about throwing mud, when one with a knowledge of the background and circumstances which this Bill is designed to cover up, as I believe now, tries to expose the insincerity and the hypocrisy of the Minister in his dealing with this Bill.  On page 12, in paragraph 21, there appears a statement as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reference was made in paragraph 13 to the substitution of copies.</P>
    <P>We have been informed that inasmuch as a period of 16 months from <Col N="557" /> the date of birth may, and usually does lapse, before a litter or any member of it is seen by a recognised official of the Irish Coursing Club, there is very grave danger of substitution of puppies and that in fact frequent cases of substitution occur.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We have all seen copies of a document circulated to the members of this Dáil, obviously issued by some person representing the Irish Coursing Club, which challenges Dáil Éireann to try to legislate to clean up this industry.  But that is only by the way.  I want to get back to the paragraph which has been quoted.  The paragraph reads on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is almost inevitable that some mortality takes place amongst puppies in the early weeks of their lives. Cases are apparently not unknown where the litter was replenished from other litters possibly bred from mediocre parents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have heard a statement by Deputy McGrath to which my friend on the Government side, Deputy Fagan, has subscribed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;We are satisfied that the present regulations, as described in the foregoing, offer considerable scope for abuse into a small minority of unscrupulous breeders, mainly because of the fact that definite identification marks are not placed on an animal until it is 16 months old. More than one witness was in favour of ineradicable tattoo markings at a much earlier stage and a maximum age of eight weeks was suggested. In support of this recommendation, it was pointed out that the introduction of outside puppies into a litter of puppies eight weeks old could scarcely fail to be detected by an experienced official of the Irish <Col N="558" /> Coursing Club, whereas at 16 months, and even at four months, such identification would be much more difficult.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite true that there were veterinary grounds to object to that.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that there were strong and valid grounds for objecting to tattooing puppies at eight weeks old.  I did not want to bother the House by completing the paragraph, but I shall do so now:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Other witnesses objected to this early tattooing on the grounds that young puppies are extremely delicate, that the official steward who would perform the tattooing, coming as he often would, from one litter, might possibly introduce disease and that this risk would also be present if, for example, the litter as a whole were taken to a centre where tattooing would be done by an official steward.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think that exculpates the officials of the Irish Coursing Club.  I do not think it does.  It merely says the affairs of this club have been managed so carelessly and so negligently in the past that their officials were likely to be careless in discharging their duties or were likely not to take the requisite precautions to prevent the transmission of disease.  That is all that paragraph says and the Minister has it for what it is worth.</P>
      <P>We come now to page 52, paragraph 127.  These are not my words; they are the words of those who know more about it and if the Minister thinks this is mud, I did not make it.  These are the words of the Minister's friends, of the Minister's nominees, of the Minister's trusted representatives on this advisory committee.  On page 52, paragraph 126, it is stated, and 1 am quoting:&mdash;</P>

It amounts to a conclusion which Deputy Barry&mdash;no, that would be unfair; I do not know whether he helped to draft it or not but he was only one with Mr. Peter Wilkinson and seven others.  He was only one of nine people who arrived at this conclusion having heard all the evidence from the various interests.  They arrived at this conclusion and I am going to put it on the records of the House, although I suppose I shall be told that I am throwing mud when I am doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> On page 83, paragraph 88, of the Report of the Advisory Committee, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having examined, in accordance with our terms of reference, &lsquo;the position respecting coursing, greyhound racing, greyhound breeding and other related activities&rsquo;, we have found that no branch of the industry as at present conducted is entirely free from criticism.  In connection with breeding and coursing, many well-defined existing rules have not been enforced and have gradually come to be ignored, thus giving rise to irregularities and more or less serious abuses.  But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity, and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, which unfortunately and undeservedly, has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report states that &ldquo;existing rules have not been enforced&rdquo;.  By whom have they not been enforced? By the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  The rules had come to be ignored by the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club itself, as well as by anybody else who could get away with it.  And the report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;thus giving rise to irregularities and more or less serious abuses.  But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity, and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, which unfortunately and undeservedly, has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us take that sentence.  Why should that be?  What was the reason for it?  Deputy Barry well knows.  It was because, out of the 21 members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, not less than 13 were directors of greyhound tracks.  It was due to their evil influence that Deputy Barry was compelled, in all justice and honesty, to report to the Minister for Agriculture that it was in connection with greyhound racing &ldquo;that the most serious abuses have been practised <Col N="565" /> with impunity, and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, which, unfortunately and undeservedly, has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not my finding.  That is the finding of the committee set up by Deputy Dillon when he previously held the position of Minister for Agriculture. It is not my finding; it is the finding of his friends; and it is a finding which the evidence given before that advisory committee will substantiate to be true and justifiable.  Let us hear what, in fact, did emerge.  We are only dealing with one portion of the documentation that should be before this House.  We should have here now, when we are considering this Bill, if we are doing our duty as public men, all the evidence which was before the committee set up by the Minister and which led them to their findings.  That evidence does not appear.</P>
    <P>I can, I hope, fill in the gap in the documentation.  I am quoting from a document put in evidence before that committee.  It was put in in evidence by the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association, a document which was referred to in a memorandum issued and circulated by the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  We say that, if it had not been for the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association, we should not have had any investigation into the conduct of this industry at all, and the Minister is concerned to protect the vested interests of the Irish Coursing Club, but he has not wanted the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association to get the whole credit in this matter.</P>
    <P>Let us see what they said.  They said, first of all:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only way to direct a coursing club was through the body that controlled it and the advent of tracks gave people who were in a prominent position in the coursing club the opportunity of becoming track directors. You might say that other people might invest their money, but that situation developed to such an extent that you had a standing committee <Col N="566" /> of 21 members, 13 of whom became track directors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That evidence appears on page 140 of the memorandum submitted by the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association and it went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we tried to air our grievances through the organisation, opposition was shown by Clonmel to such an extent that they issued an instruction to coursing clubs that they were not to be members of our organisation at pain of losing their rights as clubs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently that statement was accepted by the advisory committee and the implications of that statement were accepted when the members of the advisory committee reported: &ldquo;But it is in connection with greyhound racing that the most serious abuses have been practised with impunity, and it is here that the unsavoury atmosphere has been created, which unfortunately and undeservedly, has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole.&rdquo;  These gentlemen were talking about the aspects of the business which concerned them as breeders, owners and sportsmen.  They were speaking about the Irish Coursing Club, whose interests the Minister is so very solicitous to protect in this Bill, and the Irish Coursing Club went so far as to issue instructions to members of coursing clubs that they were not to be members of the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association.</P>
    <P>In their submission, the members of the Irish Greyhound Owners' Association stated that, if the advisory committee wanted evidence of that, a copy of that same letter was on the file, but that it would take too much time to get it.  A member of the advisory committee, my friend, Deputy Anthony Barry, said: &ldquo;We are all aware of the reasons&rdquo; and the chairman said: &ldquo;I am not aware of it and I would be very glad if you would send the secretary anything of an intimidatory nature.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When in the memorandum a reference is made to persons warned off, the memorandum omits to say that several of those people referred to were warned off because they were members of the Irish Greyhound Association and <Col N="567" /> in that capacity had the audacity to criticise the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>

      <P>I cannot stop.  I have to go on.  Time is marching on. Let us see what else happened.  There is a reference here to the manner in which the meetings of the Irish Coursing Club were conducted.  This reference in the report of the advisory committee, in the drafting of which I assume Deputy Barry participated, says this:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was pointed out to me in the hall that a man was present who was not entitled to be present and that he voted ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The man's name is given.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...His father was a member of the standing committee.  He was a man who was very well known, whose appearance and general attitude and conduct at meetings were remarkable and anybody there would know him very well.  At that meeting a lady from the office in Clonmel...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Mr. So and So's private secretary&mdash; again I am not quoting names&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and two officials were at the table checking the people who were entitled to come.  They presented their cards and credentials.  In case I was making a blunder in saying that a man was present who was not entitled to be, I went to the table and I saw Mr. So and So's name on the list as being admitted.  Actually it was his son.  I went to the son and said: &lsquo;Look, I know your father is sick, but you have not the right to come and vote for him.  I am sorry to hurt your feelings, but I am going to object publicly.  Do not take it as a personal matter.  There is a bit of a fight and we cannot be squeamish about it.&rsquo;  I pointed out that Mr. So and So's son was there and voting for his father without right.  That information created a certain amount of consternation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The witness goes on to relate what happened.</P>

    <P>All that is bad enough but there is worse to come.  Those who have taken <Col N="568" /> an interest in the long protracted history of this case will remember that certain members of the Greyhound Owners' Association in their capacity as members of the Irish Coursing Club went to court and got discovery of documents.  Arising out of it this witness tells of the reaction to what took place:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All that is bad enough but there is worse to come.  We went down with the solicitor to Clonmel&mdash;eight greyhound owners bringing the court action in respect of this &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; meeting to get a discovery of documents. We went to look through whatever documents we wanted to inspect, and see counsel and solicitor then.  We got the minute books.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from a report taken by the official stenographer of the evidence given before the Minister's own advisory committee on the greyhound racing industry, evidence which the Minister has not disclosed to the House because he dare not and bring in a Bill with this Section 9 in it.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We got the minute books.  We asked for the shorthand notes and for the names of the people present at the meeting.  On going through that list, on the files, of those present I looked for Mr. So and So's name. I found out that Mr. So and So...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the father who was entitled to be there&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...was not there but that the son's initials were there.  I am prepared...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;this witness said&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...to state in any court in the world that either that list was altered or another was substituted for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That witness went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That will help the committee to realise what we were up against when we were trying to fight for reform.  Whoever was responsible for that action was prepared to go to <Col N="569" /> any ends to prove that we were wrong.  That is a small insight into that particular meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the witness goes on, and I am perfectly certain I agree with him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should not like to suggest that all the people who were responsible for the control of the coursing club were aware of that incident&mdash;but nevertheless it happened.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us go on and see something else. I am going to refer only to one incident which shows the degree to which positions in the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club had been abused to their own profit by certain members or officials of the Irish Coursing Club. I am quoting now from page 26.  I would remind the House that it has already been pointed out that of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, consisting of 21 persons, no less than 13 were directors of greyhound racing tracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is one other matter on the question of control that will properly come under this heading of officials, where we suggest that the majority of the standing committee are track directors.  Our views are along these lines.  They have a say in the granting of a track licence, whether a licence should be granted in an area close by or near at hand.  As I have already mentioned, human nature being what it is, no group of track directors could in fairness be expected to sit down and consider whether a licence should be granted to another track area without being conscious of the fact that it might hit their own tracks.  That is another reason...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;this witness says&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...why the present set up is altogether wrong.  We might as well ask that power should be given to a shopkeeper to decide whether another shopkeeper should be allowed to set up beside him.  Some people <Col N="570" /> may think that it is a good system, but in this particular case we think it is bad.  There was a case some time ago of which, no doubt, some members are aware...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and I will direct the attention of Deputies listening to me to what this witness is saying.  Deputy Thaddeus Lynch ought to have a particular interest in this&mdash;he lives in Waterford City&mdash;because this witness went on to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Waterford track was an unlicensed track but it was a reasonably well-run track.  It was not their fault that they were unlicensed. They tried to get a licence year after year, but they failed to get a licence. They could not get it from Clonmel and they could not muster up sufficient votes against the bloc voting against them.  I may not be correct in all the details, but to the best of my recollection this is what happened. The track was forced to carry on for some time without a licence and then it had to be sold by the people who owned it.  There was a report that...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a certain person&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...was interested and he was told by Mr. So and So...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the reference to the person interested is more specific than I have given&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...there was a report that a certain person was interested and he was told by Mr. So and So: &lsquo;Do not buy it now.  You will get it a lot cheaper later on.&rsquo;  He did not buy it and Mr. So and So stepped in and afterwards bought it.  He was in the position of being the only buyer because he was the only man who was sure that he would get a track licence.  I suggest that the vendor in that case was put in the position that he could not sell at its full value because there was only one man who could buy it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on another witness said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as the Waterford course was concerned, before we applied at all we closed down the track.  We were refused a licence on the ground <Col N="571" /> that it was only so many miles from Clonmel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You would think that Clonmel was the capital of the U.S.S.R.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I then quoted the case of Longford and I found that Kilkenny, although it had no track actually in existence had a licence, although it was well within the prescribed limit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a reference also in the report to Powerstown Park and the chairman of the Minister's advisory committee asks whether Powerstown Park is registered as a separate company. Then follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. So and So: It is a separate company.  There are five members of the standing committee deputed to look after it in trust.  This was the explanation Mr. So and So gave to me.  On the question of finance and as to what they got out of Powerstown Park, we could not get any information after even a lot of cross examination and questions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a reference here to the fact that more serious abuses have been practised with impunity on greyhound tracks which have created an unsavoury atmosphere round the industry.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House by reciting the case of &ldquo;Sarsfield Lad&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Mad Pilot&rdquo;, because when I mention the case of &ldquo;Red Jack&rdquo;, I will have covered them all.  The case of &ldquo;Red Jack&rdquo; was only one of a number referred to in evidence before the committee, and in it there occurs this statement of a Mr. So and So, holding a certain position in the Irish Coursing Club:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. So and So has been a pretty big buyer of greyhounds and has been placed in a rather favourable position in that regard.  With regard to the &lsquo;Red Jack&rsquo; case, I do not think he comes off in a very favourable light.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People who may have been interested in the case of &ldquo;Red Jack&rdquo; at the time it occurred will remember it disappeared. It was like one of the &ldquo;ringers&rdquo; which disappeared very conveniently about three or four years <Col N="572" /> ago.  &ldquo;Red Jack&rdquo; disappeared out of this country and it is said by this witness&mdash;I am not saying whether he is right or wrong&mdash;that one of the prominent officials of the Irish Coursing Club seems to have had a hand in getting &ldquo;Red Jack&rdquo; out of this country. Let me be careful about this.</P>

      <P>Mind you, your own advisory committee thought there was something in these statements.  They would not have spoken about the unsavoury atmosphere that had been created about the greyhound tracks, if it had not been for that.  Like Caesar's wife, the members of the Irish Coursing Club and the standing committee should be above suspicion, and if the Minister wants to ensure that, then he will approach the discussion of this Bill in a reasonable way and will concede that there were good grounds for reforming this industry.  There were abuses and there are abuses to be rooted out.  We will take jolly good care that the spade to root out these abuses is not placed in the hands of those who, if they were not responsible for them, certainly did nothing to prevent them.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the fact of persons being warned off and that it became a treasonable offence against the State to question the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club. Let us see what some other witness had to say about the proceedings.  He offered himself for admission upon terms that he was entitled to.  Whether he was entitled to them or not is not a major matter.  He was refused admission on these terms.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I had reason to go before the standing committee.  I went to the Four Courts and asked Mr. So and So that the case should be heard before the standing committee.  He advised me like a father, and told me that I had no chance and to race my <Col N="573" /> dogs elsewhere.  That is how I was treated, while men who were warned off in connection with the running of dogs were allowed facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the evidence of one witness and I have not seen his evidence challenged. Let it not be forgotten that the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club did not appear a second time before that committee to answer and satisfy the committee that the allegations made against them were untrue.  They thought discretion the better part of valour.  They lost the case, either <i>in absentia</i> or by default.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

      <P>It is to break that monopoly and control, which, I think, has been unwarrantably used, that we are anxious that those who are members of the Irish Coursing Club will be a minority of the board, and that those who have been involved in these proceedings in the way in which they have will be in the majority and endeavour to carry out the recommendations that are so urgently necessary.  Let me come to another case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to victimise the track directors, as such. We are prepared to accept the Labour Party amendment and have two representatives of the tracks on the greyhound industry board and representatives of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  We are doing this in relation to the Irish Coursing Club.  We have an amendment which will allow members of the Irish Coursing Club to submit themselves for election on equal terms with those who are representative members of the club.  I think that is a very fair way of dealing with them.  We do not want to victimise any person on that committee, but we want to make certain that, when this job is done, it will be done properly, and that we will have a clean sport and sound <Col N="574" /> industry.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite irrelevant whether it was sworn on oath or not. This is the evidence upon which the committee based its conclusion that abuses were practised with impunity and that an unsavoury atmosphere was created because of the way in which certain greyhound tracks were managed. Here is an instance of the way in which they were managed:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A girl came in to get fawn dog marked up.  It was supposed to be <Col N="575" /> puppy.  Whether the girl was nervous or whether there was something in the demeanour of the dog which indicated that it was not a puppy, I do not know but the Irish Coursing Club steward refused to mark the dog.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He questioned the girl as to where she got it, how long she had it, who was the owner, and who bred the dog.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The girl became nervous and the steward said he would not mark the dog, that he would hold him-whether he had authority to do so or not.  He frightened the girl so much that the real owner of the dog from a town which was some 50 or 60 miles from this particular track came in to take the dog and there was almost a scene.  When he came in it was obvious from the dog that it was a dog which had done 30.6 seconds in a race at a certain place.  Quite a number of people attend the trials there and it became common gossip. Mr. So and So &mdash; who was not the steward of the Irish Coursing Club but who was a very prominent member of the Irish Coursing Club &mdash; after a while said to the Irish Coursing Club steward: &lsquo;I do not think that is necessary at all.  I think this dog is all right.  You should mark him up.&rsquo;  Mr. So and So, the steward, said he would not and Mr. So and So, the track director, said: &lsquo;Do.  It will be all right.&rsquo;  He marked the dog for the girl and everybody there was waiting for this dog when it appeared on the card.  In about a fortnight's time, the dog appeared on the card under his new name and every mug in such and such a racing track is in to back it.  It was about the time of Galway race meeting.  I happened to be working...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and, mind you, this track was not in Galway&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...in the so-and-so that night and I went to the weigh shed and I met a man there with a brindled dog.  This dog had a cover on him and the man was a long time in taking it off. There was a ritual about it.  I asked this man why he did not race the dog in Galway and he said: &lsquo;I would not forgive them in Galway. <Col N="576" /> They are crooked and I would not register a dog there any more. When all the mug&rsquo;s money is on, in go Mr. So and So's&mdash;the director's&mdash; friends and a dog called &lsquo;Open Event&rsquo; is backed.  His only reason for bringing the dog to be marked was to get the mugs' money on what they thought was a good thing while he has this other man searching the country for something to beat it. He brought &lsquo;Open Event&rsquo; up although I am not saying that the old man I speak of knew about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing &mdash; let us make no mistake about it &mdash; the Minister wants to perpetuate under this Bill. That is the sort of thing we want to prevent and we will prevent it because there will not be a single unsavoury incident that will not be disclosed about this whole industry if the Minister does not mend his approach to the helpful attitude which we on this side of the House took up in the first instance.  We were anxious to see that both the interests of the Irish Coursing Club and the interests of the greyhound track owners would be safeguarded. Above all, we are interested in the men who are the foundation of this industry &mdash; the Irish greyhound owners and breeders and the Irish sportsmen who are the backbone of this industry.  That is our attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister wanted to know what leg we were standing on.  I hope we have sufficiently exposed it.  We are not going to facilitate the Minister in trying to throw a cloak of legality and the protection of the law over people who have, whether by incompetence or otherwise, been responsible for the position of the Irish greyhound industry to-day.  We are perfectly prepared to give every credit that may be due to them for the service they have rendered in the past, but we are not going to close our eyes to the fact that when they were in control of this industry&mdash;as the Minister's own friends have said &mdash; there was created around it an unsavoury atmosphere which, unfortunately and undesirably, has come to be associated with greyhound racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word on this disgraceful performance.  Deputy <Col N="577" /> MacEntee is notorious in this House for the courage with which he slanders the dead and libels the living.  He is particularly apt at slandering the dead for they cannot answer.  He got up here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and read what he pleases to call &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; without telling this House that anyone was entitled to go and say anything he liked, unbound by oath or any kind of guarantee that he spoke the truth.  He did not tell the House that anyone with a grievance was entitled to go there and pour forth his soul in all his sense of grievance &mdash; all his suspicions, all his allegations, under privilege but unbound by oath.  In these circumstances, the commission deemed that honesty and justice forbade the publication of that.  They deemed that, inasmuch as it was not given in public and under the seal of an oath, only those who heard it were properly qualified to weigh its value and to found a report on it.</P>
      <P>We must wait for Deputy MacEntee to walk in here and, in his hatred of the living and of the dead, use the unsworn words of grievance-ridden individuals to utter the dirty slanders that he has not got the guts to utter himself.  There is something very low in those who throw out their chests to slander the dead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that here is the report, made by a body of men well qualified to weigh the statements that were laid before them.  The fact is that I told Dáil Éireann when I brought this whole Bill&mdash;never mind this section&mdash;before them that the reason this Bill was necessary was that the old Irish Coursing Club committee, burdened by the responsibility of management of racing which it was never organised to do, had manifestly undertaken a task which it had not got the requisite powers properly to perform <Col N="578" /> with the result that abuses did exist and it was the existence of those abuses that made necessary the presentation of this Bill.</P>
      <P>We are assured&mdash;and I want to endorse what Deputy Barry intervened to say &mdash; that whatever was reported in that report as being amiss was sought to be corrected by the provisions of this Bill.  I want to recall to this House's mind again that all we have listened to has been evoked to make a case that we cannot get four honest men from this list of 21.  That is what this case is made for.  There is no use in throwing all the dirt you can and then repudiating the clear implication of your words.  All that this section here provides is that four will be chosen from this list of 21, all of whom will, in due course, submit themselves for election.  If they fail to be elected at the hands of the breeders and track owners in their respective provinces they cease to hold office and at the end of two and a half years all future appointments must be made from 21 chosen by the owners, breeders and track proprietors.  I having said: &ldquo;We are all agreed about that.  I think we are all agreed that if you get such a democratically controlled body it is a good thing that they should exercise a predominant influence,&rdquo; Deputy Briscoe, as reported at column 1645, said: &ldquo;There is no doubt about that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this clear, because an energetic attempt is being made to confuse the point at issue.  The elections provided for under the scheduled constitution of the Irish Coursing Club, provide that 21 members of this executive will be chosen by the coursing clubs and tracks in the several provinces.  Lest there be any attempt to raise a fake coursing club to the status of an elector, there is a provision that none will be recognised in that status unless it has actually held a coursing meeting in its own area within the previous 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> I know of no more democratic procedure for choosing this executive than that which is envisaged in the Schedule annexed to this Bill.  I propose to stand on this principle: these shall be the people who will exercise a predominating influence on this board. I look forward confidently to breeders, track owners and all other legitimate interests being represented on this board when it is so constituted.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the making of these appointments is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture. I can only leave it to the House to determine whether or not the present incumbent of that office will discharge that duty honestly.  I look for no certificate of character &mdash; certainly not from Deputy MacEntee.  I would be shocked to receive one from such a source.  But I look to Deputies in the other half of the House for the belief that such a commission, delegated to me, will be faithfully and honourably discharged.</P>

      <P>By the Minister, from members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, is probably open to some question in the <Col N="580" /> minds of a number of interested parties because of the atmosphere of controversy which has raged in regard to the Irish Coursing Club, and to the greyhound industry generally.  I wonder would the Minister consider the inclusion among the members of the board of a representative of the bookmakers who are actively interested?</P>

      <P>I was not here at the time.  I feel that would probably be of some assistance.

      <P>The Minister quoted on several occasions here to-day a remark made by Deputy Briscoe on the Second Reading of this Bill when he said he agreed that representatives from the standing committee should have a predominating influence; and the Minister, by innuendo, wanted to suggest to the House that a predominating influence meant a controlling influence.  He was suggesting that we have been on the one leg all the time on that very point &mdash; that we do not want the Irish Coursing Club to have a majority on the board.  Now I say that a predominating influence is not a controlling influence.  I go further: I point out that the Minister himself could be a predominating influence in the Government but not a controlling influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister quoted Lloyd George, when he said it was very difficult to pick up mercury with a fork; I think Deputy de Valera suggested on that occasion that Mr. Lloyd George should try picking up mercury with a spoon.  I suggest to the Minister that after the interval he should come back here in a less heated mood and try to appreciate that in actual fact there is nothing whatever political in the arguments put up by <Col N="581" /> both sides to-day.  It was the Minister who introduced acrimony into the debate last night when he started his famous quotation from Debrett.  It has been thrown at us that we are not in favour of control of the new board by the Irish Coursing Club, but that we did the same thing in 1945 when we were setting up the Racing Board.</P>
      <P>Let me quote Deputy Cosgrave's attitude in relation to the Racing Board.  There is no analogy whatever. In volume 96, column 1114 of the Official Report, Deputy Cosgrave said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I deprecate strongly, as did Deputy Ruttledge, the rather nasty personal references made to certain members of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  A list of members of the Turf Club was read out yesterday by a Deputy which included a number of people whom he probably would have liked to exclude.  Racing is not politics.  Whatever people's opinions or actions in politics may be, sport is another matter.  Whether the sport be racing, football, hurling, cricket or any other sport, people are interested in it in the same way as other people may be interested in art or anything else.  They enter into it for enjoyment or because it is their means of livelihood.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He goes further and he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While the stewards of the Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee may not have been as go ahead as one might like them to have been, they have, at any rate, conducted the sport cleanly and maintained a high standard of efficiency so far as the actual running of the races and the management of trainers and jockeys are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was no shadow of suspicion of any of the members of either of those bodies.  The only suggestion Deputy Cosgrave made was that they were not as active as they might have been.</P>
      <P>Further, at the close of that speech he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that in nominating a representative he will be able to get one who will speak for the bookmakers. <Col N="582" /> I am not so sure that he will; I imagine he will have some difficulty.  I certainly hope he will not select the bookmaker who has had a good deal to say on this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Minister spoke here last night about freedom and liberty.  I took a note of what he said; we must have some regard for the rights of interested persons in respect of whose business you are in fact legislating.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now coming around to the viewpoint of this side of the House in regard to one specific section &mdash;and I am not taunting the Minister. He is now going to give representation on the Board to the bookmaking fraternity. There are two other sections besides the bookmakers &mdash; the racetracks and the greyhound owners and breeders.  The Minister admitted last night that these are the four main interests in the industry.  We could have saved a lot of valuable time in the House if the Minister came in here to-day and before the amendment was introduced, said a few words to the effect that he was giving the bookmakers representation, that it was his intention to give representation to the racetracks and to the greyhound owners and breeders.  This might have avoided a great deal of unnecessary debate.  Even at this stage the Minister, if he so wished, could refrain from specifying the greyhound owners and breeders and the racetrack representatives. He has agreed to give the bookmakers representation on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He has given a definite assurance about the bookmakers' interests.  The Minister has often said himself that any amendment which is put down and argued in a reasonable manner will be accepted by him.  He has used words to that effect. In any case, the bookmakers will have a representative on the new board.  I do not want to go into the question as to how that representative will be elected or selected, whether the Minister will choose him or whether he will allow the Southern Bookmakers' Association and the Bookmakers' <Col N="583" /> Association in this part of the country to come together and submit a name to him.</P>

      <P>The Minister himself could have brought in a ministerial amendment to cover this point because when the Racing Board Bill was going through in 1945 the bookmakers in particular had a good deal of sympathy from all sides of the House.  To refresh the Minister's memory of what he said at that time might not be out of place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from column 1881, Volume 96, of the Official Debates of the 11th April, 1945.  He spoke at considerable length and, having paid tribute to the bookmakers in Ireland on the lines that but for them, racing might as well close down and that they were the main factor in making the scene at race meetings so colourful, he concluded:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I go so far as to affirm the paradox: the racehorse-breeding industry ultimately depends on the bookmaker's umbrella.  Close one and, sooner or later, you will close the other.  Pursue the policies laid down in this Bill and you will close the bookmaker's umbrella and it may be then too late to save the horse-breeding industry in this country.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The bookmakers are only a small section of the representation which we are seeking on the board.  The greyhound owners and breeders and the racetracks are two other vital interests.  The Minister made a crack <i>sotto voce</i>, if I might use the expression, at the bookmakers earlier on and criticised the unhappy methods they adopted to achieve their aims.  That might be correct or otherwise &mdash; I am not giving an opinion &mdash; but surely a licensed bookmaker has as <Col N="584" /> much right as any ordinary trade unionist to go on strike if he so wishes. The Minister is a sensible man, I hope, and will appreciate that it would be very foolish on their part to wait until the Bill became law.  What would be the use of going on strike then?  They would have to wait until we came back to power to give them justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enact in permanent form measures which were introduced into the House first of all in temporary form in 1945. The House is, no doubt, aware that prior to the last emergency there were very few instances in which export controls of any sort were necessary. There has been for a long time, of course, legislation, statutory enactments, dealing with the prohibition of imports, but, until the last emergency, it was not necessary to have any type of similar controls, prohibitions and sanctions dealing with exports.</P>
      <P>In 1945, a Bill was brought to the Oireachtas and it was designed at the time to enact what had up to then been achieved by Emergency Powers Orders. It was made to expire at the end of five years.  When 1950 came it was reenacted for a further period of five years.  Last year I asked the House to enact it only for a period of 12 months, so that I might see what features in that legislation were desirable by way of permanent enactment. This Bill that is now before the House is the permanent enactment which I am recommending to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the ground that is covered <Col N="586" /> in the Bill.  We all know that there have to be provisions enabling the Revenue Commissioners to prohibit smuggling.  As I have said, there have long been such provisions in respect of inward smuggling.  These provisions are to cover and to prohibit outward smuggling in the same way.  It is necessary, unfortunately, for the economy of the country that we should take powers and provide against certain exports which have developed largely out of the situation arising during the last world war.</P>
    <P>The actual provisions of the Bill are more for the Committee Stage.  I have given the general tenor of the Bill.  If any member of the House wants me to explain at this stage any particular section I shall be glad to do it, but I think the sections are, perhaps, better left until the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £844,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons, Children's Allowances, Unemployment Assistance, Widows' and Orphans' Non-contributory Pensions, and for Sundry Miscellaneous Social Welfare Services, including Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall the two Social Welfare Acts passed last year &mdash; the Social Welfare Act, 1955, which provided for increases in the rates of old age and blind pensions and widows' non-contributory pensions, and the Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) <Col N="587" /> Act, 1955, which authorised the doubling of such pensions in a week in December last.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is mainly to provide for the cost of these improvements which affected approximately 194,000 pensioners.</P>
    <P>The increases in the rates of pensions took effect from the 29th July last and amounted to 2/6 a week for adults, with, in the case of widows' pensions, a further increase of 1/- a week each for one or two qualified children.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparation of the Supplementary Estimate, the position under the other sub-heads of the Vote has also been reviewed.  It has been found necessary to increase the original provision of £130,000 under sub-head H &mdash; Grants Towards the Supply of Fuel for Necessitous Families&mdash;by £35,000. This is mainly due to an increase in the price of machine turf as from the 1st September last and to payments to local authorities of balances of grants in respect of earlier years now falling due on receipt of final audit certificates.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is now estimated that there will be a total saving of £148,000 on the original provisions for other sub-heads of the Vote.  This saving is due mainly to the numbers of recipients of unemployment assistance and of children's allowances being less than had been expected, with consequential savings on the relevant sub-heads.</P>
    <P>The provision in the original Estimate for Appropriations-in-Aid remains unchanged. The effect of the Supplementary Estimate is to increase the net amount required for social assistance in the current financial year to £18,425,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points in connection with this Supplementary Estimate with which I should like to deal.  One is in connection with the increase which was given to a number of social assistance recipients, including old age pensioners, at Christmas.  That was to compensate for an increase in one item for the 12 months.  It does not cover the full increase.  Is any provision being made, or will provision be made in the <Col N="588" /> Budget, for a continuation of this increased payment on the termination of the period at present covered?  In view of the increase in the price of tea, provision should be made for a permanent increase in the relevant social welfare benefits or at least for an increase that would be as permanent as the increase in the price of tea.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the increase of 2/6 per week and the other increases mentioned by the Minister, I thought the Minister would have taken this opportunity of indicating the Government's intention in regard to social welfare payments generally because, since last July, the cost-of-living picture has changed considerably and is changing every day and promises to change considerably during the coming year.  This would be the time and the opportunity for the Minister to indicate the Government's intention in regard to social welfare benefits generally.  If it was found necessary in July last to increase these benefits as a result of the increases in living costs which had taken place, surely there is a much greater necessity now to review the picture and to indicate what the Government intends to do. Every day we have other sections of the community seeking and getting justice.  Wage earners are seeking and getting justice; they are seeking increases solely on the grounds of the higher cost of living.  They have methods by which they can enforce these things.  Fortunately, a good number of employers, including the Government, have admitted that the grounds for such wage increase demands are justified and they have acceded to the demands and granted those increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has done that in other cases, and so have many large employers.  What I would like to hear now is what the Minister and Government intend to do in regard to these people who have no way of enforcing their just claims.  It is almost nine months since the increase for which the Minister is now seeking money was granted &mdash; 26th July, last.  Since then, we have had steep increases in the cost of living and there are promised more increases in the prices of such commodities as coal early in <Col N="589" /> the year now commencing.  This vast body of persons in receipt of social welfare benefits are anxious to know whether they can expect anything from the Government to compensate them for the very great hardships which the present cost of living position imposes on them.  It is only right they should get some indication as to what they can expect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the Minister's Supplementary Estimate to which Deputy Cunningham made a passing reference which I should like to elaborate, that is, the steep rise in fuel prices.  In consequence of that, I would ask the Minister to review the position regarding the extension to necessitous persons and old age pensioners in other towns and cities the provisions already in operation in the chief cities for cheaper fuel during the winter months.  I think representations have been made from time to time to the Minister to extend the provisions of that Estimate, so as to include these people.  I feel sure the Minister is as concerned as we all are about the steep rise in coal prices over the past number of months and it would be a deplorable thing if some households were left without adequate fuel supplies during severe winter weather.  I feel sure the Minister has been considering this and that he will endeavour to extend the scheme as I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with the point made by Deputy MacCarthy in regard to the free fuel scheme.  The Deputy will probably remember that this scheme was not introduced, so to speak, primarily as an assistance scheme back in 1940 or 1942.  It was designed to ensure that people in certain districts in the urban areas and large cities would be guaranteed their supply of fuel.  It is true and reasonable to say that it now may be regarded as an assistance measure. I could not make any promise at the present time in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>

    <Col N="590" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy will realise where my sympathy lies in regard to those people who are depending on coal for heating and cooking. On the general question of certain welfare benefits, it would be wrong for me to boast unduly of the increases for which this Government have been responsible since taking office, but the increases that have been effected in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions compare more than favourably with the increases given in previous years.  This year, an extra £1,500,000 is being spent on these people.  I want to assure the House, and Deputy Cunningham, that I am as conscious of the need for an increase in benefits to the other social welfare recipients as anybody else.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that these people are having my active consideration and, when circumstances permit, as I trust they will in the not too distant future, I hope to bring proposals before the House to provide increases for these people to compensate for the increased cost of living.  But let us not run away with ourselves on that question.  I do not think Deputy Cunningham would concede that, even in the régime of his Government, from 1932 to 1948, and again from 1951 to 1954, all these social welfare benefits were stepped up every time there was an increase in the cost of living.  Old age pensioners had to wait for very long periods before they got their not over-generous increases of 1/6 and 2/6 a week.  I would certainly be in favour of, and would subscribe to, any scheme that would provide increases in these social welfare benefits on the basis of increases in the cost of living.  That would be ideal, and I can assure the House that it would mean far fewer headaches for the Minister for Social Welfare.  I am afraid, however, that at the present moment it would be extremely difficult to devise such a scheme, but we are very conscious of the need for an increase in these benefits. Circumstances permitting, the Government will provide the increases.</P>

Once this board is appointed, it will be responsible for the control of greyhound racing and coursing.

They will have the appointment of all the officers and there is also the question of the remuneration of the officers.</P>
      <P>If we appoint, as the Minister suggests, four representatives from the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, it means that that body has complete control, with four out of seven members.  It follows that the Irish Coursing Club members will have control of the appointment of officers. There is nothing to prevent them from appointing the people they wish to appoint themselves; these can be friends of their own, or people who have been identified with the Irish Coursing Club for a number of years; as a matter of fact, these could be other members of the standing committee. They fix the remuneration they are going to get themselves and there is nothing the Minister can do about that.  They can purchase land or properties; they can sell these lands or properties after purchase.  In other words, they can use the finances that are placed at their disposal because they have the right to borrow up to £25,000 without any permission from the Minister; it is only when they exceed £25,000 that they must go to the Minister for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board can delegate its powers to a sub-committee.  That sub-committee may have the most important functions of all in connection with the <Col N="592" /> industry.  For instance, the control of racetracks may be handed over to it and the issue of permits may be given to this sub-committee, so that it could possibly happen that, instead of a board of seven deciding where a greyhound racetrack might be, or who was to have that racetrack, it might be the four members of the standing committee who would decide it.</P>
    <P>We must remember two things when we talk of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club: One is that 16 of them are not elected representatives of the coursing clubs.  These 16 members represent what are known as&mdash;in my opinion, the best word for them is &mdash; co-opted members; in other words, people who have not been selected or elected by the coursing clubs. It has been demonstrated here tonight, I think, by a number of speakers that, of the 21 people who are on the standing committee, 13 of them are already either directors or in some way connected with racetracks.  I know that many of the names I have read out as being members of the standing committee are interested, in one way or another, in greyhound racing tracks in the country.  If the powers are to be delegated to a sub-committee of four people and if two or three of these are directors of tracks, there is nothing to prevent them from refusing permission to some group to start a track.  We have had that in the past when the Irish Coursing Club standing committee refused such permits.  Waterford was one of the places and we know the reason why Waterford was refused.  You had Waterford, Kilkenny and Clonmel together. Clonmel and Kilkenny were controlled from Clonmel and, because Waterford was going to do damage to Clonmel, it was thought better not to give a licence to Waterford.</P>
    <P>We also had the case of Enniscorthy. There was an application from another place in the area and, because of its proximity to within a 30-miles radius of Enniscorthy, it was refused.  These are part of the functions of the new board, no matter how you may look at it, and, leaving corruption and all the rest of it out, we must remember that these people have been members of the <Col N="593" /> standing committee and had supreme control in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister now proposes to give it to them again.  It has been admitted by Deputy Barry and, indeed, also by the Minister that these people have failed in their duty in the past.  We all know that and the report of the investigation committee indicates that. That report has been accepted by the Minister.  If that report is true, and I have no reason to doubt that it is true, I believe that we are doing a very bad thing for the industry generally if we put these people again in control.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made here to-night regarding the personnel of the new board that in addition to the four members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club the bookmakers would get a representative. That would be five.  Another suggestion has been made that the breeders get representation.  Deputy Sean Collins asked the Minister to give that representation and I think the Minister was agreeable to do so.  It was very easy for the Minister to agree to give representation in a case like that.  There is nothing to prevent him from taking two members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club and saying that they represent the breeders of the greyhounds.  Two others could be said to represent the tracks and others could be taken and said to represent any section of the industry.</P>
    <P>Every member of the standing committee, as far as I know, is also a breeder.  The Minister could not go wrong in picking out one or two of them to represent the breeders.  These are not the people we want to represent the people.  There was an organisation some years ago called the Greyhound Breeders' Association which represented greyhound breeders.  These people had a quarrel with the standing committee of that time.  They did not see eye to eye with the standing committee. If the breeders are to get representation, I believe that these are the people who should be chosen as their representatives.</P>
    <P>The bookmakers are also entitled to representation, but in view of the Minister's assurance in the case of the bookmakers, I am prepared to withdraw our amendment in favour of Mrs. <Col N="594" /> O'Carroll's amendment if she gives a guarantee that she and her Party are going to press that amendment and vote on it.  If we do not get that assurance, then we shall press our own amendment.  The amendment put for ward by the Labour Party is more explicit than ours and it is for that reason that I would support it.  It may have been laxity on our part that we were not as explicit as the Labour people were, but our amendment covers our intentions.</P>
    <P>We want to give representation to every interest in the greyhound industry. We are prepared to give two to the standing committee; one to the racetrack owners; two to the breeders and one to the bookmakers.  The question of the racetrack owners is a simple one from the Minister's point of view. It would be very difficult for the Minister to avoid appointing a racetrack owner in his four, or even in three, of his four nominees from the standing committee due to the fact that the directors of the racetracks represent more than 50 per cent. of the present standing committee.  It is only natural to expect, in view of that, that some of the racetrack owners will have their nomination submitted to the Minister for selection.</P>
    <P>If I got the assurance that I have mentioned from Mrs. O'Carroll that she and her Party would press their amendment and vote on it, I would support that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the somewhat more temperate tone of our discussion. I thought I made it clear, and if I did not I want to make it clear now, that the ultimate responsibility in choosing this board devolves on the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not suppose that any Minister for Agriculture welcomes that responsibility but, in all the circumstances and the history behind this business, I think the Minister has to take that responsibility.  It all depends on whether people believe that the Minister is going to do his job honestly or not.  All I can say is that my purpose is to provide a board which will honestly and efficiently rehabilitate this industry.  To that end I aim primarily to get an independent chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have already said this, but <Col N="595" /> if I have not I want to say it now, that in choosing those six honest, upright men I conceived it to be my duty to see that among them there was fair representation for breeders, track proprietors and coursing clubs as representative of owners, and I think there ought to be a representative of the public, since they are interested.  I think that I made that as clear as crystal.  If I did not, the fault is perhaps mine.  I want to make it clear now.  Some people may regard my undertaking as regards that as insufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the Deputy no discourtesy when I ask him to exonerate me from the obligation to give him any such guarantee.  I have stated my firm intention and I venture to depend on my colleagues to accept that.  If they do not accept it, I am clearly not fit for the job I hold, but I venture to think that they will accept it.  Surely we can get such a board established with the proviso that, in so far as that personnel is drawn from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club, it must submit itself not only to the test prescribed by me but to the test of election under the revised constitution by the coursing clubs and the tracks in each province.  I lay no soothing unction to my soul that what I am now saying is calculated to conciliate the Opposition.  I do not think they want to be conciliated, but I am anxious that the House should know what my intention is.  On that, let there be no doubt or equivocation; my purpose is to secure fair and adequate representation for breeders, track proprietors, coursing clubs and bookmakers on the board which it will be my duty to set up if this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am perfectly willing to accept the Minister's assurance on the point he has just mentioned, is it not possible for the Minister to make this much more explicit? I have no doubt in the world that the <Col N="596" /> Minister intends to act fairly and squarely by everyone, but I have only been in this House a very short time and there are a number of State and semi-State bodies set up by this Government and previous Governments over which this House has absolutely no control.  We cannot even ask a question about them.  It is because of that that I am anxious that the body set up to control the greyhound industry will be constituted in such a way that, in so far as I am responsible, each section shall be represented on its own merits and not as the nominees of some other body.  I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that I am not being unreasonable in pressing my point rather severely, but I am doing it only in the light of experience. with other public bodies for which we can vote money, over the expenditure of which money we have no control, and which have not always acted, in my opinion, in the best interests of the public, whom we are here to represent.</P>
      <P>The Minister has met us to a certain extent.  If he would even give us, as Deputy Collins said, the reason why it was so essential that the Irish Coursing Club standing committee should control the new body I would willingly accept that reason, but the only reason he has advanced so far was based on matters of precedent, that what was done in setting up the Racing Board has to be done here.  Would the Minister not agree with me that when this Bill is starting off and Deputies on his own side of the House have no confidence in the type of board he is setting up, he would or should reconsider that and try to get the unanimous blessing of the House?  I do not think I am asking him to strain himself too far.  He has given me or the House no reason as to why the Irish Coursing Club standing committee should have not less than four members.  It is not &ldquo;more than four&rdquo;, but &ldquo;not less than four&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Dillon is spared to us for a long time as Minister for Agriculture, we might all take it as a certainty that the four selected would be four good men and true, but we have no guarantee.  He cannot give us that guarantee that the board will <Col N="597" /> always be under his control.  If he could, I could readily accept the assurance on the lines I have indicated.  I would ask the Minister once again to reconsider the matter and give me an assurance in a more explicit manner and confirm that the board will be composed on the lines suggested in our amendment &mdash; two from the Irish Coursing Club standing committee, two wellknown prominent breeders or owners or both &mdash; and, as I said this evening, although the Greyhound Owners' Association as such may no longer exist, I am quite certain the Minister would find no difficulty in contacting those people and getting from their ranks desirable people &mdash; one &ldquo;bookie&rdquo;, and one track representative.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee mentioned this evening that of the 21 members of the standing committee there were 13 track directors, and for that reason it would be almost impossible to avoid putting on a track representative as such.  I know one provincial track that has no director on the standing committee, the track mentioned by Deputy Walsh&mdash;Enniscorthy.  I do not think it could follow that the Minister could not avoid a track representative.  I do not know whether they have an association as such, but the Minister, to make this a good Bill and to start it off with a vote of confidence from this House, should get the track representatives together to select somebody they would appoint as the track directors' representative.  I do think it is obvious that there should not be more than two greyhound owners' representatives, prominent breeders and trainers and a bookmaker.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Walsh's suggestion that I should give him necessary guarantees, and that I might have consulted his Party before tabling this amendment, in which case I might feel obliged to give them, I do not think it is quite fair and decent of Deputy Walsh to put it on that basis. Our amendment is a bit more explicit than his own, and I could not possibly guarantee that, if he withdrew his in favour of mine, the Party would necessarily follow the Fianna Fáil Party into the Lobby on the lines indicated by them.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but how can I give guarantees if I cannot get them myself?  If the Minister could give the assurance I am asking for, I think I could.  He has read out 21 names of the standing committee this evening, but he should let us know the particular qualifications of each member of that body to be on the standing committee, whether as a director of a track, a greyhound owner, a member of a coursing club or a trainer.  The House is entitled, I think, to know from what type of men these four are going to be drawn.  If the Minister could show us that they are people on that standing committee who are there because they are breeders and trainers, and he will pick two from that body, I will accept his assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate and I am sure that Deputies would like to dispose of amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  We have not heard from the Minister why he considers it necessary to incorporate in sub-section (1) of Section 9, in lines nine and ten, the words &ldquo;not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club.&rdquo;  The Minister has asked us to accept his assurances on certain things.  I think he would be in a much freer position to give effect to his assurance in a way that would be welcomed by the House if the words in the brackets in lines nine and ten were deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I suggest that the Minister should consider deleting those words, because that would be one way in which the views expressed on both sides of the House could be met.  Why should the Minister tie himself hand and foot, as he is doing in the present sub-section, to the present standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club? It would seem to me that the Minister quite forgets&mdash; whether some people are glad of the fact or very few regret the fact &mdash; that he is not going to be Minister for Agriculture in perpetuity.  His tenure of office may be almost as brief as formerly.  He has told us about the terrible things before the country, if by any chance a Fianna Fáil Minister were to succeed him.  I suggest that, in order to ensure that a Fianna Fáil Minister is bound to give effect to the assurances which he has given the House, he should accept the amendment put down by Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll.</P>
    <P>I think that is a perfectly reasonable way to approach it.  The Minister should look ahead.  He will not sit there until Tibb's eve; he will not be sitting there until doomsday.  In the normal course of events, he will probably vacate that chair in another 18 months at most.</P>

      <P>Neither do we.  We think you are just as well qualified to occupy the Minister's job as the Minister himself.  Having paid that tribute to Deputy Kyne and the Minister, I want to get back to the point I have <Col N="600" /> been making, that the Minister should not tie his hands in this way or the hands of his successors.  The best way to deal with the situation, having listened to the debate, would be to delete the words which stand between brackets: &ldquo;of whom not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club&rdquo;.  Then he can appoint the members of the standing committee of the club whom he wishes. He can appoint four members, if he wishes.  He can appoint only two members of the standing committee of the club; two members of the Greyhound Breeders' Association; one person to represent the track directors and another person for the bookmakers. He would be perfectly free to do that.</P>
      <P>The only thing I am wondering is why the Minister, who always talks in this House about freedom of action and enterprise, should feel it necessary to hamstring himself in this way.  Let him take the shackles off.  Let him not always be the serf of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, but a free man for once, and in this case let his successors be free also.  I suggest that is the best way to deal with the situation.  Since the Minister cannot bring in an amendment at this stage, I urge him to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.  If not, it would be necessary for the House to have an opportunity of hearing from the Minister why it is that he feels it necessary to tie himself up in this way. Houdini himself could not get out of it.</P>

      <P>Speaking on amendment No. 4, which has just been defeated, I asked the Minister to tell <Col N="603" /> the House why he considered it necessary to bind himself by the inclusion in sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the words in brackets &mdash;&ldquo;(of whom not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club)&rdquo;.  I think that, on reconsideration, the Minister will see that that is not only unnecessary, but unwise.  If the Minister were to delete those words he would have absolute freedom of choice and could exercise his discretion according to his best judgment and in accordance with the undertakings he has given to Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, Deputy Seán Collins and others, who have pressed him to do so.</P>
      <P>The assumption underlying the requests, which were made to the Minister to give these assurances, was that the majority of the persons whom he would appoint to the greyhound industry board would not be members of the standing committee of the club.  Now he cannot fulfil his undertaking, at least in the spirit, I think, in which it was accepted, if the words to which I am referring remain in the section; and, therefore, I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared on the Report Stage to bring in an amendment to delete those words, so that, as I have said, he will be able to fulfil the undertaking which he has given and which has been accepted by Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll and Deputy Seán Collins in the spirit in which, I think, they thought the undertaking was given.</P>

I am satisfied that my colleagues accept my undertaking and are prepared to stake their reputation on the belief that it will be honourably fulfilled.</P>

      <P>That is not fair. There is no use asking people to buy a pig in a poke.  There is no use trading on the assumption that this Dáil is composed of credulous persons who will be taken in by a mere confidence trick.  What the Minister is really telling the people whom he induced not to vote for their own amendment is: &ldquo;I have given you assurances, which I intend to fulfil, consistent with the pledges which I have given to the executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister is saying.  If the Minister really wanted to fulfil his undertakings in the spirit in which, I think, they were interpreted by those who accepted them, he would agree on the Report Stage to bring in an amendment to delete the words to which I have referred so often: &ldquo;of whom not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club.&rdquo;  We are not just as guileless as the Minister would wish us to believe and we would like some guarantee that the House will not be deceived and that, in fact, the Minister will undertake to put himself in the position in which he can fulfil the assurances he has given.  That is the next point.  Of course, if we cannot get those assurances, we shall have to divide on the section, and we shall have to try on the Report Stage to rectify the situation which will exist, if the section is carried in its present form.  We would like to free the Minister from these foolish pledges which he has given to the Irish Coursing Club.  We would like not merely to free him, but to see, at the same time, the greyhound industry having a chance to make a new start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 13, to add at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>of whom, for the purposes of a quorum, not more than two shall be members of the executive committee of the club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had accepted one of the two suggestions in the last two amendments, it would not have been necessary to move this amendment, but until he sees otherwise it is quite obvious that the board will consist of seven members, four of whom will be nominees or will be selected from the executive of the Irish Coursing Club. This amendment is designed to bring about some limited control on the activities of these people.  We suggest this addition at the end of the sub-section: &ldquo;of whom, for the purposes of a quorum, not more than two shall be members of the executive committee of the club.&rdquo;  I do not know whether the Minister will strenuously oppose this, but it is regarded as a limited safeguard. If the board consists of seven obviously the quorum will be less than seven.  The quorum laid down in the Bill is four.  There is nothing to stop the four members of the Irish Coursing Club deciding to have a meeting at a time to suit themselves, constituting themselves a quorum and carrying out any business they like in the absence of the other members.  The chairman would be included in the quorum and there would need to be only three of <Col N="607" /> them present.  I would suggest that, whatever the quorum is, only two shall be members of the Irish Coursing Club so that, if the chairman is included in the quorum, at least one representative of other interests must be present.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister would regard this amendment as unreasonable or not, but if the Bill goes through in its present form it is quite obvious that, not only will the members selected from the 21 members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club have a majority on the board but they will be able to monopolise some of the meetings.  I am giving a clear and explicit explanation that the amendment is designed to safeguard the activities of the board from what might be termed the unreasonable influence of one of the four bodies to whom this Bill seeks to give representation and in whose interests the board will work.  I do not know what the Minister will say.  I cannot anticipate strenuous opposition by him to this amendment.  In view of what he has already said and to show that what he said has meaning, I think he will be inclined to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have not the slightest intention of accepting the amendment.  The House has by a substantial majority accepted my assurance that I shall choose six honest persons with an honest chairman to carry on the work of this board and I have not the slightest intention of suggesting, by implication or otherwise, that any individual whom I should consider it my duty to appoint to this board is not a trustworthy person.  If any person is appointed to this board who in his person is unsuitable to constitute a valid part of the quorum, then the blame is entirely mine, but I give the House the undertaking that the six persons I appoint and the chairman will all be persons of honour and integrity, eminently qualified to constitute the quorum of any meeting of this board in the discharge of any business that falls to the duty of this board to transact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. <Col N="608" /> The Minister is taking full responsibility for appointing the board.  He also took full responsibility for the appointment of the investigation commission but he has ignored their report. He thought he could not find people in the country better than the persons he appointed to that commission. Why did he not accept their report on the condition of the greyhound industry?  He is now trying to put it across that when he takes responsibility for appointing all these honest men to this board that they, too, will be above reproach.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt about what will happen if four of these gentlemen get together.  I am not afraid to state it. The same thing happens in every organisation or where any group is concerned.  The same thing would apply even if the Minister were in it. When you are dealing with human beings human nature asserts itself.  If two or three of them are members of the standing committee, if it is a question of doing something that will aid the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club or themselves, they will do it.  The Minister should not think they will do anything else.  It would be foolish to try to make the House believe that anything else would happen.</P>
      <P>I have not that exalted opinion that the Minister has of many of the people who are engaged in any of these businesses. I have as wide experience as the Minister, possibly wider, regarding them.  If the Minister is taking necessary precautions to see that the industry is properly run, he must take cognisance of these facts.  The only way in which he can make assurance doubly sure that the affairs of the greyhound industry will be properly run is to ensure that no interest, whatever it may be, will have a monopoly on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Section 9, I mentioned that they have the right to buy property, to expend money up to £25.000, without the approval of the Minister.  There is nothing to prevent these four gentlemen, whoever they may be, buying that property and spending that money.  There is nothing to prevent them disposing of the <Col N="609" /> property.  When there is a body representing a certain interest there is the temptation to help that interest.  Application may be made for a racing track or some such concession that will be within the power of the board to grant. It may not be given because it might interefere with the interests of some of the gentlemen on the board.  Deputy Briscoe has pointed out that if you have a representative of another interest, he is going to ensure these things will not happen.  I can see no reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment.  There is nothing revolutionary in it; it is only plain common sense to take these precautions, and I respectfully ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whose is the hidden hand that seems to be holding the Minister back, because the Minister is a person who, as a rule, likes to have the greatest freedom of exercise, the greatest room for manoeuvre.  Here, however, he appears to have spancelled himself by some sort of undertaking given to the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  It is all very well to come in here in the role of a Simon Pure, but we have had some experience in regard to these matters and would prefer to see the Minister binding himself by law to ensure that it would not be possible for a clique to be organised outside the board to secure control and, when suitable opportunity arose, to serve its own interests rather than the interests of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister comes in here, I will not say, blandly &mdash; I do not think his conduct in this debate could be characterised as bland; on the contrary, he seems to be very annoyed &mdash; and looks as if he felt he had put himself in an impossible position.  I doubt if he studied this Bill before bringing it into the House; he does not seem to have grasped the implications of some of the proposals.  It is too late now to do anything to undo mischiefs which the acceptance of Section 9 would impose, but we have in Section 10 the opportunity of trying to ensure that, even if the Minister has bound himself to appointing not less than four members of the standing committee of the Irish <Col N="610" /> Coursing Club, at least he will ensure that, when business is being transacted, half of those who are present at the meeting will not be members of the Coursing Club &mdash; will be independent, in fact, of the club.</P>
    <P>I think that is very desirable from the point of view of the public interest.  The Minister does not make any attempt to justify the provisions of this Bill.  He is asking the House to accept it, because of his own personality. Now the Minister has shown himself to be very gullible on occasions.  I have heard the Minister in this House making statements from which, when he had to repeat them on oath, he had to run away.  He was led into this impossible position by giving ear to things which were said, slanders which were spread by some of those people undoubtedly associated with the coursing club.  After the Minister has done the damage, is the Dáil to be faced with the prospect of some other Minister coming in here and trying to undo the harm which the provisions contained in Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill undoubtedly will result in?</P>
    <P>I want to hear some sort of an assurance and a warning on these points.  When contributing to the debate on amendment No. 2, the Minister said that nothing is irrevocable.  I hope that will impress itself upon those who are, in fact, controlling the Minister in this matter.  The Minister, we know, appears to be a marionette, a cat's-paw for some outside influences. After all, the Minister will not always occupy that seat, and let everybody realise this: if there should be any abuse of their position by those who are now the pets of the Minister, there will be an opportunity later to revoke certain provisions of this Bill, and that revocation will not carry any compensation. We are not going to be treated in this House with the contempt the Minister hag manifested all through these proceedings.</P>
    <P>When discussing the amendment to Section 6 of the Bill, the Minister was unable to give a solid argument in support of his desire to bring the board into existence before the Irish Coursing Club had been reorganised, and the only reason why he was unable to do that was that he is the mere <Col N="611" /> puppet, the instrument of interests outside this House.  He introduced this Bill in terms of undisguised contempt for everybody associated with the sport of coursing and greyhound racing and in any way involved in the greyhound industry.  Let any person who doubts that read the Minister's speeches introducing and winding up the Second Reading of the Bill and the debates which took place on amendments Nos. 3 and 4 and on amendment No. 2, in which the Minister used arguments which might have some relevance, if they had been addressed to the House on amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  In the debate on this amendment, the Minister has not even attempted to justify his rejection of it. He has simply said by implication: &ldquo;I am tied to the Clonmel interests; I am tied to the owners of the greyhound tracks, and I am not going to do anything which will loosen their grip on the greyhound interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister's attitude here has shown that he is barren of argument, but not empty of words.  We know that the Minister has a reservoir of words which flow, without meaning, like water from a cistern, but in this matter we will not be treated with the outrageous contempt which the Minister has manifested, and before the debate ends, there are some other documents that can be adduced, and the Minister will have an opportunity of considering them and they will be on the records of the House to condemn the Minister when at a later stage we bring in a Bill to rectify the mistakes of this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced this amendment and approached it from a very simple point of view, hoping that the Minister might take a reasonable view of it.  Would the members of the House look at Section 10?  In sub-section (3) (a) of that section provision is made that &ldquo;the chairman of the board shall, if present, be chairman of the meeting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>He need not be present, but the quorum of four nominees of the Irish Coursing Club can hold their meeting. Sub-section (b) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If and so long as the chairman <Col N="612" /> of the board is not present or if the office of chairman is vacant, the members of the board who are present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister had in this section provided that no meeting would be held until there is a chairman, one might say there would be no need for all this suspicion, but what guarantee have we got that this board will not meet without its chairman at the very first meeting, and proceed to do all these things contained in sub-section (6) of Section 10?  They will frame their standing orders and the proecdure of business of the board, and when the poor chairman comes along, this will all have been decided, and no matter how he might want to alter it, he is only one of the minority side.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that with that kind of a section in the Bill, subsequent to the other sections which have been debated at such length&mdash; particularly Section 9 &mdash; that the amendment is outrageous?  I cannot understand what his attitude is.  I subscribe entirely to what has been said by Deputies Walsh and MacEntee.  It seems to me as if this Bill has been deliberately designed, first of all, to give control to one of the four interests and then throughout the Bill, in case there would be any chance of any of the other interests defending themselves and doing something for themselves, they will be precluded from so doing by these very peculiar sections, all the way designed, at every step of the ladder they have to go up and down in their activities, so that something can be done only by one section of these four interests.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacEntee, but I express the hope that it will not be long before a change will come, so that no harm will be done, and that a subsequent Minister for Agriculture will be able to remedy what I regard as the very sincere grievances arising from this particular Bill.  The Minister, as I said, does not seem to appreciate that, even according to this section, if there was no chairman &mdash; due to his not having been appointed after the establishment date, or due to absence of the chairman appointed&mdash;<Col N="613" /> the four gentlemen from the Irish Coursing Club could, in fact, control entirely and absolutely every activity and operation and make every decision, even against the interests of the other sections.</P>
    <P>As I said when I was introducing the amendment, they could call a meeting at a time inconvenient, say, for the representative of the bookmakers, and could decide at that particular meeting matters of the most vital interest to the bookmakers, while their representative was not present, because it was not convenient, although it was convenient for the other gentlemen who formed the quorum.  There has been, from all sides of the House, criticism of the giving of so many seats on this board to one body that is represented there.  There have been efforts made and amendments discussed at great length to try to change that situation, and now we come to the quorum itself of the board, and we find it may no longer be a majority of the board representing the Irish Coursing Club which will conduct its business, but that a quorum of the board, consisting entirely of these gentlemen, can still conduct all the business of the board.  That is why I think the Minister should take another &ldquo;think&rdquo;, if he wants to pacify some of the people or interests who feel they will be grievously affected ultimately by the decisions of this body, if the board is set up as envisaged in the Bill and continues to act in accordance with its different sections.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Walsh, I think, have the same view, that the sooner a time comes when there is a change and when there is another Minister for Agriculture, the better, so that the objectionable provisions in this Bill can be amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a good deal of discussion dealing with various points raised here to-night and on this amendment I should like to refer to the one request that has been made to the Minister since the House began to discuss the Bill, that is, that it should cater for all interests.  Every speaker, no matter on which side of the House, <Col N="614" /> asked the Minister to give an opportunity of having a reasonable or fair representation on this new board.  The Minister has promised to do that, but the Minister's promise is not legislation. In know, with the best will in the world, the Minister will see as long as he is there that everything will go on all right; at least, he has given the House that assurance.  Nevertheless, in my experience of this House, legislation by promise is no legislation at all.</P>

The only thing I wish to say to the Minister is this: I am one of the interested parties in the Irish Coursing Club and I have been associated with coursing since 1924, and I do want to say that I am very concerned that all interests should be fairly met.  We are here to do our job impartially, justly and above board. I cannot speak too highly of the people I have been associated with in the Irish Coursing Club.

      <P>The amendment seeks to add at the end of the sub-section; &ldquo;of whom for the purposes of a quorum not more than two shall be members of the executive committee of the club&rdquo;.  The Minister has to deal with a feeling that has been created in the country outside this House, but that suspicion is in the House also, and surely the Minister should consider this point again and say to himself: &ldquo;I am setting up a new board to deal fairly with this industry and I am <Col N="615" /> going to try to meet the wishes of the Dáil as far as possible.&rdquo;  In meeting the wishes of the Dáil, he will meet the wishes of the people of the country, and I do not think that will involve any injustice, even to the people with whom I am associated.  I cannot see that there is any injustice at all in it, particularly if there is a fair and equitable discussion and impartial people are dealing with the matter and various interests are represented. Surely in that case you are bound to get justice and fair play; one would be afraid to do anything wrong in case it would come back on oneself.</P>
      <P>I want to see how far one could go to be just and honourable in the Bill. If the Minister could think of some way of meeting the point raised in the amendment and going further than he is going at present, I would be very glad.

      <P>The Minister has apparently become adamant in his refusal to accept this amendment.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not seen any sign of that.  We have put forward reasonable amendments on this section and I do not know if the Minister has really seen the implications of Section 10 at all yet.  There is a number of other sections in this Bill that will be governed by the actions of this committee. The fact of having four people <Col N="616" /> responsible for all the activities of that board makes it incumbent on us to see that we are not going to give a majority to one particular interest in the industry.</P>
      <P>Let me take one instance.  Suppose these four men constitute a committee and that they are dealing with the sale of greyhounds.  If they have an interest in any particular individual, there is no reason why that individual would not be given a complete monopoly of the sale of greyhounds in this country and there is no one to say yea or nay to that decision.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister place himself in that position?  He is flying in the face of God's goodness when he tempts a group of people to that extent.  One of these people may be a person who is interested in an auctioneering firm, in greyhounds or in a particular track and the board could decide that greyhounds could not be sold at any other track in this country but that one. The Minister is now legislating for a situation such as that.  He is asking this House to make it possible to have that done.  Does the Minister think that he is working in the interests of the public generally or the industry generally or in his own interests by having such a provision in the Bill?</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that that could not happen but it could.  There is nothing to prevent its happening. The same thing applies regarding permits for tracks and with regard to bookmakers.  That committee could decide on what records are to be presented.  That committee could appoint inspectors to visit the bookmakers' premises and not merely inspect the records dealing with greyhounds but possibly the records dealing with every bet that was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the responsibilities that are now being entrusted to the board and the board can delegate all these responsibilities to a sub-committee. That sub-committee could be composed of people who have an interest, a very genuine interest possibly, in one particular phase of the industry.  I think the Minister should think carefully over this.  I do not know if he has <Col N="617" /> given it all the consideration it requires but this section and Section 9 are the two sections that govern this Bill.  All the other sections are incidental to Sections 9 and 10, which deal with the formation of the board, the sub-committees of the board and the functions that will be carried out by that board and these sub-committees.</P>
    <P>The sections of this Bill that are affected by our amendments to Sections 9 and 10 are Sections 12, 13, 16, 17, 21, 22, 33 and 39.  There is a clause in every one of these sections that is affected by Section 10.  We are trying to amend Section 10 so as to make it impossible for any particular section or interest to decide the future of the industry.  I cannot understand why the Minister objects to this.  What is the reason for not accepting this reasonable amendment?  It is a safeguard. It is not brought in in any spirit of bitterness to the Irish Coursing Club and it is not proposed in any spirit of making the Bill unworkable. It is not proposed in any spirit of dissatisfaction with the people who might comprise the board but simply for the reason that I believe it will make the Bill a better Bill than it is now, that it will make it more workable and to ensure more integrity and honesty in the people who will have the task of conducting the affairs of the board.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment and to see all the implications that are involved.  I think that if he gave it the consideration it deserves he would not have any hesitation in accepting the amendment as put forward by us.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me say this to the Minister, that whenever he speaks no matter what he says he certainly <Col N="618" /> never wearies the House.  He may on occasion amuse and interest the House.  The Minister must not forget that every section of this Bill is bound up with the authority which the board will ultimately have.  The board will, of course, have control in its present form over who auctions dogs for export.  It will probably license such persons as auctioneers and all the rest of it.  I am amazed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity even at this stage to point out to us that the report from his advisory body shows that the number and value of dogs fell, from 1946 to 1950, from £1,000,000 to £422,000.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Deputy Briscoe very frankly is interlarding his observations with the aside &ldquo;as I said before&rdquo;.  Surely even on the Committee Stage there is a limit to the number of times that you are entitled to say the same thing.</P>

      <P>I am coming to other points.  I did say that it could arise that four of those members could decide matters concerning bookmakers' interests, the bookmakers' representatives not being present.  I am now going to say something I did not say, that the Bill gives this board authority to select auctioneers.  There are interests of the greyhound breeders and greyhound owners who may consider that their representatives should have a voice in that particular decision.  It may be made over their heads.  The board decides about the licensing of tracks, the granting or refusal of licences, or the stopping of existing ones.  Those decisions could be made without the representative the Minister has promised to try to get in of the track owners.  The purpose of the <Col N="619" /> amendment is to try to show that if there is going to be the slightest semblance of democratic control at least that safeguard is necessary.</P>
      <P>I was going to say, by way of an aside, that the Minister has told us many things which were so irrelevant on the previous discussions of the previous sections that I wondered why he did not blame the <i>Irish Press</i> for the fall in the export of dogs both in number and value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that if the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment, which is designed to bring about a safeguarding of all interests in view of the whole set up, which is so exceptional in comparison with any other such board, would he be prepared to increase the number of the quorum to be the full membership of the board, or to limit the type of decision that should be taken when the full membership of the board is not there, or to say that there shall be a rule that only matters concerning the interests of those who are there shall be discussed when such a meeting takes place with a quorum at which only one interest is represented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that this amendment has some merit when related to that situation?  The Bill is going to hand over interests not at the moment under the control of the Irish <Col N="620" /> Coursing Club.  There were certain interests which they did manage to effect control over, and this Bill now is bringing in new operations not previously attended to by them.  Therefore it is reasonable to suggest that because of that there should be some safeguard, some reduced number of those who represent any particular interest, rather than to have the full quorum to be in effect, as I say, the four from the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not attacking the individual members. I do not know who they will be. I do not know who will be the successors of the present ones.  But I do say that the Minister should not just take the line now of sitting down, having for the moment anyway achieved victory over the previous amendments which were so vigorously discussed, and now, in a matter of this kind, on this particular amendment which is subsequent and required subsequent to sections being passed as they were designed and prepared, he should just say: &ldquo;I have nothing more to say.  I am not going to accept it.&rdquo;  I want to assure him that we did not hurriedly design this amendment.  We considered the Bill in its entirety.  We considered it from every aspect possible, and we are trying to make it what the Minister says he wants &mdash; a Bill that will work with satisfaction and will secure and continue to have the full confidence of all sections of our community that are interested in any particular aspect pertaining to the greyhound industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister still remains mute of malice, because I had unfortunately to leave the House to do a little research, research which has, I think, solved for me at any rate the mystery of the Minister's silence.  The Minister has been asked in the course of the debates on previous amendments to say why it was that he was tying himself hand and foot to the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club. The Minister, who is on most occasions voluble and expansive, bares his bosom and his inmost thoughts about this, that and everything, has during the course of this debate being woefully restrained.  I have been wondering why.  I think I have solved the <Col N="621" /> mystery, and found a solution of the problem as to why it is that the Minister has thrown over the recommendations of his own advisory committee in relation to this Bill to establish the Irish Coursing Club in control of the Irish greyhound industry.  That is what will happen if this greyhound industry board is set up, without the safeguards which we have endeavoured to have incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a very far reaching one, as Deputy Walsh pointed out in the discussion on amendment No. 4.  It not merely gives the board control of greyhound racing and totalisators but also controls to a large extent greyhound sales and the export of greyhounds.  It is in a position to confer benefits upon certain individuals.  I am sure that those of us who listened to the Minister in this House, when he was in opposition denouncing the Government and all its works and pomps, will wonder why it is that the Minister has been at pains to introduce in this House legislation to establish firmly in control the vested interests in the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, I think, found the solution, and if any Deputy is curious about the point, he can turn to Volume 132 of the Official Report.  In column 862, he will read some very curious correspondence. There was an exchange of documents.  When high contracting parties enter into a treaty, it is generally done by an exchange of documents and there was on this occasion an exchange of documents. &ldquo;My dear Seán&rdquo;&mdash; it was not I, I may say, but a somewhat ambitious statesman anxious to establish himself as a world figure, who was breaking into Irish public life at that time and had an organisation behind him known as Clann na Poblachta.  This idea of &ldquo;My dear Seán&rdquo; grew into &ldquo;My dear Pat&rdquo;. In the course of his letter, he gave &ldquo;My dear Pat&rdquo; an undertaking that, if he was returned to power and was sufficiently influential, licences to establish totalisators would be granted to the proprietors of the greyhound racing tracks.  Now, mark the year 1948!  Who shall say that the Coalition does not fulfil its bargains?  Who shall <Col N="622" /> say after this that the Coalition has not a long memory?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How does this matter arise on the amendment? We are dealing with the composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are dealing with the composition of the board, but, if you refer to Section 9, it will be seen that the board is to be appointed by the Minister and is to consist of six persons, of whom not less than four shall be members of the standing committee of the club.  I am addressing myself to the fact that this board is merely going to represent the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club as at present constituted.</P>
      <P>How is the Irish Coursing Club constituted at the moment?  It has 21 members and it is admitted now that, of the 21, 13 are directors of greyhound racing tracks and it is to these 13 directors of the greyhound racing tracks that the greyhound industry board will be handed over.  That is why the Minister tied himself, as a result of a bargain, to appoint not less than four members of the standing committee of the club to the board.  That is why the Minister is refusing to accept this amendment which we are putting in as a safeguard.  If he were to accept this amendment, then he could not fulfil the undertaking to permit the owners of greyhound racing tracks to establish totalisators.</P>
      <P>Of course, he has not the audacity to come here and do it barefacedly and openly.  Oh, no; not at all!  The Minister adopts a subterfuge.  He acts behind a camouflage and the camouflage is the greyhound industry board which the Minister is setting up under this Bill &mdash; a greyhound industry board which will be controlled by &ldquo;my dear Paddy&rdquo; and his good friends.</P>
      <P>Let us carry this a little bit further. It has been the custom on occasions to read letters about subscriptions in this House.  Let us hear how &ldquo;my dear Paddy&rdquo; responded when &ldquo;my dear Seánin&rdquo; gave this undertaking to his &ldquo;dear Pat&rdquo;.  I am quoting from the Official Report, column 865:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am enclosing a statement of policy as affecting the greyhound industry, <Col N="623" /> which I have obtained from Mr. Seán MacBride, Clann na Poblachta leader, in reply to a questionnaire addressed to him which is a very logical exposition of the position as affecting the two industries. In addition to obtaining funds, I consider it the duty of every greyhound owner &mdash; and a good investment &mdash; to &mdash; support this man's policy by sending me a subscription, which will be duly acknowledged by my headquarters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the exchange of documents. There is the explanation of Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill.  There is the promise given on the one hand by the man who claims he brought the Coalition into existence in 1948; there is &ldquo;my dear Paddy&rdquo; appealing on behalf of &ldquo;my dear Seánin&rdquo;; and here is the Bill which implements the contract. We have heard a great deal about dance hall proprietors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But here is the Minister handing over to this board the control of an industry which may well represent many millions to the Irish farmer.  The people who are going to control these totalisators are not men of straw, but one way or another they are the gentlemen who entered into that contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why the Minister has not been prepared to discuss the provisions of this Bill in a rational way.  He has tied himself hand and foot.  He is mute of malice &mdash; mute because he has not the audacity to try to find arguments to support the provisions which he has incorporated in the Bill.  And the only argument he can use in support of this Bill is the fact that his then friend and colleague, Deputy MacBride, gave an undertaking to &ldquo;My dear Paddy&rdquo;, as a result of which &ldquo;My dear Paddy&rdquo; appealed for funds, funds which helped to put the first Coalition into power and everybody was told, in fact, that this was not a political contribution, that it would be a good investment which would yield dividends. And the dividends we are going to see manifested, when we come to consider the extent of them, <Col N="624" /> will be the property of the Irish Coursing Club which is going to be vested in the hands that will now control it.</P>
    <P>I warned the Minister about the way he was treating the Opposition in its attempt to make this Bill a workable Bill and to ensure that the greyhound industry would be cleaned up and an end be put to those most serious abuses which have been practised with impunity in greyhound racing and that the unsavoury atmosphere which has come to be associated with the greyhound industry as a whole would be cleared away.  We have told the Minister that we are anxious to co-operate with him in this Bill.  We accepted the principle of the Bill that there should be a greyhound industry board; we accepted the fact that, in view of the public demand for it, totalisators would have to be established; there were some objections to that; we accepted that, in general, there should be a certain control of the export of greyhounds in order to ensure that only genuine dogs would be exported.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which seeks to establish a monopoly, is entirely unacceptable to the Opposition in its present form.  We cannot understand why it is that the Minister is not prepared to accept helpful suggestions from this side of the House.  I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to nominate the Earl of Sefton and the Earl of Enniskillen who, according to the document circulated, were part of the personnel of the Irish Coursing Club from 1916 to the present day?  He has just as much right to nominate them as, perhaps, members of the Racing Board but, in view of the statements he made last night, I assume the Minister has in mind to select his nominees from the 13 of the 21 members of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club who control greyhound racing tracks in this country and the 13 members who were party to that bargain between Deputy MacBride, as he was then, Deputy MacBride as he has come again to be to-day, and his good friend &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We did not want to bring these things out and we should not have brought them out and we would not have brought them out: let us be quite <Col N="625" /> clear about that.  We did not wish to expose these things but, since the Minister &mdash; and he was warned &mdash; is not prepared to discuss this Bill as a free agent, we shall disclose the facts to the public.  Quite obviously, the Minister is not prepared to discuss this Bill as a free agent because he is not free to discuss it.  There is some bargain behind all this &mdash; some bargain which has compelled the Minister to tie his hands by binding himself to select not less than four members of the standing committee of the club.  Because he is not a free agent, we are going to disclose to the public why he is not a free agent &mdash; and that is only the first of the documents that will emerge in due course.</P>
    <P>Before this debate goes any further, I would suggest that, between now and when the Dáil reassembles next week, the Minister should re-examine his position and see whether he is going to be prepared to maintain it throughout the course of this debate because, I am telling you, it will not reflect credit upon the Minister or those who are associated with him in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister circulated what purports to be an explanatory document of this Bill.  I have referred to it before.  I did not go very far into it because I was hoping that some understanding might be reached.  On page 3, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provision in Section 9 that four of the seven members of the board should be appointed by the Minister from among the members of the standing executive committee of the club was not recommended by the advisory committee...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from that, that his advisory committee had, in fact, recommended <Col N="626" /> possibly a lesser number. The amendment to Section 10 becomes more vital and more important because what did the advisory committee recommend? They recommended that the Irish Coursing Club should have no representation whatever on this board. Does the Minister deny that?</P>
    <P>This is a document which one usually reads in good faith and assumes that, behind it, the Minister is trying to explain to the Dáil possibly what the Bill means and where he is advised on slight disagreement.  But the advisory committee &mdash; and I want to emphasise that &mdash; and perhaps Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll may not have read this, recommended that the Irish Coursing Club membership should not be on it at all &mdash; not one.  Why?  On page 57 of the report of the advisory committee on the greyhound industry, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After careful consideration, we are in agreement with the general demand for a control board and hereby recommend that such body be established by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Every witness who advocated a control board was requested to give his view as to how the board should be constituted and what interests&mdash;if any&mdash;should have direct representation on it.  It is perhaps only natural that certain interests, e.g., racing track managements, course bookmakers, bookmakers' assistants and the Irish Coursing Club itself, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;mind you, put last&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>would each feel entitled to representation. The bulk of opinion as revealed both in memoranda and during oral evidence was, however, opposed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What has this to do with the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is simple. Section 10 gives this control board set up by this Bill power to have a quorum. That quorum has full authority and, under this Bill, the quorum would constitute possibly on very many occasions absolute operation of its activities by the members or the representatives of the Irish Coursing Club.  I am pointing out that there <Col N="627" /> must be a safeguard, at this late hour, against their getting absolute monopolistic control when, in fact, the advisory committee to the Minister did not want these to have any representation whatever on this board.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking about blackmailers. There are other forms of sinners in this world besides blackmailers. What can one think of a Minister who circulates this document as an explanatory memorandum to members of good faith in this House who would assume from it that the only difference between him and his advisory committee is the exact number of representatives that should be put on this board, when, in fact, he has palmed off this document in spite of the recommendation of his advisory committee not to have one of them on the board?  Does the Minister deny that?  No wonder he is silent.  That is why this amendment is of vital importance and that is why what I am saying and what we are all saying here is quite in order and relevant. Let me continue the quotation now:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the bulk of opinion as revealed both in memoranda and during oral evidence was, however, opposed to sectional representation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was pointing out&mdash; and I accept the ruling of the Chair in regard to it &mdash; that Section 10 lays down the quorum for operation of the committee of management set up under Section 9.  Section 9 points out that not less than four of this governing body shall be representatives of this Irish Coursing Club; and Section 10 lays down the quorum for the meetings of this body and it lays down that four shall be the quorum.  I say that it is dangerous to have as a quorum the four to whom we have been objecting as having a majority on the full board and we want some safeguard that this quorum shall not consist of more than two of the Irish Coursing Club representatives, and then the other two representatives of other interests.  We assume the chairman will not be an Irish Coursing Club representative.</P>

      <P>Subject to your ruling, I want to make this submission.  The Minister, notwithstanding the advice he got from his advisory committee, which examined this matter, notwithstanding that advice and in spite of it, decided to put in charge of this body a majority of representatives of the Irish Coursing Club.  The advisory committee said: &ldquo;Put none on, you cannot trust one of them.&rdquo;  Now the Minister has designed Section 9 which gives these people a majority.  He has designed Section 10 which, again, makes that majority an absolutely controlling majority because of the fact that the four he wants on the board can constitute the quorum of actual management.  I, therefore, feel that it is quite relevant to read the recommendations contained in this report from the Minister's own advisory committee as to why that should not be done.  I hope the House will bear with us this time and at this late hour and, remembering the position we have reached in relation to the Bill, try to put a brake &mdash; even a brake &mdash; on the activities of these people.  I am, subject, of course, to your ruling as to whether or not I am in order in making that point.</P>

I do not know how many people in this House knew that the recommendation of this advisory body was against any representation of the Irish Coursing Club and other sectional interests.  Yet, here we are handing over lock, stock and barrel absolute control, with no safeguard whatsoever.  The more one examines into it and the more one reads the relevant documents the more one regrets that the amendments we designed were not even more violent in their opposition to the Irish Coursing Club since it has now emerged in this House that this Bill stands or falls on the acceptance by this House of majority control by the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to say that had the amendment to Section 9 been passed the Minister would have said here what he said outside: &ldquo;If certain sections are not carried as they are in the Bill I will withdraw it.&rdquo;  Let me tell the Minister now &mdash; I am sure other Deputies know this &mdash; that all the other <Col N="630" /> interests concerned would rather see this Bill dropped than see it made an Act of Parliament because their positions &mdash; all of them, individually and collectively&mdash;will be worsened as time goes on, if this Bill is passed in its present form.  Therefore, I am not surprised really at the silence of the Minister.  If the Minister had even a semblance of a case to put up against our argument we would have heard him rising to the highest pitch of histrionics, which only he is capable of reaching.  But he is like the bold boy to-night &mdash; he has no argument.</P>

As Deputy MacEntee has pointed out, we will have to go over all this again on the Report Stage.  We are going to design an amendment to Section 9 and we will also design, if this is not passed, a further amendment to remedy the situation because this matter is of absolute and vital importance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe wound up on a nice note.  He said that probably the Minister did not understand what the members in the Fianna Fáil benches were saying.  That is the only true thing he said in his speech. Several Fianna Fáil Deputies have condemned the Irish Coursing Club. Others, such as Deputy Burke, praised that organisation.  We cannot, therefore, blame the Minister if he does not understand; it is very hard to know what the Fianna Fáil Party want. Deputy Briscoe reminded me of the electric hare because he seemed to be so electrified about it all.  Of course, he wanted to keep on the racket, so to speak, that Deputy MacEntee tried to organise here and found what I can only describe as a mare's nest.  He came in here quoting a certain volume. It would remind one of the days when the dance tax was remitted and the price of bread increased for a certain political purpose.  The Minister was <Col N="631" /> supposed to have quoted something that Deputy MacBride said to some other body or some other body said to Deputy MacBride.  There is an old saying: &ldquo;A guilty conscience haunts the guilty mind.&rdquo;  That is the position with Deputy MacEntee.</P>

For heaven's sake, let us finish with the electric currents generated by Deputy Briscoe in trying to make a case and the mare's nest discovered by Deputy MacEntee. The Minister has brought this Bill before the House, saying to the Opposition: &ldquo;If you have any suggestion that will help, and we think it will help, it will be accepted; or, if you have any suggestion to take from, which we think will help, that will be accepted also.&rdquo;  Of course, there has been no suggestion of any improvement.

      <P>I submit that if the views of the House, as expressed on both sides, are to be implemented, then this is a vital amendment.  I think I can convince the Minister of that in this way: when the Minister did not <Col N="632" /> accept either of the amendments tabled to Section 9, he is now in the position that he may appoint all six who are members of the Irish Coursing Club. For example, a man may be a breeder or an owner of greyhounds and may be put on a list submitted to the Minister but at the same time he may be a member of the Irish Coursing Club. There is nothing to prevent a bookmaker being a breeder or a large shareholder in a track &mdash; I do not know whether he could be a director of a track &mdash; and if a person's name is submitted to the Minister, regardless of whether that person is a bookmaker, a farmer, a labourer or a carpenter, he may still be a member of the Irish Coursing Club.  If the Minister wants to avoid the difficulty, he must say: &ldquo;He is a member of the Irish Coursing Club and even though he is put up by the interests concerned I cannot select him.&rdquo;  If this amendment is passed he cannot have all the board as members of the Irish Coursing Club.  Therefore, when the breeders are asked to put up a list to the Minister, he must be satisfied that that list does not include members of the Irish Coursing Club.  Then he will at least have two on his board who will not be members of the Irish Coursing Club and out of a quorum of four, which is the essential minimum, he will have two outside the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental question involved here and I am sorry that the Minister let this come, as a natural growth from the past, that the people concerned, knowing their responsibilities and their rights under the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though I have nothing to say about the members &mdash; I am not a bit interested in racetracks because I do not know sufficient about them &mdash; I am interested in the greyhound industry, in open coursing and in park coursing and that is why I am so anxious to have the breeders and the owners represented.</P>

      <P>I shall try.  As I have often said before, we must try in this House to separate ourselves from our affiliations outside and do justice while we are here.  In doing that, I am respectfully asking the Minister to look upon this amendment to Section 10 in a fair and impartial way and to say: &ldquo;Here is an amendment which has only one intention, to see that justice and fair play will be administered at all times.&rdquo;  The fact that I have certain affiliations does not prevent me from doing in this House what I believe justice demands I should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="634" /> If the Minister accepts this amendment no one can say but that he has contributed something worth while to the industry.  If in the light of experience things go wrong and some undesirable people come along and injure the industry, the Minister has the matter in his own hands provided he is Minister during the transition period when this Bill is coming into operation.  All we are asking is what everyone would like to see in any walk of life, a fair balance of power between each section.  If you have that balance of power nobody can say to the Minister that he gave an unfair advantage to one section or another. I want to see the greyhound industry going ahead.  I want to see every section associated with it catered for impartially.  There are a number of sections who are dissatisfied and I would like to see the matter remedied.</P>
    <P>As regards the committee which the Minister set up to bring in a report on the industry, the only comment I would like to make on that is that the inquiry should have been in public but, of course, that is not relevant to the amendment under discussion.  Again I would say to the Minister that, in accepting this amendment he has an opportunity of demonstrating to the people generally that he is completely impartial, and of setting up a board that will represent all the interests involved.  If he adopts the suggestion in regard to the quorum he will be ensuring that there will be a balance of power which will enable the affairs of the industry to be fairly administered.</P>

      <P>From experience of the past hour or two it would seem that the Minister has no intention of giving way on this Bill.  He has stuck his heels in the ground.  No matter how constructive the arguments may be for amendments, he has decided to stick by the Bill.  Therefore, there is no purpose in pursuing this line any further.  We will take an opportunity, I hope, of putting in an amendment on Report Stage.  By permission of the House, we propose to withdraw this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put it to the House that it should not stand part of the Bill.  It should not stand part of the Bill because, if this board will be constituted as the Minister proposes to constitute it, it is quite clear from the report of his own committee that the procedure of the board at its meetings is not likely to be very regular or very edifying.  I have put on the records of the House an account of a meeting of the Irish Coursing Club. The manner in which this club conducted its proceedings is here also in an official document issued by the Minister's own Department.</P>
      <P>There is a number of matters which arise on this section.  Sub-section (3) says that the chairman of the board shall, if present, be chairman of the meeting.  It would seem to me, in view of the manner in which the board is to be constituted &mdash; the board as Deputy MacCarthy has pointed out may be composed wholly of members of the Irish Coursing Club to the detriment of the other interests concerned in this sport and in the industry &mdash; that there should at least be a proviso that no meeting of the board shall be held unless the independent chairman is present, that is, assuming that the Minister will appoint a person as chairman who will not be a member of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there is anything in the Bill which would prohibit him from appointing a member but I do suggest, in view of the composition of <Col N="636" /> the board, that the chairman should be independent and should be neither a member nor an ex-member.  Having regard to the circumstances in which this Bill has been conceived, and the long gestation period between 1948 and 1956 &mdash; eight years &mdash; before it saw the light of day, I do think that it should not be possible to hold a meeting of the board unless the chairman is present or a person nominated by the Minister to act as chairman in his absence.  That would be a reasonable thing to do.  It might give some greater degree of confidence in the procedure and operations of this board than the majority of the members of this House actually feel.</P>
    <P>There is no use in referring me to division figures because we did hear a member of the Minister's own Party, Deputy Sean Collins and a member of the Labour Party, Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, very ably presenting the case against the Minister's proposals in the Bill.  I understand that Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll must have spoken for at least one other member of the Labour Party.  She must have spoken for Deputy James Larkin because his name was associated with hers in amendment No. 4 and I am sure they were not the only two &mdash; I was going to say &ldquo;swallows&rdquo; but I suppose I had better say &ldquo;birds of paradise&rdquo;&mdash; in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know at any time what side Deputy Sean MacBride is on.  Deputy Sean MacBride did certainly put some questions to the Minister which seemed to suggest to those who heard him that he himself, notwithstanding his affection for &ldquo;dear Paddy&rdquo;, was a bit doubtful as to how business would be conducted with a board composed as the Minister has indicated he proposes to compose it.</P>
    <P>So, I do suggest to the Minister that, however they may have voted in the Division Lobby &mdash; to what degree they may have swallowed their words, does not matter &mdash; it does appear clear that they themselves were convinced that the Minister's proposals for the future control of the greyhound industry were not wise and that there should be some attempt to ensure that the board would be an independent board.  It can only be an independent board if <Col N="637" /> it can act only in the presence of an independent chairman.  That is why I have suggested that the chairman should be independent and that, if he is not present, there should be no meeting of the board, except a person duly appointed, under a provision which I hope the Minister might put in the Bill, to act as a deputy chairman is present.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that we are compelled to challenge almost every section and every sub-section of this Bill.  That is not our fault.  We did not desire to debate this Bill in the manner in which this debate is being conducted.  We wished to be helpful; we wished to be co-operative and we did hope that our advice and knowledge &mdash; which is not small, despite what the Minister may say &mdash; would be at least considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen fit to affront this House in the debate on the last amendment.  He used words which, if he had used them when he was a boy, would have brought down upon him by those responsible for his discipline hands of corporal chastisement.  We are not going to have to resort to that now; in any event, I do not think we would be able.  Personally, I would physically be unable to do it.  However, the language he used ill befits the Minister for Agriculture who has always posed as a person of good manners and decorum.</P>

We have reached only Section 10 of the Bill so far, and if the Minister would indicate that he is disposed to accept our objections, as implying that we are anxious to see the industry reorganised in a way that will make it both profitable to the community and a source of relaxation and sport to those who have the leisure to be interested in it, we could approach the Bill in a different manner. <Col N="638" /> If the Minister would only approach the Bill with a fresh mind next week, we will not press a division on this section.  We will not, however, be treated with contumely by the Minister.  We had hoped the Minister would take our advice in the spirit in which it is given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), before paragraph (c), to insert the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the grant of such sums to greyhound racetrack executives as may be required to cover the difference between the track charges to bookmakers under Section 48 and the track charges in force prior to the appointed day for this Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy speaks to the amendment, may I put to him the difficulty I am in?  I think the Deputy will agree that, if the amendment were accepted, it would be open to every racetrack, who were already charging the bookmakers five times the normal spectator's charge, to &ldquo;jack&rdquo; up that charge to 30 times the present one.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister could make provisions to see that this would not happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And surely the Deputy will see the difficulty about making such a provision&mdash;that, in no case, will more than five times the admission charge be charged to the bookmakers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Down the country in tracks where the admission charge was about 2/6 a head, the bookmaker is in many cases now paying 17/6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now proposed to limit the tracks' charge to five times the 2/6 admission fee.  That means that numerous tracks would lose considerably on this new provision.  Would the Minister give his sanction to that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not exceptional cases; they are general to many of the smaller tracks throughout the country, and many of these tracks will be unable to make up losses suffered in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases of that kind, the board could permit the charging of a higher figure, and I would sanction a charge of more than five times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this will have to be discussed in much more detail because this applies generally to small tracks outside Limerick, Cork and Dublin.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 22nd February, 1956.</P>
