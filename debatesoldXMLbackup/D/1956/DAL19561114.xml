      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that notices of dismissal have been given to eight members of the technical staff who have become redundant owing to staff reorganisation and a reassessment of the board's objectives arising from changes in the plans of the E.S.B.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, looking at next year's allocations, it appears, if county committees obtain loans through the banks, it will be necessary to reduce the amount available to the Local Loans Fund by that amount.  Looking at the financial position at the moment, that is what I see. Therefore, in order to see that proper and necessary priorities in relation to vocational education extensions are kept, it is necessary to control the <Col N="910" /> authorisations given to the various committees to proceed with any work.</P>

The amount of finance that will be available in one way or another for that, I understand, will be limited and, therefore, it is necessary for me at the present moment to control priorities and, therefore, to control permissions in this way.  I have indicated that the expenditure on vocational schools during the current year is something over £500,000-£533,000 &mdash;about £232,000 more than last year, so that the question of expenditure on this case does not arise in this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state in respect of the Kilworth forestry area (a) the number of men employed during the peak periods in the years 1954 and 1955, (b) the number now employed, (c) the total acreage in the possession of his Department which is still unplanted, (d) the number of acres which it is proposed to plant in the next planting season, and (e) why provision for the resumption of planting was not made towards the end of the thinning programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The total area of this forest has remained almost unchanged at 2,000 acres since 1923.  Very little plantable land has accrued during those years.  The only addition of plantable land since 1923 has been a small area of 42 acres in 1954.  Between nursery work, planting and maintenance, the normal staff is approximately 30.  In order to bring the arrears of thinnings up-to-date, it was necessary to employ extra staff, which brought the maximum number in 1954 to 63 men and in the early part of this year to 113.  The arrears of thinnings have now been completely liquidated and a consequent reduction in staff to a current figure of 30 has taken place.  The total unplanted area is 53 acres, of which 27½ acres will be planted in the coming year.  In addition, an area of 152¼ acres is scheduled for replanting or for replacement of failures.  For technical reasons, it would not be possible to undertake planting operations earlier than November and, in fact, most planting is done after Christmas.  Work preparatory to planting is on hands at Kilworth at present.</P>
      <P>As this forest is surrounded by a very good arable area, I do not see much prospect of further expansion in the immediate future.  There is an area of approximately 150 acres likely to come in shortly, but apart from this, prospects of expansion are extremely limited.</P>

      <P>(b)  This sum is payable to the Export-Import Bank, Washington.</P>
      <P>(c)  Repayment is governed by Loan Agreements dated 28th October, 1948; 23rd February, 1949; 22nd December, 1949 and 30th June, 1950 between the Government of Ireland, acting through the Minister for Finance, and the Export-Import Bank of Washington. The Agreements were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(d)  The amount borrowed was $128.20 million of which $46.79 million was converted at the pre-devaluation rate of $4.02 to the £1 approximately and $81.41 million at the post devaluation rate of $2.80 to the £1 approximately making a total of £40.70 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The approximate value of articles of furniture other than floor coverings, tapestries and textile materials purchased under contract and at public sales by the Commissioners of Public Works in each of the years 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1955 was £31,000, £21,000, £19,000 and £18,000 respectively.  In addition many small items of furniture, delph, cutlery etc. required for day-to-day use in the various establishments throughout the country are purchased on individual orders.  Segregation of the figures of expenditure on such purchases would involve the examination of several thousand vouchers and the work entailed would not, I consider, be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Purchases of furniture are made for the purpose of meeting immediate or current demands and save in the case of standard articles such as office <Col N="920" /> tables and chairs are not intended for stock.  Purchases of standard articles are made in bulk and include anticipated demands over limited periods. The value of such goods awaiting issue from store varies from day to day.</P>
    <P>(c)  During the period referred to, approximately 100 different firms were invited to tender for the Commissioners' requirements.  These were for the most part manufacturing firms. Where the value of a contract is estimated to exceed £500 the contract is also advertised in the public Press.  In practice, individual orders for small items are placed with distributing firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As the law stands at present, responsibility for the prevention of coast erosion rests, generally, with the owner of the property affected, who may be a private individual or concern, a transport undertaking or a local authority. The only Departments of State which have any statutory or other responsibility are the Department of Industry and Commerce, which in the exercise of the powers conferred under the Foreshore Act, 1933, is concerned only in so far as the removal of beach material from the foreshore may cause or accelerate erosion; and the Department of Lands, in the limited category in which it administers trust funds for the maintenance of existing protection works or makes occasional grants and advances to assist in the carrying out of minor protection works in a case where the security for land purchase advances is endangered by coast erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of coast erosion and coast protection has been the subject of examination and consideration over a great number of years, but the attention given to it has been intermittent. As far back as 1906 a British Royal Commission was appointed to inquire and report as to the encroachment of the sea on various parts of the coast of the United Kingdom, and the damage which has been or is likely to be caused thereby, and what measures are desirable for the prevention of such damage.  The final report of this commission was submitted on the 31st May, 1911.  The commission in so far as Ireland was concerned reported that the chief erosion in Ireland occurred <Col N="928" /> on the coast-line of the Counties of Dublin, Wicklow and Waterford, and on other parts of the coast-line encroachment only took place at isolated spots.</P>
    <P>In October, 1929, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health appointed an inter-departmental Committee consisting of the chairman of the Commissioners of Public Works representing the Minister for Finance and representatives of the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Lands and Fisheries, Local Government and Public Health and the Irish Land Commission.  The committee's Terms of Reference were as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;To inquire into and report on the extent to which coast erosion is proceeding or may be anticipated in the Saorstát and on the nature and effect of the damage which is being or may be caused thereby; and to make recommendations, with due regard to the relation between the nature and amount of damage and the cost of preventing it, as to any measures for securing increased protection of the coast which it appears advisable to adopt&rdquo;.  This committee reported in 1931.  In their view the following general conclusions might be drawn, namely, (a) there was constant erosion as well as accretion going on around the coast; (b) there was no conclusive evidence of any catastrophic action either past, present or imminent.  Much of the erosion is of little practical importance.  But (c) there are a number of cases in which valuable property is threatened or actually being damaged.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that the Government should not assume general responsibility for the protection of the coast against inroads of the sea, but they envisaged circumstances in which individual property owners might undertake works of coast protection subject to Government control or the State might contribute towards the cost and in cases undertake such works itself.  In the case of applications for State assistance the committee suggested that the following considerations might properly govern a decision, namely, that the object to be attained is of national importance, <Col N="929" /> that it could be attained at a cost which is not greater than the purpose warrants, and that the persons whose property is to be protected cannot afford to defray the whole cost.</P>
    <P>The Government take the view, and the present Bill has been framed on that basis, that the obligations in respect of coast erosion which might be assumed by the State should be restricted to cases of serious erosion as distinct from storm damage, and that the initiation of schemes for coast protection should lie with the local authorities who would have first hand knowledge of local conditions and needs, and would no doubt be moved by interested property owners, and who should be in a position to decide in a preliminary way that the conditions and needs were such as to justify financial participation in the cost of remedial measures by the authorities themselves and by the interested property owners.</P>
    <P>This is the general background, and, although there is no evidence of any urgent necessity for the carrying out of widespread protection works to combat erosion by the action of the sea, representations have been received from time to time in individual cases of varying seriousness.  The Government decided in the circumstances that it would be desirable to make statutory provision to enable serious cases to be properly examined and coast protection schemes to be formulated and put into effect in suitable cases.  There are no reliable up-to-date statistics as to the general extent of the problem, but such evidence as we have leads to the assumption that the number of individual instances where erosion is taking place to the grave detriment of a town or village or of valuable property is not large.  Nevertheless there are undoubtedly a few cases which are of sufficient importance to justify the provision of statutory machinery for dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that this Bill is not intended to cover cases of storm damage as such.  It is intended, as is set out in Section 2, to deal with cases where land is being progressively damaged by encroachment of the sea <Col N="930" /> which, if permitted to continue, is liable to endanger the safety of a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area, or other valuable property.  The Bill provides that the preliminary examination of coast erosion problems and the initiation of protection schemes are matters for local authorities but there is also provision that, if the local authorities concerned are advised that the preparation of a scheme is practicable and desirable but that the works would be of such difficulty or magnitude as to be beyond their capacity, an approach can be made to the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake a further examination for the purpose of determining whether the preparation and execution of a scheme is practicable and desirable.  The costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners in respect of such examination are to be paid by the local authority concerned. In such cases as are referred to them, the Commissioners will decide whether a scheme should or should not be prepared and, if one is to be prepared, whether the work should be carried out by them or by the promoting authority.</P>
    <P>Other important provisions in the Bill are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Where land in two or more counties is affected by erosion the councils of the counties concerned shall name one council as the authority to promote a coast protection scheme.</P>
    <P>(b)  A scheme prepared by the promoting authority, or by the Commissioners, is to be exhibited locally and notice of the preparation of the scheme setting out particulars of proposed interference with land, rights and property is to be served on interested parties, who may within a period of two months submit observations on any matter to which the notice relates.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Commissioners of Public Works may decide to cause a public inquiry to be held, by a person appointed by them, on the observations received by a local authority on a scheme prepared by that authority, or on observations received by the Commissioners on a scheme which they themselves have prepared.  Schemes <Col N="931" /> prepared by local authorities will be subject to confirmation by the Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance; and schemes prepared by the Commissioners will be subject to confirmation by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(d)  The Minister for Finance is to be empowered to contribute out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas such amount, not exceeding one half, as he may consider proper of the costs and expenses incurred in executing a coast protection scheme, the balance to be provided by the promoting authority with the aid of such contributions as may be agreed upon with other local authorities, harbour authorities, and the owners of protected lands.</P>
    <P>(e)  Completed works are to be maintained by the promoting authority, and local authorities who contribute towards the cost of schemes will be required to contribute towards maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the Bill, section by section.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the usual definition section incorporating the definitions which are used throughout the Bill.  I think those definitions are sufficiently clear without any comment from me.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the council of a county, which expression includes the corporation of a county borough, whenever satisfied that land within the county is being progressively damaged by encroachment of the sea and that such encroachment, if permitted to continue, is liable to endanger a harbour, the buildings or amenities of a residential area or other valuable property, may declare that it is expedient to promote a coast protection scheme in relation to the encroachment.  Where an encroachment affects land in two or more counties and the council of each county makes a declaration under this section, the councils are to name one council to act as promoting authority for the coast protection scheme.  The making of a declaration will be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that where the promotion of a coast protection scheme <Col N="932" /> has been declared to be expedient the promoting authority shall cause a report to be prepared on the nature and probable causes of the encroachment, the extent and value of the lands and property being damaged or liable to be endangered thereby, the works, if any, which may be practicable and desirable to prevent the continuance of the encroachment, and an estimate of the cost of such works. Necessary powers for entry on lands etc., are provided for the purposes of the examination and report.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that a promoting authority, after consideration of a report under Section 3, may declared that a scheme is not to be proceeded with, or that a scheme is to be prepared and, subject to confirmation as provided for in the Bill, executed by themselves.  Alternatively, if they are advised that the preparation of a scheme appears practicable and desirable but that the works are of such difficulty or magnitude as to be incapable of successful execution by them they may request the Commissioners of Public Works to make a further examination for the purpose of determining whether the preparation and execution of a scheme is practicable and desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the Commissioners of Public Works may make the further examination referred to in Section 4, and that they may recover the costs and expenses incurred by them from the promoting authority. Provision is made whereby the promoting authority can recover from other local authorities in appropriate cases portion of the costs and expenses incurred by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 6 lays down the procedure to be followed by the Commissioners of Public Works after they have completed their examination of the problem.  They may determine that the circumstances would not justify the preparation and execution of a coast protection scheme or that a coast protection scheme would be justified and should be prepared and executed by the promoting authority, or alternatively that it should be prepared and executed by themselves.  In the first case the Commissioners will make a <Col N="933" /> report to the promoting authority and they will give the reasons upon which their determination has been based. These reasons will normally have relation to the feasibility of devising a scheme which from the engineering point of view is capable of execution at a reasonable cost and without endangering property other than that which it is desired to protect.  As Deputies will realise, interference with the normal course of nature and particularly with elements such as the wind and waves can have peculiar and sometimes dangerous reactions.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with cases where the Commissioners of Public Works inform the promoting authority that a coast protection scheme would be justified, and that the scheme should be prepared and executed by the promoting authority.  In that event the promoting authority have the option of deciding, after consideration of the Commissioners' report, whether or not a coast protection scheme is to be proceeded with.  This is to be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a coast protection scheme may be prepared by a promoting authority who have made an appropriate declaration under Section 4 or Section 7; similarly a scheme may be prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works in a case where they have made a determination under Section 6 that they are to be the executing authority.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives details of the matters to be shown in a coast protection scheme prepared either by a promoting authority or by the Commissioners of Public Works including the estimated cost and the several sources from which the necessary moneys are to be provided.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that when a coast protection scheme has been prepared copies are to be sent to specified parties.  The scheme is to be exhibited and public notices of such exhibitions are to be given.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the serving on every interested party of a notice stating that a scheme has been prepared specifying where the scheme can be inspected and describing any <Col N="934" /> proposed interference with his land, rights or other property.  A period of two months is allowed for the sending to the promoting authority or to the Commissioners of Public Works, as the case may be, of any observations which the interested party desires to make in regard to the matters to which the notice relates.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that when a promoting authority have considered the observations received in regard to a scheme prepared by them, they are to furnish a report thereon to the Commissioners of Public Works who will examine the report and the scheme and if they consider it necessary cause a public inquiry to be held.  The Commissioners will then consult the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers if necessary and they may then decide not to confirm the scheme, or, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to confirm it.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that when the Commissioners of Public Works have considered the observations received in regard to a coast protection scheme which they themselves have prepared, and the report of any public inquiry which they may have caused to be held in regard thereto, they shall present the scheme, accompanied by a statement of any alterations which they consider should be made therein, to the Minister for Finance for confirmation. The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and such other Ministers as he may consider necessary, may make an Order refusing to confirm the scheme or he may make an Order confirming the scheme either without alteration or with such alterations as he considers proper.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides the necessary powers for the executing authority in regard to the carrying out of a coast protection scheme for which a confirmation Order has been made.</P>
    <P>Section 14 sets out the duties of an executing authority in regard to public roads and bridges which may have to be interfered with in the course of executing a coast protection scheme. <Col N="935" /> Local authorities who benefit from the provision, by an executing authority, of new or improved bridges or roads, conferring substantially greater benefits than the original ones, are to contribute such part of the cost as the Minister for Local Government shall certify.  This section follows a similar provision in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the acquisition of and compensation for land, rights, etc., proposed to be compulsorily acquired or substantially interfered with in a coast protection scheme for which a confirmation Order has been made.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for compensation for other interferences with land, etc., during the execution of coast protection works and lays down a time limit of one year for making claims for such interferences.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with certain matters to which an arbitrator shall have regard in assessing compensation; these include any benefit to the claimant's property deriving from the works.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the disposal by the executing authority of any lands, etc., acquired by them in connection with a coast protection scheme which have become surplus to requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the provision of the moneys necessary for the carrying out of a scheme.  It provides that the Minister for Finance may contribute, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, such amount, not exceeding one half, as he may consider proper, of the costs and expenses incurred in executing a coast protection scheme, the balance to be provided by the promoting authority with the aid of such contributions as may have been agreed upon with other local authorities, harbour authorities and owners or occupiers of protected lands.  Provision is made for the borrowing of money from the Local Loans Fund by councils of counties, and other bodies, for the purpose of making contributions under this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Section 20 provides for the issue by the Commissioners of Public Works of certificates of completion for coast protection schemes.  These certificates shall show the works which have been completed, the protected lands and the total cost of the works, and they shall be conclusive evidence that the works shown thereby have been completed in accordance with the relevant coast protection scheme, with such additions, omissions, etc., as may have been found necessary in the course of the work.  One of the purposes of the certificate is to settle the nature and extent of the works to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with the disposal of trust funds for the maintenance of existing embankments, the necessity for which has been obviated in whole or in part by a completed coast protection scheme.  It follows a similar provision in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 and is of a precautionary nature for any case that might arise.  The amount of money likely to be involved would be negligible.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides that where compensation is payable by the Commissioners of Public Works to a person who owes money to them, to a Minister of State, to the Revenue Commissioners or to the Irish Land Commission the Commissioners may pay and discharge out of the compensation, the money so due.  This is a usual provision.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for apportionment of land purchase annuities, etc., in cases where land acquired for a coast protection scheme is subject, in conjunction with other land, to such annuities, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the works to which a certificate of completion under Section 20 relates shall be maintained by the promoting authority and gives necessary powers for entry on lands, etc. for that purpose.  Beach material within 100 yards of any works required to be maintained under this section may not be removed save under licence, and a person contravening this provision is liable to a fine not exceeding £20.  Local authorities who contributed towards the cost of the execution of coast protection works are required <Col N="937" /> to contribute towards the cost of maintenance of these works.  The council of a county whose duty it is to maintain works is required to furnish to the Commissioners of Public Works an annual report in relation to the works.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for inspection by the Commissioners of Public Works of any works required to be maintained by the council of a county.  If the Commissioners are satisfied as a result of such inspection that maintenance or repair of the works in question is immediately necessary, they may serve a notice on the council concerned specifying the necessary maintenance or repairs and requiring the council to execute that work within a specified period.  If the council fail to execute the specified work to the satisfaction of the Commissioners within the period stated in the notice, the Commissioners may enter and execute or complete such work, recovering from the council concerned the cost and expenses incurred.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides powers for abandoning coast protection works which are no longer capable of being maintained at any reasonable cost. Power is also taken to prevent abandoned works from becoming dangerous or a nuisance.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides powers for the making of by-laws for the protection of works which the council of a county is required to maintain.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with the procedure for the holding of public inquiries and provides that in each case notices are to be published of the time and place at which the inquiry is to be held.  All persons, who in the opinion of the person holding the inquiry are interested therein, shall be entitled to appear and be heard at the inquiry. Power is provided for the summoning of witnesses and for requiring the production of books and other documents.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is the usual expenses section and Section 30 is the citation.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. The problem that has arisen in the one or two areas concerned in relation to coast erosion has been a problem that has been worrying these areas for a very considerable time.  I think it is <Col N="938" /> one that can be adequately dealt with within the framework of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, recognise that a Bill of this kind has become necessary, although, for a good number of years, the actual danger to valuable property did not seem to materialise.  First of all, I want to congratulate the Minister in as much as he has not adopted the principle of the Local Authorities (Works) Act in which there is no provision for maintenance.  So far as the drainage performed under that Act is concerned, an enormous amount of money has been and is being wasted because there is no power and no authority by which maintenance can be insisted upon by either the local authority or by the State, which provides a 100 per cent. grant; millions more will have to be spent if drainage works are to be maintained resulting in far greater cost to the State, to the taxpayer and to those who lend money to the Government.  In this Bill there are adequate arrangements for maintenance. I wish the Minister had given us a little more detail as to the general position in relation to coast erosion. We have not been given any particulars as to the areas in which coast erosion of a dangerous character is proceeding.  We can see, because of the Deputies who are in the House, where the principal area lies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill might be called the Wexford, Rosslare and Other Areas Coast Erosion Bill, as far as one can see.  When the Minister comes to reply, we would like to have some details of the other areas where coast erosion is taking place.  We would also like to have some information from him as to whether the Commissioners of Public Works have considered the comparative cost of actually moving buildings and of erecting defence works because we have been told that in certain areas the cost is so enormous and the ultimate result of such works so impracticable that compensation for the removal of the sites involved and <Col N="939" /> of the properties and hereditaments may actually be preferable.  That does not apply in the case of any particular piece of coast I have in mind; but we have read reports in international publications on coast erosion and, judging by those reports, it would appear to be a tremendously complicated problem.  If the Minister could give us a little more information on the financing of these projects, it would be welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the works must be of national importance in order to come within the purview of this Bill.  I presume he meant of not only national but of local importance as well.  There is a certain amount of vagueness in his definition in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that storm damage, in itself, would not bring works under the purview of this Bill. We want to ask him whether it is not a fact that storm damage over a succession of years can actually create an erosion problem which would otherwise have been very slow to mature?  Where does the Minister draw the line between erosion brought about by a single storm and erosion brought about by a succession of storms in a particular area?  Can he give us some information as to what exactly he means when he eliminates storm damage from application under this Bill?</P>
      <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, a great deal of it amounts to mere lip-service to the powers of local authorities. I do not know whether the Minister has examined this Bill in very great detail or whether he has an open mind upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister always has an open mind on everything.  He is always open to conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem to me, if the history of Youghal Bridge is examined and of any other project in which negotiations have to take place, first of all between the various local authorities in relation to the apportionment of the cost and in relation to the importance of the project and, secondly, negotiations not only with <Col N="940" /> the Minister immediately in charge of local government, but with the Commissioners of Public Works as well, who have, shall we say, a very deliberate and careful way of doing things, that the delays will be tremendous, and, although we are well aware that we have taken a long time to deal with coast erosion, we should not mind fairly extensive delays when they take place.  Nevertheless, I want to ask the Minister whether he thinks it is necessary to throw the ball to and fro between the local authority and the Commissioners of Public Works in cases where it has been decided that the local authority itself cannot carry out the project, or projects, because of the expense involved.</P>
      <P>Would it not be simpler if, the moment a decision was made, the Commissioners of Public Works carried out the project?  Is there any need for a complication to arise wherein the local authority has to make a further plan because, when the Commissioners of Public Works have decided that the work is worth doing, they may or may not give it to the local authority to execute?  Could we not make the assumption from the point of view of administrative simplicity that, once the local authority decides the job is too big for it, the Commissioners of Public Works may as well carry it out in all its stages, obtaining the consent of the local authority for a contribution to the cost of the scheme?</P>
      <P>If, for example, this particular principle were applied in the case of arterial drainage, it would be years and years and years before any arterial drainage could be carried out, because, after a report had been issued by the Commissioners for Public Works, there would be two alternatives: a number of counties could carry out arterial drainage or the Commissioners could do it.  It would seem to me that in that case there would be unnecessary delays.  I cannot see that it detracts from the authority of local bodies for the Commissioners of Public Works to carry on with the work where the local authority feels the work is too much for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schemes are quite unusual.  They involve machinery, staff and administrative <Col N="941" /> surveillance of a kind far beyond the capacities of the ordinary officers of local authorities.  If the local authority executes the work, then special officers and special consultants will have to be appointed, It is not as though one would take away from the normal prestige or authority of the engineering service of a local authority for the Commissioners of Public Works to do the entire job themselves. There will not be many cases involved. I do not suppose the number of erosion projects will be very great.  We, on this side of the House, are quite open to argument on the matter, but it does seem to me to be a tremendous complication.</P>
    <P>When sub-section (c) of Section 4 of the Bill comes into operation, would it not be more suitable, as from then on, that the Commissioners of Public Works decide to do the whole work themselves, working out costs and getting the advice of the local authority and the consent of the various bodies?  If they did that, will it not take years and years to obtain all the consents, to apportion the contributions and to deal with all the various matters in relation to compensation, invasion of various private rights and so on?</P>
    <P>To some extent, the Bill is, of course, a Commitee Bill, and we can discuss these matters later, but to amend the Bill to make that kind of a change would be very difficult, and therefore I would like to have the Minister's point of view in regard to it, because, as I have said, it does seem to complicate the whole question.  We noted that in the Bill there are a number of sections where there is a time limit, but looking back at experiences we have had in connection with bridge projects, the delays would appear to very great indeed.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether he has any general information about the financing of erosion works and whether he can give us some picture of the more important areas where erosion has taken place, and even to the nearest £500,000, the approximate liability which the State will have to face in this matter?</P>
    <Col N="942" />
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister and Government for bringing in this Bill.  For a very long time, we have been faced with erosion affecting many parts of our coasts, but more particularly the east coast.  The difficulty that any Deputy representing a maritime or coastal constituency has been faced with is that the strong representations he may have made were falling to a certain extent on deaf ears in that he could not find where exactly to make those representations and he was always thrown back on the argument that it was finally the responsibility of the local authority to deal with the matter.  The Minister knows quite well that I and my co-Deputies have been seriously concerned with the situation that is developing in Wexford and I noted in his opening remarks when he was quoting reports of commissions from time to time that it was stated that the principal counties that were suffering erosion were Dublin, Wicklow and Waterford, and for some reason or other, Wexford had been omitted.  Admittedly, the erosion is not going on in its entirety on the coast of Wexford, but we have a certain area there in which the situation has become extremely critical within the last ten years or so.  What is known as the littoral drift of tide in the Irish Channel goes from north to south and if there is any interference with it, or any barriers created, there is a tendency for that tide to scoop into the coast and evacuate or clear out the sand and extensive erosion takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am primarily interested in this Bill because of the very critical situation which prevails at Rosslare where virtually thousands of pounds' worth of property is gradually being encroached upon to such an extent that in the course of the next ten years or so, unless some drastic action is taken, it will disappear altogether.  Further, the situation that obtains there does not only apply to Rosslare strand itself, which is a long peninsula jutting out into the sea, but it also applies, in the course of time, to the town of Wexford, because when Rosslare strand is completely eroded&mdash;as it would be in the course of time without protection&mdash; then Wexford will be exposed to the <Col N="943" /> full force of these south-easterly gales and tides which are so injurious and it would be flooded and eventually eliminated as well as Rosslare.</P>
    <P>The proof of that lies in the fact that, in the memories of older people living in the town of Wexford, there were originally islands situated off the harbour where people lived and carried on their business and these islands have completely disappeared, leaving just small sand dunes standing out at low tide.  I said earlier that any interference whatever with the course of this littoral drift is responsible for erosion.  That, in effect, is what happened throughout the areas that I know personally in Counties Wicklow and Wexford.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It was an extremely difficult Bill to introduce because it was very hard to know exactly who was to be made responsible for this particular work that it will be necessary to do to save certain parts of our coasts from disappearing altogether.  I think most countries have a scheme of some sort whereby they deal with erosion.  I think this matter has been more thoroughly studied in America than anywhere else and in fact they have introduced gigantic schemes for that purpose there with a view to saving territory.  I would like to suggest to the Minister&mdash;although perhaps it would be unnecessary to have any particular legislation in relation to that&mdash;that it would be a very desirable place, perhaps, for the Commissioners of Public Works, who would appear to be the experts in this matter, to get some up-to-date, modern advice.  Of course, that would be a matter, I suppose, for the Commissioners themselves.</P>
    <P>There are a few instances arising in the Bill where I think the Minister could have gone a little further.  In Section 5, the Bill says that where a scheme comes back to the Commissioners from the promoting authority, which is the county council &ldquo;the Commissioners may undertake such further examination...&rdquo;.  I may have a suspicious mind, but I know that the Commissioners of Public Works have many things to examine and I feel, <Col N="944" /> somehow, if we leave the Bill as it is, the Commissioners may make the further examination, but it will be an extended period before that examination takes place.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should go the whole hog and say &ldquo;the Commissioners shall make further examination&rdquo;, because, otherwise, I can envisage schemes coming up from county councils, in combination or singly, that will be put on the long finger and we may have to wait a considerable time before the examination takes place.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that.</P>
    <P>I have the feeling that a lot of erosion could be prevented if we had a certain amount of afforestation along the foreshores of the eastern coast.  I recently had the experience of trying to induce the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands to plant a few trees along the Wexford foreshore in order to prevent further erosion, and the explanation given as to why they could not embark on such a scheme was that they were tied up with the Department of Industry and Commerce as regards foreshore rights and that it would be very difficult for them to plant trees on the foreshore.  I know that most countries concentrate largely on the afforestation of their foreshores as a protection against erosion.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions several Ministers and says that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Ministers.  I should like to see the Minister for Lands tied up considerably with this problem of erosion, its prevention and cure.  I do not know whether that could be brought about.  However, if we are spending money on erosion, we should step in now and do some work on prevention and protection through the afforestation of the foreshores. That is why I want to see the Department of Lands tied up with this scheme.  I should like to see it made mandatory on the Department of Lands to initiate schemes of afforestation along our coasts as a protection against this tidal suction and as a prevention rather than a cure of erosion of the land.  It would be a great help to the country as a whole and a great saving of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> From my experience of the Department of Lands, I would say it would be futile for me or any other Deputy to go to the Forestry Division and make representations to have trees planted on the foreshore for the purpose of maintaining or preserving land from erosion.  I wish we could embody in this Bill a provision for the initiation of a protective scheme.  With regard to the method of carrying it out, I think the Bill is extremely well drafted because, in effect, it means that if you are to deal with erosion the schemes will come from the local authority or from the local people concerned.  I feel also that the Commissioners of Public Works are the proper body to carry out such schemes as will be carried out under the Bill because they are the only people who have any knowledge of such work.  I know that there are people in that office who were competent to deal with this work and, I might say, willing to do it.  However, heretofore they have had no authority to do anything.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I am so pleased at the appearance of this Bill. From now on, when people make representations they will do so with the knowledge that something may be done to act on them.  I think it is a great credit to this Government that they introduced this Bill because successive Governments previously have never really done anything about it.  Questions have been asked in the Dáil from the various affected districts but the usual answer was that it was a matter for the local authorities concerned. It was quite impossible for the local authorities to do this work.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to bring the House back again to Rosslare, but it seems to me that it is the pivot on which this Bill hinges because it is a little town which will be very much in danger in the near future.  The Bill provides that schemes are to be drawn up by the promoting authority and presented to the Commissioners of Public Works for their consideration, and that it will be incumbent on the local authorities to pay for whatever work is done.  In the case of Rosslare, a very elaborate scheme was drawn up some years ago <Col N="946" /> by a firm of British engineering experts whose name escapes me at the moment.  That was about 20 years ago, but things have not altered since.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it would be necessary to have a new scheme drawn up.  Since the British firm considered the matter, the Rosslare Development Association, a pretty active body, have been in touch with this firm who gave them sound advice. The officials of the Commissioners of Public Works have had considerable intercourse with our engineer in Wexford.  I am wondering if the existing scheme in respect of Rosslare could be adopted for execution under this Bill.  If so, it would save a considerable amount of money and it would facilitate expedition in the matter of the execution of a scheme.</P>
    <P>Another point I noticed in the Bill is in regard to the financial arrangements. In Section 19 it is stated that the Minister for Finance may defray the cost and expenses to the extent of 50 per cent. out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  That seems to me to preclude the possibility of dealing with erosion schemes entirely out of capital expenditure.  I may be wrong, but it seems to me that money collected in the ordinary way in taxation would not be available for such schemes.</P>
    <P>Naturally, these schemes will cost a great deal more at their inception than at later stages, particularly if the Department of Lands are not given authority to plant trees along foreshores. Considerable sums may be needed to deal with emergency schemes.  There are only about half a dozen districts urgently in need of attention.  I wonder if the Minister would consider expending capital moneys on schemes for a certain limited period at the beginning.  That probably seems rather a bad idea, coming from me; it might seem that I just want to get Rosslare done and that I am not bothered about the country as a whole.  But, as I say, there are only three or four such areas in the country causing anxiety. It might be possible to advance some capital moneys for these schemes in the first few years.  That would help <Col N="947" /> local authorities in the matter of schemes which need almost immediate attention and which probably would require considerable sums of money.</P>
    <P>Unless this is done I foresee that schemes to which the Government might contribute £500,000 would fall down through the fact that half of that amount must be subscribed by local authorities.  The difficulty about it is that this work must be done through the county council and it is quite possible to see that where county councillors are elected sectionally or for the various districts within the county, if a big sum of money, which ultimately will be thrown back on the ratepayers, is required for a scheme of erosion prevention, certain councillors will not vote in favour of such schemes which do not affect the districts they represent.  I can envisage a scheme being drawn up, being perfect in every way, being ready for execution and a county council simply turning around and saying: &ldquo;We cannot provide the money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be obliged to the Minister if he would give consideration to these points.  Again I would like to thank him and the Government for introducing this Bill.  They can be assured of the gratitude of the Wexford people for it.  We have long waited for a Bill like this.  I know that the father of the Minister for Social Welfare, the late Alderman Corish, put any amount of work into this years ago trying to get a scheme implemented.  I have that from the local people.  It is a very sound scheme, it is very necessary and I hope the Minister will be able to implement it for us in the Rosslare district as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I have a particular interest in this Bill as have Deputy Esmonde, Deputy O'Leary, Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Allen.  The five of us, during the time we have been in Dáil Éireann, have concerned ourselves with coast erosion, particularly as it affected Rosslare.  No matter what our positions in the House were, we tried to impress on the inter-Party and Fianna Fáil Governments the necessity for some legislation to deal with <Col N="948" /> the problem of coast erosion or at least the necessity of pinning the responsibility on some particular Department of State.</P>
      <P>I remember that one of the first parliamentary questions I put down when I entered the Dáil about 11 years ago was in respect of coast erosion. On that occasion, as happened in the case of Wexford Deputies on many occasions, I was given an evasive reply.  I would not say it was deliberately given, but the fact was that there was no legislation to deal with coast erosion and no Department of State was prepared to accept the responsibility, even to the extent of answering questions about the problem.  A particular answer would immediately pin the responsibility on the Department of the Minister who gave the reply.</P>
      <P>I know it is very hard for the majority of the Deputies to be enthusiastic about this particular Bill. There is only a limited number of maritime counties and consequently a limited number of public representatives for them, but it is good to see an ex-Minister like Deputy Childers, and one who is from practically the centre of the country, show, as he did in his speech here to-day, an interest in the problem which concerns us particularly in the maritime counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been well said that Rosslare has been to the fore in making this Bill possible.  I think that is correct. The problem of coast erosion in Rosslare is much greater than in most other parts of the country.  Rosslare has suffered immensely during the last 45 years, and the tragedy is that some native Government since 1922 did not take the steps which the present Minister for Finance has taken to try to deal with the problem.  In the meantime all this procrastination, all the research and examination have meant that Rosslare town has lost dozens of yards of its land surface. That has interfered severely with the tourist potential of Rosslare.  Those of us who know the position, especially those of us from that county, know that Rosslare has declined to some extent.  The strand itself is damaged; the golf course has been eaten into and <Col N="949" /> much valuable property has been lost as a result of coast erosion over the past 45 or 50 years but particularly in the last dozen years.  I do not know the real reason for its intensity in the last few years, but I do know the people there have suffered very badly. If something is not done very quickly &mdash;and it can be done under this Bill&mdash;it will mean that even further damage will be done to Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reply for the Minister, who is usually well able to take care of himself, but Deputy Childers asked about the extent of the problem in the whole country.  I think it would be very hard to determine the extent of the problem, but I have a list here before me&mdash;how I got it I do not remember now&mdash;of schemes that were submitted to the Department of Local Government in respect of coast protection.  From that list there appears to be a problem of coast erosion at Lahinch in County Clare, in various parts of County Cork, in Youghal urban district, and Garrettstown; in some Donegal areas and in various areas of Dublin&mdash;Malahide, Portmarnock, and Portrane.</P>
    <P>I believe the problem in Dublin is somewhat similar to that at Rosslare. The evidence is that coast erosion has done substantial damage there over the last dozen years or so.  The problem is in Galway to a very small extent but it is very hard to understand why there should be any severe coast erosion in Galway with its steadfast and rocky coast.  The problem is present in Kerry, but not to any large extent; it is in Louth to some extent; in Meath, at Laytown and Bettystown.  In Dungarvan, according to the Dungarvan Urban Council, there is a very big problem; and, of course, in Wexford, at Rosslare, Courtown and Ballyanne.  In Wicklow, it occurs at Brittas Bay, Greystones, Arklow town, Bray town and Wicklow town.</P>
    <P>This was a list of schemes submitted some few years ago.  I think it was submitted in connection with the National Development Fund.  The estimated cost at that time was £812,000 and the proposed cost of the various schemes varied considerably. <Col N="950" /> The nature of the erosion in practically all these cases varied very much as did the nature of the work designed to correct the erosion.  The very fact that there is a Bill now before the House and that there will be an Act of Parliament within a few weeks does not necessarily mean that this problem of coast erosion will be arrested in reasonably quick time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to a scheme that was submitted in respect of Rosslare a good few years ago.  As the Deputy admits, it is difficult to know now whether or not that scheme would be the best to correct coast erosion at Rosslare strand.  Various schemes have been mentioned and submitted to the county council and to various Departments over the years but, as yet, I do not think any body in authority or any body that is responsible, such as the Wexford County Council or the Commissioners of Public Works, has definitely favoured one scheme as against another.</P>
    <P>The one merit I see in this is that the local authority that would be primarily concerned have the initiative. The initiative rests with them; they make the first move and practically every single move until the scheme is in operation.  It is a good thing that the responsibility should be laid on the local authority in this case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde also suggested that it would be difficult for inland areas in the county to vote with any enthusiasm any large sum of money as their contribution towards a coast erosion scheme but I think Deputy Childers and the Minister for Finance and Deputies from inland counties would take the same attitude in respect of moneys that would be voted from the Exchequer.  Having, naturally, no problem of coast erosion in their constituencies, it is very difficult for them to be enthusiastic about spending hundreds of thousands of pounds or £2,000,000, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, whatever the cost might be, for the correction of coast erosion in Malahide, Portrane, Brittas or Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>The financial arrangement is a good one, whereby the Minister for Finance or the Government will pay 50 per <Col N="951" /> cent. of the cost and the local authority will be required to pay the other 50 per cent.  Perhaps, if I may ask my colleague, the Minister for Finance, he may, when replying, say whether or not the cost of the preliminary investigation and examination and preparation of a scheme would be subject to this 50 per cent. Government grant.  My impression is that it would be but it is not quite clear in the Bill. Deputy Childers said that there was no provision for maintenance in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I misinterpreted what the Deputy said.  As Deputy Childers also said, it is a Committee Bill and I am sure that the Minister will seriously consider any suggestions he receives for the improvement of the Bill.  I think the House generally acclaims the Bill as being a step in the right direction.  It is the first time that a Government has taken any degree of responsibility for coast erosion and coast protection. It is the first time that a Government has decided to make grants available to local authorities to tackle the problem and I think the provisions for the safeguarding of the interests of the local authority and of private individuals and practically everybody concerned are admirable.</P>
      <P>From the wording of the Bill, it does seem that there may be a certain amount of shuttlecocking of proposals between the local authority and the Board of Works and various Departments but, if the local authority play their part, I cannot see that there will be any undue delay in the preparation of a scheme and its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities should embrace the Act, when this Bill becomes law, and endeavour to tackle the problems of coast erosion in their areas.  As a Deputy for a constituency that is <Col N="952" /> affected by coast erosion, I should like to say how pleased I am to be a member of the Government that introduced this Bill.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the work he has put into it and to express the hope that the House will pass the Bill very, very quickly in order to enable local authorities to engage in this work and to deal with the problems and difficulties which they have encountered for such a very long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming this Bill because in the constituency which I represent coast erosion has been the most urgent and pressing problem since I became a member of the Dáil.  I have met people from Rosslare Harbour and other coastal districts.  Rosslare is in danger.  Last winter I attended a meeting of the Vocational Education Committee in an hotel in Rosslare and right behind the hotel the sea was washing away the strand.  A few months ago, hotel owners, shopkeepers and all concerned met Deputies in Wexford Chamber of Commerce.  But for the fact that Deputy Corish was able to tell them that a Bill would be introduced to deal with coast erosion, I do not know if we would have got out of Wexford that night, they felt so badly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the county council and I hope that the cooperation that the Minister expects will be forthcoming because I am afraid that the 50/50 basis will not be very acceptable to some of the members of the county council.  I am afraid it will be very difficult to get county councillors of all Parties to agree.  It is a pity Deputy Allen is not here. Last Monday, I am sorry to say, he told the council about this Bill and that we would have to vote against it and almost told the Deputies to vote against it.  That was a very wrong attitude because the Bill had just been circulated.  The county manager and the county secretary had not seen it and many of the members knew nothing at all about its contents.  It is a pity that that attitude should be adopted on this subject, when some attempt to deal with the problem is so urgently needed.  The livelihood of about 6,000 people is at stake in <Col N="953" /> Rosslare Harbour.  Along the coast, houses are being eaten away.  I refer in particular to a house at Curracloe. I often went there up to ten or 15 years ago and could get down to the coast.  There is no access to the coast there now, as a result of erosion.</P>
    <P>This problem is not a new one.  It has been with us over a number of years.  I have been on the county council for a number of years.  The county council has received deputations from the areas concerned and it was very hard to have to say that there was nothing we could do.  Many people suggested that it should be a State responsibility and that the local authority should have no say in the matter.  I do not know whether that is right or not because, if we try to help the people, the people will also have to help themselves.  We cannot look to the State for everything.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on taking the necessary steps to bring in the Bill. It is long overdue and I hope there will be no delay in passing it.  The five Deputies concerned were powerless to help the people.  We told them we could no nothing and that the Wexford County Council could do nothing until a measure was introduced in the Dáil. Now it is here and I hope it will get co-operation from all Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which Deputies have met the proposals submitted in this Bill.  The Minister for Social Welfare referred to the fact that Deputy Childers and I both represented an inland constituency and that those constituencies might not perhaps relish the burden of meeting the cost in this Bill.  In case there was any doubt in anybody's mind, let us be quite clear about it: I have no intention of changing my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas that are concerned in this Bill are difficult to specify precisely at this stage partly because, until the machinery of this Bill is in operation, there is no machinery by which the extent of the problems at various places can be ascertained.  What I meant to imply by excluding storm <Col N="954" /> damage from the scope of this measure was to draw a distinction between what might be isolated instances and what would be the continuous damage by storms that would gradually erode a coast away.  It is not possible, I am afraid, as Deputy Childers suggested, to give a more precise definition on that point because in each case it is a question of fact.  In the areas where there is a gradual erosion, that erosion operates more in the winter when it is stormy and when there is a lot of bad weather than in a mild winter when there is not.  That is a matter that must be related to the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>There are, in fact, four main areas where there is substantial erosion.  It is not necessary for me to mention Rosslare.  Every Deputy who has spoken was well aware of the position in Rosslare and was quite determined to bring Rosslare to my notice.  I had already had Rosslare brought to my notice.  I was invited to a meeting down in Rosslare to which Deputy O'Leary referred a few minutes ago. I do not know whether I was invited because it was dangerous and difficult to get out of the meeting, as he suggested, or whether it was because, as he also suggested, the danger of erosion was so great there that some of the people who were at the meeting might not be able to get away.  As the Deputy said, at that time we had already decided to introduce a Bill of this nature and accordingly the necessity for me to risk either form of danger did not arise.</P>
    <P>We cannot at this stage give to Deputy Childers any estimate of the alternative cost of moving back buildings for the simple reason that, as I have said already, until the machinery set up by this Bill is in operation it is impossible for us to give anything like precise estimates. However, the Deputy will notice the Bill refers to reasonable cost and obviously one of the things to be considered in deciding whether the cost of a coast protection scheme as such was reasonable would be whether it would be less costly to move buildings than to institute a protection scheme.  Again, that is a matter that <Col N="955" /> must be considered in relation to the facts of each individual case.</P>
    <P>I passed inadvertently a second ago from mentioning the four areas I had in my mind: Rosslare; curiously enough another one is also in Wexford, Courtown; Wicklow; and Lahinch, in Clare.  There is also perhaps a fifth one at Ballinskelligs in Kerry but the first four are the four that have been mainly the cause of representations throughout the years.  When one realises that these are the four or five main cases of coast erosion, I do not think Deputy Childers need be apprehensive about the provisions for bringing in more than one local authority.  Only the one local authority will be concerned in these main cases but it is desirable that there should be a provision in case in other places there were separate authorities, though I must admit, while not being an expert on that matter, if the picture as given indicates that Wexford town might also be affected as well as the rural area, or the county council area of Rosslare, that might be a question for consideration by two authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde regretted that the Minister for Lands was not brought more into this Bill, and suggested that we should do more in relation to afforestation to prevent coast erosion.  The type of work that is envisaged here is more where erosion has already taken place and further erosion has to be restricted and contained but it is a fact, as the Deputy suggested, that planting is one of the best means of avoiding erosion. However, I think that bent grass and other planting of that sort has perhaps been more successful than the type that he was suggesting, but this is a matter which would have to be considered in a different context from this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked what is the position in relation to existing schemes, whether they could be resubmitted or whether new schemes had to be drawn up.  He will appreciate that in relation to coast erosion the very essence of the problem is that it is a continually changing one <Col N="956" /> and that, therefore, in relation to any scheme it is essential that it be brought up-to-date.  That does not mean, however, that much of the work that had been done before would not be of great value in bringing it up-to-date, but it would not be of any assistance if a scheme were to be furnished which had been made some years before and if there was substantial variation in the facts and in the circumstances since the scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare asked me about the cost of the scheme. I think that if Deputies consider the provisions of Section 19 the position is clear enough, that where the scheme is confirmed the cost of the preparation of that scheme is considered as part of the scheme and that, therefore, the promoting authority gets relief to the extent that is given by grant in relation to the cost of the preparation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies felt it was not necessary that I should have schemes referred back to local authorities. There will be small schemes which it might be desirable to refer back.  I think it should not be the case that we should always have those schemes carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works.  There might be small trivial schemes which would be desirable and which could very well be carried out by the local authority.  I think that is a wise provision.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general principle that the schemes are to be promoted by a local authority and then to be carried through on the basis of a grant not exceeding 50 per cent. out of the Supply Estimates, the rest of the matters included in the Bill are really matters for Committee Stage and we can discuss that aspect on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to give statutory force and effect to the increases in pensions payable from the Exchequer or other public funds, including the funds of local authorities, which I announced in the Budget last May.  Under the authority of a Supplementary Estimate passed by this House on the 25th July last, increases have already been paid to most of the Exchequer pensioners.  The detailed legislative provisions governing the increases are contained in the Bill before the House and I shall now summarise the more important of its provisions.</P>
      <P>The appropriate percentage increases under the Bill, ranging from 15 per cent. on pensions under £100 a year to 6 per cent. on pensions over £450 a year, are prescribed by Section 2.  The pensions to which these increases apply are described in the Schedule to the Bill.  Parts I and II of the Schedule contain pensions payable from the Exchequer and from certain statutory funds to retired civil servants, teachers, etc., to members of the judiciary and to the widows and children of former Ministers and holders of parliamentary offices.  Parts III and IV of the Schedule specify the pensions payable to former employees of local authorities and harbour authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally no increase will be granted under the Bill unless the pensioner's service ended before the effective date of the 1952 pay increases. These pay increases were granted to most classes with effect from 1st November, 1952; where this is not the case, the appropriate date in 1952-53 is prescribed or can be determined <Col N="958" /> under the Bill.  This alternative date will in no case be later than the 6th April, 1953.  I should like any reference to the 1st November, 1952, that I may make in the course of my remarks to be understood as a reference to the alternative date prescribed or determined under the Bill for a particular class or classes.</P>
    <P>This restriction does not apply to pensions payable at fixed rates which were not altered or affected by the 1952 pay increases.  The pensions payable to the widows and children of Ministers and other holders of parliamentary offices and to widows of members of the Garda Síochána, which are listed in Part II of the Schedule to the Bill, are almost all of this type. In such cases the appropriate increase under the Bill will be added to all pensions, including pensions to be granted in future, thus operating as a general revision of the existing rates of pension which were fixed prior to 1952.  An exception is also required in cases where, although retirement took place after the 1st November, 1952, the pension was calculated on average salary over a three-year period which stretched back before the 1st November, 1952, and was, therefore, derived partly from receipts at the lower salary rates in force prior to that date.  Special provision has been made in Section 7 of the Bill to allow a modified increase proportionate to that part of the three years which fell before the 1st November, 1952.  Parts III and IV of the Schedule to the Bill cover similar cases among local authority and harbour authority pensioners.</P>
    <P>As no pension calculated wholly on the increased rates of salary introduced on 1st November, 1952, may be increased under the Bill, so no pension may be increased under the Bill beyond the amount which would be payable to a colleague of identical rank and service who retired on the 1st November, 1952, and whose pension was calculated wholly by reference to the higher salary rates introduced on that date.  Provision for this overriding maximum has accordingly been made in Sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Bill,</P>
    <P>During the period between 1921 and 1951, the salaries of the higher posts <Col N="959" /> in the Civil Service, and of some higher posts elsewhere, were subject to a reduction called the supercut.  The supercut originated as a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus in the higher salaries.  Its effect persisted in the consolidated salary rates which replaced the former system of basic salary and bonus from 1946 onwards until it was removed partially in 1948 and completely in January, 1951.</P>
    <P>Officers who retired while the supercut was in force are, however, still in receipt of pensions based on the lower salaries.  When this Bill was in course of preparation it was found that a revision of these pensions to remove the effects of the supercut would not cost appreciably more than the grant of the appropriate percentage increases under the Bill.  I decided, therefore, in view of the representations which had been made from time to time by these pensioners, to allow them to take their pensions increase either in the form of a remission of the supercut reduction, or the appropriate percentage increase, whichever is more favourable.  Provision has been made accordingly in sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill provide for the treatment of double pensions and for the application to the pension as increased of any statutory provisions applicable to the original pension.  Sub-section (5) of Section 10 provides that any increase under the Bill shall not be assessed as means for the purpose of an old age pension or a widow's non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Under Sections 5 and 6 local authorities and harbour authorities are empowered to grant increases in the pensions payable by them which are specified in Part III and Part IV of the Schedule.  The increases will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health in the case of local authority pensions, and to regulations to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the case of harbour authority pensions.  The increases allowed will be similar in amount and will be generally subject to the conditions and limitations governing increases in Exchequer pensions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The total cost of the Bill to the Exchequer is estimated at £140,000 in a full year.  Of this sum £37,000 will go to retired civil servants, £40,000 to national teachers, and £28,000 to former members of the Garda Síochána and the Dublin Metropolitan Police Force, resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and other pensioners under various enactments.  The balance will be payable to local authorities in increased grants attracted by increases in local authority pensions.  Increases in Army pensions and retired pay, for which separate legislation is being prepared, will bring the total cost to the Exchequer of pensions increases to £180,000 a year, the amount that I mentioned in my Budget statement.</P>
    <P>I accordingly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of the consequences of the failure to check the rising cost of living.  It is a Bill, in fact, to mitigate the hardship to which the continuing upward trend in prices has subjected many hapless people, most of them incapable of serious work, who were retired on pension in days when circumstances were easier and who had been looking forward to comfortable security in their old age.  It cannot be denied that the hardship exists and that in the majority of cases it is severe. Accordingly, despite the fact that the burden of taxation presses heavily on all the people, we are not opposing the Bill.  This, I believe, is in accord with the general public feeling that something should be done to relieve the distressed conditions in which many retired public servants are now existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the one criticism I have heard of the reliefs to be granted under the Bill is that, so far as the smaller pensions are concerned, they are meagre indeed; but we have to recognise, as against that, the straits in which the Minister finds himself for cash.  If the tax revenue is not coming into the Exchequer, he cannot dole it out unless he borrows and the capacity of any Minister for Finance in this country to raise money by borrowing, even for the most acceptable and <Col N="961" /> justifiable purposes, is exceedingly limited to-day; but even if the Minister for Finance could borrow, he would not be justified in borrowing to pay increased pensions, even to the most deserving persons, and I feel certain that the present Minister would resist any attempt to force him to do so.  I do not believe either that he would be justified in imposing extra taxation to raise the additional moneys required in order to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think, indeed, that the limit of our tax-paying capacity has not merely been reached but exceeded.  Therefore, despite the fact that I am alive to the needs of those whom the Bill is intended to help, I must recognise that such benefits as it provides can be given only at the expense of the general body of hard-pressed taxpayers and, therefore, I personally will not take responsibility for pressing the Minister to do more for the persons who are covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is indeed a wide-ranging measure.  No fewer than, I think, 24 different classes of pensioners are covered by it and some of those who are covered by the provisions of paragraph (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 may be in receipt of substantial sums.  I do not question the equity of that particular provision, particularly in the circumstances to which the Minister referred.  I believe that in the matter of superannuation, as in the matter of remuneration, the principle of relative and fair reward should, so far as is just or practicable, be observed; but the fact that it is included in the Bill and the fact that the measure will benefit no fewer than 24 different classes of pensioners spotlights the ineffectiveness of the Minister for Defence.  The Minister for Finance has shown that he is a very effective Minister indeed, so far as the Minister for Defence is concerned.</P>
    <P>When he was in opposition, ranting up and down the country, Deputy General Seán MacEoin, as he then was, constituted himself as the guardian, protector and special friend of the Old I.R.A. He led them to believe that if he were to be put in office, he <Col N="962" /> would be a sort of fairy godmother&mdash; ill-favoured for the rôle, no doubt, but a fairy godmother, nevertheless&mdash; to them.  Largesse in generous measure would be bestowed upon them.  He would also exercise his magic, wit and charm on the Minister for Finance and would not be denied by him.  Alas, for Deputy Seán MacEoin's promises!  Alas, for the Old I.R.A. men who were taken in by them!  Although there is room in this Bill for 24 different classes of pensioners, there is no room in it for the Old I.R.A. men.  That will not make any difference to the Minister for Defence. As Minister for Defence and as Deputy General Seán MacEoin, he will go on his humbugging way making promises to his old&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Minister for Finance says, as this Bill suggests he says, that everyone in some degree must be taken care of, except the Old I.R.A., that is all right with Deputy General Seán MacEoin, now that he is in the Government as Minister for Defence, or with the Minister for Finance.  I shall leave the Minister for Defence to extricate himself from the equivocal position in which his colleague, the Minister for Finance, has placed him and I will content myself by saying what I said at the beginning, that this is a Bill to mitigate in a modest way the hardships which the rising cost of living has imposed on certain classes in the community and, as a Bill to mitigate hardship, we do not oppose it.</P>
      <P>The only thing I would hope for is that as the Bill will cost £140,000 in a full year, the Minister will find himself in a position to defray the additional expenses for which the Bill provides out of the economies which we understand he is endeavouring to make.  I trust he will be successful and that the net result of the Bill will not be to increase the burden upon the already overburdened taxpayer's back.</P>

      <P>The ex-Minister for Finance paid a very grudging tribute to the present Minister for Finance for introducing this Bill.  He states that the purpose of the Bill is to mitigate the hardships caused to pensioners as a result of the rising cost of living.  I think it is only fair to remind the ex-Minister that he had some small part in this rising cost of living himself. When this Government came into office, the cost of living was already going up.</P>

      <P>While the last Government was in office, there was no Bill to give anything to the pensioners. Having regard to the limited funds at his disposal and to the difficult economic position with which he is faced, I think the Minister has done very well to introduce this Bill.  I also think that he has given increased pensions to the people who most need them.  He has not been able to give them a lot, but the sum of £140,000 is distributed among the people who most need it.  I think this is a reasonable Bill and Deputy MacEntee would have made a far greater impression had he accepted the Bill on its face value as the best that could be done in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy will agree that pensioners who have given the best years of their lives in the service of the State deserve to be looked after as best we can.  As I say, I do not think the speech which Deputy MacEntee has just made is a very satisfactory one, from the point of view of pensioners. I think it would clearly indicate that had this Government not been in power pensioners would have waited quite a considerable time before getting what was due to them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde has more or less implied that when the Minister for Finance is in difficulties, or, as he put it himself, embarrassed, it is quite in order to sacrifice the Old I.R.A. men who gave service to this nation.  As far as I am concerned, and I am sure I am speaking for most Deputies, when a Bill of this kind comes before the House, it is generally <Col N="964" /> received with sympathetic consideration. We all know that the people who are endeavouring to exist on fixed sums of money find it difficult to make ends meet.  There is no means by which they can increase the fixed sums and they have to live within the bounds of those means.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be an extraordinary situation in a national Parliament, whose establishment was due to the activities of the Old I.R.A., that they are the only section of the community excluded from this Bill.  It does seem an extraordinary state of affairs and I do not think it reflects any credit on any one of us here that that should be so, especially when we know that the Old I.R.A. pensioner in this State is the only pensioner who has a pension of the very small amount which he receives for the service he gave to the State.  The average pension, if we take the awards made under both Acts, the Acts of 1924 and 1934, paid to these men is the very small sum of £47.  If we look at it from the point of view of the amount paid to the same type of pensioner under the 1924 Act, the average pension is £73 and that paid under the 1934 Act is £37.  I hope the Minister for Finance is listening to these figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing the Minister's attention to the smallness of these pensions paid to men, who, as I said at the beginning, are mainly responsible for the fact that we are debating this Bill.  My reference to the Minister was merely to emphasise the fact that these were the amounts being paid to these men and that they were the only section of the community being excluded from this Bill.  I am putting it to the Minister that he ought to take that into consideration and bring in this one section that have been excluded and give them the type <Col N="965" /> of justice which they are all seeking.</P>
      <P>I do not think the amount, if the Minister went into it, would be very excessive.  My own rough estimate would be something in the neighbourhood of £50,000.  Surely these men are entitled to that?  If the Minister is not prepared to consider all the Old I.R.A., then I suggest that he consider sections of the Old I.R.A.; in other words, sections under, say, Sections E and D of the Pensions Act.  These are men who are receiving rather small amounts and anything that could be done in the nature of even the small amount that this Bill would provide would be very acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is another section which we surely should not overlook, even if we are prepared to exclude all the sections I have mentioned.  There is still the section which is paid disability pensions.  These are men who are paid small pensions because of the disability from which they suffer or wounds they incurred in the engagements in which they participated.  I know there are quite a number of Deputies on the other side who would be as sympathetically disposed to the case I am making as I and my colleagues are and I do not think that in a matter of this kind we need discuss it from any political angle.  We can discuss it from the point of view that these men gave service when service was required and when service was sometimes very difficult to find. From that point of view, I would ask for the very sympathetic consideration of the Minister for that section of the community.</P>
      <P>I hope that by the time we have reached the Committee Stage the Minister will have examined the figures I have given him, and that, if satisfied that these figures are correct, he will take into consideration the desirability of amending the Bill to that extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of pensions and the amount involved under this Bill are small, the pensioners affected will welcome it. Deputy MacEntee struck a wrong note when he referred to the Minister for Defence not having sympathy with the Old I.R.A.  But for the 1949 Act, which he brought in, a good number <Col N="966" /> of the Old I.R.A. would not be in receipt of pensions to-day, and I think it is no harm to remind Deputy MacEntee of that.  There should be sympathy for the members of the Old I.R.A.  After all since we entered this House and since the pensions started a great number of the Old I.R.A. have died and there should be a saving for that reason.  It would be no harm if that saving was utilised in order to increase the pensions of the small number who still survive.  I did not hear the Minister say anything about the Connaught Rangers.  I am sure a few of those still survive and there must be some of them still trying to eke out an existence on a very meagre pension. I am sorry they are not included in this.  I certainly did not hear them mentioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor says that these increases would cost about £50,000: £50,000 is nothing to a Government.  It is only a fleabite as compared with the expenditure in Government Departments at the moment.  Money is of very little account in some countries to-day.  If we were in the position that we had to declare a state of emergency to-morrow, money would be required. That money would be found, as it was found in the last emergency; millions were found for the Army and for defence. In County Wexford, there are many Old I.R.A. trying to live on very small pensions and the Minister should give them some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to those of the last two speakers, in support of the case made for a particular section of our people, a section conspicuous by their absence from this Bill.  By way of interjection, the Minister said that the 1952 Bill made certain provision for increases to these people.  The 1952 Bill only made good the omissions of the 1950 Act, an Act brought in by the Minister's predecessor. Its introduction was regarded by us as merely correcting that rather serious omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the change in money values has left pensioners in the position that they are barely able to meet the calls made on them or purchase for themselves the necessaries of life.  There is one section of our pensioners <Col N="967" /> deserving of any increase in the paltry amount they are receiving. Every Deputy knows them.  Every Deputy has had the experience of being almost ashamed to admit that these are the people who played even a small part in the establishment of this State because of the conditions under which they are now compelled to live.  Their position is a mockery.  No one would begrudge them anything by way of increase in the paltry pensions they receive.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Leary that it may be difficult to come by money now, but I also agree with him that, if it has to be found, it will be found.  Every Department is loud on the necessity for economy.  If a world war broke out to-morrow and an emergency situation was once more declared here, money would be found to meet that situation. We should declare war on poverty.  We should be able to find the money to help these deserving cases.  If the view is taken that we cannot go on increasing emoluments indefinitely, then we can leave out the higher income groups from our calculations and concentrate on the more deserving categories.  One of the most deserving is the Old I.R.A. pensioners.  They are in receipt of very paltry pensions at the moment and they are certainly worthy and deserving of an increase.</P>
    <P>I emphatically endorse all that has been said by Deputy Traynor and Deputy O'Leary.  I am sure that every Deputy is only too anxious to urge on the Minister the importance of making provision for this section of our community. There is yet time to make that provision.  If there is not sufficient money to meet all claims, surely the Minister will agree that those with the lower scales of pension are entitled to consideration.  I urge the Minister to consider the lower-paid pensioners of the Old I.R.A. and make some provision for them even at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one to which no reasonable man could have objection. Those concerned have been very, very hard hit because of the rising prices in the past few years.  Why they are not included, I cannot understand. Very meagre amounts are given to <Col N="968" /> these people to meet increasing costs. In many cases, the increases would not cover the increase in rates which they have been compelled to meet over the last few years.  Nothing is cheap.  No reasonable man could object to these increases.  Indeed, we would all approve of giving more, if that more could be found.</P>
      <P>There is one notable omission from this Bill, namely, the Old I.R.A. pensioners.  They were omitted, too, from the 1950 Bill.  We never got any reasonable explanation of that omission.  That Bill was not amended until three years later, in 1953, and then the Old I.R.A. pensioners got only exactly the same amount as all other pensioners had got in 1950.  I do not know why that policy should be continued in this Bill.  It was an injustice to leave those people out in 1950.  That was proved in 1953 when the House unanimously, almost with acclamation, agreed to increase the pensions of the Old I.R.A.  It passes my comprehension why they should be once more omitted from the scope of this measure.  They suffer in the same way so far as the value of money is concerned. We all know the service they had to render in order to qualify for pensions, in order to lay the foundations of this State.  I cannot understand why they should be treated in this fashion.  To say the least of it, it does seem ungrateful that men like them should be omitted from the scope of this measure and that we shall have to wait another few years before the position is again rectified.  It will then, of course, be rectified unanimously and with acclamation.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to take the same line as his predecessor did about 1950.  If the Minister had been in the House in 1953 when the Old I.R.A. pensions were discussed, or if he would look up the records he would know that what I am saying is perfectly true.  Representations were made from all sides just as they are made to-day.  It would seem that the Old I.R.A. are the only people concerned who have to suffer further <Col N="969" /> and not get even the small amelioration of their lot that is being given under this Bill.</P>
      <P>That is the main point I want to make on the Bill.  I was very surprised to find that, although I went through the measure very carefully, there was nothing at all in it about the Old I.R.A.  I would appeal to the Minister to meet us on that matter.  I am sorry I was not here at the beginning of the debate, but I gather that appeals have been made already from different sides of the House and I would like to add my voice to the voices of those who have already spoken in appealing to the Minister to put this matter right at once.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee suggested that it was undesirable that any Minister for Finance should borrow for such things as pension increases. Of course, I could not agree with him more.  As far as I am concerned, this is a measure which was visualised by me at the time when I was framing my Budget last April or May and it was included by me on the basis of the estimates then available to me that it would be possible to meet the cost out of current revenue.  Although we all wish, whenever we possibly can, to be as considerate as possible to those who are in straitened circumstances, as most pensioners are, so far as I am concerned I want to make it quite clear that unless I was able to estimate that it would be met out of current revenue, I could not possibly have accepted its implications.</P>
      <P>The only other point that has been raised is that which was raised in relation to military service pensions. The purpose of this Bill is to bring the pensions of civil servants up, where the civil servants resigned prior to the 1st November, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to military service pensions, there was, of course, as Deputy O'Leary properly said to Deputy MacEntee, a measure introduced in 1949 by the Minister for Defence which adequately, I think, makes clear his interest in those who were responsible for the foundation of this State, and who, as Deputy Traynor has correctly said, were responsible for the fact that <Col N="970" /> we are discussing the matter here.  The Bill of 1953 brings the position in their case up to the 1st January, 1953, whereas this Bill deals with civil servants who were retiring prior to the 1st November, 1952, that is to say a matter of a couple of months before. Quite apart from that, the pattern of the legislation is such that a matter of that sort is dealt with by separate legislation rather than in an over-all pensions increase measure.  The classes included in this Bill are those in respect of which an estimate was framed at Budget time and I regret it is not possible for me to provide more funds than were provided at that period.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think it will be of assistance towards the understanding of the need for this Bill and of its provisions if I fill in briefly the historical background.  The Irish Civil Service, as such, got its statutory existence from the enactment of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924. Prior to that enactment there had, of course, been a Civil Service in being, consisting, in part, of persons taken over from the old Dáil service and, in part, of persons taken over from the British Civil Service.  Former British Departments, such as the Post Office and the Ministry of Labour to mention a few, carried with them into the Irish Civil Service the departmental rules, practice and procedure, particularly in regard to control and discipline, which had applied to the staffs under the British Administration.  With minor modifications to meet the new requirements these rules were applied in the new setting both before and after the passing of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and continue to be applied to this day.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, gave a statutory basis to the Irish Civil Service.  Shortly before the enactment of that legislation the Oireachtas had passed the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, providing for recruitment to the Civil Service.  Singularly enough, and to my mind, perhaps inappropriately, that Act, though really dealing with recruitment, contained a provision empowering the Minister for Finance to make regulations for controlling the Civil Service and providing for classification, remuneration, conditions of service and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This regulation-making power has <Col N="972" /> been very sparingly utilised.  It may, indeed, be said that to the extent to which regulations were made they scarcely impinged at all on the system of practice and procedure in respect of control and discipline which had been taken over.  That system continued to function largely undisturbed by political and statutory change.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that this system of control and management has worked and continues to work reasonably well, it has for long been felt that a definite basis in Irish law should be given to the system and that legislation should be available to the Irish public indicating on its face how the Irish Civil Service is to be regulated.  The Bill now before the House is designed to supply precisely that need.  It introduces nothing new.  It makes no radical changes.  It merely affirms practice of long-standing and seeks to enshrine that practice in legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into the various sections of the Bill. That can be done more readily and more conveniently on the Committee Stage.  I should, however, mention that this Bill is complementary to the Civil Service Commissioners Bill which is at present before the House.  I referred earlier to the fact that in the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, Section 9 gave power to the Minister for Finance to make regulations for the control etc. of the Civil Service.  That provision is really inappropriate in a Bill which is designed specifically to cover recruitment.  It is one of the reasons which led to the preparation of a separate Civil Service Commissioners Bill so that statutory provision for the regulation and control of the Civil Service would be contained exclusively in a single statute.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, this Bill is mainly a Committee Stage Bill, once one accepts the principle that it is desirable to have an Irish statute dealing with the Irish Civil Service. For that reason, I do not propose at this stage to go into the Bill, section by section, as we shall have full and ample opportunity for any discussion that may be necessary on the various sections on Committee Stage.  However, I do think it is desirable to stress <Col N="973" /> that it is more for the purpose of enshrining in our own legislation practice and procedure rather than for the purpose of introducing any new practice or new procedure that I have brought the matter into the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill on this side of the House and I, personally, should like to say how gratified I am that the Minister for Finance has found time to amend the existing law in a way which is long overdue.  Those of us who have had occasion to study the manner in which our Civil Service was hitherto regulated and controlled, and particularly the basis from which that authority was derived, must be very grateful to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much to be said on the Bill.  It does not make any significant change in the existing position; it merely, as the Minister has said, bases that control on an Act of our own Parliament.  I have no doubt that perhaps in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage we may find some few points that would require further discussion, but in the time that has been available to me, and with such attention as I could give the Bill, I really do not see any.  I think the Bill, as drafted, is a great improvement on the Civil Service Regulation Act of 1924.  It is certainly much more lucid and much easier for a layman to interpret.  What may happen when it goes into the courts is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less indicated that this Bill is a general principle.  However, there are one or two points which I should like to bring up which might possibly be considered on one of the subsequent stages.  With regard to the retiring age for civil servants, it has always been a mystery to me why civil servants have to retire at the age of 65 when judges are permitted to continue to the age of 72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to me that the duties of civil servants are even as onerous as those of High Court or Circuit Court judges.  As far as I can read this Bill, not being a lawyer, I think it establishes the fact that an <Col N="974" /> established civil servant will be allowed to remain in office only for a further three-month period.  I should like the Minister to consider, at a subsequent stage, whether it would be feasible to extend the age limit somewhat more.  To my recollection, in the last year or so, we had legislation in this House whereby the Land Commissioners, who, if not actually civil servants, come very near to that category, were permitted to continue to the age of 67.  During the present year, we were told that in certain cases civil servants might continue to the age of 70 or 75.  However, they would be unestablished or on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>There is another section of civil servants in respect of whom I want to make a plea.  I am not quite sure whether they are known as unestablished or temporary officers, but we have in this country, under certain Departments, civil servants who are employed on a temporary basis.  I know several of these cases myself. They are very efficient officers but they are limited in salary and in terms of service. They have no future whatever. The only opportunity they have of becoming permanent civil servants is to be permitted to take part in an examination. To my knowledge, there are several of these people who could pass any examination.  They are exceedingly able and brilliant men who are held in a blind alley and have no hope of getting any further.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider if there is any legislation to deal with this or if the existing state of affairs is to continue.  As I know it, the existing state of affairs is that these servants are allowed to compete for an examination when it is considered necessary that extra civil servants should be taken in.  As far as I know, there has been no examination under this category for a period of four or five years.  The only future for these people is to hope that at some time or other there may not be redundancy and that this examination will be held, with the result that they will be placed in the ordinary category of civil servants. I would ask the Minister to consider <Col N="975" /> them favourably.  I know there are several of these cases.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to service for the State in the Civil Service has always been that the retiring age was 65, but that it was possible to retain civil servants in an established capacity after that period for a matter of a few months for the purpose of enabling them to make up what might otherwise be a broken pension period.  Once that pension period is over, then they are retained in an unestablished capacity.  Frankly, I do not feel called upon to discuss the relevant merits of civil servants at 67 or 70 and judges or any other persons at that age.  If I am lucky enough to arrive at that age myself, perhaps I may be in a position more adequately to express an opinion on my capabilities. It would, of course, be contrary to all the practice of what is believed desirable in administration to extend the fixed age for retirement beyond 65 years as a permanent measure.  It would have the effect perhaps of preventing new expressions of view in the service, would act as a curb on promotions and would not be at all in line with the view, held not merely within the Civil Service but without, in business, as well, that early retirement assists modernisation in output and method and assists efficiency. For that reason, regardless of the comparisons which Deputy Esmonde has made, I do not think it would be of real assistance for me to discuss or to consider on this Bill any variation in the age itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee paid a graceful tribute to the drafting in the Bill.  I, too, would join in that tribute.  Perhaps I may be permitted to say that part of the reason for the excellence of certain drafting provisions and of the framework of the Bill is that Deputy MacEntee, as my predecessor, had some act or part in that, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As I mentioned earlier in connection with the previous Bill, these two Bills are to some extent complementary.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commissioners Bill, 1956, is designed to replace and supersede the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926.  These Acts&mdash;save for Section 9 of the 1924 Act, which deals with control of the Civil Service and which is to be superseded by the Civil Service Regulation Bill, 1956&mdash; deal solely with recruitment to the Civil Service and related matters.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Regulation Bill, 1956, necessitates certain amendments to the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926, and the opportunity has been taken to revise these Acts generally so as to remedy certain defects which 30 years' experience of the working of the Acts has revealed and to effect a number of procedural improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not seek to introduce any new principles into Civil Service recruitment but for rounding off purposes it introduces some complementary provisions in relation in particular to the unestablished groups which are not provided in earlier legislation. As in the case of the Civil Service Regulation Bill, I feel it unnecessary to go into detail on this particular Bill as discussion can proceed more readily and more informatively on the Committee Stage.  The scheme of things is entirely the same as before.  Independent Civil Service Commissioners are appointed by the Government who are charged with supervision and direction of recruitment to the Civil Service.  The long-established principle of competition is reaffirmed and power is given to the commissioners to make regulations governing, among other things, particular types of test to which candidates for admission to the Civil Service are to be subjected.  The provision for appointment in the public interest is retained and special provision has been made to deal with the reinstatement in the Civil Service of <Col N="977" /> women who having been civil servants retire from the Civil Service and subsequently become widows.</P>
    <P>I think it well to draw attention specifically to Section 29 (2) of the Bill. This section is new and provides that a person appointed under the Income Tax Act, 1918, to be a special commissioner of income-tax shall be appointed to an unestablished position in the Civil Service unless the Minister for Finance directs that such appointment should be to an established position. Special commissioners, other than the Revenue Commissioners, who are ex-officio special commissioners, are appointed both from within the Civil Service and from outside it. There has always been a certain amount of doubt as to whether special commissioners appointed from outside the service could be regarded as appointed to positions in the Civil Service.  Section 29 (2) makes clear that such appointments will be Civil Service ones.</P>
    <P>Appointed special commissioners carry out very important duties which are of a semi-judicial character&mdash;they act as an appellate tribunal for hearing appeals against income-tax, surtax and corporation profits tax assessments. Where non-civil servants are appointed, they must be barristers or solicitors of standing.  In the circumstances, it is important that where the Minister for Finance is recruiting a special commissioner from outside the service he should be empowered, if he thinks it necessary, to offer a pensionable position to the person proposed to be employed.  Section 29 (2) will enable him to do so.</P>
    <P>I think all members of the House will agree that it is desirable to put a person who is in that semi-judicial position in a position in which he knows that he is not liable to discharge or variation for the discharge of his duties.  He might feel, even without justification, if he were not so established, that he could not vary or, without fear or favour, find against the State in those cases that have to come before him.</P>
    <P>In general, the Bill deals mainly with changes merely of a procedural nature <Col N="978" /> and it is designed in particular to remove minor administrative difficulties which have come to light over the years in the operation of the recruitment machinery and to define more clearly the functions of the Civil Service Commissioners.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill is complementary to the Civil Service Regulation Bill and, as we had praise for that Bill, we also have praise for this measure.  Again, I should like to say how grateful I am personally to the Minister for introducing these Bills and for disentangling two entirely separate matters from each other.</P>
      <P>I should say also that I think it is a very good thing that the arrangement which is provided for under sub-section (2) of Section 29 is given legislative permanence.  I do not think that any person who had ever held the post of special commissioner has been at any time influenced by any member of the Government or by any member of the Legislature in such a way as prevented him from doing what was properly his duty.  Even if sub-section (2) of Section 29 were not there, I do not suppose that any special commissioner would ever be subjected to unjustifiable or undesirable pressure in future but it is a good thing, at any rate, that he should have that assurance given to him by legislation.</P>
      <P>The other point on which I want to congratulate the Minister is the provision which is being made for the reinstatement of former civil servants who left the service on marriage and who, becoming widows, have hitherto been reinstated by administrative act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to make this a matter of contention, but we are certainly entitled to be treated with some courtesy.  The idea of flinging this Bill at the House, as though Deputies were to be like so many letterboxes with apertures down which this measure was going to be shoved by the Attorney-General, is not good enough.  There has not been such a mass of legislation before the House that, when a Bill of this sort comes and the House is asked to give general authority&mdash;that is what the general resolution means&mdash;to enact legislation which may involve the State in expenditure and may, of course, ultimately make the taxpayer subject to taxation, we could not be treated with some greater courtesy than has been extended to us here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Again I am entitled, in view of the line which the Attorney-General has taken, to go through this Bill section by section and to ask the Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill, to tell the House whether in respect of any one of them expenditure may be incurred.  I do not want to be difficult in a matter of this sort but I certainly will not permit the House to be treated as though it was a mere rubber stamp. I want to ensure that Deputies, when they ask for information from those who are responsible to the House for the conduct of its business, they will be given that information.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to come in here and, from a superabundance of caution, ask the House to vote a Money Resolution if, in fact, a Money Resolution is not necessary.  The procedure which is laid down in this House has been very carefully considered.  There is the requirement that before any Bill which may involve the expenditure of public money passes to Committee Stage a Money Resolution will be put before the House, not merely put before the House in a formal manner in which it has been done here but put before the House in detail.  On numerous occasions I remember Money Resolutions being debated at great length.  I do not propose to follow that example, but I do propose to insist, if I can find sufficient support in the House to do so, that the business of the House will not be treated in the perfunctory sort of way of which we have an example here.</P>
    <P>I notice that Part IV of the Bill relates to arbitration.  Is it anticipated that any public liability will be incurred in relation to these arbitration proposals?  Perhaps the Attorney-General could answer that point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is re-enacting it and if under previous enactments expenditure <Col N="982" /> may be incurred is there anything in this part to show that the State may not find itself involved in expenditure again under this Bill? However, it is quite obvious that those responsible for the Bill are not disposed to treat the House seriously, that they have, as they have indicated on other occasions, a contempt for the procedure of this House.  Even outside this House some members of the Government indicated that they have a contempt for public opinion and they have challenged the people to get them out of this if they dare.  I am leaving the House.</P>

      <P>Before I move the various amendments, I should like to obtain the permission of the House for the procedure we propose to follow. As Deputies will be aware, the Statute of Limitations Bill is a difficult Bill. As I said on the Second Stage, it covers a large number of matters, and it is, in many respects, highly technical.  I also indicated that the law of limitation requires a specialised study in order to become fully conversant with its many ramifications and effects.  We are fortunate that the Attorney-General is a member of the House, and in discussing the details of the present Bill&mdash;and this applies to all our law reform proposals&mdash;we will be able to have his valuable assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are submitting 82 amendments for the approval of the House and have followed the policy which we adopted for the Bill of adding explanatory sidenotes to each amendment.  The idea of these sidenotes was welcomed by the House when we were discussing the Second Stage.  The sidenotes are often technical and to comprehend fully what is involved in the proposals needs very often a study of the leading cases we have cited.  Where Deputies raise particular points, the Attorney-General will do his best to explain the law as existing and the changes in the law <Col N="983" /> which the Bill, as amended, will seek to effect.</P>
    <P>I propose simply to move each amendment formally and the Attorney-General will then explain what exactly is involved from the legal point of view.  Any points raised which are not covered in the Bill will be considered between this and Report Stage.  I trust this will be approved.</P>
    <P>Before, however, I move any amendment I should like to state generally what the principal objects of the amendments taken as a whole are.</P>
    <P>First of all, we want to ensure that an executor or administrator may plead the statute except where he is guilty of fraud.  This will help people on farms, who have taken out administration, to establish title where the other members of the family or the next of kin do not make any claims or are abroad for a period of 12 years.  It will, we hope, also encourage people to take out administration. Secondly, we desire to cover all types of action which may be taken by a mortgagee so that the reforms contemplated in the Bill will be in conformity with the practice in this country as to mortgages.  Thirdly, we are suggesting that the position in regard to certain charges and burdens on land not at present specifically provided for should be covered.  Fourthly, we wish to enact that certain actions, such as actions to recover annuities charged on personal property, should have periods of limitation applied to them.  Finally, we are suggesting that the law as to the appropriation of part-payments made generally should be cleared up and put in statutory form.</P>
    <P>All the points made by Deputies on the Second Stage have been carefully considered, and, in so far as we could, we have tried to meet them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to postpone the date of the coming into operation of the Bill from January 1st next to September, 1957. It is hoped to have the Bill enacted in the next month or so.  People will then have about nine months in which to assert their rights, and any person whose limitation period might be shortened by the new legislation will have time within which to bring an action and protect his rights.  If Deputies think that a longer period is necessary, we have no objection to postponing the commencement of the Act still further but we think that nine months ought to be sufficient.  The Minister will arrange to draw to the attention of the public, when the Bill becomes law, the fact that persons who might be affected ought to consider taking such action as is necessary to protect their rights.  It will be noticed that Section 8 of the Bill prevents any action barred on the operative date being revived except in so far as the action may be revived by acknowledgment or part-payment.  Acknowledgment or part-payment always revives a debt even though the period of limitation has expired.  In actions to recover land (which includes rentcharges) the title is under Section 24 of the Bill extinguished and acknowledgment after the period of limitation has expired will serve no useful purpose as far as the person receiving the acknowledgment is concerned, because, his title having been extinguished, there is nothing to acknowledge.  In this type of case, therefore, it is immaterial when the new legislation commences for the reason I have given and also because the period of 12 years is not being altered.  In the case of State land there is an alteration being made in that the period of 60 years for former Crown land is being reduced to 40 years and, in the case of land belonging to a State authority which is not former Crown land, a period of limitation is being introduced for the first time.</P>

      <P>It seems to me, from an ordinary practical point of view, that it would be easier to have this come into operation on the first day of the year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a large Bill.  I raised a certain matter, when the Bill was introduced, in relation to certain charges on lands which have no effect on the sale or transference of lands as between private individuals, but which do affect the sale and transfer of land as between the State and individual owners.  Deputy Finlay pointed out to me that we might, in rectifying what I regard as an evil at the moment, run into some constitutional difficulties.  I was not concerned with the denial of property rights. Where, to use a famous phrase, the insistence upon right had been left in abeyance and where a charge on lands had not been paid for a particular period, that charge should no longer exist.  There should be a limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, I think these charges are abolished after about 80 <Col N="988" /> years.  They do not affect the sale or transfer of land as between private individuals, but they gravely affect the sale of land as between the farmer, the landowners, the Land Commission and the Board of Works.  I think a good deal of injustice is being done to landowners.  I know of cases where payment of any sort is being held up by the State simply because the original owner has disappeared from the face of the earth.  I think it is wrong to retain the right beyond some certain limited period.  I should like to be assured on that.</P>

    <P>This is a drafting amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment in a sense.  The aim is to cover all actions which are actions to recover land so that they will be brought within the provisions of Section 24 of the Bill and the other sections providing for the law in regard to such actions.  We are going to bring all recovery actions within that section. There are other sections, but Section 24 is the real root section.</P>
      <P>Besides the ordinary action to recover land, as where, for instance, B is in occupation of A's land and A desires to eject him, there are the three types of action mentioned in the amendment.  First of all, there is an action claiming title to land or, say, claiming title to a rentcharge.  The Irish case of <i>Vandaleur v. Sloane</i> (1919) 1 I.R. mentioned in the sidenote, and in which the Court of Appeal followed an old English decision of <i>Walters v. Webb</i>, decides that such an action is an action for the recovery of land to which the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833, as amended by the Act of 1874, applies.  The existing period, and also the period prescribed in the Bill, is 12 years.  An action claiming a declaration of title to land might be brought where it would be impracticable to recover possession of the land in view of the rights of tenants. It might also be brought in order to get a declaration from the court that a rentcharge was properly attaching to the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second type of action dealt with in the amendment is an action by a mortgagee against a mortgagor for the delivery of possession of the land.  The normal practice is that, when a person mortgages land, though the legal title under the instrument of mortgage vests in the mortgagee, the mortgagor remains on in possession of the land, his right being purely an equitable right to redeem the mortgage.  If the mortgagee wants to recover his money, <Col N="990" /> he may proceed to sell the land.  But in order that he may do this easily, he will often want vacant possession and hence he proceeds to obtain this possession from the mortgagor.  This type of action was at one time quite rare because a mortgagee obtaining possession must account to the mortgagor for any profits arising out of the land before he sells it.  The action is provided for in Order LV, rule 7, of the 1905 Supreme Court Rules.</P>
    <P>In the two cases <i>(Bank of Ireland v. Slattery</i> (1911) 1 I.R.; and <i>Ryan's Case</i> (1950) I.R.) cited in the footnote, the mortgagee wanted possession in order that he might easily realise the mortgage debt.  On the sale of the property, there would be no difficulty in allowing the purchaser to go into possession. Actions to recover land by a mortgagee would at present arise where a person with a mortgage on his house defaulted in his payments to an insurance company or building society <i>(Ryan's Case)</i> and the company wanted possession of the house to hand over to a purchaser or person willing to take over the mortgage loan.  I shall have more to say about mortgages under later amendments.</P>
    <P>The third kind of action which we want to cover is a proceeding under Section 13 of the 1942 Registration of Title Act.  Under this section, where a person is registered as the owner of a charge on land and the principal money has become due, the registered chargeant may apply to the court in a summary manner to be put into possession of the land.  On being so put into possession, he becomes a mortgagee in possession by virtue of the section and can sell the land.  No period of limitation is specially prescribed for this type of summary proceedings. The period will in future be 12 years.  It will, of course, be the same period as the existing period in the other two actions mentioned in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to make what really is a lawyer's point which I had not an opportunity of going into. This definition is for the moment immediately related to this particular enactment.  However, lawyers have a <Col N="991" /> habit sometimes, when they are casting round, of making the seemingly irrelevant relevant and finding it relevant.  Is there any danger in so extending the definition of an action to recover land that you may have unforeseen repercussions in regard to any other type of common action?  I do not see it myself.  I merely raise the point whether the matter has been looked at from the point of view of other common actions or procedures which are not specifically envisaged in this Bill from the point of view of limitation? In other words, can this definition, if universally adopted, cause confusion in relation to any other type of action relating to land?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> In sub-section (1), page 5, between lines 17 and 18, to insert:&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;charge&rsquo; includes a lien and a right in the nature of a lien for money's worth in or over land for a limited period not exceeding life, such as a right of support or a right of residence, not being an exclusive right of residence, in or on a specified part of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges on land or personal property are liens and not mortgages.  They confer no estate legal or personal.  Section 32 covers liens of various kinds under the term &ldquo;charge&rdquo;.  For instance, there is a vendor's lien for unpaid purchase money, which is an equitable charge on the property.  Liens may be charges on land or charges on personal property.  At present there is no bar to the recovery of money charged on personal property, but we are providing a period in Section 32 of the Bill. The real object of the present amendment is to cover rights of support and residence and I want to say something about these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rights in the nature of a lien such as rights of support and rights of residence arise very often in Irish rural districts.  I think I can best illustrate this matter by referring to the <i>Keegan's Case</i> (1931) I.R. which is mentioned in the sidenote.  By a memorandum agreement between C.K. and his aunt, M. K., made in 1915, C.K. agreed to give to M.K. &ldquo;during her life the exclusive use of the drawing-room and bedroom over same, with fuel and suitable support and maintenance&rdquo;, in a certain dwelling house, &ldquo;free of charge, the consideration for same being natural love and affection and services rendered&rdquo; by M.K. to C.K.; and C.K. thereby agreed with M.K. &ldquo;to execute a deed whenever called upon to carry out and give effect to the foregoing contract.&rdquo; In 1921 C.K. deposited the title deeds of the house with a bank to secure the payment of present and future advances.  Subsequently in 1927, a large sum being owing to the bank, they brought proceedings to enforce the mortgage and the question arose as to M. K's. rights.  It was held by the Supreme Court that she was <Col N="993" /> entitled to an equitable life estate in the two rooms, which interest was not subject to the bank's equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds, but that she was not entitled to a charge upon the premises for fuel and support and maintenance.  I should now like to read portion of the late Chief Justice Kennedy's judgment which will explain what is exactly involved in those types of cases&mdash;cases which will be familiar to Deputies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The instrument (i.e., the memorandum of agreement of 1915) presents two problems, viz.: first, as to the residential right, and, second, as to the right of support.  The residential rights which are so commonly given in farm holdings in this country, especially by way of testamentary provision for testators' widows, also frequently by the reservation to parents of rights in settlements made on the marriage of sons, are of two types, namely, the type which is a general right of residence charged on the holding usually coupled with a charge of maintenance; and the type which is a particular right of residence created by reserving or giving the right to the exclusive use during life of a specified room or rooms in the dwelling house on the holding.  The general right of residence charged on a holding is a right capable of being valued in moneys numbered at an annual sum, and of being represented by an annuity or money charge.  It is clear that such is not the type of benefit given by the instrument before us.  Here we have the second type of case, in which the exclusive use during her life of a specified part of the holding comprising two rooms is given to the beneficiary. If this benefit were given to her by a deed or a will, I think that it is clear that she would hold an estate for life in the property, legal or equitable, according to the terms of the instrument.  The document of the 27th September, 1915, is an executory agreement to grant such a life estate or interest, and to perfect it by a deed, if called for, and Mary Keegan went into immediate occupation and enjoyment of the premises, and took, and has held, exclusive <Col N="994" /> possession thereof ever since. ... In my opinion, Johnston J. rightly held that Mary Keegan is entitled to an equitable estate for life in the two rooms mentioned in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The second problem under the agreement is the question as to her right to &ldquo;fuel and suitable support and maintenance in the dwelling-house free of charge&rdquo;.  Johnston J., by his order, declared that this right amounted to an equitable charge on the lands and premises.  He does not, however, refer to this question in his written considered opinion, which is so full in every other branch of the case.  I regret this, because I have not been able to find in the agreement anything to support a charge of the fuel, support and maintenance agreed to be given to Mary Keegan. In my opinion, if she had called for a deed, she would not have been entitled under the terms of the agreement to ask for anything more than a covenant on the part of the defendant in respect of the fuel, support and maintenance which he agreed to give her, and she could not have required to have the benefits under the covenant charged on the house and premises.  I do not agree, therefore, with so much of the order under appeal as declares Mary Keegan entitled to a charge for fuel, support and maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the Chief Justice concluded his judgment by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In my opinion, she is entitled to an equitable life estate in the two rooms, which interest is not subject to the plaintiff's equitable mortgage. In so far as the order of Johnston J. so declares it should be affirmed; but, in so far as it declares that there is a charge on the premises for fuel, support and maintenance, it should in my opinion be reversed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Exclusive rights of residence are accordingly equitable estates and the Bill will by reason of Section 25 (1) apply to them.  Non-exclusive rights of residence and rights of support do not of themselves create equitable estates but they may be registered as burdens on registered land under the <Col N="995" /> provisions of rule 99 of the 1937 Land Registration Rules.  It is this type of burden that the amendment is concerned with.  Such burdens whether registered or non-registered will, by reason of the amendment, be charges to which the limitation provisions as to ordinary charges will apply.</P>
    <P>We may have to reconsider the wording of this amendment and of Section 32 (1) but we can do this on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;No action shall be brought to recover any principal sum of money secured by a mortgage or charge on land or personal property....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, charge will be defined as a lien and &ldquo;a right in the nature of a lien for money's worth in or over land.&rdquo;  Is it proposed that the word &ldquo;charge&rdquo; is also to include a lien over personal property&mdash;for example, goods?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 and amendment No. 13 do a certain thing and really go together.  Possibly, therefore, we can look at them together. As far as amendment No. 6 is concerned, we are deleting line 22 &ldquo;(No. 4 of 1946)&rdquo; and reinstating it, but with an addition.  We are substituting &ldquo;(No. 4 of 1946), but does not include a fee-farm rent payable under a grant which creates the relationship of landlord and tenant.&rdquo;  All fee-farm rents are being made rentcharges under amendment No. 13.  It is not quite clear in the Bill that all fee-farm rents are rentcharges and, in order that I might explain this, perhaps I could say something on fee-farm rents.  This question was raised by Deputy Moylan on the Second Stage and he was later kind enough to give to the Department of Justice a specific case of what he had in mind. When the Bill was originally drafted <Col N="998" /> we took it that all fee-farm rents were rentcharges by reason of the way they originate and because of their nature. Still, in the case cited by Deputy Moylan, there was the suggestion that the law was not specific enough as to the period of limitation applicable.</P>
      <P>Fee-farms are of three kinds.  First of all, there are the ordinary fee-farm rents at common law, which do not set up the relationship of landlord and tenant at all.  At common law a fee-farm rent arose where there was a grant in fee with a regrant of a rentcharge. In other words, the land was held subject to the rentcharge.  There is no reversion in the grantor and there is no doubt that these rents are rentcharges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there are the fee-farm rents arising under the Renewable Leasehold Conversion Act, 1850.  At the time of the Act many lands in Ireland were held under leaseholds with covenants for perpetual renewal, and it appears from the recital in the 1850 Act that great expense was constantly incurred in procuring renewals, and that it was expedient that such tenures should be converted into tenures in fee.  The Act provided that the owner of the lease could require the owner of the reversion to execute a grant of an estate of inheritance in fee simple in such lands subject to a perpetual fee-farm rent to be charged upon the lands.  Under the Act, two estates were created, one being an estate of inheritance in the lands and the other an estate of inheritance in the fee-farm rent.  The difficulty arose because Section 20 of the Act provided that the fee-farm rent was to be recoverable in the same way as a rent service (an ordinary conventional rent) reserved in a common lease was recoverable, but this did not make it a rent service for the purposes of the statutes of limitation, and so the land judge, Judge Ross, decided in the <i>Maunsell Estate Case</i> (1911) 1 I.R., which we have cited opposite amendment No. 13.  The term rent service is now obsolete in this country since Deasy's Act of 1860, which provided that a reversion was no longer to be necessary in a lease.  Under Section 3 of that Act the relation of landlord and <Col N="999" /> tenant is founded on the contract of the parties and not upon tenure or service. A conventional rent is an incident of the ownership by the landlord. A rentcharge is an encumbrance on the ownership of the person in possession.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there are fee-farm rents under Deasy's Act.  These create the relationship of landlord and tenant and Section 2 of Deasy's Act applies to all fee-farm grants made since the 1st January, 1861, which set up the relation of landlord and tenant.  It is important to note that, though the relationship of landlord and tenant is established and though the grantor is given all the rights and remedies of recovery such as a landlord has, the nature of the rent is not changed.  The grantor has no estate in fee in the lands for there cannot be two estates in fee co-existing in the lands.  The grantor merely retains a statutory right to recover an estate in fee in certain events.  His estate is in the rent which remains a rentcharge.</P>
    <P>The position was further complicated by the Land Code.  The benefits conferred on ordinary tenants by the Land Law Act of 1881 were gradually extended to other classes, to lessees by the Land Law Act of 1887 and finally to grantees under fee-farm rents.  The relationship of landlord and tenant, for the purposes of the particular Act, but only for such purposes, is assumed to exist between parties who were not landlords or tenants at all, because the landlords had no estates in fee in the lands.</P>
    <P>The definitions of conventional rent and rentcharge as amended by this amendment and amendment No. 13, respectively, will remove any doubt that may exist as to what category the different types of fee-farm rent belong. In all cases they will be rentcharges and for the very logical reason that the grantor has no estate of inheritance in fee in the lands but has an estate of inheritance in fee in the fee-farm rent.</P>
    <P>By reason of the clear-cut distinction we are making between conventional rent and rentcharge in this and some later amendments, we will get rid of the difficulty which arises under the <Col N="1000" /> Real Property Limitation Act, 1833, as amended by the 1874 Act.  The word &ldquo;rent&rdquo; occurs many times in the 1833 Act meaning at one time rent service or conventional rent and at another, rentcharge.  In Section 9 of the 1833 Act it occurs seven times&mdash;in four cases meaning conventional rent and in three cases meaning rentcharge, and it takes a specialist knowledge of the Act and the cases thereunder to find out when it means what.  In our Bill as amended, where we mean rentcharge, we propose to say rentcharge, and, where we mean conventional rent, we will say conventional rent.  As originally drafted we did not think that any difficulty could arise.  Investigation of Deputy Moylan's point has, however, led us to the conclusion that it would be much better to make assurance doubly sure and to save the expense which might be involved in having the matter finally settled by the courts in a particular case.  Amendment No. 13 links up a bit with this and I will deal with that in a moment.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that the net position is something like this: that the attempt is being made to define &ldquo;rent&rdquo; in what would be loosely described as the &ldquo;conventional rent&rdquo; meaning, and going back to what was more or less called the &ldquo;rentcharge,&rdquo; and you are separating as rentcharges, everything that would have been a rentcharge in the original sense of the fee-farm rents, for instance?  In other words, where you have what is a fee-farm estate, namely, a perpetual estate in the land subject to a rent, you are going to treat that rent as a rentcharge&mdash;is that roughly the position?</P>

      <P>This is purely a drafting amendment necessary in order to define &ldquo;judgment mortgage&rdquo;, an expression which occurs in amendment No. 8.  Judgment mortgages in Ireland are dealt with in the Irish Judgment Mortgage Act of 1850.  The Act allows a court judgment to be registered by affidavit by the creditor under the judgment against the lands of the debtor. The registration has the effect of an ordinary legal mortgage in that it vests all the estate of the debtor in the lands in the creditor, subject, of course, to a right of redemption on payment of the money owing under the judgment.  The legal estate being vested in the creditor, he may obtain possession of the property by the action to recover the land mentioned in amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>This amendment <Col N="1004" /> defines a mortgage to include the judgment mortgage dealt with in the previous amendment and an equitable mortgage.  An equitable mortgage arises in three ways. First of all, the equity of redemption of a mortgage may be mortgaged. That is to say, the mortgagor's right in equity to redeem a mortgage of his property on payment of the mortgage debt may itself be mortgaged. Secondly, an agreement in writing to execute a legal mortgage creates in the creditor an equitable mortgage; and this means that he has a right to demand the execution of a proper legal mortage.  Thirdly&mdash;and this is the usual type of case&mdash;an equitable mortgage may be created by deposit of title deeds with, say, a bank to secure an advance of money.  This type of mortgage arose in <i>Keegan's Case</i> which I mentioned in dealing with amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>An equitable mortgagee, where the mortgage instrument is under seal, can exercise all the powers given to a mortgagee by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, and, if he has a right to possession, he can exercise the power of sale. An equitable mortgagee is not the same as a chargeant.  A charge gives the chargeant a lien on the property but, as I explained in dealing with amendment No. 5, it does not give him either a legal or an equitable estate in the property.  A chargeant can apply to the court to have the property sold in order to realise the charge, and, as I mentioned when discussing amendment No. 3, if the property is registered land, a registered chargeant may have himself put in possession by going to the court in a summary manner under Section 13 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with mortgages and charges.  This amendment defines &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; and amendment No. 5 defines &ldquo;charge&rdquo;.</P>

We propose to exclude personal representatives from the operation of the provisions as to trustees.  I shall have more to say on this question when we come to amendment No. 14 <Col N="1006" /> and later amendments.  Personal representatives under the Land Acts arise where land is vested by the Land Commission in a particular person appointed to be the administrator of a deceased tenant or nominated to represent a person who is dead, absent or under a disability.  The idea is that persons so nominated or appointed should be deemed to be personal representatives so as to be able to plead the statute and obtain title after 12 years. Section 18 (4) of the Land Act, 1953, gives these limited administrators and nominated representatives full power to transfer or otherwise deal with land. References to these persons will also be found in Section 67 of the Land Act, 1923, and in Section 54 of the Land Act, 1939.  This hangs on amendment No. 14 and I think the House will have a better view of it when we come to deal with amendment No. 14.</P>

In respect of such land, there is no such person as the heir-at-law so that the provisions of Sections 21 and 22 of the Bill which provide for possession by a younger brother or by <Col N="1007" /> a co-parcener have no application to such land.  Co-parceners are female heirs and they all take together jointly where there is no male heir.</P>

      <P>This amendment is a corollary to amendment No. 6.  It requires a bit of trouble to put it into the text of the Bill.  We want to make it quite clear that fee-farm rents are rentcharges for the purposes of the statute, and this whether or not they create the relationship of landlord and tenant.  I have referred to <i>Maunsell's Estate Case</i> (1911) 1 I.R. already in dealing with amendment No. 6.  We relied on this case in the draft of the Bill, but as I have said we think it better to remove any doubt.  Further, the decision of Judge Ross that fee-farm rents are rentcharges might possibly be overruled and, apart from this, the decision only covers the type of fee-farm rent which was in question in the case.  The amendment comes in the order of (d), (e) and (f) following (a), (b) and the new (c).  As I say, it is a corollary to amendment No. 6.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  It covers a matter that was raised here and was the subject of controversy in the House on the Second Reading.  As at present drafted, the specific provisions in regard to trustees apply to all trustees whether they are express trustees or trustees whose trusts arise by operation or implication of law.  These latter are known as constructive trustees.  As the Minister explained on the Second Stage, one of the objects of the Bill was to consolidate the relevant provisions of the Trustee Act, 1888, and apply them to all trustees.  It has been argued that the intention of the 1888 Act was that all trustees should be in the same position; but it was held that an executor or administrator could plead the Statute although he retained the property.  An express trustee cannot plead the Statute where he retains the property or is guilty of fraud.  Express trustees are, of course, trustees specially so created in the trust instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two views on this matter and we have carefully considered them. <Col N="1010" /> First of all, there are those who say that a constructive trustee is in a peculiar relationship with the beneficiaries and that he should not be allowed to abuse his position by retaining property belonging to the beneficiaries. This is the view which was adopted in England by the Law Revision Committee in its Fifth Interim Report presented in 1936, and that view is now enshrined in the English Limitation Act of 1939.  On the Second Stage of our Bill, Deputy Finlay and the present Minister for the Gaeltacht were inclined to favour that view.  On the other side is the view that constructive trustees, like everybody else except express trustees, should be able to plead the Statute and establish title by long possession. This is the view as expressed by Deputy Boland and Deputy Glynn in regard to personal representatives.</P>
    <P>We have considered this matter very carefully and we have been particularly impressed by the examples cited by both Deputy Boland and Deputy Glynn.  We examined the law which was adopted for personal representatives in the Six Counties in their Administration of Estates Act of 1955. Deputies will find the subject very thoroughly discussed in an excellent handbook which has just been published in Belfast on that Act and which was written by Mr. Leitch, who was the draftsman responsible for the Act. I mention this book because it should prove very helpful when the House comes to discuss the provisions of a comprehensive Administration of Estates Bill which we have at present under examination.  We have, also, consulted the Registrar and Assistant Registrar of Titles in the Land Registry, officers who have had a wide and specialised experience in matters concerning registered land.</P>
    <P>The Bill as amended will propose to allow constructive trustees, be they personal representatives or others, to plead the Statute.  The problem in so far as this country is concerned arises mainly in rural areas.  If a registered owner dies intestate leaving, say, three children and two of the children leave the farm to get married or to take up employment elsewhere, the son who remains on in the farm is in a peculiar <Col N="1011" /> position at the moment.  If he takes out administration he may find himself in the position of an express trustee, if <i>In re Loughlin</i> (1942) I.R. is correct. As an express trustee he can never establish title and an application to the court under Section 52 of the 1891 Act will fail.  This section says that &ldquo;where any person but for the provisions of this Act would have obtained a title by mere possession to any registered land, he may apply to the court in the prescribed manner for an order declaring his title to such land, and the court, if satisfied that such title would have been acquired but for the provision of this Act, may make an order declaring such title, and ordering the register to be rectified in such manner as it thinks just.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite the words &ldquo;but for the provisions of this Act&rdquo; in Section 52, <i>Loughlin's Case</i> has decided that an administrator in the case of registered land is an express trustee because he is made such by the provisions of Part IV of the Act, and that, consequently, he can never establish title by lapse of time.  The same is the position if he is an executor of a will of registered land.  If he is a personalty representative where leasehold property is concerned, he <i>can</i> establish title.  In preparing the Bill, we were conscious of this and decided to put all administrators and executors in the same position.  The question now is as to what is to be that position.</P>
    <P>On reconsideration, we have decided to propose, for the agreement of the House, that, along with other constructive trustees, personal representatives be allowed to plead the Statute except where they are guilty of fraud.  This we are doing in amendment No. 45. Our opinion is that this is the best policy to follow, because it is a policy more in line with Irish social conditions. The decision in <i>Loughlin's Case</i> has, admittedly, been questioned and the late Mr. Justice O'Byrne reserved his attitude on the point in a later case of <i>Owen v. McGarry</i> (1948) I.R. I notice from Mr. Leitch's book that it is understood that a somewhat different view from that in <i>Loughlin's Case</i> was taken in an unreported case <Col N="1012" /> up North and I gather that there is at present a prospect of having <i>Loughlin's Case</i> questioned in our Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to settle the matter one way or the other in our Bill.  The provisions now proposed will be in line with the Government policy (recently declared by the Taoiseach) to facilitate the establishment of title.  In addition, the new provisions will, we hope, encourage people to take out administration to estates in all cases.</P>
    <P>The amendment under consideration will also cover cases where an interest in land, vested in a purchaser under the Land Purchase Acts, is deemed to be a graft on any previous interest in the land.  This will make it quite clear that, where land purchased through the Land Commission is subject to previous rights or equities, the vested owner will be able to establish title as against the owners of any such rights or equities.</P>
    <P>The new provisions will not, of course, help an executor who is specifically made a trustee for the beneficiaries under the will.  In such a case he is more than an executor, being, in fact, intentionally constituted an express trustee.  In such a case it would be improper deliberately to allow the executor to circumvent the express terms of the will.  This amendment has to be read with amendment No. 45 and then related to the trustee sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I would like to raise on that. There is a matter of policy in this.  I think we will probably agree that the line now taken is the better line.  It will go a certain distance towards meeting the points that have been raised on previous occasions.  The question is whether the draft here is the best way of effecting that.  I would like to put this to the Minister and to the Attorney-General: in the form in which this amendment is submitted, the effect is that &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; does not include a constructive trustee.  Perhaps that is going rather further than they might wish to go and I am bringing them right back to the point in regard to the rentcharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney-General does not want <Col N="1013" /> to separate constructive trusts from express trusts for all purposes?  If I understand the Attorney-General properly, he wants to put constructive trusts in this regard on the same footing as other constructive trusts?  Would it not, therefore, be better to use the two words &ldquo;express trustee&rdquo; and &ldquo;constructive trustee&rdquo;?  You may also have to provide for an implied trustee.  In effect, what you are saying in this is that &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; does not include constructive trustee.  Should you not say &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; means express trustee?  You would have to define that and leave constructive trusts in their ordinary interpretation.  In other words, could you not use the terms in the forms more or less normally used and frame your definitions accordingly without bringing in complications?  I do not know if I have made my point clear.</P>

I do not expect that that can be answered immediately on the spot and I would simply ask if the Minister will consider that as a possible improvement in the drafting of that section.  I do not expect an immediate answer here.  We are agreed on the principle of the Bill but I would suggest that for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to delete sub-section (2), which has reference to foreclosure.  The sub-section is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In this Act references to a foreclosure action shall, in relation to land, be construed as including references to an action claiming the sale of the land instead of foreclosure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is proposed now to delete that sub-section. As the Minister mentioned on the Second Stage there is no such thing as foreclosure in Ireland.  When the Bill was being prepared, we relied on an earlier case and did not advert to a later leading case of <i>Waters v. Lloyd</i> (1911) 1 I.R. in which Lord Justice Holmes in the old Court of Appeal dealt comprehensively with the differences between the law in Ireland and in England.  Some of his judgment will, I hope, clarify what the position is with us:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The remedies given by the well-settled law and practice of this country to mortgagees differ in one essential feature from those usually adopted in England.  In both countries, the mortgagee is entitled to gain possession of the land by an action of ejectment or otherwise; but as the mortgagor may years afterwards <Col N="1016" /> bring a suit to redeem the mortgage, in which the mortgagee must account for the rents and profits he has received, this is a course rarely resorted to.  In England, the usual remedy of the mortgagee is an action to foreclose, the judgment in which makes him the absolute owner of the mortgaged lands if the mortgagor does not redeem within a limited period.</P>
    <P>I understand that this is the course taken, not only by the first mortgagee, but also by mortgagees of the equity of redemption who undertake to redeem the earlier mortgages, and even by a person whose right as mortgagee arises from a deposit of the title-deeds of the lands.  In these cases the lands themselves become the property of the foreclosing mortgagee; and they seem to me to be actions or suits to recover land within the meaning of the first section (Section 1 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874). In Ireland foreclosure is unknown. The mortgagee who desires to put an end to the mortgage takes proceedings to obtain, not the mortgaged land, but the money secured by it. The judgment he seeks is that the lands be sold by the court, and that all persons interested therein be paid out of the proceeds in due priority.  This court recently considered the effect of this mode of procedure in connection with the arrears of interest which a mortgagee was entitled to be paid out of the purchase money of the mortgaged property; and, as far as we could ascertain, sale of the lands, by the Court of Chancery, and in later times by the Landed Estates Court, has in Ireland always taken the place of foreclosure in England.  Mr. Ronan has called our attention to a remarkable legislative recognition of the difference of practice in the two countries which is to be found in Section 25 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881.  This section, which authorises the court to direct a sale of the property in foreclosure and redemption suits, ends with the provision that it does not extend to Ireland, which can only be accounted for by the fact <Col N="1017" /> that the settled practice in this country made it unnecessary.  Now, while an English foreclosure action may be properly described as an action to recover land, a proceeding taken by an Irish mortgagee to realise his charge by selling the lands subject thereto is not so.  It is, in the words of Section 8, that is, Section 8 of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, an action, suit, or other proceeding to recover money secured by a mortgage, similar to a proceeding to realise a lien for unpaid purchase money or any other sum charged upon or payable out of land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question which arose in <i>Waters v. Lloyd</i> was as to whether an acknowledgment of a mortgage debt having been made by an agent was sufficient to keep alive the right to have the lands sold and the debt realised.  If an action for sale was an action to recover land, the acknowledgment made would not satisfy the law as it was made by an agent.  If, however, it was an action to recover money secured by a mortgage the acknowledgment was sufficient.  The court of appeal held that it was an action to recover money.  The point as to the type of acknowledgment required will, in future, be academic in view of Section 47 of the Bill which proposes to allow an acknowledgment made by an agent to be effective in every case. But the point at issue in the case could still be vital where an acknowledgment is made after the period of limitation has expired, and for the reason that, if actions for sale were to remain, for the purposes of the Statute, actions to recover a mortgaged debt, these actions could still be brought irrespective of the date of the acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>In this respect, we think that <i>Waters v. Lloyd</i> should be overruled and that actions for the sale of mortgaged property should be put on the same footing as actions for the recovery of land.  In other words, once the period has elapsed both the remedy and the right should be barred.  At present the position is anomalous.  A mortgagee may want to get possession of land to effect a sale and, as I have indicated in dealing with amendment No. 3, this <Col N="1018" /> type of action may now become more popular than in the days of Lord Justice Holmes.  At the end of the statutory period, if there has been no acknowledgment, an action to get possession of the mortgaged land is barred but an action to have the land sold may not be, if there is a subsequent acknowledgment.</P>
    <P>We think that, when an action to eject the mortgagor is barred and the right extinguished, an action to sell him out should also be barred and the right extinguished.  The law, as we propose it should be, in regard to actions for sale, will be found in amendments Nos. 36 and 37, and the matter will arise there.  Our proposals will cover all actions by a mortgagee specifically and clearly and the different categories into which they are to be placed will be clearly indicated.  I have gone into this matter in detail on this amendment in order that our proposals may appear in proper perspective, but they will arise on the two amendments that I have referred to&mdash; 36 and 37.</P>

It is desirable specifically to provide for the question.  A later amendment, amendment No. 26, provides for a special period of limitation of two years.</P>

      <P>What it simply means is that the statute is stopped from running by the bringing of an action within the time.  In the first instance, if A injures B, B has an action accruing from the date of injury and time starts to run against B from that date but if, within the time allowed by the statute, B initiates an action then the statute ceases to run against him.</P>

If A injures B the statute runs as from the date of injury.  B arrests the run of the statute by bringing an action.  He prosecutes the action to a conclusion and gets a judgment.  The statute does not start to run again till the judgment is obtained and runs from the date of the judgment according to this.  What happens in the case where B stops the statute running in the first instance but does not prosecute the action to judgment and the action is not determined? <Col N="1020" /> How long will the right stay alive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to cover the registered owner of a charge on land.  I have already discussed the registered chargeant in dealing with amendment No. 3.  Under Section 40 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, a registered owner of land may charge the land with the payment of money either with or without interest, and either by way of annuity or otherwise.  The owner of the charge is registered as such and the charge is created by an instrument in the prescribed form and the chargeant receives a certificate of charge from the Land Registry.  The instrument of charge has the same effect as a mortgage by deed and the chargeant has all the rights and powers of a mortgagee under a mortgage deed.  As I have already pointed out, he may under Section 13 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, apply <Col N="1022" /> to the court in a summary manner to be put in possession of the land when the principal money has become due. If the court orders possession, he shall be deemed a mortgagee in possession.</P>
      <P>We want to bring the registered chargeant specifically within the orbit of the Bill.  Statute has put him in a better position than a chargeant of non-registered land and we propose to recognise that position in the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Forestry and Land Commission Workers' Superannuation&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that legislative proposals should be introduced at an early date to provide a superannuation scheme for forestry and Land Commission workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> This motion was put down for the purpose of bringing to the notice of the House the necessity to provide superannuation for forestry and Land Commission workers.  I am sure the Minister is aware that practically all workers in the country at the present time in permanent and semi-permanent employment are superannuated and, for that reason, I felt there should be no difficulty in having this motion accepted by him.</P>
    <P>I understand that, at present, there are about 5,000 forestry employees and a much smaller number of Land Commission employees who are employed all the year round and over a number of years.  Many of them are employed for their working life and yet, when they have to retire because of age or for any other reason, they are not given an opportunity of having a pension granted to them.  I felt that by putting down this motion this House could have a discussion on it and I am sure the Minister will be prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>I think the question of the Land Commission workers should be dealt with first because their case is much different from that of the forestry workers.  We know that a considerable number of workers are employed on short-time employment with the Land Commission building fences, building houses, making roads, and so forth. The vast majority of them are only casual workers and could not, therefore, be included in any superannuation scheme.  I am referring particularly to gangers and such people who have been employed over many years by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, at present, the Land Commission have a system in operation whereby the equivalent of one week's wages is paid for each year of service&mdash;I am open to correction on this but I think it is correct&mdash;to Land Commission gangers who are disemployed after a period of 15 years' continuous service.  I consider that this is hardly adequate.  The Land Commission may think they are doing a big service to a man if they give him £100, £150 or £200 but I do not think it could be considered very big compensation to somebody who has spent <Col N="1027" /> 15 or 20 years of his life in the employment of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is the argument which we find very often in industry that a worker receives a week's wages and that that is all he should look for and that if he gets constant employment with the week's wages he should be satisfied.  I do not agree with that at all.  I believe the worker who gets a week's wages is simply getting sufficient to keep himself and family, if he has one, in food, clothing, shelter and all the other little things that are required.  However, the present rate of wages does not give him anything to put by for the rainy day.  It does not give him anything to put by for his old age.  I am sure the State should set a headline in these matters.  I propose to show this evening that, far from setting a headline, the State has lagged behind.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be no difficulty in getting the Land Commission to introduce a scheme which would be operated in perhaps the same way as the local authorities' contributory superannuation scheme.  That would result in giving pensions to Land Commission gangers in proportion to their service and wages, on retirement.  I also believe that the forestry end of it &mdash;which is a very much bigger problem &mdash;could be tackled and that a similar scheme could be operated for them.</P>
    <P>The argument may be put up that this pensions scheme would cost a lot of money which could be spent on developing forestry.  I do not agree with that argument because I believe that even if the same type of scheme, as introduced in 1948 and amended last year, for local authority employees, is put into operation, it would mean that a forestry worker getting £5 per week would pay slightly over 4/- per week for superannuation, and with approximately 5,000 forestry workers employed, 4/- per week deducted from them for superannuation would result in approximately £1,000 per week being paid into the pool from the first week the scheme was put into operation. Since there is a very small number of forestry workers with anything like 15 to 20 years' service, it <Col N="1028" /> would be a very considerable time before there would be any withdrawals at all for payments of the pension.</P>
    <P>If such a scheme were put into operation, a very considerable amount of money would be accumulated before anybody at all would apply for a pension or before there would be anything like a substantial withdrawal. Since the vast majority of the people employed by the forestry section were recruited over the past five years, it would be 25, or even 30, years perhaps, in normal circumstances, before those people would apply for superannuation. That being so, it appears on the face of it that the superannuation scheme should be well able to carry itself without any contribution at all from the State.</P>
    <P>I give those figures as a layman, but possibly if an actuary were called in to assess the scheme, he might find a lot of snags which are not apparent to me at the present time.  No matter what way you look at it, it means that a superannuation scheme would be an economic proposition for the forestry section and the Land Commission.  It could and should be done.</P>
    <P>Possibly the argument may be put forward by the Minister that there are not so many constant employees in the forestry section and for that reason it might not be easy to administer the scheme.  If there are not so many employees, there should be.  I do not agree at all that the employees on State forests who have been trained for a number of years should be scrapped, that somebody new should be taken in and trained, and that after a few years they also should be dismissed.  I suggest that a superannuation scheme of the type I propose would be one way of ensuring that the people in the employment of the forestry section for a number of years would be retained when there was a shortage of work for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>I am also told that there is a build up in so far as forestry is concerned; that the figure is increasing and that the amount of work which will be done in the years to come will be greater. The greater that will be, the greater the amount of employment given.  I <Col N="1029" /> would be very anxious to see that happening. I do not see how any argument can be advanced to prevent a scheme of the type I suggest being put into operation.  If an employee was on short time, wanted to leave or was dismissed by the forestry people the provisions of the Superannuation Act would guarantee him a return of his contributions and he would thus be safeguarded from any possibility of loss.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the scheme would have to be compulsory, because, if some people were allowed to opt out, there would be difficulties.  In regard to the local authorities' superannuation scheme, there were people who for one reason or another did not apply at the start of the scheme and who kicked up a row to be included after the date had passed when they could apply.  It would be necessary to include everybody employed by the forestry section.</P>
    <P>It may possibly be argued that the people who would pay into the scheme might claim a prior right to employment. I think they are entitled to claim that.  No matter what way one looks at it, forestry is an important part of our economy and the people employed in it should be put on some secure basis of tenure.  I think they are entitled to that.  A number of things might be adduced in argument against the proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that possibly it might be necessary to modify slightly the 1948 and the 1950-55 local authorities' superannuation scheme.  I do not know what arguments could be employed to prevent the scheme being put into operation.  There is, however, one argument which is almost certain to be advanced, that is, that if this scheme is put into operation for forestry and Land Commission employees, it may be asked for in regard to other State employees.  In that connection, I should like to point out that the Department of Lands are by far the biggest direct State employers. I understand that the Board of Works and other such bodies who have a number of people in their employment all the year round could not under any circumstances be compared with the <Col N="1030" /> Department of Lands, so far as employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>The employees of whom I speak are out on their own and should be considered on their own merits.  I also understand that some of the semi-State bodies, such as Board na Móna, are at the present time considering a scheme of superannuation.  I know that the E.S.B. and many other semi-State employers have already a scheme in operation.  For that reason, I do not think there is any answer in the world to this proposal.  There is a very small number of people employed by the Department of Lands for a long number of years who might possibly in a few years' time claim a pension, but, as I said earlier, even before anybody is entitled to a pension, the amount of money which will have accumulated will be so great that there need be no fear whatever that the fund will be unable without any contributions from the State to carry out the scheme.</P>
    <P>One other point I would like to make is that when the local authorities' superannuation scheme was being put to this House, a suggestion was made that the amounts of the contribution should be much smaller.  Personally, I am in favour of a much smaller contribution, but if it comes to a question of having a scheme with higher contributions than we would like or no scheme at all, then I think we should have the scheme, even if it means paying a fairly high amount each week.  Possibly, it may be argued that workers themselves are not in favour of such a scheme.  I do not agree that that is so, because I know that the trade union which I represent travels all over the country, and, when dealing with forestry workers, we find everywhere a demand for some type of superannuation scheme.  They want to know why it is that the man at the bottom of the lader should be the last to be catered for.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter fully and give justice to these men, even if they do not do the planning, and are not responsible for the provision of the cash which carries out the scheme. Without the forestry workers and the Land Commission labourers, a very important work could not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I agree with the mover's remarks about Land Commission workers and particularly do I agree with the necessity for providing, as is asked for in this motion, a superannuation scheme for forestry workers.  It must, of necessity, be tied up with our whole approach to forestry.  Workers at the present time can see that in many, if not in all, of the counties of the Twenty-Six that we hold, after a number of years of consistent employment with local authorities, they can secure a pension at the end of their working days.  Of necessity, we must say that if we hope to secure the best type of workers available for forestry purposes, then we must offer to them at least the same consideration in regard to what pension scheme they may have at the end of their working days, as is being offered by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as Deputy Tully said, may draw attention to the fact that there are so many workers in forestry who are considered only as casual workers.  Should that case be put forwards, then our answer must be that the same applies to workers for the local authorities and provision is made for casual workers.  They are entitled to a refund of the contributions paid by them.  We realise that it is essential to provide forestry not alone with a sufficient number of workers but with the best type of workers.  It may be said, as it has been said in regard to the local authorities' superannuation scheme, by some people, that the contributions are too high.  Like Deputy Tully, I would like to see them lower, but we must also say, as some people may suggest, as they have done outside this House, that, because of the contributions being too heavy, it would be more advantageous for some of these workers to pay into some insurance. We do not agree with that because the very fact of the money being deducted, means that if they must pay into some other insurance fund, it is very likely that, with other financial commitments, they will not find it easy or economical to pay into these other funds as much as they may be paying into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the forestry worker has a superannuation <Col N="1032" /> scheme, he can say that he is on a par with his fellow workers working for local authorities and for whom pensions are being provided, and he can say that there is some do-finite inducement for him not only to continue in forestry but to take a greater interest in it as a national scheme which can undoubtedly absorb a larger number of men.  I would ask the Minister, in view of his statements in this House and in view of our policy in regard to forestry as a whole, to consider the urgent necessity of implementing and putting into operation a scheme which, if not exactly such as that suggested here, will give to the workers already employed and to those who may in the future be interested in forestry for a living, a scheme which may be to their advantage and ultimately to this State an advantage which at the present time may be undreamt of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am personally satisfied that the mover of the motion, Deputy Tully, and his seconder, Deputy Desmond, are very sincere in putting down this motion.  They are anxious to focus the attention of the House on the conditions under which forestry workers and Land Commission workers work.  Generally speaking, I agree with the viewpoints of the Deputies who have spoken already and I think that the majority of Deputies agree with them also.</P>
      <P>The type of person to which this motions refers is the ordinary working man who has to work out in the fields, whether he be engaged in work for the Land Commission or for the Forestry Department.  Generally speaking, he is exposed to winds and weather.  For that reason, I am sure they will have the sympathy of the majority of the members of the House.  I am personally satisfied that there is no member who is more sympathetic towards them or more likely to consider them than the present Minister who is himself a rural Deputy, who is conversant with their mode of living and who has lived amongst them.  I would prefer to leave this whole matter to the Minister for the reason that I know he is interested in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that because he has discussed <Col N="1033" /> matters of this kind already with some of the people concerned.  It should be appreciated that the majority of the people who engage in Land Commission or forestry work, certainly in my part of the country, are small and perhaps uneconomic holders.  They are only inclined to engage on Land Commission or forestry work for short periods in order to supplement their incomes.  That is true of the province of Connacht generally.  I live amongst these people and I know their minds; they want something to cushion them against the difficulties of the times.  It may not be a lot, but it is something on which they can fall back when necessary.  They like to get some cash income for a short period to supplement their incomes.</P>
    <P>That type of individual is not anxious for a superannuation scheme. These workers, as I have already said, are outdoor workers.  Deputy Tully pointed out that some of them would not benefit under such a scheme for 25 to 30 years.  From that point of view it would be difficult to encourage such workers to enter such a scheme.  Generally speaking, they feel they may never derive any benefit.</P>
    <P>As we grow older, all of us prefer indoor to outdoor employment.  We look for employment under the roof. Many of the people engaged on this type of work are looking forward to working under the roof eventually in preference to continuing with the Forestry Division or the Land Commission. If these people had insurance policies on their lives, such policies would afford them much better protection. I am convinced that the majority of them feel that way about this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to superannuation, I understand a man must have five years' contributions paid before his death so that his wife may qualify for compensation and, even then, the amount of compensation is rather niggardly.  If a man has to have five years' contributions paid before his wife can receive the equivalent of one year's pay, I do not think the scheme is so very attractive. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why forestry workers are not clamouring for a superannuation scheme.  I <Col N="1034" /> have forestry workers living about four miles away from me.  I know forestry workers living eight miles away from me.  All over Mayo there are forestry workers.  I meet them regularly.  I have never heard them clamouring for any superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to Bord na Móna.  He said Bord na Móna is considering a superannuation scheme.  No doubt, it is.  Bord na Móna give good and decent employment, generally speaking.  But Bord na Móna has been quite a long time in existence and it is only now the members of that Board are considering the introduction of a superannuation scheme.  I suggest that the delay is due to the fact that the majority of Bord na Móna workers are seasonal workers.  A lot of the Board's activities are outdoor.  The workers are exposed to winds and weather and they are hopeful that some day they will get employment indoor or under the roof.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is most sympathetic to these workers.  He comes from a rural area and he appreciates their difficulties.  He has very good advisers at his disposal.  I am sure he has discussed this matter with them, with both his indoor staff and his outdoor staff, on different occasions. He fully realises all the implications and all the difficulties such a scheme would present.  I know that he is most anxious to introduce a scheme and his main anxiety is that, when he does introduce such a scheme, it will be a satisfactory scheme, the type of scheme which will bring benefit to the kind of people Deputy Tully and Deputy Desmond have in mind.</P>
    <P>I join my voice with the voices of other Deputies who have spoken.  I urge the Minister to give this matter full consideration.  I am sure the Minister will do his best to bring a satisfactory scheme in at the earliest possible date, the kind of scheme that will benefit all.</P>

      <P>I suppose this motion, like many other motions, may serve a useful purpose.  I would support it if I thought it was brought in for the purpose of looking after genuine workers. At the same time, before we embark <Col N="1035" /> on too many things, we should think of justice before generosity and I think the time has come when there should be a review of the whole position in relation to many of these State-sponsored schemes.  At the present moment, the taxpayer is burdened by many injustices. There is a great deal of injustice in the employment of many men and I hope the trade union officials and those concerned will see that these injustices are weeded out. Nobody else can do it, but the trade unions can clear up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the men who are to be covered are genuine labourers, I would support the motion.  But if they are men who got land through State contributions, and have full economic holdings, or if they are men with almost economic holdings who get constant work with the Forestry Branch and can go to the labour exchange and get out a card, I want to have an inquiry into that.  By all means help the genuine workers and keep them employed, if at all possible, but do not let us have this faking going on.

There should be a close scrutiny of employees in the Forestry Branch by the Minister and if there is, I can guarantee his eyes will be opened and he will see all the injustices meted out to the taxpayer through comfortable, well-off men getting work that the unemployed are entitled to get, while we have scores of genuine workers leaving the country for lack of work at the present time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange to hear Deputy Giles expressing such <Col N="1037" /> ideas.  If the State is to be the model employer, State employees should be better treated, because the State should be able to treat its workers better than any private individual.  We had a somewhat similar discussion some time ago in regard to road workers when a Bill similar to this was brought in, and it was said that it could not be put into operation.  That Bill was introduced in 1948, amended in 1956, and is working satisfactorily through the county councils.  I am glad to say in my constituency that some people who have since retired are now enjoying what they thought they would never have, a pension from the local authority.</P>
      <P>The only thing that I see wrong is what Deputy Tully mentioned about the contribution of 4/- a week which is rather high.  Forestry workers are tied down to the local authority rate of wages which in some areas would be about £5 5s. a week.  If a forestry worker has to pay 4/- out of that, plus unemployment and national health contributions it would make his wages very small.  I think we should try to do better than that.  If we have 5,000 employees working for the Department that would bring in a substantial sum in a very short time.  Why should Deputy Giles or any other Deputy in the House object to the lowest paid men in the State getting a pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But if they are in State employment and if this scheme is put through the House, as I hope it will, are they not entitled to benefit whether they are farmers or not?  I think the Minister should give every consideration to the forestry worker. If workers are employed in the Forestry Branch or any other Department why should they not get a pension at the end of their time?  Some of these people will work until they die and get no pension, old age or anything else.</P>
      <P>I think if we introduce a retiring age and a pension for forestry workers we will achieve our main purpose because if a worker has to carry on until he is 70, he is confronted with a means test before he gets the old age pension. That is happening at present. When a county council worker after long service retires in my constituency &mdash;I have looked it up&mdash;he gets £2 7s. a week.  The social welfare officer comes along and grants him 9/- of the old age pension if he is a single man. If he is married he gets a little more.</P>
      <P>I think every State-employed worker is entitled to a pension as in the case of civil servants.  Why have class distinctions?  Why should a man working in the hills of Wicklow or elsewhere in cold weather, in some cases without shelter or protective clothing, not have a pension like the civil servant who is in a protected and sheltered position?</P>

We should apply here the old saying: &ldquo;Never put off until to-morrow what you can do to-day.&rdquo;  It is now 1956 and after all these years of native Government it is a sad reflection that we have not given pensions to men who had given such service not only to the Forestry Division but to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Hara, I feel that the Deputies who tabled this motion did so sincerely and not from the point of view of embarrassing the Minister and the Government or of putting up a case for the sake of gaining the popularity of a certain section.  I should say straight off that this is a question which is worthy of consideration.  However, the motion proposes that there should be superannuation schemes for both forestry workers and Land Commission workers.</P>
      <P>It is only right to point out that there is not a great deal of similarity between the two classes.  During the past 20 or 30 years, since the first big burst was made by the Land Commission under the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commission, the volume of work done by the commission has decreased.  At the moment Land Commission work takes place only wherever the farms happen to be divided.  Even in such cases, work lasts for only a short period, even in the very congested districts and the rundale areas.  Generally, work lasts for about six weeks at a time and I have never known schemes to extend for as long as three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When work is completed in such areas, Land Commission work never occurs there again because, when a townland or group of townlands are rearranged there is no necessity for the Land Commission to return.  Most of this work is carried out during the winter and early spring so that it will not interrupt normal tillage operations <Col N="1040" /> on adjacent farms.  For those reasons, I submit that Land Commission workers could not be included in a superannuation scheme.  I do not believe that even in Deputy Tully's constituency men get constant work from the Land Commission.  Even in County Meath, when a farm of 200 or 300 acres is being acquired and divided, the work in that area is completed when the fencing and the house-building have been carried out.  The next job might occur five miles away and the commission certainly would not bring workers from the previous scheme because there would be resentment against men coming into an area while there were men available locally.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Land Commission employ about 1,200 men in the peak period and that at no time does the number drop below 500 or 600.  However, I do not think there is even a permanent Land Commission ganger. The most minor official who is permanent is the supervisor of gangers and even he is not superannuated.  As a rule, his period of service is five years longer than that of the ordinary official; as a rule he works up to 70 years of age and if he is a good official &mdash;indeed most of them are excellent men&mdash;he is retained for longer because his experience is absolutely invaluable and indispensable to the Land Commission. As I have said, I could not hold out any hope of a superannuation scheme for such men because, to put it bluntly, such a scheme would never bear fruit for those for whom it was intended.  These men have no continuity or permanency in their jobs.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the motion in so far as it relates to forestry workers. The background from which I viewed the question was whether such a scheme would work.  I will say bluntly and briefly that it could not be made work.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately there is no comparison.  The nature of the work done by the two types of authority could not be compared.  In my county there are several permanent county council workers because the <Col N="1041" /> County Engineer feels some men have acquired a particular skill in a particular job.  He takes these men round the county by lorry to certain types of road making jobs.  Perhaps he would be able to get local labour but he prefers to fall back on those who have acquired a certain amount of skill in that type of work.  For that reason, county council workers have a certain continuity of employment.</P>

Up to then the poor land in the West was described as being unsuitable for the growing of commercial timber.  I was very vehement in pushing afforestation in these areas. I knew the suggestion that commercial timber could not be grown in these areas was a wild assertion without any foundation.  I pushed afforestation in those areas because we had no mineral deposits there such as those with which other countries are blessed.  From those areas we had considerable emigration and I realised that the only hope of bringing employment, not into the towns but into the country areas, was to promote afforestation schemes and to allow the small farmers who had not enough land to make a living, to engage in that work.</P>

    <P>I hope the Chair will allow me to digress from the strict terms of the motion in order that I might tell the <Col N="1042" /> House that I think the best scheme for the small farmer, in order that he might retain his hold on his piece of land, is to give him employment in a local forest.  I have seen such a plan work in other countries and I agree entirely with it.  In areas like Deputy O'Leary's county, the people are blessed with a very high percentage of first quality arable land.  In his case I could understand his amazement and resentment at the idea of small farmers going to work in forests.</P>

      <P>In the case of the ordinary type of employees I could see huge difficulty in coming to any kind of arrangement.  From Donegal to Kerry superannuation of the forestry workers would be wellnigh impossible.  Most of the forestry workers could be described as only part-time employees. Although they might work a 48-hour week, at least in spring, summer and autumn they always attend to their crops when they go home after work.  It is a very pleasing feature of country life that people should be sufficiently industrious to earn a week's wages and at the same time keep their little holdings in first-class working order.</P>
      <P>I have more knowledge of the small farmer than the big farmer.  Most of the small farmers I know find it very hard to live in these times.  For the majority a holding under £12 valuation, and if a man is rearing a big family a holding under £15 valuation, is scarcely sufficient to give a man any kind of decent livelihood or to bring up his children in the decency and comfort which every father would like.</P>
      <P>For that reason, as I said to Deputy Tully, I approached this from the point of view of whether or not it was possible for a superannuation scheme to work.  I want to assure the Deputies who brought the motion that I did not approach it from the point of view that, whether it was good or bad, it would not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Tully to throw <Col N="1043" /> his mind back to 1948 and the conditions which existed at that time, particularly amongst the forestry workers. In 1948 we had approximately 1,200 forestry workers&mdash;certainly we had not 1,300.  To-day we have 5,400 and, with the determined expansion of forestry, that number will go up to 7,000 or 8,000 within the next five or six years when the Government's programme is fully implemented.  That will be a sizable increase in the number of workers.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Deputies who introduced the motion that I believe first things should come first and, in my opinion, the first things were the wages paid and the conditions of employment.  While I know it is very important for them to have a pension when they reach the end of their years of service, I think it should not be forgotten that when this Government went into office we had only 1,200 forestry workers receiving 48/6 per week. One of the things I did when I first became Minister was to fix the wages of forestry workers at the same level as that of the county council workers in the county in which the whole or greater part of the forest was situated. According as the local authorities increased their wages, the Forestry Department had to increase their wages automatically from the date of the increase given by the county councils. That was a big step forward.</P>
    <P>At that time Deputy Tully and some of his colleagues were always pointing out certain improvements in the conditions of employment that could be brought about.  We succeeded in getting them better working hours, in getting them rubber boots, in getting shelters erected, and many other little comforts which, although they did not cost the State a whole lot, made a big difference for the forestry workers. The result is that the forestry workers to-day, no matter what we may do for them when they come to the end of their working years, have been given the best wages we could give them&mdash; even though they might not be fully satisfied with them&mdash;and their conditions of employment have been made as easy as possible.  We have tried to safeguard their health by the provision <Col N="1044" /> of Wellingtons or waders and shelters in the forests, all at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>It may look as if I am praising myself unnecessarily or overmuch for what has been done for the workers but I think we have only done what had to be done and we have succeeded in improving their wages and conditions of work very much.  I know the comment may be made that, particularly since 1935 or thereabouts, there has always seemed to be a race going on.  Wages go up, the cost of living goes up; wages go up again and the cost of living goes up again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">

      <P>Whenever it started, we know that it is there.  This Government looked after the workers in the first instance.  I do not think there is a great deal of similarity between forestry workers and county council workers and I want to cite a few cases I know of.  Take the case of forestry workers who work for two or three years and then decide they will go to England to see what it is like and where they think they will get better wages than at home.  Take the case of the forestry workers working in forests where the plantable reserve of land is exhausted and the whole forest will virtually have to close down until thinning or some other maintenance work comes along.  Cases of that kind have occurred here.  While a certain number of men give excellent work and take pride in their work, you cannot expect the best from a man who, after nine or ten years' service, suddenly finds that the plantable reserve has petered out and that he has to be allowed to go.</P>

      <P>No.  A good deal of the inspectors are unestablished.  They <Col N="1045" /> will perhaps work up to the day when they will be established.  I am talking about forestry workers who might have to go through no fault of the forester, the permanent officials and the Minister but simply because the work comes to an end.  But after two or three years, all of a sudden a new block of land might be offered and the work might start all over again.</P>
      <P>Most of the forestry workers are married men and if such a scheme as this were put into operation a contribution would be levied from them. That would be following the pattern of the local authorities.  I do not think it would be fair to levy a contribution even though there would be machinery for returning it.  We have very few constant or permanent workers in the Forestry Division.  There are a few men here and there who have been employed steadily throughout the years.  They were fortunate enough to have their health and they were fortunate in that the work was constant.</P>
      <P>Kilworth Forest, referred to here to-day by a Deputy from Cork, is one instance of where work has been going on steadily since 1923.  It is one of the oldest forests we have and steady employment for about 30 men has been given there all down through the years.  I do not think it would be just to make a levy on these men.  I cannot say how it will work out in the case of short-term employment.  I understand that would be the case; that contributions would be returned when they cease to work permanently.  I could not imagine much justice in any other system, but it would mean a very big bookkeeping staff to keep a check on the 5,400 men we have at present.</P>

I could not see how any such superannuation arrangement could be got to work.  One set of forestry workers work in the forests to-day.  In the not so very distant future, another side of forestry work, that is, the use of timber, will come into operation, and perhaps in the not so very distant future pretty big projects will give permanency to a vast number of men.  A Deputy made a comparison with Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna employees are fairly permanent. The bog is there and Bord na Móna buy only very big areas of 200 or 300 acres, certainly not less than 100 acres, that provide constant employment for a certain number of men for seven, eight or ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of the county council, there is much more permanency of employment for the comparatively few workers that Bord na Mona have than there is in the case of forestry.  I deliberately examined this whole question to see if anything could be done.  On the terms of the motion as it stands, I would say I could not accept it because it would be misleading the House to do so, as it would not be workable.  I know Deputy Tully and Deputy Desmond want a scheme that will work.  I will give them this promise, that I will examine the matter from every possible angle to see if a workable scheme can be produced.  I do not hold out much hope, for the reasons I have given.  I have tried to make myself as clear as I can and I have done my best.</P>
      <P>The principal difficulty is the very nature of the employment in forests. While employment is steady and growing, it must be remembered that the men who are employed now will not be with us next March or the men who will be with us next March will not be with us this time next year.  Men are constantly coming and going.  It would be impossible to keep track of the levy that would have to be made from each man out of each week's wages.  These men want a good deal of time at home &mdash;Deputy Tully is smiling now&mdash;but most of our workers are men who have some other means of livelihood.  Most of our workers are small farmers.  That is as I like it.  They require a few weeks off in spring-time to till and sow their crops, a few weeks in June and July to look after hay, some time in the harvest to cut corn and stack it and bring home turf for the winter and then, later in the year, time off to dig potatoes, turnips, mangolds and sugar beet.  These are the men on whom we have to rely.  Young men will work for a while and may then go to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men we have to rely on in forest centres, particularly in western counties, <Col N="1048" /> from Donegal to West Cork, are small farmers who are married and who have children, who cannot fly from them, who are willing to live on the land but whose land is not sufficient to give them whole-time employment and who, therefore, must get wages from forestry, the Land Commission, the county council, the Special Employment Schemes Office or some other source.  Otherwise, they could not live on their holdings.</P>
    <P>It is with that knowledge of the vast number of small farmers that I pushed forestry as much as I did in the western areas, where big expanses of land were available, even though it was of poor quality, and where a big number of small farmers were huddled together on smallholdings, on poor mountainy land, where there was not sufficient land to maintain them, if forestry had not been available. Forestry filled the gap in many cases and but for forestry, emigration would be very much worse.</P>
    <P>The scheme suggested in the motion would be unworkable, even with the best will in the world, but I want to say that I do think that forestry workers should get some recompense in their old age, as security against the day when they can no longer work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the broad line of giving a superannuation scheme to forestry workers.  What we would be doing would be failing the majority of the workers because they could not have the whole-time employment that would merit superannuation.  Take the forestry worker who may work in the forest from seven to ten years.  The <Col N="1049" /> plantable reserve would run out and there would be no more work for him. Perhaps in two, three or four years' time, other land would come in and that man would be re-employed.  How could we deal with such a case as that?</P>

      <P>If the work were reasonably constant, I would be prepared to consider it, but there are two sides to any improvement such as this. On the one hand, you are benefiting certain people.  On the other hand, there is the question of who will pay for it.  Deputy Giles touched on that point.  It is not the position in private industry or in any branch of the State service that men employed on a part-time basis are pensionable.  It could scarcely be proposed that we should make an exception in this case.</P>
      <P>I will examine the matter and, if there is any reasonable hope of producing a scheme that would work, the Deputies can rest assured that they will have one sympathetic Minister to deal with because nobody appreciates more than I do what the forestry workers are doing to reafforest this country.  I realise the slavery involved. There are very few forests along main roads.  Most of the work is in wild, exposed areas, exposed to the heat of the sun or to rain and storm.  I know that forestry work is not very pleasant. That is the reason why I went all the way with Deputy Tully in other matters, in making their conditions of employment as bearable as possible. We have left nothing undone in that direction, if the Deputy will admit it. I should like to see some little recognition&mdash;I do not care how small it is&mdash;if it were possible, being given to the whole&mdash;time worker.  That is as far as I can go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Giles was out of order and Deputy O'Leary was out of order.  However, their disorderliness could only be termed common assault, but the Minister was so much out of order that he was guilty of the manslaughter of orderliness entirely.  Like the political contortionist that he is, <Col N="1050" /> he takes every opportunity, no matter how unsuitable it is, to pat himself on the back even at the risk of dislocating his joints.  I did not discover in any part of the statement any of that hidden anxiety of which Deputy O'Hara spoke that keeps the Minister awake at night trying to develop schemes for the benefit of the old age of forestry workers or anybody else.  Interpreting the thought behind Deputy O'Leary's speech rather than the manner of its expression, I would say he said the State was a muddled employer, and the Minister's speech was a fine example of the bemuddlement of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister held out very little hope of accepting the view that Deputy Tully expressed.  The Minister does realise, of course, that the pursuit of social justice, as we understand it nowadays, has not been so many years in operation.  Certain things have been done, wise, sometimes not so wise, but in general there has been an improvement of conditions for the less well-off part of the community.  However, as I say, social justice is only in the infancy of its development and I am pretty certain that the logic of events must force the Government and every other employer in the country to see the need there is, and the importance of meeting that need, to introduce pensions for all workers.  I believe that these pensions will come and come in a short time, and I believe the Minister would be wiser to promise to give the closest examination to the proposals in Deputy Tully's motion.  I think it is wisdom, justice and Christian charity that we should place the worker, when he comes to retiring age, in some position of independence and comfort.  I merely rise here to express the view that is held by this Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody said in this House some time ago when the Minister for Lands was answering a question that he was &ldquo;blathering&rdquo;. At the time I thought it was rather ungracious but I must say the Minister was &ldquo;blathering&rdquo; to-night.  He completely distorted the whole matter which was under discussion and built a verbal smokescreen around the question.  I do not think it is fair for <Col N="1051" /> any Minister to approach a matter such as the one put before him in the manner in which he approached this. The similarity between the employees of local authorities and those of the Department of Lands is so great that the Minister himself, in the instances which he gave, proved that there is absolutely no difference whatever between the type of people who are employed by the Department of Lands and the type of people employed by the local authority.  That being so, is there any reason in the world why a superannuation scheme, which has been found to be a success when applied to local authority employees, cannot be applied to the employees of the Department of Lands?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to small farmers.  Of course there are small farmers employed by the Forestry Department and small farmers employed by practically every county council in Ireland.  Deputy Giles referred to big farmers, the fellows on the Land Commission farms who are working with the Forestry Department, and said they should not be.  I want to stay within the rules of order but let me say this.  If Deputy Giles was referring to certain individuals that he knew, surely it would be more fitting if he brought these matters to the notice of the Minister individually instead of trying to spike a scheme such as this by referring to matters during the debate which, in my opinion, were not relevant at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that Land Commission men could not by any stretch of imagination be included in a superannuation scheme. I specifically stated in my opening speech I was referring to Land Commission gangers.  There are approximately 50 Land Commission gangers in this country as far as I know, men who are as permanent as any employee of any public or semi-public body can be.  Those people as they get along in years find they are just pushed out by the Land Commission.  Some of them have got a week's pay per year of service, a very small thing to a man getting on in years who has no other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> I think the Minister was well aware, because I brought it specifically to his notice, that those were the people I was referring to.  The Minister should have taken into consideration that there was a very small number involved and there is no reason why they should not be included.  I agree entirely it would not be possible to consider ordinary Land Commission workers, the 1,200 or so who are working here to-day and away to-morrow.  The suggestion he made that Land Commission gangers do not leave their districts is ridiculous because he knows very well that one of the rules of the Land Commission is that a man must not be employed near his own home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the question of the 4/- per week and said it was not fair to ask these people to pay 4/- a week.  The local authority employees are paying 10d. in the £ and in the case of the sum of £5 a week, 4/- is the amount which the employees of the Department of Lands will be asked to pay. There is no suggestion at all by anybody that the State would be required to put up a big sum for the purpose of running the scheme.  I cannot accept the Minister's suggestion that the staff of the Department of Lands would not be able to cope with the collecting of 4/- a week from its employees and returning it to those who wished to leave the employment.  The county councils employ approximately one-third of the number of labourers employed by the Department of Lands and the local authorities, with a much smaller staff, are making the necessary arrangements and find no difficulty in doing so.  Surely the Minister could be a little bit more gracious than to say that he might be able to consider the question.  I would ask the Minister to give an assurance to the House that he <Col N="1053" /> will definitely reconsider the whole matter and not just pass it over because he thinks it is unworkable.</P>

      <P>At a time when Bord na Móna is cutting down the scale of its activities, at a time when it finds it is necessary to dispense with the services of a number of its trained technical staff, the Government has decided to put upon the board the responsibility of remunerating two new directors appointed to the board by the Government&mdash;individuals whose qualifications for membership of that particular board are not very obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, during the course of our exchanges to-day, said that the cutting-down of Bord na Móna's activities was consequential on the curtailment of the E.S.B. development programme.  He repeated what he had said previously&mdash;that the E.S.B. had been bull-dozed by me into embarking upon a development programme in excess of the country's requirements. That statement is not true.  I am quite certain the Minister was not told by the E.S.B., apart from anything they may have said regarding the four small Western stations to be fired by hand-won turf, that they were compelled by me to include in the new generation programme, which was published to the Dáil in 1954, any generation station <Col N="1054" /> which, in the circumstances of that year, they did not consider to be necessary having regard to the trend of the demand for electric power.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that, based upon the circumstances of 1954, the generation programme published then was excessive. It is true that circumstances have changed since.  There has been, according to the report of the E.S.B., an unexplained falling-off in the demand for electric power.  There has been a slowing-down, if not a complete cessation, of industrial expansion and we have learned that there is to be a curtailment of rural electrical development. Unless the Minister has in mind the possibility of provoking an even greater industrial slump than he has yet accomplished, the generation programme prepared in 1954 is still not excessive of the country's needs.</P>
    <P>Even if what the Minister said were true&mdash;even if circumstances have shown that the new generation programme of the E.S.B. published in 1954 now exceeds the estimated growth in the demand for current&mdash;I still contend, and I want to urge this point of view very strongly on the Government, that it is madness to curtail that programme which is based entirely upon the utilisation of native sources of fuel.</P>

      <P>I will get back, if the Chair will give me a little time.  The explanation given for the dismissal of a number of the board's technical staff and the need to strengthen the board by, as it was described, appointing new directors was this problem created for the board by the curtailment of the E.S.B. programme.  I say that there was not in that programme a single station which was not designed to use native sources of power, either water power or turf.  If that programme had been allowed to proceed as planned and if what the Minister says regarding the dimensions of the programme is correct, or if changes in the demand for power should make that programme in any way excessive, it would still be good national policy to proceed with it.  It might mean <Col N="1055" /> that, for a time, existing stations which use only imported coal or imported oil would have to be worked to less than their full capacity or close down for a time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I should like, however, if the Chair will allow me, to put this point.  We have in the bogs of Ireland, for the development of which this board is responsible, two main problems, not one.  Underneath these bogs there is productive land, land which is capable of being utilised for agricultural purposes or afforestation purposes provided we can get the peat off it.  It would be an impossible task for this country, with its resources, merely to get the peat off the land so that the land would be available for production.  It was, consequently, a matter of tremendous moment for this country when it was shown to be technically possible to utilise that peat as fuel for power stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister implies that the existing directors of Bord na <Col N="1058" /> Móna were political pals of mine.  I want to say quite definitely that none of them so far as I know was ever involved in political activities in the Party sense.  They certainly were not appointed for any such reason.  They were, each of them, people who had previous experience in this problem of turf development.  They had been associated with the old Turf Development Board and, indeed, it was their wisdom, helped by the experience they had acquired on the old board, which led to this great development of turf production through mechanical means.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the political opinions of some members of the board and I certainly never asked their political opinions.  The Minister's interjection implies, however, that there need be no doubt as to why these two new appointments have been made, to balance up political influences on the board.  I think that is a completely wrong approach to the responsibilities which were given to him when he was appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said in an interjection that I see the members of the board as often as he does.  I want to put on record that I have never met Bord na Móna since I ceased to be Minister.  I have never had a discussion with any single member of the board regarding the affairs of the board since I ceased to be Minister. If the Minister is under the impression that I am receiving any information concerning Bord na Móna from any member of the board, I want to correct that impression completely.  They are, so far as I know, all exceedingly honourable men who certainly would not abuse their positions in the slightest, nor would I for a moment consider asking them to give me information concerning the affairs of Bord na Móna which they had available to them by reason of their membership of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the board had in some way mismanaged their affairs.  These are the same individuals who have been in charge of Bord na Móna since its initiation.  It is one of the most successful enterprises <Col N="1059" /> ever started in this State and the whole credit for its success is due to these individuals.</P>
    <P>Two new directors have been appointed.  I said both were solicitors. I was wrong.  One is a solicitor and the other I know was an election agent for the Minister for Local Government. I thought he was a solicitor. I was wrong.  I have tried to find out from those acquainted with him what his work is.  I do not know and they do not know.  I asked the Minister in the question to state what the occupations of the two persons appointed were and he did not answer that part of the question.  From such inquiries as I have made, not one of them has ever had the slightest association with turf development activities, nor possesses any qualification which would, in the circumstances of this day, when the activities of Bord na Móna are being curtailed, when its staff is being reduced and competent technical men being paid off, justify his appointment.</P>
    <P>It is said that whom the gods wish to destroy they first drive mad.  This is the maddest thing the Government did. What are they trying to do?  Do they not realise that this action of theirs will demoralise the whole organisation of Bord na Móna?  There is not an individual employed by it who is not commenting adversely on a situation in which competent technical people are being dismissed while people are being appointed because the Minister thinks the members of the board are political pals of mine.  I think the Minister has abused his powers and functions.  This is one of the most disgraceful things they have done.  I suggest that he should forthwith so arrange the programme of Bord na Móna that at least these dismissals will not be associated with these appointments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts of this case?  The Turf Development Act, 1946, provided for a board of seven people.  Deputy Lemass made proposals to the board; he said: &ldquo;Here are five names; here are my five names for five of the particular posts and we will fill the other two posts later.&rdquo;  These five members whom I recently appointed, are the people appointed by Deputy Lemass in 1946, and who were reappointed later. Now, the House can have its own sense of humour out of the scrupulousness which Deputy Lemass displayed in making political appointments.  Have a look at the names of the members of the board and see if they have ever been known or noted for their support of any Party in this House other than Fianna Fáil.  I am not denying their right to be members of a political <Col N="1061" /> Party, but I am denying the right of Deputy Lemass to make appointments to State-sponsored bodies while in the Government and then to expect this Government to carry his political appointments when he is in opposition. That is not going to happen and the sooner Deputy Lemass realises it, the better.</P>
    <P>We have filled the seven posts which were provided for on the board.  Deputy Lemass promised to do it in 1946; we are doing it now in 1956.  Of course, behind all this artificial indignation this evening of Deputy Lemass is his innate belief that you cannot get a good director unless he, or some other Fianna Fáil Minister appoints him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to that was that since they believed they were over-planted by Deputy Lemass, they should have come to us earlier and said: &ldquo;Look here; we are over-planted by the White Paper of 1954.  We are being asked to put in more plant than we need.  We cannot use the plant to-day, and with the plant that we already have in operation and the plant in sight, we will not be able to use it even by 1960-61.&rdquo;  The E.S.B. to-day is substantially over-planted.  In 1960-61, they will still be over-planted, and by that time they will have plant capable of producing more than 30 per cent. of the anticipated demand either now or then.  To hear Deputy Lemass speaking one would think it was recklessness to say to the board: &ldquo;Get your plant as you need it&rdquo;.  Deputy Lemass wants to produce more plant, although there is no use for it.  Bord na Móna said: &ldquo;What is the use of producing turf when the E.S.B. cannot take the production?&rdquo;</P>

On the question of E.S.B. over-planting, the board told me&mdash;and I will repeat this&mdash;that they were forced by Deputy Lemass to gear themselves for the commissioning of plant which they did not believe they wanted, which time has proved they did not want and which they will not need for another five years.</P>

If there is any one of them who says that I did not, I invite him&mdash;with a guarantee that there will be no consequences&mdash;to write to me, through the public Press, a letter to the contrary to-morrow or any other day he likes, and that is a fair offer.</P>
      <P>Of course, this whole thing springs from Deputy Lemass's desire to dominate, whether he is in office or out of office.  If the raising of this matter on the Adjournment by Deputy Lemass is being put up to the Government as a challenge by him that this Government cannot make its own appointments to State-sponsored bodies and that they must accept the Fianna Fáil concept that these bodies must be Fianna Fáil dominated, that challenge will be accepted here and now.  There are more people in the community than members of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party want to make nominations when in office, so that when they go out of office and cease to be Ministers they will have their friends there, and overnight they become directors of public companies.  That is a disgraceful performance.</P>
