One lot, within the boundaries of the flying field, contains 354 acres; the other lot, which adjoins the airport, contains 217 acres.  The flying field lands were to be used only for the cutting and removal of grass and the outside lands for approved agricultural purposes. Three weeks were allowed for tenders and all persons interested had an opportunity to submit tenders.</P>

      <P>County Donegal is not being excluded from the scheme for the certification of seed oats which is being introduced this year.  I am prepared to consider applications from County Donegal or elsewhere for participation in the scheme provided applicants have suitable storage and handling facilities and are prepared to comply with the conditions of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is dissatisfaction amongst the farming community and that the feeling is that this scheme, whatever the regulations are, is not as beneficial as it should be?  In view of that, would the Minister not think it is false economy and bad agricultural policy, in a county like Donegal, to <Col N="802" /> curtail in any way a certified seed oat scheme due to the fact that Donegal is the premier seed oat and oat-producing county?  If there have appeared these published reports by the farmers' association that they are dissatisfied with the scheme &mdash; with the lack of a scheme or the type of scheme being operated &mdash; will the statement by the Minister satisfy their needs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say whether my reply would satisfy the persons to whom the Deputy refers in his question. This is a new scheme.  There never was a scheme before until I started the scheme.  We are strictly limited by the availability of mother seed, of which there existed none in Ireland until we propagated it.  We will distribute all the available mother seed this year to the most suitable growers in order to establish this pedigree seed-breeding operation on a firm and satisfactory basis and to expand it so as to supply our domestic needs and the export inquiries which we are already receiving.  I would direct the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the marvel is that we have got under way so quickly.  I do not want to make any observation about what might have been done in the years that have rolled by.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention has been drawn to a statement that the report of the Milk Costings Commission is being deliberately withheld, and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement and there is no truth whatever in it.  The Milk Production Costs Committee was established by my predecessor in 1952 with a technical director. The committee's terms of reference provided that the technical director would be responsible for the detailed administration of the investigation, the calculation of the final figures of cost and the compilation of the report of the investigation.  It was further provided that the technical director would furnish the report to the committee who would transmit it to the Minister for Agriculture with such comments as they deemed desirable. The committee has not sent that or any report to me, but, as I have already repeatedly stated in public, I understand that the report, both in respect of milk in the Dublin and Cork liquid milk supply areas and in respect of creamery milk, will be available before the end of March, and the chairman of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, Mr. C. H. Fletcher, received the following letter from me on the 25th January last, informing him of these facts:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
      <P>The Government has given careful consideration to the representations made at our conference on milk prices designed to secure an interim increase in the price of milk pending the receipt of the report of the Milk Costings Commission.</P>
      <P>The Government regrets that it cannot accede to this request but must postpone a decision in regard to milk prices until the report of the costings commission has been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the commission's report, both in respect of milk in the Dublin and Cork liquid milk supply areas, and in respect of <Col N="804" /> creamery milk, will be available before the end of March, and no time will be lost in giving full and sympathetic consideration to this report the moment it is made available to me by the commission, who I am sure will do all in its power to expedite the completion of this report and the commission's comments upon it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no scintilla of truth in the suggestion that there has been any agreement, or discussion, between myself and Professor Smiddy, designed to attain the delay of the publication of this report, or to give this report any slant in any particular direction.  In fact, there has been no discussion between me and Professor Smiddy at any time about any aspect of this report, except in so far as I wrote to ask him when he expected to be in a position to make it available. I have from the beginning maintained the position that this commission was set up by my predecessor as an independent and autonomous body and that I had a special duty to refrain most scrupulously from any interference with its deliberations, one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that considerable <Col N="806" /> delay has taken place in dealing with applications for grants under the rural improvements scheme and, if so, if he will take steps to provide increased staff in order that such applications shall be dealt with promptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that owing to the increased popularity of the rural improvements scheme since the introduction of lower rates of local contribution in 1950, there has been a very considerable increase in the number of applications received and, because of this increase, there is delay in dealing with the applications.  The difficulties in this respect have been aggravated by unavoidable delay in filling vacancies in the inspectorate staff.  I should add that the full provision for the scheme in the current financial year has been exhausted and that the number of applications in hands is more than sufficient to provide the programme of work for the coming financial year.  It is only right, therefore, that the applicants generally should realise that some delay is unavoidable and that each must await his turn.  As far as possible applications are dealt with in order of receipt.</P>

      <P>In this case, the manager did not make an order because he was advised that the proposed sale of the dwellings was a reserved function of the council for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1955.  The position is, however, that the disposal of the property is an executive function of the council performable by the manager and the council have been so informed.  The manager has not as yet submitted any order in the matter for consideration by me.</P>

      <P>On the order of business, I tabled two questions here very recently, one in connection with the desirability of increasing the existing rate on Post Office savings deposits and the other in connection with the bank rate, requesting that the bank rate should not be allowed to increase as a result of the recent increase in the bank rate in Britain.  In view of the importance of these questions, I asked permission to raise them on the Adjournment.  Due to the rules of <Col N="809" /> procedure, you decided to reject my request in connection with the first on the ground it would mean advocating legislation on an Adjournment Debate.</P>
      <P>In connection with the second question, namely the bank rate, you ruled me out of order on the basis that the matter was too grave and too important to become the subject matter of an Adjournment Debate.  That left me no alternative but to include these matters in a motion, which I tabled and which is now before the House.  I most earnestly ask the Taoiseach, in view of the urgency and importance of the subject matter of both these questions now embodied in the motion, if he will give special Government time for discussion at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 10, to delete sub-section (1), lines 12, 13 and 14, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Before the 1st day of December in each election year, six persons shall be elected by registered opticians to be members of the board.</P>
      <P>(2) Subject to any regulations under sub-section (3) of this section for the time being in force, of the six persons referred to in sub-section (1) of this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  five shall be registered ophthalmic opticians, and</P>
      <P>(b) one shall be a registered dispensing optician.</P>
      <P>(3) The Minister may by regulations substitute other numbers totalling six for the numbers specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for the election of the optician members to the second and subsequent boards.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure <Col N="811" /> that five of the six opticians to be elected to the boards shall be registered opthalmic opticians and the other one a registered dispensing optician. Sub-section (3) of the amendment will enable this allocation of the six seats to be altered at a later date should this be considered desirable.</P>
    <P>It was argued on the Committee Stage by Deputy Esmonde that there should be at least two dispensing opticians on the board, since their membership of the association, which they have recently formed, is 178.  According to his figures, membership of the Ophthalmic Opticians' Association is 149 and there are also 133 ophthalmic surgeons.  With 11 members on the board a division of four medical practitioners, five ophthalmic opticians, one dispensing optician and one other person would ensure that no one interest would have a majority on the board. It will be necessary for any particular interest moving a proposal before the board to convince at least one other person of its general desirability.</P>
    <P>The Association of Ophthalmic Opticians have always held that the dispensing opticians would work with the medical practitioners.  While this may or may not be true it is considered best that the combined representation of the medical practitioners and dispensing opticians should not give them an overall majority on the board.</P>
    <P>The Association of Dispensing Opticians is a very recent creation and one which is still in process of formation. They have not the same standing or experience as the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians.  Finally, the possibility of varying the numbers, so that their total does not any time exceed six is an easy method of resolving any difficulties regarding representations which may arise in future.  I accordingly recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to amendment. No. 2 in my name, I think that <Col N="812" /> any organised section represented on a board of this kind should have at least two representatives.  As we all know, it sometimes happens that one particular person may not be able to uphold his point of view where there is a large number on the other side. I think, that in all fairness, we should see that both interests have at least two representatives.  The same thing should apply equally to ophthalmic opticians and to dispensing opticians.</P>
      <P>I presume that when the election to this board comes on the two registers will both be on the way and my only aim is that two should come from each side and that they should vote as to who the other two should be.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister should argue that the interests of dispensing opticians and of the medical men should coincide in all cases.  On certain questions they would be together, but there may be other questions on which they would be opposed to each other.  On the last occasion when we were discussing this Bill, Deputy Esmonde gave certain figures and the Minister quoted these figures again to-day.  Whether they are correct or not I do not know, but I do not think it would alter his argument in any way.  I would be inclined to press amendment No. 2 unless there is a very strong argument against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in rather a difficult position in regard to this amendment because I do not really understand the method of election.  It appears that we are going to have in the register of opticians two separate registers and, as I see the position, according to the Minister's amendment, it would appear that my figures are being unanimously accepted by all sides of the House.  In that case we have approximately 170 dispensing opticians and 140 ophthalmic opticians voting to elect a register.  As the matter stands at the moment with the Minister's amendments, there must be five ophthalmic opticians and only one dispensing optician on the register. That seems to me to be a negation of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has given a great deal of thought to this matter and I <Col N="813" /> feel grateful to the Minister that he has given way to a lot of the suggestions and representations put before him.  I feel that the fairest solution to this question is that the Minister should accept amendment No. 2, paragraph (b), which would mean that at least one would be a dispensing optician.  It would then leave the question open to the voters whether more than one dispensing optician might be elected. However, we have not yet reached the stage of electing members.</P>
    <P>We are legislating in the Bill for the purpose of setting up this board.  In the first instance, the board will be nominated by the Minister.  As far as I can recollect, a period of three years will elapse before actual elections will take place.  Judging from the Minister's amendment here, it would seem to me that he intends to nominate five ophthalmic opticians, one dispensing optician, four ophthalmic surgeons &mdash; as I understand it, these ophthalmic surgeons will be from private practice; I think that is more or less on the official record now &mdash; and one other person who, I take it, will be entirely above reproach and neutral in every way.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is setting up this board for a period and that this board will have plenty of opportunities of showing its worth, would the Minister not consider changing (b) to read: &ldquo;at least one shall be a registered dispensing optician&rdquo;?  I do not think there would be any doubt then about the representation being fair.  It seems the Minister is setting up the board as he so desires and as, no doubt, he has been advised by his advisers, and that would seem to me to be a safeguard for everyone concerned for the future.  It leaves the position that this will be a fair and neutral board for all the interests concerned. After the prescribed period of three years, they may then elect a further board, having had three years' experience of the state of affairs that then existed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to press the Minister on this point because I know this is a difficult Bill.  I know it is a Bill which possibly was created before he himself came into the office which he now holds.  There are many contending interests concerned, but I do feel that, <Col N="814" /> were he to accept my suggestion, he would satisfy the wishes of everybody, and by the wishes of everybody I mean the ophthalmic opticians, the ophthalmic surgeons and the dispensing opticians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I must say to Deputy Dr. Esmonde and Deputy Dr. Ryan that I cannot depart from the compromise suggested in the amendment which I have tabled.  The position as it appears to me is, first of all, that this Bill would never, I am convinced, have been introduced into the Oireachtas by any Minister for Health, were it not for the insistent demand made by the ophthalmic opticians.  I think their association throughout the years has been seeking some form of legislation which would set down and establish certain standards of conduct for those engaged in this service to the people.  I am not in the slightest bit critical of the dispensing opticians when I say that they only formed a body, so far as I am aware, within the last two or three months.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Dr. Esmonde is quite correct &mdash; I have no contrary information &mdash; in the numbers he quotes. I am quite sure the number of dispensing opticians who would qualify to be registered as opticians under this Bill when it becomes law would greatly exceed the number of ophthalmic opticians, but I do not think that is or should be the sole test as to membership of the board.  While the ophthalmic opticians may be a minority in actual numbers, they nevertheless are the people who are engaged solely in the practice of optics and in providing this form of service to people; whereas the dispensing opticians &mdash; again I am not being critical of them in the slightest and I do not intend to be&mdash; are people who, largely speaking, engage in the dispensing of spectacles very much as a side-line.  They may be pharmaceutical chemists; they may be druggists; they may be jewellers; they may be carrying on quite a number of other forms of activity which represent their main source of livelihood and, incidentally, they may engage in the sale of spectacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, as the House will see in a later amendment, that to the extent <Col N="815" /> that these people have for a number of years been engaged in the sale of spectacles and have been recognised by the State as sellers of spectacles, it would be wrong that they should not qualify for registration as opticians.  Accordingly, if the House accepts a later amendment, they will so qualify, but that qualification, although it does increase their number, in my opinion, should not be regarded as in any way outweighing the primary concern of the ophthalmic opticians in this legislation, in the board that will be established and in the proper working of the standards hoped to be achieved by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The board will consist of 11 persons. I feel it would be wrong if that board could be operated in the interests of any particular body or group of persons interested in the work of opticians.  With the number now proposed, it will not be possible for any of the different interests to exercise a controlling influence on the board.  Nevertheless, the ophthalmic opticians, who number five, will, I <Col N="816" /> think, be given a very definite say in the manner in which the board should function, but will not be given a dominancy.  I can assure Deputy Dr. Esmonde and the House generally that the amendment now proposed, while it represents a compromise, is one to which a considerable amount of thought and consideration has been given before it was tabled.  Therefore, I feel it is an amendment that I can stand upon and I must accordingly tell Deputy Dr. Ryan that I cannot accept the amendment which he proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister's difficulty is that he does not want to give a majority, let us say, to the medical practitioners and the dispensing opticians, let the Minister nominate two or three, instead of one.  I think it would be a much better idea than only leaving one to the dispensing opticians.  However, if the Minister is not prepared to accept that, I must press my amendment. The only way I can make that clear is by voting against the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Dr. Ryan put down an amendment to provide that an Order removing a person from membership of the board should be laid on the table of the House and should contain the reason for the person's removal.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendment No. 7 are primarily drafting amendments, to rectify an anomaly whereby a person removed from one register could, under the Bill as drafted, apply for registration in the other register on foot of professional qualifications, or because he satisfies any of the other conditions precedent to registration.  For example, an ophthalmic optician could be removed from the register of ophthalmic opticians for administering drugs.  Under the Bill as it stands, he could apply to be registered in the register of dispensing opticians and the board would necessarily have to <Col N="819" /> register him without regard to the fact that he had been removed from the ophthalmic opticians' register.  This amendment will make it clear that the board need not act in this manner.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to permit the registration without examination of persons who were on the optical benefit panel maintained by the Department of Social Welfare.

      <P>In page 13, before Section 39 but in Part IV, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part of this Act, a person who is a registered ophthalmic optician shall not be registered in the register of dispensing opticians.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a person who is a registered dispensing optician becomes registered in the register of ophthalmic opticians, his name shall thereupon be removed from the register of dispensing opticians, and Sections 36, 37, and 38 of this Act shall not apply in relation to any such removal.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that an optician can be registered in only one register at a particular time. It meets the point made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde and Deputy Dr. Ryan on the Committee Stage, which was withdrawn on the Minister's assurance that he would move an amendment on the Report Stage to give effect to the principle involved.</P>

This amendment makes it clear that an optician can do nothing, except provide spectacles, if he is a registered dispensing optician, or prescribe and provide spectacles, if he is a registered ophthalmic optician.  The purpose of the amendment is to deal particularly with the question of engaging or purporting to engage in medical diagnosis of diseases of the eye and I think it meets, in effect, the amendment tabled and withdrawn on Committee Stage by Deputy Dr. Esmonde.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I read the Bill, it appears that, if mining operations were carried on at any mine at any time during the three years prior to 5th April next, that mine can never become a qualifying mine as defined in this section, even if the mine is not now being worked commercially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> If, at any time during the period of this Bill, a company is formed to work minerals which are not being worked now, but which were worked at any time during the past three years, that company can never get the benefit of the tax relief for which this Bill provides.  I presume that was done for some deliberate purpose but I must say I find it very difficult to guess what that purpose is.</P>
    <P>I examined the report of what the Minister said when introducing the Bill.  He said at column 76, Volume 154:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In fixing that period of three years, I deliberately had regard to the fact that during the emergency it was perhaps necessary first to produce minerals on what I might term an emergency rather than a commercial scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not make sense to me.  The relevancy or even the meaning of the observation is not very clear.  Surely the proper description of a new mining operation &mdash; to use the term in the Bill &mdash; should be an operation to produce minerals that are not being produced now?  Why should a company starting a new mining venture be deprived of the benefit of this Bill, the relief which this Bill affords, merely because somebody else during the past three years tried to make a commercial success of these minerals, and failed to do so and abandoned the operation?  The presumption is that an even greater incentive would be required to get operations restarted in such a case than to get people to work minerals which are now newly discovered and were never worked before. Is not the Minister's view &mdash; I take it it must be&mdash;that if somebody tried to make a commercial success of some deposit and failed, it should be written off for all time?</P>
    <P>I would consider that that was a very wrong approach to the purpose of developing interest in Irish mineral resources, such as they may be, and everybody who has examined the position knows that the prospect of attracting interest in the development of Irish mineral resources at the <Col N="823" /> present time arises not because of anything the Government has done, not because of this Bill, but because of the prevailing price of copper.  The price of copper recorded in the past few days is the highest ever known in the world's history.  It has been going up steadily for many weeks past; it is now around £408 per ton.  There are perhaps mineral ores in this country containing copper which could not have been worked successfully a couple of years ago, but which are capable of yielding quite substantial profits, if worked now.  During the period when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, arrangements were made to investigate the commercial prospects of a number of our mineral deposits.  People of international repute were engaged to carry out preliminary surveys of a number of mineralised areas and we got from the Dáil the necessary authority to spend money on the further exploration of three of the best prospects selected by these international experts.  These experts examined most of the districts in which minerals were known to exist and gave adverse reports on some of them.  These adverse reports indicated that, at the prices then prevailing, the cost of extracting the minerals would not be economic.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that prices have now gone up so very steeply since then and appear likely to stay up, each of these prospects is worth re-examining. Certainly, we should try to get a commercial enterprise interested in their re-examination.  If that is so, there is no sense in this provision in the Bill. The Bill appears to be so drawn that, in practice, nobody can get any profit out of it, except the one company with which the Government has been in negotiation.  I shall move later an amendment, the purpose of which will be to bring all mining undertakings on to the same footing, so far as taxation is concerned.  If the Minister is going to accept that amendment, this one which I am moving now is not one which we would press very hard, but if he is not going to accept that amendment, this could be very important.</P>
    <P>There are some minerals listed in <Col N="824" /> the Schedule to the Bill which were worked during the past three years and which are not being worked now. I do not know what the prospects of getting commercial working of these minerals restored again may be, but I see no sense in putting in this Bill a clause which will make it practically impossible for anyone who comes in to work them in future.</P>
    <P>Coming to this Bill so far as it provides for relief of taxation, I do not know whom the Minister is trying to exclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can shorten the Deputy's discussion on this amendment very simply, so far as the period of three years is concerned in this Bill as it is now framed.  There is no intention or desire to exclude any particular mineral; on the contrary, so far as I am concerned, what I was anxious to do was to ensure there could not be an in-and-out operation in relation to mining, that a person could not close down, perhaps even since the announcement was made last autumn, for the purpose of merely getting the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> I fixed the period of three years frankly because I wanted to be quite sure that I was excluding from the operation of this section the type of mining work that was done during the emergency which, as I said on the Second Stage, is not the same type of commercial mining as one might visualise in ordinary times.  During the emergency, the anxiety was to get the mineral, regardless of the cost; it was a question of supply, not a question of economical working.  I fixed a period of three years so as to make quite certain that I would get outside that period.  As far as I am concerned, I am not the least bit tied to that period of three years.  I believe from the information available to me that it does not affect anyone concerned, that it gives a fair average picture and certainly no representations have been made to me or to the Department of Industry and Commerce that it does, in fact, exclude any such working as the Deputy suggests.</P>
    <P>I am quite insistent that the period must be one to make it quite certain that the shut-down was due to what might be described as permanent failure, rather than temporary causes, and to make it quite certain, in particular, that it could not operate in any way as a shut-down by reason of the announcement I made last September and for the purpose merely of getting the benefits of this Bill.  That, as the Deputy will agree, would be undesirable.  The Deputy's period of three months would render that possible. I do not think it has been done, but it would render it possible.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Lemass is also wrong in one other respect.  We are agreed that the present high price of minerals is one of the operative causes in getting development, but it is not, as we discussed the other day, only the price at the present moment but the price at the time the minerals are extracted and going to be sold commercially that really matters to any concern.  Unfortunately, our minerals are somewhat lower in grade and percentage than in any other country.  Therefore, we would not get the development, unless we made up for that difference by having some form of differentiation as there is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I will certainly not accept the Deputy's suggestion of three months as it would be open to possible abuse. From the time the announcement was made, it certainly was not my intention to exclude any such work.  In fact, I am told since that the working the Deputy referred to was prospective, but not working on a commercial basis which is specifically defined here.</P>

There is no need to keep that provision in unless we intend to exclude somebody.  If the Minister wishes to stand on the date, the 15th September last, he can make it six months, but it would still be an assurance that we would not be excluding the possibility of bringing some mine into development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to bring up this question of bedded minerals.  I made it clear that my interest in this regard is mainly in connection with the effect of the Bill on the development of Irish coal deposits.  The Minister's case for the Bill as a tax measure was that it was necessary in our circumstances to get business people interested in what he described as the somewhat chancy business of seeking and working com mercially minerals here; that the exploration of minerals requires very heavy expenditure; and that capital must be committed to the enterprise involving a greater risk of failure than would be associated with a normal commercial enterprise.</P>
      <P>If the case for giving tax incentives for the working of non-bedded minerals is that, precisely the same case can be made for giving tax incentives for the working of what are called bedded minerals.  I would admit that there is the possibility of argument that the working of gypsum deposits in the Monaghan-Cavan-Meath area is in a different position from the working of coal deposits in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of this State during my time spent a great deal of money on the exploration of gypsum deposits in that district and as a result that exploration revealed the existence of valuable and extensive deposits for a number of commercial firms engaged in the mining and processing of that gypsum.  Having regard to the amount of State money already spent upon exploration work there, having regard to the competition which existed between commercial firms for leases of the minerals and to the nature of the working itself, the depth of the seams, their closeness to the surface, the methods of working which can be employed, I would be inclined to accept the contention that there is a difference between the working of gypsum deposits and the working of coal measures which might justify some difference in the tax arrangements applying to them.  I do not agree at all that there is not as strong a case for giving tax incentives for the working of coal &mdash;indeed, I could contend that it is stronger than the case the Minister <Col N="829" /> made for the giving of tax incentives for the working of non-bedded minerals.</P>
    <P>If incentives are needed to get people to show a greater interest in developing our non-bedded mineral deposits then incentives are also needed to get people to show a greater interest in our coal deposits.  Exploration and development expenditure on Irish coal-mines is necessarily very heavy.  The main difficulty in developing Irish coal-mines is the very high proportion of non-productive expenditure which has to be undertaken because of the relative narrowness of the coal seams.  The risk of failure is considerably greater than in normal commercial enterprise, as indeed the records of the Department of Industry and Commerce will show.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument against extending the relief given by this Bill to coal-mining was that the contents of these non-bedded deposits are capable of being more readily assessed than in the case of non-bedded ores and that their extraction is much more akin to normal commercial operation.  He represented me as pretending that there is no distinction between bedded and non-bedded deposits or in the difficulties involved in their mining and said that operators did not have to invest the same heavy type of capital in the working of bedded minerals as is necessary for non-bedded ores.  I do not think a single one of these statements will stand the test of examination so far as Irish conditions are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not true &mdash; in this country, at any rate, whatever conditions may be elsewhere &mdash; that the contents of our coal measures can be more readily assessed than the contents of our non-bedded ores.  I have personally held the view for a long time that exploration activity in this country could be more usefully directed to the areas which are known to contain coal than to any other known deposits.  I had intended that Mianraí Teoranta, when they had finished their work at Avoca, should be asked to undertake the detailed examination by diamond drilling of the whole of the Leinster coalfield area.  As Minister for Industry <Col N="830" /> and Commerce, I tried to get that done by a commercial company, but unsuccessfully.  There are workings going on at various points in the Leinster coalfield area, but I believe it has never been thoroughly explored to a proper depth.  While my hopes may prove to be groundless, I think there is a far better prospect of exploration work there producing results than in almost any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>During my time as Minister, considerable inducement was given to private firms to get working in that area and, indeed, a number of new workings began.  Grants were also given on a fairly liberal scale to persons undertaking mineral exploration work&mdash;grants for the construction of roads and for the removal of overburden&mdash;which proved abortive in the sense that the work did not disclose the existence of minerals which, in the conditions of the time, are capable of profitable commercial development. However, a number of workings were begun and in each case are capable of further development.</P>
    <P>What can be done by efficient direction in the development of Irish coal measures has been demonstrated during the past couple of years at Slieveardagh.  Indeed, the main impediment which exists at the present time to the further development of the coal measures there is the inability of the firm working them to attract a sufficient number of miners.  The difficulty in doing so is very largely a problem of housing.  One of the main incentives which might be given to the development of mining operations here would be some provision for the building of houses in the vicinity of mines-houses that could be reserved for those working in them&mdash;most of which are located in isolated districts away from towns and cannot attract workers into them unless there is a certainty of suitable housing accommodation in their vicinities.  Local authorities are always co-operative but local authorities are bound by the Housing Acts and cannot undertake to build houses exclusively for the employees of an individual concern or even to allocate them in a preferential way to the employees of an individual concern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> However, that is a side issue to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My point is that the development of our coal measures is as urgent a task as any other type of mineral development in this country.  It has not been done very largely because of the reasons the Minister gave for this Bill in relation to the non-bedded ores.  The initial investment of capital in exploration and development is very heavy, with a substantial risk that it may be completely lost.  I have argued here, on the Second Reading, that there is a far more urgent need for this country to give incentives to the exploration and development of its coal measures than any other mineral deposits we may have because we need the coal and we are likely to need it much more urgently in the years ahead.  All the indications are that we will have very considerable difficulty in meeting our requirements of solid fuel by imports. The day is in sight when British coal will not be available.</P>
    <P>The British coal authorities are already forecasting a day when they will not be able to meet British internal needs with their own coal production. If the coal exists, we need it and it can be consumed in its final form in this country.  Indeed, in so far as we might produce a certain type of coal such as anthracite in excess of our own requirements, there is no difficulty in finding an export market for it.  At various times in past years, some of our coal producers have been able to dispose of part of their production by export.</P>
    <P>The mining difficulties in Irish coal mines are far greater than the difficulties in non-bedded ores.  I speak with some experience.  I have been down the mine in Avoca and I have been down some of our coal-mines also.  In Avoca, it was possible to walk upright. There was no problem of ventilation which could not easily be solved by the mining engineers.  There was a great deal of water, which made the work in the mines somewhat unpleasant. The depth of the rock which is being worked permits of upright work. I was down the mine at Silvermines, too, and had the same experience there.  Our coal-mines are all working <Col N="832" /> narrow seams.  A 24-inch seam is big for an Irish coal-mine; some of the seams worked are less.  The men working there cannot stand up.  They have to work lying on their sides; and they have to remove a great deal of material, which is just waste.</P>
    <P>As I said, a great deal of the expenditure in production is non-productive expenditure.  It may be true that, in other countries, working on bedded deposits of coal is an easier operation than working on non-bedded ores. That is certainly not true under Irish conditions.  Neither is it true that the capital expenditure which has to be undertaken for the working on non-bedded ores is greater than the expenditure necessary for working on bedded ores.  If one estimates output on a tonnage basis there is no foundation for that statement at all.  Indeed, I think that most of our coal-mines could be greatly improved with a substantial amount of expenditure upon more extensive and up-to-date plant, and that includes plant on the surface as well as plant underground.</P>
    <P>The main advantage which the Slieveardagh working has over other coal-mines is that they have a washing plant installed, which other coal-mines have not got and which represents a very considerable investment of capital. I think there is no case to be made for the withholding of these incentives and reliefs from coal-mining which does not apply equally to any other type of mining operation.  If the Government has accepted the principle that tax incentives should be given to encourage the kind of development which is regarded as most important, then every argument that can be used in favour of giving these incentives for the working of non-bedded ores can be applied just as forcibly to the working of bedded ores.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any hope that, having apparently accepted the principle of tax incentives to encourage desirable types of development, he will not be urged to extend its application in a variety of directions. Indeed, if there is a principle, if this Bill is the product of some decision that it is desirable that tax incentives should be given to get suitable <Col N="833" /> economic activities going, then it is even more important than I think it is. I think it is the result of a particular bargain with an individual group and that there is nothing more behind it than the desire to fulfil that bargain. I suspect that the Bill was drawn in a way which will, as I have said, make it almost certain that nobody will be able to get any relief under it except the one group.</P>
    <P>If there is a principle, and if the principle is that tax incentives should be given to encourage desirable developments, then I urge most strongly that that principle should be used to justify the extension of these incentives and these reliefs to coal-mining. In that connection the Minister used in his concluding speech the other day the words &ldquo;<i>ex parte</i>&rdquo;.  I do not know quite what he meant, but, in case he meant what I think he meant, I want to make it quite clear that I have no financial interest of any kind whatever in any coal-mine undertaking.</P>

      <P>I am not making this case for coal only.  I would point out that in British practice &mdash; and under British tax law considerable reliefs are given to mining operations &mdash; the term &ldquo;mining ventures&rdquo; is understood to cover oil bearing strata, potash and sulphur bearing deposits, china clay, gravel, sand, clay, chalk and slate as well as beds of minerals in the ordinary sense.  While I am making this case for the extension of the Bill to other types of minerals mainly in relation to coal, I think that, in our circumstances, there may be justification for extending it also to such material as slate. Certainly, as an illustration of the type of risk which those who undertake any mining operation incur, I would advise the Minister to examine the record of the effort to develop the slate quarries at Carrick-on-Suir. There a private company embarked upon the development, spent a great deal of money and got a great deal of <Col N="834" /> Government money as well, but, very shortly after commercial operations had started, it was discovered there was a flaw in the slate which made it practically unsaleable, a flaw which could not have been discovered by any process in advance of the opening up of the quarry.</P>
      <P>While it is true that the use of slate as a roofing material is not as extensive now as it was some years ago, nevertheless there is a market for slate and there was at one time quite a considerable export of Irish slates to centres in Britain.  I do not know if that possibility exists there now; but if we are to frame our laws on the basis of an equitable arrangement and if we are to have concessions for mining operations, then these concessions should apply to all mining operations in which the risks are similar and, on that basis, I would urge that this Bill be reframed so as to cover all mining concerns in the country no matter what type of minerals they are working.</P>
      <P>I do not think the effect on the revenue would be considerable.  If the Bill is confined, as it is now confined in effect, to new ventures, the number of new ventures in these additional fields is not likely to be very considerable. If it is extended, as I hope it will be extended, to give the same tax concessions to all mining undertakings, whether they are new or old, the cost to the Exchequer is also likely to be small, because I doubt if any of them are making very substantial profits, but they are all giving a very useful type of employment in districts where adult male employment is not easily procurable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As, for the first time, the principle of modifying the tax arrangements as an incentive to economic development has been enshrined in legislation, then it should be extended on some logical basis.  It is no secret that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, strongly resisted the idea of using tax modifications as economic incentives because he believed that, once the integrity of the income-tax was breached, there would be no power in the Department of Finance to resist <Col N="835" /> the ever-widening of that breach.  A proposition similar to that which the Minister has accepted in relation to Avoca, was made to me when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce before the war by a Canadian group, as far as my recollection goes, in relation to the copper mines at Bonmahon in County Waterford and when this proposition was discussed with the Minister for Finance &mdash; at that time Deputy MacEntee &mdash; his approach was not that he would not give a tax concession but that he would give a direct grant equivalent to the amount of tax payable; in other words, he felt that even though the financial result to the Exchequer would be the same it was better to do it in one way rather than in the other in order to maintain what he called the integrity of the tax system.  I did not altogether agree with him but, so long as I got the result I was aiming at, I was quite satisfied and I think the people concerned would have been satisfied too. But unfortunately at that time the copper market slumped instead of booming, as it is booming at present, and the enterprise never went ahead.</P>
    <P>I have said already in my Second Reading speech that I am personally in favour of the idea of using tax modifications as an incentive to economic development.  I am supporting the principle of the Bill in that way, but I think the tax incentives should be based on some logical scheme which must be equitable in its operation as between private individuals.  On its present basis it is not logically framed and will operate unfairly as against some citizens.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, in the remarks which he has just made, made several <i>ex parte</i> statements.  He made a series of assertions without any foundation for these assertions or without giving the House any proof that the assertions were founded on fact.  I thought, when he started off, that he was saying that I was incorrect when I told the House on the Second Reading that there was a difference in expenditure between bedded and non-bedded minerals and towards the end of his statement he repeated the statement <Col N="836" /> that the difficulties were similar.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there is a substantial difference between the principles that affect the mining of bedded minerals on the one hand and non-bedded minerals on the other.  The differences are differences in exploration, in assessment of the proposition as a commercial venture, in relation to the expense of the plant and so forth.</P>
      <P>First of all let us be quite clear on this matter.  In regard to bedded minerals exploration it is comparatively &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;comparatively&rdquo; quite deliberately &mdash; comparatively simple, compared to the exploration of non-bedded minerals.  I do not want to make it appear, or to suggest in any way, that dealing with Irish bedded deposits is a simple proposition, but when you compare the two, bedded and non-bedded, there is a vast difference.  In relation to bedded minerals, it is possible to ascertain the extent of the vein by a very limited series of interpolation drilling and some exterpolation work.  It is not possible to do that at all in regard to non-bedded minerals.  It is quite impossible to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to ascertain the extent of non-bedded minerals by a series of interpolation drilling and some exterpolation work, which can be used for bedded minerals. The amount of work that has to be done in the exploration of bedded and non-bedded minerals is not comparable at all.  The Deputy knows that that is correct, although he is not prepared to admit it.  It is also abundantly clear, and it is borne out in the records of the geological office, that so far as the veins of bedded minerals and of non-bedded minerals are concerned, the estimation that can be made out of the one is as different from that which can be made out of the other as it is possible for it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also suggested that this is a method unusual in other countries.  The British report, to which he referred, was dealing with matters dealt with under the 1946 Act <Col N="837" /> rather than the type of incentive in this Bill.  I made it quite clear on the Second Reading what the incentives given in other countries were.  In all those countries the incentives were for non-bedded minerals because of the known difficulty there is in foreseeing the extent and value of non-bedded deposits and the fact that the result must be deferred for longer in the case of non-bedded deposits and also because of the machinery expenditure. Take, for example, coal, to which the Deputy referred.  There is nothing comparable in coal to the erection of a concentrator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Comparable machinery has to be installed.  The coal has to be graded and washed on the surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery necessary is not in any way comparable in cost and the Deputy knows that it could not be.  You have an entirely different type of organisation necessary in relation to non-bedded minerals to what you have in relation to bedded minerals.</P>
      <P>I never had any doubt, when I was introducing this Bill, that there would be pressure put upon me to extend the scope of the Bill to other types of minerals in addition to those for which I felt that this is the appropriate type of incentive.  I think that the basis which we are taking here is the correct basis, having regard to the difficulties in ascertaining the extent of the deposits, the difficulty in regard to the delay in the production of the mineral, compared to that in relation to the bedded deposit, and the very much larger expenditure that is necessary for machinery for non-bedded minerals such as the type we have named in this Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, as Deputy Lemass has correctly said, a possibility of dealing with the matter by way of subsidy or grant.  I knew there was that method of dealing with it.  I knew that such a method was suggested by some people to the Canadian groups.  I prefer this way.  I think it is a better way than the other way that was open to us. The method here is designed for the purpose of getting people to sink the large amount of initial expenditure <Col N="838" /> that is necessary, so as to get that expenditure put there on the basis that will mean that the mines will operate.  There is a very great difference between coal and a mineral that requires a concentrate.  The expense is in the erection of the concentrator. When that is erected, your main expense on machinery is dealt with, but it is not so in relation to bedded deposits.  In that case there is a smaller initial capital expenditure. In this instance I want to get the initial capital expenditure laid out. Then, when that is laid out, I think there will be a reasonable prospect of the minerals being worked in order that the money that has been so laid out will be recouped.</P>
    <P>That is the type of incentive which I think is desirable for this type of minerals.  I am not going to argue with the Deputy to-day about it, because it seems to me an entirely different type of proposition.  There are other amendments he has down that deal with the question of industry generally.  I think coal-mining is far more akin to them than are non-bedded minerals.  As I have said on other occasions, so far as industry generally is concerned, I am not going to consider the question at all, until such time as the Industrial Taxation Committee's report is available to me.  But no matter what that committee may report in relation to industry in general, non-bedded minerals are in a separate class.  That has been accepted in every other country where it is desired to induce this type of mining. Non-bedded minerals are apart and it is for that reason that I must resist the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that other countries have not found it necessary to do this is not an argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In Canada, local coal-mines produce about 40 per cent. of their total production of coal.  We are not producing 10 per cent. and we are in this position that we need to encourage the maximum output in our <Col N="839" /> coal-mines, and we are likely to find that need a very acute one in the years ahead.  I am not arguing with the Minister on the issue of the size of the investment required for the working of non-bedded ores.  I will admit at once that the successful working of any non-bedded ores in this country must be on a fairly large scale, that they are not suitable for the smaller scale type of development which Irish coal measures will respond to.  My argument was that the capital investment required is relatively no greater in one case than in the other.  The Canadians are proposing to invest £2,000,000 in Avoca.  They are hoping to get, and are planning to get, 1,000,000 tons of rock from it, that is to say, each £2 invested will yield one ton per year.  I doubt if there is any coal-mine in this country that could hope to get a ton of coal out for £2 investment.  I should say that for coal the investment is relatively heavier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting a little mixed up in his figures. He is likening the coal that comes out with the mixed rock that comes out, out of which the mineral has to be extracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be clear on this. Let us think of what is required to get a saleable product.  So far as Avoca is concerned, they will not be producing a mineral; copper, lead or zinc. They will be producing a concentrate of the rock mined, a saleable product from which they will get their profit. So far as the coal-miner is concerned, he is also producing a saleable product and to put a ton of saleable product on the market involves relatively a heavier capital outlay in Irish coal-mines than is involved in Avoca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My argument is that, relatively, the investment required in Irish coal-mines is heavier.  It does not make any difference if that statement is strictly accurate or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still true that those who go into coal-mining in this country have to risk a great deal of capital in an enterprise that can fold up overnight.  They risk that capital in circumstances where they cannot have any certainty as to the size and reliability of the coal deposits they are working.  I am not claiming to be a mining expert, but, from my experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I do not think it is true to say that the difficulty of exploring the extent of a non-bedded deposit is greater than in the case of these bedded ores like coal.</P>
      <P>Before the war, the Government of which I was a Minister employed a firm of French mining experts at what was then a very considerable sum of money to carry out complete exploration, both by magnetic survey and diamond drilling, of the Leitrim coal area.  That investigation of the Leitrim area was directed both to determining the size of the coal measures there and also in the hope of locating a workable deposit of iron ore&mdash;iron had been worked in Leitrim previously.  It continued over a number of years and when the report came, I remember being rather dissatisfied with the inconclusive nature of the evidence upon which the French firm based its conclusions that there were not workable deposits of iron ore in the area, and that the coal measures were broken up and scattered and could never be the basis of any large-scale operation. They had carried out a number of drilling operations.  They had put down their bore holes over a number of areas and found that they could not get a satisfactory core, wherever they contacted coal, because the coal in Arigna is very soft and friable, and the dust that was produced by the drilling operations was washed out in the process. Their report was very largely based upon the assumption that, wherever there was nothing in the core, that meant there was coal underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in the drilling of rock such as the rock in Avoca, the engineers were able to take out cores which were capable of being analysed and tested in every detail, and which enabled them to say with considerable <Col N="841" /> exactitude what was under the ground in the places where the drilling was done.  In the case of the drilling of the coal measures, that was far less certain because of the friable nature of the material they were drilling and the difficulty of getting measurable cores.  I know most mining people will not embark upon an operation merely on the results of diamond drilling, that they will insist on going down below the ground and exposing the ore to be worked by tunnelling.  That was why we explored Avoca by tunnelling operations, rather than confining ourselves to diamond drilling.</P>
    <P>The same is true of coal-mining and there are a number of instances of coal-mines which were started on what appeared to be a good prospect, working a seam of reasonable thickness producing good quality coal, but quite suddenly it petered out because of some fault in the ground which involved the closing down of operations and the loss of the capital put into it.  Again, of course, the position in relation to coal as it existed in the past was not dissimilar to that which existed in relation to copper.  The price of coal was low and the profit to be drawn from coal-mining operations was not very considerable.  Now coal prices are going up.  They have not reached the all-time historical record such as copper prices have reached, but they are still going up, and operations are now being carried out in areas where they could not have been profitably conducted before the war.</P>
    <P>But let us get back to fundamentals. The Government has decided to give incentives to mining, these incentives taking the form of tax reliefs for a limited number of years.  What is the case for confining these incentives to one type of mining and refusing them to others?  Surely, on any rational analysis of our needs, there is as strong, or a stronger, case for giving these incentives for coal-mining as there is for giving them in the case of non-bedded ores.  The employment is just as urgently needed.  The product is one that we need ourselves and that will be used in its final processed form by consumers in this country.  In the other case, there will be employment, undoubtedly, <Col N="842" /> but what will be produced is a raw material for further processing abroad, something we cannot use at home because we have not got the facilities for processing it.  If there is any logical reason for giving tax relief incentives to the working of non-bedded ores that reason applies with, certainly, equal force to bedded ores.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I will admit that an exception may be made in the case of gypsum, in regard to which we have spent money and where there was competition between the operators for the leases they hold.  That is certainly not the case in regard to coal.  We have not got our measures in coal.  We have never got enough capital behind the development of coal-mines to guarantee their success.  There are exceptions to that.  There are a couple of mines that are well worked and adequately capitalised. Most of the mines are small. Some of them are losing money.  Some of them close down periodically until they raise a few pounds to get going again.  Certainly, any tax relief is not likely to cost the Exchequer very much, because I cannot see them making profits on any substantial scale for some years ahead.  But it is worth while encouraging people, by giving this type of concession, to go into that business and to get into it on a scale, with sufficient capital, to give them a reasonable chance of succeeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I think, closing his mind to this argument because he has produced a Bill here, rather reluctantly, to give effect to one bargain made with one Canadian company interested in Avoca and, while he thought to express that Bill as being of general application, he is determined in his mind that it will not be extended to anybody other than this one group on whose behalf the Bill was produced.</P>
    <P>If that is the reason why the Bill is before the House, it would be far more straightforward of the Government to come in with a Bill and to give this company, St. Patrick's Mines, Limited, the benefit of this concession and to give it to nobody else; because that was the bargain that they made to induce them to undertake the operation. Why produce a Bill that appears to be of general application which is not of that kind at all and which is not <Col N="843" /> designed to do the type of job that has to be done in this country if we are to get the development of our mineral resources, such as they are, and as varied as they are, in every part of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister is leading up to.  Before the war, the Government itself undertook a number of mineral exploration activities.  The one in Leitrim, to which I referred, and the exploration of gypsum deposits were the two most costly operations.  There was a system of grants available for anybody who wanted to develop any kind of mineral, grants which were specifically allocated to the building of roads into the areas, the removal of the overburden and similar non-productive expenditures of that kind.  We set up Mianraí Teoranta to carry out mineral exploration, in 1944.  In fact, it did not get operating on exploration work until after the war.  It had certain duties to produce minerals during the war, to produce them to meet urgent needs&mdash;sulphur from Avoca and coal from Slieveardagh.  That company was directed to give its main attention to Avoca until the exploration work there was completed, until the practicability of commercial development was demonstrated. In consultation with that company and in conjunction with E.C.A, funds were made available for other mineral exploration work to be carried out by international experts, involving diamond drilling explorations in selected areas, one in Galway where molybdenum was believed to exist, another in Sligo, which resulted in the extension of the workings of the company <Col N="844" /> there, and the third, I think, Glendalough, where the operations were in progress when I left office. Bonmahon in Waterford, Allihies in Cork and other areas were also examined.  These experts' activities were designed to give information which would permit of a decision as to what further development work would have to be done before commercial development would become possible.</P>
      <P>I have said that I had in mind personally that when Mianraí Teoranta got free of Avoca and when the efforts that were made to get a private company to do exploration work in the Leinster coalfield area failed, exploration there would be the next main activity but, so far as I know, no decision had been made as to what it was likely to cost or what sum should be allocated for it.  As far as Avoca is concerned, we decided to allocate a sum of £85,000 for seven years for that purpose but no similar decision had been taken with regard to any coal-mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked the question is that the relative exploration cost, or amount spent, would be somewhere about ten to one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that but I must make a qualification.  The intention was to do the exploration in Leitrim by diamond drilling only.  In Avoca, the decision to do exploration by tunnelling was based on the realisation that the tunnel, when made, would be a saleable asset.  Also, we had in mind the desirability of keeping in Avoca the miners who had got experience in mining there during the war-time operations so as to keep them available as a nucleus of the organisation that would be required when commercial operations began.  We could have decided to do it by diamond drilling only.</P>

I think that I am in a better position to know what is at the back of my mind than Deputy Lemass is and his statement in that regard is about as accurate as the other statements he has made to-night without any proof. The fact is that non-bedded minerals are different in the extent, different in the type of deposits, different in the cost of exploration, different in the method of exploration and entirely different in the extent of the cost of the installations necessary to deal with them.  It is because of these differences that this Bill deals in this way with non-bedded minerals and not with bedded ores.</P>

I am not pretending to be a constitutional lawyer, but I think the constitutionality of that provision could be called in question.  The Constitution provides that no appropriation of revenue can be made until it has been recommended to and approved by Dáil Éireann and I consider that discriminatory remission of taxation is a form of revenue appropriation.  It is equivalent to the giving of a subsidy.</P>

    <P>I feel sure there will be Deputies on both sides of the House who will agree that the Dáil should be particularly vigilant in connection with experiments in discriminatory taxation and that they should refuse to allow to pass out of their hands the powers of control which they normally exercise in such matters.  I think that, if we adopt the proposal in this Bill, we shall be establishing a precedent which will be undesirable from every point of view.  I have no objection to the idea in the Bill if it is to avoid the necessity for further legislation, if a case should be made for the extension of the measure to other non-bedded minerals; in other words, I have no objection to <Col N="847" /> the Minister dealing with that by Order, but it should be specifically understood and stated in the Bill that that Order would have no effect until the Dáil had approved of it.</P>
    <P>This is something more than the normal type of Order which Ministers make to give effect to details of legislation. This is a question of discriminatory taxation, of giving to certain individuals tax advantages which are not available to citizens in general.  That may be a good thing, but it should not be capable of being done by ministerial Order without the Dáil giving it specific sanction beforehand. That is why I would urge the Minister to amend this Bill to provide that any Order made by him extending its provisions to other commodities should require the specific authority of the Dáil.  It is far better to keep the principle of the control of the Dáil to the appropriation of revenue.</P>

      <P>It is an entirely different question from the appropriation of revenue.  Appropriation of revenue is an entirely different thing.  I would accept the view of Deputy Lemass if there were any type of wide discretion at all available to me but, in fact, what the section does is to provide that I can add only things that are <i>ejusdem generis,</i> the same as the ones specified.  I could quite easily have brought in an enormously long list of all possible geological non-bedded minerals that there were anywhere in the world.  If I had done that, the Deputy would have suggested I was giving the impression to our people that there were minerals here that we did not believe existed.  It is a much better method to do it like this&mdash;to bring in a list of minerals to which we believe there are some prospects of this Bill applying.  But in case there might be something that has been overlooked, providing we restrict it to that type, I do not see how there is <Col N="848" /> any objection to this section.  If I had not provided the annulling proviso I could see the Deputy's objections, but we all know that there are certain types of things that are dealt with in this way.  There are a few dealt with by Order&mdash;one is the sugar Order.</P>

      <P>The Dáil has ample power in this case to throw out any Order I might make.  I should perhaps explain that the power of annulment is restricted here to the Dáil alone and not to the Dáil and Seanad.  The Dáil has ample power to throw out any Order made no matter what Government is in power and it has always been understood by the Government and Opposition that any motion of annulment will always be given power of precedence in parliamentary time. That has always been accepted as proper procedure.  The Dáil is keeping control in that way.  It is only a matter of detail, once the category has been listed and once the main minerals in that category have been specified.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not trying to tell the House that what will happen is that he will be lying in bed some morning and that just for fun he will add uranium and platinum to the list.  It might then happen that John Smith, an ordinary citizen, would come to the Department with a proposition and for the benefit of that one individual the Minister would make an Order.  I am not saying that will happen but the Minister is giving himself power to give a discriminatory remission of taxation.  I am not objecting to that power by Order, provided the Minister seeks the approval of the Dáil before it comes into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power of annulment is very largely illusory.  I do not think that one Deputy in ten reads the list of papers published on the Order Paper and not one in ten would go down to the Library to look up those Orders to see whether any of them should be the subject of an annulment motion in the Dáil.  It is far more likely that Orders <Col N="849" /> will be made and brought into operation and remain in operation for 21 sitting days of the Dáil before anyone knows about them than that there will be this particular examination of a Government's actions which the Minister assumes.  The Seanad has already had to consider the desirability of setting up some special machinery to make sure that these ministerial Orders are brought under notice in some way.  This, I agree, should be a matter for the Dáil alone as it is a matter of finance, but the Dáil has no machinery for ensuring that Orders tabled, Orders which the Dáil can annul, if it wishes to do so, will be brought specially to notice.</P>
    <P>There is no committee such as the Seanad has for the examination of these Orders.  That is why I think we should not rely on that device as a safeguard in this important matter. The question may never arise, but it is a fundamental principle of democratic procedure that the Legislature should hold the ultimate decision in matters concerning the appropriation of revenue and the Minister should not take power to give discriminatory remission of taxation, without the prior consent of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think it is important that this matter should be raised.  I am quite certain, if the Minister was sitting on this side of the House and if this Bill were introduced by another Minister, that he himself would be one of the first to see the desirability of keeping within the power of the Dáil the granting of tax remissions equivalent to subsidies to private individuals.  Remember in each case what is involved: it is a concession to a private individual, to John Smith, Pat Murphy, to somebody who will negotiate with the Government, and, as a result of the negotiations, get that discriminatory taxation relief.  If he is entitled to it, nobody will resent his getting it, and if benefit is likely to follow generally, nobody will disapprove, but the Minister should come in a formal way <Col N="850" /> before the Dáil and get prior approval before granting the remission.</P>

      <P>If I thought there was any democratic principle involved, I would not have any difficulty about Deputy Lemass's amendment at all.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Lemass and I, when the positions were reversed, had brushes on what I considered were democratic principles and which Deputy Lemass did not.</P>
      <P>As far as whether or not one Deputy in ten in the Dáil will notice the Orders tabled, I think we must accept that the working of Parliament in a democratic way depends to a large extent on the Government and the Ministers, on the one hand, and on the Opposition Front Bench, on the other hand.  It depends far more on that than on the individual working of each individual Deputy in the House. I do not know what the Deputy does when in opposition, but I know when we were over there, certain members of the Front Bench had the responsibility of looking at certain executive actions of certain Ministers for the very purpose of spotting Orders of this sort, and considering whether it was desirable, in respect of those Orders, to put down an annulment motion. That was how we dealt with this type of situation and I think, frankly, it is a better way of dealing with it than cluttering the Dáil programme with positive motions of the sort the Deputy suggests.  It seems to me that the democratic principle to which Deputy Lemass referred is preserved either way, and preserved without question. When the power of annulment is there the principle is preserved and I think this is the more convenient method.  I do not think this is any infraction of the principle at all.  If I did think so, I would agree with Deputy Lemass, but I do not think so.</P>

      <P>To delete all words from and including &ldquo;(hereinafter&rdquo; in line 12 down to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;after the 6th day of April, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The tax concessions, the reliefs for which this Bill provides, are, it appears, to be available only to companies starting new mining operations, as defined in Section 1, within the next three years.  I may say that it was that provision more than any other which produced in my mind the suspicion that although the Bill is drawn as if intended to be of general application the intention is that only one company will effectively be able to secure relief under it, the company that will be working at Avoca.  So far as the Party on this side of the House is concerned we have accepted that there is need for a general revision of our company taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission which was set up to examine that question some time ago has not yet reported, and if the Minister took the line that he was not going to change the tax law until he got their report it would be a logical position, although I may say in passing that the commission is taking somewhat longer to report than I had anticipated.  But the Minister is not waiting until he gets the report before changing the law in one respect.  This Bill is presented as necessary to give relief to companies engaged in one particular operation.  Our existing <Col N="854" /> system of taxing companies engaged in industrial operations might be described as obsolete, and it is clearly in need of revision.  What alterations the commission may recommend I do not know, but I think they will have no difficulty in discovering that at least so far as taxation of mining profits is concerned the existing position is inequitable, illogical and unfair.  But if there is a case for its revision at all there is a case for its permanent revision.  Certainly, there is no justification for giving relief merely for a period of three years and leaving it at that.</P>
    <P>I think, indeed, that it would be possible for the Minister now&mdash;certainly for his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;to name every company that can possibly get concessions under this Bill.  Nobody, so far as my experience goes, could get into the commercial working of minerals on a reasonably substantial scale unless they have already begun the process of exploration and development. Indeed, the Canadians at Avoca, notwithstanding all the work already done at Avoca and notwithstanding the immense financial and technical resources available to them, do not expect to be in commercial production for at least 18 months to come.  Any new company undertaking new mining operations as defined in the Bill cannot possibly be in commercial production within three years unless they have already begun the process of exploration and development. Therefore, this Bill is not really an incentive to people to investigate, as the Minister said, the mineral resources of the country and to plan for their commercial development.  So long as it is limited in its operation for a three-year period it cannot possibly have that effect.  Men experienced in taxation matters will agree that tax incentives of this kind do not even begin to produce results within three years.  The experience in most countries has been that it is only gradually that incentives of this character begin to show effect.  It may be that it was the intention of the Minister, if not to confine the Bill to one company working at Avoca, to confine it to persons who are already known <Col N="855" /> to be interested in mineral development and have already begun measures to express that interest in the development of particular minerals.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister seriously contemplates that at the end of three years we will go back to the system of taxing mining profits and that this incentive will no longer operate.  If that is so, it is a vain hope, and the Minister would do far better to recognise that once the idea of tax incentives to commercial development has been introduced they cannot be relinquished again.  Certainly if it is in the Minister's mind that this is going to be an incentive to people to invest money in new mining developments he will have to get rid of this three-year limitation, because nobody will gamble upon the prospect that any operation they may plan now will be in commercial production in three years' time and so qualify.  It would be only an added risk to the others involved in mining operations.  If the Minister thinks that the Dáil should have an opportunity of reviewing the desirability of retaining this legislation at some stage he should leave it at least ten years.  I do not think that any lesser period will get the results it is intended that these incentives should produce.  Certainly, three years is altogether too short a period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass started off on the wrong foot in relation to this whole Bill when he was referring continually to new companies. It is not the owner of the mine that is operative in this case.  It is the mining operation itself.  I do not think that it matters very much in relation to the rest of the argument, but it is just as well that I should correct him on that, because it is not the ownership that matters, it is the operation, and the fact that the operation may be under different ownerships during the period concerned does not affect the issue.  It is important, however, to recognise that fact in relation to the existing mining companies.  The fact that an existing mining company carries on an existing mining operation in one place does not, of course, in any way prevent it from carrying out a new <Col N="856" /> mining operation in accordance with the terms of the definition.  It is important, therefore, to remember that it is not the ownership but the actual operation which is operative in deciding whether the profits arising come within the terms of the Bill or not.</P>
      <P>One of the existing companies at one end of its existing property might very conceivably start a new operation right at the other end which would be a new mining operation within the meaning of the definition in Section 1.  There would not be any question whatever that such a concern should not operate within the three years referred to.  It has been accepted before, not in relation to tax incentives but in relation, for example, to housing incentives, that it is desirable to restrict the period of operation of the Bill giving the incentive so as to get people to do the job in question within a specified period.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and the House are well aware that, for that reason, the Acts allocating housing grants are on a temporary expiration basis.  The same thought was in my mind when I fixed this as a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I think the essential thing is to provide an inducement to people to get after this type of development work immediately.  If we do not so frame our incentives that they will feel it necessary for them to start their exploration work immediately, and to start their commercial development at the soonest possible opportunity, we shall have lost the benefit which I hope will flow from this Bill.  I do not agree with the Deputy that the position is that that cannot be done within three years.  I never believed at all that, when the three years were up, we would arrive at a position in which we would say incentive was no longer necessary. We might decide, perhaps, in three years' time that this type of incentive could be improved upon in a certain way and I think the three-year period is desirable as a trial period in that respect, if for no other.  Its greatest advantage is that it shows&mdash;if people wish to rely on this incentive in getting out non-bedded minerals&mdash;the urgent necessity of getting ahead with the work.  It was with that in mind that I fixed the period of three years.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just defeated his objective, if that is his objective.  As the Bill stands, a new mining operation must be substantially distinct and separate from, and not merely an extension, of any mining operation.  I do not think it is practical to get a new mining operation, so defined, going to the stage at which there is production in reasonable commercial quantities taking place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The existing mining operations, as we know them in this country, for non-bedded minerals are Silvermines, Abbeytown in Sligo&mdash; Benbulben barytes&mdash;and, possibly the best, Avoca.  Beyond these, the main likelihood of any important mineral development turns upon copper deposits. The likelihood that the price of copper will continue to be high brings into the picture as a possible development certain deposits which were worked before and on which work ceased when the price of copper fell too low to make it an economic proposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I had an argument as to whether the price of copper will go up or down.  One of the benefits which the British Government stated might follow from the recent increase in the bank rate is a reduction in the price of minerals.  There was a fall in the price of some minerals, but the price of copper went up and it is at a higher level than ever before.  All the expectation is that it will remain high. On the basis of that expectation, we can get commercial firms interested in some of our existing deposits which are known to contain copper.  Bonmahon, County Waterford, Allihies, County Cork and Beauparc, County Meath, where the value of the deposits has never been explored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that nobody knows what is there.  So far as these are concerned, <Col N="858" /> Bonmahon is the best prospect.  At least, there is a far greater prospect that people will be concerned to develop it, because there is a great deal of knowledge about it and it was the subject of interest before the war. In fact, I know there is already interest in the possibility of developing it.  The deposits there were thought to be worked out by the old company, but it is now believed that a substantial bed of ore exists lower than the old company worked, just as was the case at Avoca.  Avoca was thought to be worked out by the old company until this possibility of a new bed of ore at a lower depth in the ground was discovered.</P>
      <P>Allihies mines were worked until some period in 1924 or 1925.  I think they are flooded.  There is a theory that it is the Atlantic Ocean that is flooding the mines there, in which case they can never be drained.  Advice given to me was that the cost of dewatering the mines would be prohibitive and consequently it was not likely that there would ever be development there.  Whether that is so, on the basis of present prices, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Beauparc, a great deal of investigation will have to be done by anybody thinking of investing money there.  Under the Mining Acts, the prospecting lease given to persons who want to prospect for minerals is for two years.  It is assumed that reasonable exploration of any area will take two years.  When the prospecting is done, there is the process of the formation of a company, of raising capital, of procuring equipment, and so forth, which has to be completed to get commercial development and production. If you try to interest people on the basis of this Bill, and then tell them that they must be in production in reasonable commercial quantities within three years, this Bill will not be successful.  So far as I know, there are mineral deposits which are likely to be of interest to private firms at Bonmahon, Allihies and Beauparc and three years is far too short a period no matter how highly financed they may be, or what technical resources are available to them.  I do not think <Col N="859" /> there should be a date at all.  I do not see the need for a date, but, if the Minister wants it, it must be much later than three years.  Otherwise, I think the Bill is quite useless and will only strengthen my suspicion that the intention of the Bill was that only one company would get benefit out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this question.  I had considerable experience at one time in dealing with questions of plant used by mines.  Although the date of delivery has improved since the time when I had some knowledge of this, I know for a fact that, even at the present time, a certain type of machinery might take anything up to 15 months to deliver and certainly, very frequently, six months.  That could apply equally to certain types of prospecting machinery.  I am quite sure that if the Minister consults even the people who are going to benefit by this Bill immediately, they will tell him that, from the point of view of the delivery and the setting-up of plant, you could quite easily absorb from a half to two-thirds of the entire period he has allowed and it would be more than reasonable, if he insists on having a date, to make the date at the very least five years.  If he were to get from his officials a chronological statement in regard to the processing of a mine, I am quite sure he would agree with Deputy Lemass on this problem, quite apart from the general question as to whether or not we should have a date. He simply takes the date upon which the machinery which takes the longest time to deliver is delivered; both in regard to prospecting and in regard to actual production, he will simply have to extend the period, if this Bill is intended as a serious contribution to the exploitation of mines in the future.</P>

While they may not be in production for 18 months, at the same time, they will certainly be within the three-year period laid down here. While Deputy Lemass has referred to copper-mines in general, it is a fact that other mines are about to be worked, particularly lead and zinc in Monaghan, Castleblayney and Derrylenihan. I think the idea behind this particular section is to encourage people to go in for the development of our mineral resources now rather than at a later stage, and that is very commendable.  We may find from experience that there may be defects. If, until now, the existing laws were O.K., surely it is a bit thick for the Opposition to suggest that the three-year period embodied in this improved legislation is too short.  I know that the Opposition wish to see minerals developed just as much as we do, but, at the same time, I think they should not be too quick to condemn what is now proposed in order to help out the development of our mineral resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In computing the amount of profits for the purpose of assessment to income-tax of a company working a qualifying mine or an existing mine the following deductions may be made:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Twenty per cent. of any capital expenditure undertaken by <Col N="862" /> the company during the year of assessment on the exploration and development of mineral deposits whether at the mine or elsewhere within the State including the acquisition of exploration plant.</P>
    <P>(b)  Twenty per cent. of any capital expenditure during the year of assessment on works, other than buildings, which will be of no value when the mine is worked out.</P>
    <P>(c)  Ten per cent. of any capital expenditure during the year of assessment on buildings, including buildings for occupation by or for the welfare of mining workers.</P>
    <P>(d)  An allowance, to be called the depletion allowance, which shall be such proportion of the total capital expenditure of the company on the acquisition, exploration and development of the mine as the output during the year of assessment is to the total of deposits.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment for a particular reason.  The Minister is probably aware&mdash;other Deputies may not be&mdash; that this amendment represents an attempt to express in my own words the provisions now existing in British law regarding the taxation of mining profits, or the changes in British law for the taxing of mining profits which were recommended by the recent British commission on income-tax.  If this Bill is intended to be a temporary measure only, then these arrangements will probably find no place in it; but, if there is an idea of liberalising our tax code so as to facilitate and encourage mining development, then I think it is necessary to go further than the Bill attempts to go.</P>
    <P>The Bill is introduced here, as we know, for the purpose of giving relief to the Canadian company which will work in Avoca.  But there are other mining concerns at present operating, some of which will get no benefit whatever under the Bill and all of which need encouragement and assistance to extend their operations.  These concerns have gone through difficult times; some of them had to suspend operations for a period and started <Col N="863" /> again only with difficulty.  The idea of this amendment is to give to these concerns the same tax provisions as the British Government thinks it wise to give to mining concerns in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We know that British mineral resources are vastly superior to our own. We know that these mineral resources of Britain have never failed to attract the interest of private enterprise and, if the British Government, in those circumstances, having regard to the variety and wealth of its mineral deposits and having regard to the abundance of capital always available for the financing of mining projects there, think it necessary to give the reliefs which I am proposing here, then obviously these reliefs are doubly required in this country where mining ventures are few and far between, where many mining ventures have lost money and failed, to the detriment of those who invested in them, and where all of them are encountering problems of production costs more acute than those arising in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Our system of taxing the profits of mining ventures is completely indefensible. It means that the profits of these companies are calculated for tax purposes on a basis which no intelligent accountant would use.  It is more than time that we changed all that.  The British tax code, as I understand it, provides for a number of reliefs, reliefs which do not exist here.  In the first place, there is the investment allowance of 20 per cent.; if money is spent upon capital development in any year, 20 per cent. of the amount so expended may be deducted from the profits of that year before determining the profit on which tax is to be assessed.  That investment allowance, which applied to all British industry and which has, in part, been suspended since last week by the British Government, replaced the initial allowance; and, in Britain, the initial allowance in relation to mining undertakings&mdash;that is, the extent to which the cost of new equipment purchased could be written off in the first year out of profits&mdash;was as high as 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> There is neither investment allowance nor initial allowance here.  This allowance was given in Britain apart altogether from the normal allowance for depreciation of plant used in the operation of the mine.  Allowances are given there for capital expenditures in exploration and development and the allowance given for exploratory expenditures extend to expenditures undertaken by mining companies in other areas, outside their present area of operation.  They cover also the cost of plant purchased for the conduct of exploratory activity.</P>
    <P>Allowances are made in the same way for capital expenditure on works which are likely to be of no value when the mining operations have ceased on the working out of the deposits.  In addition there is an investment allowance of 10 per cent. for industrial buildings on the same basis as for industrial buildings generally.  We have no allowance of any kind in respect of industrial buildings.  There is an investment allowance of 10 per cent. and an annual allowance for buildings provided by a mining company for the occupation of, or for the welfare of, mining workers, buildings which are likely to have little value when the mine is no longer working.</P>
    <P>The British Royal Commission recommended that there should also be a depletion allowance, an allowance for the cost of acquisition of mineral areas.  The whole case for these amendments is that we require to give to our people here at least the same taxation reliefs as the British Government thinks it right to give in Britain. One would think that in our circumstances we would require to give greater reliefs and that, in our circumstances, we should tend to be less restrictive. I do not propose that.  I am merely proposing that we inscribe in our law the same allowances and reliefs as the British Government gives in Britain.  If British circumstances justify these allowances how much more must our circumstances require them here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed to me, when I heard Deputy Lemass commence, that I would find him following <Col N="865" /> this amendment further by moving an amendment to delete Section 5 and Section 6.  That would have seemed to me to be the logical method of dealing with it.  The case Deputy Lemass now makes is that any sort of relief in mining taxation which we give should be at least as favourable as it is in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The incentive purpose that is now in mind will be more favourable than under British law.  So far as the general position is concerned, as I understand Deputy Lemass, he was advancing, in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), the general case for industry, which has no particular reference to mining at all.  So far as the general industrial case is concerned, I will not come down on one side or the other until I get the report of the committee on industrial taxation.  All I have sought to do in this Bill is in so far as I consider that certain mining activities are different from ordinary industrial activities.  The suggestions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are not for specific mining requirements but for industrial requirements in general. This Bill does not purport at all to deal with general industrial requirements. There will be another day to discuss those when I have received that report.</P>
      <P>So far as paragraph (d) is concerned, the Deputy, when he was taking this paragraph from the British report, changed it somewhat.  The British suggestion does not deal with it in quite the same way and our 1946 Act does not deal with it in quite the same way.  The new element which the Deputy introduced in paragraph (d) is to deal with circumstances in respect of exploration and development of a mine which is already in our existing law in a form more beneficial to the mine concern and particularly so when it comes under the provisions of Section 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a mining concern is within the eight-year period in which it gets the four full and the four half-year concessions, paragraph (d) would not be in their interests at all.  Paragraph (d) provides for what might be called <Col N="866" /> a form of relief for depreciation.  The 1946 procedure is that it is spread over the life of the mine and at the end of that time residual values are taken and deducted from capital expenditure and then that is averaged.  I might also say that I do not understand how the Deputy's formula would work out in regard to the total of the deposits. How could one estimate, at the beginning of the year, the total of the deposits that are likely to be in the working life of the mine?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You can leave it to the companies themselves to decide that. They would have the same interests as the Minister.  If they tended to minimise the deposits there would be a possibility of a day coming when they would be entitled to no relief at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That would lead to exactly the same objection which Deputy Lemass had on the Second Reading of the Bill when he said that there was a danger of people coming in and doing certain work and getting out again.  That argument would be even more true in relation to the type of relief given here because the type of relief I have provided in Sections 5 and 6 is intended to be a type of relief to cover initial construction, which is relief in respect of construction that would be far more liable to misuse for certain temporary high pressure working followed by collapse.  I think the Deputy's main case in relation to this amendment was not related to mining but that be wanted to give the investment allowance, the initial allowance, and so forth, in relation to industry generally a trial gallop.  I cannot prevent the Deputy giving it a trial gallop but it is not a trial in which I am going to participate.  I intend to await the appropriate race, to wait until the commission's report is available.</P>

      <P>I must say that as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1953, I would not have been nearly <Col N="867" /> as happy as I was about the decision of the Government of that day to set up a commission to investigate this matter, instead of taking action in the matter, if I had known the commission was going to take so long in its labours. I do not think it is reasonable that industry should be asked to stand still for three years pending the production of that report.  If we had realised that it would take that time or longer to get the report I think we would have preferred to proceed even by trial and error to get the right system of taxation which would encourage the developments we desire here than to wait for the possibility of a perfect system emerging from the deliberations of the commission.  But here we have a Bill which is intended to do something which naturally came within the commission's terms of reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that I accept what the Deputy says, that the special case of mining was within the terms of reference of the commission. The commission's terms of reference were in respect of general industrial problems rather than any specific problem such as mining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised in every country that the calculation of mining profits for the purposes of taxation represents special difficulties and that special provision must be made for them.  Apparently our system is that everything that comes in is revenue, everything that goes out is expenditure and the difference is taxable profit, without recognition of the fact that a wasting asset is being worked and that a large part of the expenditure which has been undertaken will not be recovered when the asset finally disappears.  If a factory builds a sports hall or houses for its workers it can at least assume that these are saleable assets, that if the factory ceases to operate, the houses and sports hall will be saleable.  A mining concern which has to provide these facilities generally in isolated districts knows that all that expenditure will be completely lost if operations cease.  That is a case for giving a special allowance against that expenditure which might not be applicable at all in the case of other concerns. <Col N="868" /> I am not going to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is presumed that the Deputy has in mind the computation of mining profits for income-tax purposes.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The profits of mining ventures are computed according to the relevant rules applicable to Schedule D. of the Income-tax Act, 1918, in the same way as the profits of other concerns in the nature of trade, but an allowance may be claimed in respect of certain capital expenditure on mine development subject to the provisions of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1946.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if it is going to be of no use thereafter.  The situation is quite clear that you take the capital expenditure that has been incurred on the erection of buildings, everything except acquisition.  You estimate the working life of the mine and you estimate the residual value that the buildings, and so forth, will have at the end. The hostel in a desert, so to speak, will not have any residual value.  In the circumstances to which Deputy Lemass just referred, there would be no residual value and if the estimate of the working life of a mine is 20 years then one-twentieth of that is deducted each year during the working.  The only difference&mdash;I want to be perfectly straight on this&mdash;in Deputy Lemass's amendment is that he refers to the cost of acquisition.  The 1946 Act does not provide for the purchase price.  It provides for everything else.  I think probably the reason why my predecessor did not put that in was because here we do not deal with minerals by means of purchase prices, we deal with them by means of royalty.  I imagine that was the reason my predecessor excluded it.</P>

I think it is entirely wrong to provide here an arrangement under which one concern, a foreign-owned concern at that, will be getting exemption from taxation of its profits when another concern, an Irish-owned concern already established in this country, doing precisely similar work, will nevertheless be paying taxes. We know the Canadian company which will work in Avoca will have the advantage of the very considerable State expenditure already undertaken there. It is true that they will repay the total of that expenditure, without interest, out of profits over a period of time but they are getting for their enterprise at Avoca far more considerable help from the community here than any of the existing mining concerns got.</P>

If I myself had the task of framing the tax arrangements which would be fair to those who were undertaking that development and most likely to act as an incentive to other persons to undertake mining development in other areas I would have produced a somewhat different Bill from that which the Minister has introduced, but here is the Minister's Bill; it has been accepted by the Dáil on Second Reading.  I am letting that position stand.  I am not objecting in any way to the giving of the concessions which the Dáil has approved of to the Canadian company, but I do contend strongly that elementary justice requires that similar treatment should be given to the Irish-owned companies in the same business. That is the purpose of this amendment. So far as the Bill is concerned, these companies are being given a theoretical right to tax relief which is completely fictitious and which could only have been put in to irritate them.</P>
      <P>As I understand the provisions here, each of these companies is deemed to be entitled to the eight years' relief that the Canadians at Avoca will get, four years free of all tax, four years with only 50 per cent. tax, but these eight years of tax concessions are deemed to have commenced, as far as each of them is concerned, on the day that they commenced operations so that any company that has been eight years in existence gets no relief at all; it is assumed to have already got the relief.  A company that has been in existence for seven years will be entitled to one year at a rate of taxation of 50 per cent.  A company that has been in operation for four years will be deemed to have already got four years' complete tax remission and to be entitled to four years of 50 per cent. remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I know, there is only one company in this country that can qualify for any relief under this Bill, that is the company operating at Abbeytown in Sligo, which is itself <Col N="872" /> entirely foreign-owned, as the House knows.  If my recollection is correct&mdash; it may not be&mdash;the Silvermines Company commenced operations in 1948 and just misses to qualify by a hair's breadth.  The Benbulben Barytes Company has been in operation for about ten years.  Each of these concerns, therefore, fails to qualify by reason of that provision for any relief under this Bill.  If I am wrong in that, if the Minister can indicate to me any Irish-owned mining enterprise that can get any relief from this Bill, I will accept his statement.</P>
    <P>I think it is unjust, not merely to deprive them of the same relief as the foreign-owned companies are getting, but, by the provisions of this Bill, to proclaim to them how foolish they were to have gone into the development of Irish mineral resources in the past or not to have had some foreigner associated with them when they were doing it.</P>
    <P>The result of the acceptance of my amendment would be to say to them: &ldquo;We are starting a new arrangement now.  For this year and for eight years to come, everybody doing mining in this country will be entitled to tax relief and all will get the same relief.&rdquo; That is a matter of common justice and I think the Government would be most unwise to insist on retaining the Bill unchanged in that respect.  I do not know if any of the existing concerns are making a profit.  So far as I can gather from their published statements, they are not.  If that is so, then the Minister can do justice in this matter at no cost to the Exchequer and that must gladden any Fine Gael heart.  He can give the relief without its costing anything.  To put the provision in the Bill that these companies, which have been struggling through difficult times, losing money, many of them, occasionally making a profit and then being billed by the Revenue Commissioners, are presumed to have already enjoyed these tax concessions and can never under any circumstances qualify for them in future, is completely wrong and, as an incentive to Irish people to invest in Irish mining or other enterprises, it is completely negative.</P>
    <P>No matter what efforts the Government may make to get in foreign capital, it is certain that Irish development <Col N="873" /> in the future, as in the past, will, to the extent of 90 per cent. or more, depend on Irish enterprise and Irish resources.  By putting in this Bill a provision which in fact provides for preferential treatment for outsiders is completely wrong.  Even if it does cost the Exchequer anything, it is far better to proclaim: &ldquo;We are prepared to give the same treatment to everybody without discrimination, to Irish-owned as to foreign companies&rdquo; than that we should, by this elaborate procedure, hold up to these companies the picture of what they might have got but will not get and to make sure that in fact they can never benefit under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was wondering, when Deputy Lemass put down the amendment, how he would speak in support of it.  From the somewhat offensive speech he has made, I can only assume that the whole purpose of the offence was to try to cover up his own guilty conscience because&mdash;the situation is clear beyond question&mdash;if the companies concerned are not getting any relief prior to 5th April, 1956, the reason for it is that Deputy Lemass and his colleagues, when they were in Government, did not see fit to give them this relief in their initial years. Deputy Lemass cannot get over that fact.</P>

      <P>The only reason for the speech we have just heard is that Deputy Lemass knows that and was trying to cover it up with a flowery type of offence.  What are the facts? The facts are that the existing companies in this country who are mining non-bedded deposits came to see me, having first of all sent me a memorandum of what they wanted.  All they asked me for were the provisions I have given them here.  When they came to me, I told them I would give them these provisions, and now I am giving them all they asked me for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister for any information about the tax position of these companies.  I asked about the dates on which they started.  I could have got that from the newspapers and from other reports available.  There is no secret whatever about that.  My recollection is that Silvermines started in 1948.  There was a public issue in that year.  I know for a fact that Benbulben Barytes started some years before that.  If the Minister tells me that these people asked him for an arrangement under which they would get no benefits whatever and that they were satisfied with that he must think I am very naïve.</P>

      <P>The practice of this House is that when a Deputy on either side states something within his own personal knowledge, that is accepted. I am telling the Deputy that the companies operating the mining of non-bedded deposits&mdash;Abbeytown, Silvermines and Glendalough&mdash;came to see me and asked me for the arrangement which I am now providing in this <Col N="875" /> section.  I have given them that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Glendalough company would be entitled to some relief under the Bill.  That company were operating for a number of years but only on the basis of processing spoil of previous workings.  It is only within the past eight years that they have done actual mining operations and so would qualify under this Bill.  To what extent they are now doing mining operations I do not know. Abbeytown would qualify for some relief, but they are a completely foreign-owned company.  Silvermines started in 1948 and Benbulben Barytes are definitely not qualified under the Bill.  Is there any argument against the giving of these facilities on a uniform basis over a uniform period of time to all concerns apart from the fact that the Exchequer may lose money&mdash;not much money because the profits are small?  It is a wrong situation to allow to develop here that in two or three years' time when the origin of this legislation is forgotten and when the bargain made with the Canadians has receded into the past, on this discriminatory taxation basis, you will have some industrial firms paying the full tax, some paying half and some paying no taxation at all.  If that is the situation the Minister is holding out as an incentive this Bill is worse than useless.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  in the event that mining operations ceased, prior to January 1st, 1956, for any period longer than three months, the commencement day shall be the day on which mining operations were resumed after such cessation.</P>
      <P>Here we have a different proposition and this amendment I will press to a division, if necessary, but I hope such action will not be necessary.  In at least two of the concerns I have mentioned, production ceased for a period. The companies began operations many years ago, lost money and ceased operating.  They closed down.  Market conditions improved again and they resumed operations.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the commencement date for the purpose of qualifying for this concession will be the date on which they resumed operations, not the date on which they originally began.  Silvermines were closed down for over a year and only got back into normal commercial production again when additional capital resources were made available to them by a trade loan.  Benbulben Barytes were closed down for two years and only reopened in 1954 when the prospect of an export market opened up again.  It would be wrong to penalise these people for having had to close down.</P>

If there was any delay in completing the debenture deeds and other documents involved that was because of the slowness of these proceedings.

The process of reviving it was a different one and it involved the introduction of new capital by means of State guarantee and I think that for the purposes of this Tax Bill the company should have been deemed to have commenced operations at the time when the process of reviving was completed and the company set up again.  Precisely the same thing happened in the case of Benbulben where the resumption after stoppage began in 1954, if my recollection is correct.

In justice, apart from the position of individuals&mdash;and the trouble with a Bill of this kind is that we know there are only three or four individuals involved in it&mdash;I suggest we should have regard to the fact that certain companies went out of production and we should deem the dates of revival as the dates of commencement of operation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> Since yesterday, I have been doing a little research and I dug up a report of the committee of inquiry into the issue of totalisator licences for greyhound racetracks in&mdash;as it was then described&mdash;the Irish Free State.  This document was finally produced in July, 1932, and it gives a very considerable amount of valuable information as a result of the investigations.  I would like to say at this stage that this was an inquiry held in public, not in secret, so that we know the sources of evidence.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (10) of that report&mdash;and I am quoting from the document&mdash; says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Evidence was given before us to the effect that the totalisator provided the ideal system of betting, inasmuch as it was restricted in its operations to cash betting and excluded credit betting, with its attendant evils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first amendment, No. 8, seeks to prevent, on the authority of the board, the setting up of any form of credit totalisator betting and that can only happen as far as they can control the area over which they have control, that is, inside the track where the totalisator exists.  At the same time, I want the Bill to make it unlawful for any other group of people, without the consent of this board, to set up credit totalisator betting outside the greyhound racing track.  Therefore, the two amendments are similar.  If the Minister would say now he accepts that, it would save me a lot of trouble and argument and save me reading a lot of extracts from this document.  If the Minister, at this stage, would indicate whether he has objections to it, I am willing to listen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be perfectly frank with the Deputy and the House. I have no strong views on this and I would not want to coerce the mind of any member of my own Party or any Party supporting the Government in regard to this matter.  I think it is a matter upon which any two honest men could have a fair difference of opinion. I think I am right in saying, as Deputy Briscoe has already said, that the two amendments together operate to prohibit <Col N="882" /> credit betting on greyhound racetracks.  Let us take it on that broad basis.</P>
      <P>The considerations that occurred to me are quite simply these.  If you think it is right to prohibit credit betting in greyhound racing, why do you think it right only to prohibit in respect of totalisators?  Should it not be prohibited in respect of bookmakers as well?  That is one consideration. The second consideration is this.  If a chap is going to ruin himself by wagering improvidently on races, I often think that the sooner he gets into deep water, is unable to meet his commitments and gets warned off racetracks altogether, the better it is for himself. The worst that can happen to him, if he runs up an account with the bookmaker or the totalisator far beyond his capacity to pay, is that he will be unable to pay on settling day and he will be reported to the appropriate authority and warned off tracks altogether thenceforward.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that is not a good thing for a fellow who cannot enjoy an evening's sport and confine his wagering to a figure well within that which he may legitimately put at hazard.  On the other hand, I can see Deputy Briscoe's point of view, that if a fellow goes to the races and has £2 or £3 in his pocket and, when that is gone, temptation is out of his way, whereas if he has opened a credit account with a bookmaker or a totalisator, when he spends the £2 or £3, he may be tempted to retrieve his losses on the last race and plunge up to his neck far beyond where he would have gone if, in fact, he had been prevented from betting for the want of credit facilities.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I personally take the view that nothing we can do here can reasonably be expected to settle the private affairs of any of our fellow citizens.  The proper thing to do is to let things take their course and not try to extend an avuncular umbrella over improvident persons, but rather face the fact that the sooner improvident persons are excluded from racetracks altogether, the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way I would opt if this were put to a division, but I would not <Col N="883" /> have the slightest hard feelings against anybody who took the opposite view. I would fully understand their approach as well, but I would ask Deputy Briscoe to give us the benefit of his views.  Does he think there is something in the argument that, if a chap is going to spend too much on betting, it is better to leave him get up to his neck at once and then let him be warned off altogether, rather than to have him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear the Minister's point of view in relation to the suggestions in these amendments, but I am afraid I cannot agree with the Minister, because I do not think he knows, from his own personal experience, much about this game. First of all, the Minister must accept that, in the case of the totalisator and betting transactions, it is a purely impersonal matter, but, in the case of betting transactions between, say, myself and a bookmaker, it is a purely personal transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases, a person backs with a person who is known to him&mdash;a bookmaker. That must be accepted.  The bookmaker is not in business for the public benefit.  He is in the business <Col N="884" /> as a business and he has to be prudent, in so far as he gives credit to a client. I can tell the Minister that I know without doubt that in most cases bookmakers do not encourage backers to get out of their depth.  If they know of a case such as the one cited by the Minister, where a person takes the housekeeping money, they do not want to have any business with him.  That is my own personal experience and I am satisfied I am correct on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it exists with the bookmakers.  That is true, but he does not say it could be regarded as an evil; but it does not exist with this particular tote because this tote does not exist.  I say it is far more dangerous to have this impersonal kind of situation than to add to the other business. I must refer the Minister to the last part of paragraph (10), page 7 of the document to which I referred.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... Section 3 (6) of the Totalisator Act, 1929, provides in effect that wherever the totalisator is in operation bookmakers must also be allowed to operate and that thus the same facilities for credit betting would still exist side by side with the totalisator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to say, first of all, that in regard to the case of credit betting on a totalisator, there is the possibility of its being inside a greyhound racing track under the control of the board, but there is also, as amendment No. 9 points out, the possibility that a few of us could get together and set up a credit betting shack outside the greyhound racing track, with a number of telephones.  I might be at home reading the paper and see that a particular little dog has a good chance of winning. Five minutes before the &ldquo;off,&rdquo; I ring up the tote investors and make a bet.  The following night I try to recover my losses, but the difference between the bookmaker and the punter on the one hand, and the tote and the punter on the other, is that, if I go to a bookmaker, he tells me what he is going to pay me.  The Minister cited four-to-one odds yesterday and for the present we will take those odds.  I go to him and say: &ldquo;I want £1 on this dog.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;My price is four-to-one,&rdquo; and then I put on my money. I know what I am likely to get, if the <Col N="885" /> dog wins.  But when I go to the window of the tote, or to the credit business, I have not the foggiest idea what the odds are going to be.</P>
    <P>The bookmaker may have this dog listed on his board at four-to-one and I might get a point over, depending on how many people have backed.  The bookmaker regulates his prices in accordance with his business.  If he holds a considerable amount of money on one particular dog, he reduces the odds, and, if I do not like it, I might find another bookmaker with better odds.  But the bookmaker has to regulate his book so that he can pay at the end.  In the tote, they do not give a hang.  The Minister and myself can go and put on our money on some dog on the tote, and all we can get back is our own money, if we are the only two persons backing that dog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can correct the Deputy there.  If we were the only individuals backing the dog, we would get a lot more back than our money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We would get it back less 10 per cent. in tax.  We would get no profit.  On the one hand, as I have said, you have the impersonal side of it, with the unknown odds, the added gamble.  There is a sufficiently big gamble in backing your dog, but now you are going to have an added gamble that, if your dog does win, you are waiting till the odds go up, wondering what it is going to pay. Sometimes we are very disillusioned when we see the odds.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about this improvident person, and I say that we have a duty towards him, if there is anything in what the Minister says&mdash; and mind you, a lot of people agree with him&mdash;that the smaller the facilities for credit betting the better.  I agree with him, but I do not agree with him to the extent of saying that what already has grown up as a well-known practice and well-conducted business is objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that if I went to a bookmaker and said: &ldquo;I want to have £5,000 on the winner, on this horse for the National,&rdquo; the bookmaker would say: &ldquo;You and who else?&rdquo; if I was <Col N="886" /> looking for credit, because he would know that I could not afford to have £5,000 on a horse; but if, while I am busy here in Dáil Éireann, I am interested in having a little flutter&mdash; and I am sure the Minister would feel the same way about it&mdash;say, on the Derby, on so and so, I can go to the phone, ring up some bookmaker who knows me and whom I know, and say: &ldquo;I would like to have 2/6 on this horse&rdquo;.  What is this horse that was named here and that none of us accepted the tip?  It was the Leader of this Party who gave a tip on Derby Day without knowing it when he said &ldquo;Never Say Die&rdquo;.  When I went to put my 2/6 on &ldquo;Never Say Die&rdquo;, I would be glad to know that I was able to do it because of those credit facilities and that I was able to do it with somebody who knew me, and to know that if the horse won at 20-to-1, I would get 20 half-crowns, without having to pay my own 2/6.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to recognise the different stages.  I will go that far with him, that, without the individual control of the individual bookmaker with regard to his client, it would be bad to introduce an additional method of credit betting. The Minister will recollect that, recently on a Bill in this House, the Lotteries and Gaming Bill, I sought to have some protection for bookmakers for the purpose of the recovery of bad debts.  I did not succeed.  But can you imagine what the position is going to be if there are defaulters on the totalisator?  How is the totalisator going to recover losses from defaulters and pay the people who wager the proper legitimate odds which they are entitled to, on the basis of the calculations made?  Is it not obvious that they will have to find a way to build up a fund against bad debts?  Consequently, the Minister will be introducing into this system what I would regard as something, again, that is not equitable.</P>
    <P>Those are my answers to the intervention of the Minister.  I think I am not misinterpreting him when I say that he has gone so far as to indicate last night and again this evening that he would be prepared to leave this to a free vote.  I am not saying that the <Col N="887" /> Minister committed himself to that, but he was prepared to consider it.  I was going a bit further.  Let the Minister accept the amendment, because I think it is more important that it be accepted in that form than on what is called a free vote.  Certainly if the Minister were to make that suggestion this evening, I would have to keep on fighting these amendments until 10.30, because most of our troops will not be back until next Wednesday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion I made was that the Deputy might withdraw the amendments and let our colleagues read the two sides of the story, as discussed here, in the Official Report, so that by the Report Stage everybody would have considered the arguments proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Minister's view, I want to say this, that at this stage I would not be prepared to withdraw, because I want to adduce all the arguments I can, and I hope that some of my colleagues will fortify and strengthen them much more than the little I am able to do.  The Minister says, and I agree with him, that we do not want to introduce any additional methods, that credit betting is bad, but because it exists in a limited way in regard to bookmakers, we might as well leave it as it is.  His position, if I might respectfully suggest it, I would not regard as quite logical. He says: &ldquo;I do not like, in the public interest, credit betting because evil can arise from it, but because it exists to the limited extent it does and is in the hands of the individuals who control it, very well, let it go rip altogether.&rdquo;  I say, on that argument alone, the Minister should concede the point I am making, but I have given him a lot of other arguments, and at this stage I think the Minister should be able to say that both these amendments are necessary and will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point of view I would like to put to the House with regard to this matter which arises partly out of what Deputy Briscoe said. I myself do certainly with regard to <Col N="888" /> greyhound racing say that, if there was a feasible method of restricting credit betting altogether, I would be taking up the attitude with regard to these amendments that I would approve of them, and I would suggest that, in addition to restricting credit betting on the tote, you should also abolish or restrict it with regard to bookmakers. I honestly do not believe, however, that you would ever be able to devise an enforceable method of preventing a bookmaker from making a credit bet, either on the course or in his S.P. office on greyhound racing.  If I thought you could, I would be suggesting to the Minister not only to accept these amendments, but to add to them himself, and to say that credit betting on a totalisator or with bookmakers, either on the course or off the course, shall be illegal.  I think there is great weight in the suggestion that you cannot avoid a certain amount of credit betting with the bookmakers and that it may cut down the general volume of it to prevent it on the tote.</P>
      <P>I make that suggestion on one proposition, of the validity of which I have no personal knowledge.  It has been suggested to me that Tote Investors, as they operate at present, are much more lenient with the amount of credit they give, and the people to whom they would give credit, than the average hard-headed bookmaker.  It is suggested that, strange as it may seem&mdash;one normally expects a firm to be a bit harder than a personal entrepreneur such as a bookmaker&mdash; they operate the only credit totebetting operating in this country and that they are much more lenient and take much harder knocks, proportionately, than any bookmaker.  I have not heard anything to the contrary and I have not any information myself which either confirms or repudiates it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is true that a man may be in the position of going to a bookmaker with no money in his pocket, and that taking his average luck, the bookmaker will say: &ldquo;No, I am not dealing with you.  You are not a good risk&rdquo; and if the same man is likely to be able to go to Tote Investors, even once, and put the same bet on the credit with them then I can see a lot in what the <Col N="889" /> Minister says about the improvident man who has the bug and who will ruin himself and that possibly it is better for himself and his family if he does so quickly.  The less extreme case is the man who will go to a meeting and lose maybe what he brought with him on the first two races and who, if he cannot get accommodation, will either go home or remain and watch as a spectator for the rest of the evening and then come back again the next week and bring a few more pounds or a few more shillings with him.  If he can get credit on the tote where he would not get it from a hard-headed bookmaker, then I suggest to the Minister that these amendments might be worth while.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion in relation to which I should like some investigation and the validity of which I do not know at all.  There is a suggestion that, at present, on the timing of the S.P. operating of the credit tote system, it seems most unlikely that a proportion of the bets which the credit tote accepts ever pass into the tote. In other words, it is suggested that you can ring up, at 27 minutes past three, the credit tote in the middle of the city and get a sizable bet on with them for a race starting at 3.30 and that it is most unlikely, on the timing and the figures, that that bet is ever passed into the tote itself.  I do not know if that is true.  The suggestion is made.  It would not apply to the credit tote on the course; presumably it will pass in every bet it gets.  If the suggestion is true, you are betting on the tote but you are not paying 10 per cent. of the funds to the board concerned.</P>
    <P>It may be, as a side issue on all this question of credit betting on the tote, that there would be an appreciable loss, though not a great loss, to the funds eventually going into the board controlling it and the industry generally because of the existence of credit tote betting.  In other words, they are basing their prices not as S.P. but on the tote, without paying their 10 per cent.  If that is so, it would be an added reason for being against credit betting.  I am only partly persuaded at present that the credit tote is <Col N="890" /> likely to be a more lenient credit giver than a hard-headed bookmaker and, though it may only be a half measure, it might be worth while particularly in regard to greyhound racing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has brought up a very important point in connection with the improvident man who is on the downward path so far as betting is concerned.  The idea the Minister expressed is that it is as well to put him out of pain as quickly as possible and finish him off as far as betting is concerned.  I do not think we should make the downward path any easier for any man to pursue.  If you have credit betting as it is at the moment with the bookmakers&mdash;personally, I do not believe they should have it&mdash;I do not believe it should be extended to the tote under any circumstances. I recollect distinctly, when the Gaming and Lotteries Bill was introduced here, that Deputy Briscoe and myself did not see eye to eye on an amendment which he introduced at one stage by which he endeavoured to protect bookmakers from the depredations of people who welshed or failed to pay bets they lost.  My argument at the time was that these bookmakers were taking a chance and that if they were protected by being allowed to proceed to the courts afterwards to recover their losses you would only encourage credit betting.  The fact that you limited bookmakers and gave them no protection under the Gaming and Lotteries Act makes them more cautious and certainly helps to stop the gentleman who is anxious to throw away what, in fact, he has not got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finlay is quite right, I think, in his remarks about extending it to the tote if we find that it is impossible to limit credit betting with the bookmakers. If that cannot be arranged&mdash; and it is very hard to see the legal machinery whereby you can accomplish it&mdash;I do not think it is fair to extend that privilege of credit betting outside the limit the bookmakers have at the moment.  We had a discussion here&mdash;I do not think the Minister himself was present when it was thrashed out&mdash;about the terrible evils committed through the playing of &ldquo;pongo,&rdquo;<Col N="891" /> roulette, and so forth.  We heard talk of wives and children suffering because of the gambling instinct.  Steps were taken in this House to limit to the tightest degree possible opportunities for small income groups to indulge even in a game of &ldquo;pongo.&rdquo;  I think a sixpenny limit was imposed on them in that particular game.</P>
    <P>I can visualise some of the gentlemen who would like to take up a phone and put a £50 or £100 bet on a particular horse or dog.  It may be awkward for those people to send down a messenger to a bookie's office, but I think that privilege should be limited as much as possible so as to make it as awkward as possible.  Though it may be awkward for the gentleman who has plenty of money, by tightening up the position on him you will protect, in so far as it is possible to do so, the man who cannot afford to put on a credit bet, although that opportunity may be given to him.  Take Deputy Briscoe's point.  If he wishes to put on a bet of 2/6 on the Derby, my argument is that we should not facilitate him, if at all possible, and that it would be better to suggest to him that he should send out a messenger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could get the Chief Whip to take the bets outside the House, but I know perfectly well it is not practicable to impose restrictions on credit betting, as far as bookmakers are concerned.  I am of the opinion, however, that this House should not at this stage make it still easier for the man who is weak and easily tempted to have the privilege of credit betting with the totalisator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my approach is probably the right one.  There are very cogent arguments on both sides. Deputy Finlay posed the arguments in a way which would most strongly influence the mind of any reasonable person.  If I were to have a division on these two amendments to-night, I would vote against them in a free vote; but I can well understand Deputy <Col N="892" /> Finlay going into the opposite lobby and fully appreciate his view and think nothing wrong that both of us should differ on a matter of this kind. As Deputy Briscoe said, he is not particularly anxious to put an amendment of this kind to a division this evening for a variety of reasons, which I fully understand.  I think there would be an advantage in withdrawing the amendments now and letting our colleagues read the report of this debate&mdash;they will have an opportunity of doing so before this day week&mdash;and then put down the two amendments and let there be a free vote, every man voting as he thinks wise and prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister overlooks one practical difficulty, that is, there has been no discussion on the amendments so far, at least no discussion that one could describe as closely-knit and closely reasoned.  The House is almost empty for the usual reason; it happens to be the time when most people are in the restaurants. Now there was a rather long debate on the Bill which preceded this one, but we have not had, as I have said, any reasoned or close-knit discussion on these amendments at all.  The only way in which it would be practicable to allow the amendments to be discussed would be to withdraw them, on the promise that the Minister would allow the Bill to be recommitted for the purpose of discussing these amendments when we put them down again. That might, of course, involve us in a considerable user of Parliamentary time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really think that we have not visualised what the position is likely to be if we simply withdraw the amendments now and have a perfunctory division upon them some time later on the Report Stage.  After all, the value of the Committee Stage is that you enter the argument as soon as it is made.  In the case of a debate on Report, you have not got that opportunity. I am very sorry to hear the Minister say that if there were a free vote at this moment on these amendments, he would vote against them.  I do not know whether he has considered what a great temptation the facility for credit betting on the totalisator, in <Col N="893" /> the way in which it is offered on the racecourse at the present moment, really represents.  A person who wants to bet on the tote in the ordinary way has to have his money in his pocket. In most cases, if he wants to make a bet with a bookmaker, he has to have his money in his pocket, or the bookmaker must have good reason to believe he has the money in the bank. A person who, without any sort of introduction, can walk into the offices of the totalisator and make a bet will, under this system, get his bill at the end of the month and he will have forgotten what the bets were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the week&mdash; I know that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of the week, he will have forgotten what the bets were.  It seems to me that that is bad when you have race-meetings at not too frequent intervals.  But, remember, here in the City of Dublin, you would have a dog meeting every evening, six evenings in the week, and on each occasion you would have the facilities for credit betting available. People might be rushing out on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and their opportunities for betting are quickly exhausted, if they have to make cash bets.  If they are going to be in the position of walking in and betting &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo; with the totalisator, one can easily visualise what the result will be in many cases. People will be tempted to enter into commitments which they cannot meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect.  I do not know precisely how the totalisator credit betting will be controlled.  Is a monopoly to be conferred on a group? Is it the greyhound industry board that will operate the totalisator credit, or will it be the monopoly of some persons who get facilities for operating totalisator credit betting on racetracks?  I think that is an aspect of the matter which requires some consideration. These people would be getting facilities denied to everybody else and these are facilities, too, which can lend themselves to abuse.  If a substantial bet is going on with a bookmaker, the man who is making the bet makes it as a rule in open court, so to speak.  If <Col N="894" /> the big money is going on, one finds the bookmakers' odds change very rapidly to match.  In the case of the totalisator, on the other hand, quite substantial bets can be placed and can be held until the last minute.  Any person who has been to a race-meeting will see the ordinary punter, who is betting in a small way, watching to see how many units there are in the pool; then, quite suddenly, the whole thing is upset because of the totalisator credit coming on.  The picture changes completely.</P>
    <P>In the position which might exist, when the totalisator is established on the greyhound racing tracks, I think there would be many opportunities offered for people to bring off coups which they could not possibly bring off, if they were betting openly with bookmakers. Deputy Finlay referred to yet another aspect of this matter.  He mentioned the fact that one can get a late bet on at the totalisator credit and it is possible that the levy will not be paid on these bets at all through the totalisator.  The problem that will arise there is how will the totalisator credit system finance itself?  After all, if you make a bet on Monday and the bill is presented at the end of the week, or on the following Monday, in the meantime there is 5 per cent. on that bet owing to the greyhound industry board.</P>
    <P>How will that be financed? Apparently, the only way in which it can be financed, that I can see, is from private sources, financed by the people who operate the totalisator credit and operate it for profit, which, in some unknown way, they must derive for themselves or draw for themselves.  In addition to that, what will happen to bad debts?  How will they be paid off?  There are bad debts with the bookmakers.  How will bad debts on the totalisator credit system be dealt with? I think these are aspects of this matter which we should have an opportunity of discussing when there is a fuller House, when there are some more knowledgeable people here than the few neophytes now sitting at this side of the House.  If we had the assistance of some of our colleagues who know a great deal more about this problem, <Col N="895" /> we would be able to make a more valuable contribution to the discussion. The fact of the matter is that we have not got available, to assist us here, the expert knowledge which some of our colleagues have.  If they were here, this would be a much more useful debate.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, if he wished us to withdraw the amendment, we would do so, provided that he agreed to recommit the Bill and discuss the matter later.  I gather that the Minister is not prepared to make that concession and I suppose we will have to try, with our imperfect knowledge and lack of dialectical skill, to continue the debate until such time as we have thrashed the matter out, so that our colleagues can read the report of the debate with advantage.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the Minister asking the House to leave things as they are.  We have had a great deal of discussion in this House during the last six months on gambling and I do feel that if the Minister is going to leave it open to the totalisator to have credit gambling, we are encouraging more gambling for our people.  The Minister and other Deputies have spoken about the bookmakers in their speeches.  If a man goes to a bookmaker to make a credit bet, there is the human side of it, and a bookmaker will accept a credit bet from a friend.  On the other hand, if we are going to extend credit betting to the totalisator, I think the Minister, instead of saying that he is going to leave everything to the board, would have done better not to bring in the Bill at all.  I believe the responsibility is on the Dáil to make this Bill as perfect as it can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We would be all better off, if we got a little less credit. I believe that this House and the Minister have a responsibility to make a decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>By accepting what we <Col N="896" /> believe to be two very reasonable amendments.  I believe that, in doing so, we would be contributing something worth while, not alone to this House, but to the people outside by preventing them from indulging in credit gambling to a greater extent. As Deputy Briscoe has pointed out, no bookmaker is going to give credit <i>ad lib</i> to anybody.  If the Minister accepts these amendments, he will be ensuring that that section of our people who have the complete gambling outlook will not get further facilities for credit gambling.</P>
      <P>In the Lotteries Bill we discussed at considerable length the gambling instincts of our people and we tried to keep them down.  In these amendments, the Minister has the opportunity of saying that he will not extend any more credit facilities for gambling than are available at present.  I feel that the Minister should really consider this matter.  We do not want to prolong the debate and to discuss every section of the Bill here, day after day, but we feel that we ought to make the Bill as good as it possibly can be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay stated that he would do what is suggested in the amendments to the bookmakers.  If we decided to make credit betting with the bookmaker illegal, it would be impossible to administer that restriction, because the human side is there and the bookmaker may or may not accept a bet from a friend.  Credit betting with bookmakers is completely covered because a bookmaker who wants to make a few shillings will not deal with a man who is continually looking for credit.  I feel that the Minister should make up his mind to accept the amendments. I believe that they are reasonable amendments and that they are in the interests of everybody.  It would be wrong to extend the facilities for credit betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What more can I do to help the Opposition than to say that I am prepared to have a free vote on it now, or to have a free vote on it on the Report Stage; that I see the force of both arguments and that I do not quarrel with a man who holds a different view from my own, but I expect <Col N="897" /> him not to quarrel with me for the views that I hold?  I am puzzled by all this talk about a man having the right to bet indefinitely on credit with the totalisator.  It would surprise me if, when that man did not pay his weekly account, he would not be told to take his business elsewhere.  If a fellow is going to act improvidently, it is better for him to run into debt with the totalisator and be unable to pay and then be told to take himself off.</P>
      <P>I see fully the force of the arguments on the other side and I quarrel with nobody who holds the opposite view to mine.  I cannot do more than to say to the Opposition: &ldquo;Let there be a free vote now, or let the Deputies withdraw the amendments and we will have a free vote this day week.&rdquo;  I find no fault with anybody who goes into the opposite lobby to me and I fully understand his position, but I bespeak for my colleagues a similar understanding for myself.  The length of one's speech is not related to the measure of his cogency.  I have said all I have to say on this matter and I do not want to delay the House any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister cannot shed some part of his responsibility so lightly.  The Minister wants to leave the decision of this to a free vote of the House and he frankly says: &ldquo;whatever is the decision I am satisfied.&rdquo;  The Minister is a Minister of State and he has more responsibility than just acting on his own personal view in this.  There is a moral issue. Deputy McQuillan in supporting this amendment which, I take it, does not even go as far as he would like it to go in the general situation, pointed out that particular aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do know that there is a widespread anxiety over the facilities we have and the additional facilities we are giving for gambling transactions. Here the Minister, without realising what he is doing, is opening up a very extensive new field in which thousands of our citizens can become involved, and not the type of person who bets in big transactions.  The man who bets in big transactions could not afford to do his business with the totalisator because the odds would never suit him. <Col N="898" /> The man who owns or trains horses, the big person who is in the know, bets with a bookmaker, in ante-post betting in big transactions at agreed odds. Therefore, he is removed from the working of this.</P>
    <P>What Deputy MacEntee had in mind when he was speaking&mdash;and I quite see his point&mdash;was, Tote Investors or totalisator credit betting.  We do not know whether it is run by the body which concerns itself with the racetracks or whether it is a small monopoly.  We do not know, but possibly we will find out in time.  In some place, there may be a race-meeting, at the Curragh, in Cork, or somewhere else, and there is not the same opportunity for these facilities. What Deputy MacEntee had in mind was that, even if it were only a week until such time as the totalisator sends out its bill, a person can deliberately, with malice aforethought, make up his mind: &ldquo;I am going to have a go. Maybe I will make very substantial quick money easily and if I do not and I lose six nights in succession, well, I will face the consequences as they arise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The bookmaker is a human being, but the totalisator organisation or institution is quite impersonal.  If I have a bet with a bookmaker and I lose to him and he sends me his bill, I may not pay him immediately.  I may wait until I go to the races again, maybe a month afterwards.  If I go to the dog track, the bookmaker would expect me to settle with him on Tuesday for bets I had lost on Monday and if I did not pay him he is not going to carry me for six nights in succession for continued losses.  Therefore, his care for his own welfare is a protection against my going out of my depth.</P>
    <P>That does not apply in the case of these totalisators.  Deputy Finlay spoke of what he called suggestions of things that were happening.  He was not stating them as matters of fact but he had reason to believe that because of the sources from which he had got this information, there was some foundation for what he stated.  I know and have known for a long time that there is an institution called Totalisators, Limited.  I have never yet been <Col N="899" /> able to find out if they publish a balance sheet and what is in the balance sheet.  Most people think, as the Minister did up to yesterday, that this is a public affair, that it is a non-profit-making organisation run for the benefit of horse racing.  Before this Bill is concluded maybe we will find out who are Totalisators Investors, how they are set up, who are the directors, whether they are profit-making or non-profit-making, and what they do with the profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay referred to the suggestions that were made to him.  A suggestion was made to me that Tote Investors operate quite differently from the totalisator.  The moment the whistle goes that they are off, the window is shut down on the totalisator and you cannot place any more bets, but I am told, as regards Tote Investors, that they are not as prompt in closing the window for transactions. Deputy Finlay spoke about bets made at 27 minutes past the hour.  It is quite obvious that all those bets cannot find their way to the totalisator and consequently do not come into the calculations of the odds to people who draw money for win or place bets.  I myself admit that I am prepared to wager, if I get reasonable odds, even on the North Kerry by-election.  I have not been successful in tempting anybody yet to have a bet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed odds, nothing in the dark.  I am as serious in this matter as anybody can be, and, if the Minister consulted organisations outside this House who are concerned with the welfare and behaviour of people, he would be bound to agree with amendment No. 9.  If amendment No. 9 were accepted by him it might not be necessary to have amendment No. 8 because if this credit betting were made unlawful there would be no use in giving anybody a licence.  Therefore, in actual fact, we are discussing amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider his own position, the responsibility he has in this matter.  There is no use in the Minister having to consider representations from organisations outside for an amendment to be brought in at a later stage, because it is bound to happen.  We must remember that the vast bulk of those who enjoy greyhound racing are the lower level income people.  They are not the &ldquo;toffs&rdquo;; they are not the list that the Minister read out last week, the D.S.O.s and the &ldquo;Barts.&rdquo;; I have not yet found out what a &ldquo;Bart.&rdquo; is. I have heard of a baronet but I am looking for the &ldquo;Bart.&rdquo;.  These are ordinary working-class people and they should not be put in the position of being enticed into transactions of this kind.  The vast bulk of them who attend meetings take with them a certain amount in cash and conduct their betting transactions in cash.  As far as the big gambler is concerned, he will have his bets, in any event, with the bookmaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have touched on the moral side of this matter and the responsibility of <Col N="901" /> the Government in that respect.  I am asking the Minister seriously, having tried to draw a picture for him of the circumstances and situations which will arise, to accept the amendment. He is fortified by the representations of Deputy Finlay.  It cannot be suggested that Deputy Finlay ever lightheartedly enters into a debate here merely for the sake of talking.  If the Minister is not influenced by what has been said from this side of the House, he ought to be influenced by what a colleague in his own Party says. Deputy Finlay probably draws his conclusions from his own professional experiences.  I express my views from information I receive and from my own judgment as an ordinary human being.</P>
    <P>It is admitted in both reports of inquiries that the totalisator will attract increased numbers to greyhound race-meetings.  That is admitted both by the secret and the public inquiry into this matter.  If that is so, it will mean that a large number of people will, in the beginning, engage in cash totalisator betting transactions and, later on, being more experienced, becoming fonder of racing, being able to afford to take bigger risks, will be driven to the other form of betting, the credit totalisator betting.  They will learn that by putting their money on the ordinary cash totalisator they will bring the odds down against themselves and that it is better, from that point of view, to use the credit totalisator.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister not to take the line that he has made his offer to leave this to a free vote of the House now or on Report Stage.  I do not regard this as an item that should be left to a free vote.  I would be quite happy if the Minister had left the whole Bill to a free vote of the House because then we would not have had the spectacle of people having to vote against their own amendments.</P>

      <P>Or has he made up his mind that he is not concerned further <Col N="905" /> with what is being argued?  This is a matter of vital importance.  It is not an amendment designed to bring any further protection for bookmakers; it is not designed to guarantee them against losses in revenue; but it is designed specifically to do what the Minister himself says should be done&mdash; to remove what he regards as something that should not be in existence or which should not be extended, that is, credit betting on gambling.  I can quote from the records of the committee set up to examine the whole question of totalisators for the greyhound tracks.  It is correct to admit that the 1932 inquiry was concerned with the greyhound racing tracks becoming owners themselves of their own totalisators&mdash;that totalisators would be established on greyhound tracks for the greater benefit of every aspect of the industry.  I do not know whether Deputy McQuillan is in a position to get up and dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; for me.  Five of us have spoken on this matter, one from across the House, one from the Independent Benches and three from this side who were in full agreement on this amendment.  Consequently, I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief, although my rising is welcomed by Deputy Burke, since it will save him the trouble of keeping the ball moving for a while.  I do not think there could have been any more generous attitude displayed than that which was displayed by the Minister here this evening.  I have often heard Deputies on the opposite benches and on these benches suggesting it would be a good thing to leave as many of these decisions as possible to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>I will say this now because I intended saying it before I sat down: I think the Deputy misinterpreted an interruption I made. I was not questioning his credit when talking about the North Kerry election, but that he would be justified in refusing to give me credit, if I were to take a bet with him on that question. I was about to say that, as far as Deputy Briscoe's arguments are concerned, he has gone a long way to persuading me to vote with him, should he accept the Minister's offer and have a free vote on it.  I think the Minister has met Deputies Briscoe and MacEntee in a very open and in a very fair way, and I do not think it is justifiable criticism on Deputy Briscoe's part to say there is something mean about the Minister's attitude here.</P>

Matters of the general principle behind the Bill are decided when <Col N="907" /> the House gives the measure its Second Reading.  It is then that the principle is decided.  We are now down to details and, on this particular detail, the Minister has, I think in a very fair and open way, offered a free vote.

      <P>In regard to what Deputy Briscoe has said, it is certainly my intention to request in so far as it is practicable the board to give effect to what is proposed in amendment No. 10, but manifestly the amendment in its present form is quite impracticable and could not be incorporated in the Bill.  But, in so far as it is practicable, I would expect the board to give priority on its totalisators to suitable persons not otherwise employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to put down an amendment which will be practicable to compel the board not to employ any person who is not wholly unemployed, but I think the board will decide so far as they can to give priority in employment to persons who are not otherwise employed.  It is just not possible to define a fully employed person in a statute and therefore it is impossible to apply what Mrs. <Col N="910" /> O'Carroll had in mind to an amendment of this kind.</P>

That is resented very strongly by a great number of people and I would hope that the Minister would address himself to that problem, because we are in full sympathy with the object of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  It is the section which empowers the board to grant or refuse to grant licences to operate greyhound racetracks.  One of the matters which was put in evidence before the advisory committee which the Minister set up was the rather arbitrary fashion in which licences had been granted or had been refused, when the Irish Coursing Club was in control.  We have not put it down as an amendment, because it is difficult for us to phrase it, but I would hope that the Minister would afford any person who was aggrieved by the refusal of the board to grant a licence an opportunity of presenting his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of these, 11 and 13 hang together and they are put in because there was some apprehension in the minds of individual track proprietors that the board should have an arbitrary right to walk in and appoint a place for the totalisator or for the bookmakers, without even asking the track proprietor what his opinion was, and that at least the track proprietor ought to be consulted, so that there would not be arbitrary or highhanded action in that respect.  These amendments operate to put a duty on the board to consult the track proprietors, at least, before determining where the totalisator or the bookmakers should be located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I gather from that that the Minister is including No. 12? The Minister has argued for the bookmakers, although Nos. 11 and 13 really concern the track proprietors.  There is an amendment here to the Bill by Deputy Walsh asking for the same facilities for the bookmakers, but with a certain amount of security, but if the Minister says the case is being made on 11, 12 and 13 together&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to No. 12 is slightly different and I think on reflection it will appear that <Col N="912" /> No. 12 is probably unnecessary.  At present, the only safeguard for horse racecourses is under the Totalisator Act of 1929, which provides that where a tote is installed, &ldquo;a place or places shall be appointed where bookmakers may carry on their business,&rdquo; but Section 23, sub-section (3) (d) of this Bill&mdash;I am trying to explain to the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;goes further by empowering the control board to attach conditions to greyhound racetrack licences as to the provision by the licensees of suitable arrangements for bookmakers in places convenient for carrying on their business, and if the licensees do not make accommodation available of their own goodwill, the bookmakers have a right at once to appeal to the board and ask the board to intervene and request them to do so.  So that really we are making provisions for the bookmakers' legitimate claims to be met and bearing in mind that we intend to have a bookmaker on the board, I think we can rest assured that if any clash arose, then the bookmaker would go to his board, one member of which at least would be familiar with their natural desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, we have to bear in mind that many of the apprehensions that exist on behalf of bookmakers under our conditions at present are really not well founded because they arise from the apprehensions which arose under the conditions that obtained in Great Britain.  In Great Britain the totalisators on the tracks were owned and controlled by the tracks and they were getting the profits from them.  You could well imagine that the bookmakers might be apprehensive that the tracks might elbow them off the tracks.  That is not the case here.  In so far as business goes into the totalisator here, the tracks get nothing and the track owners must try to tempt as many bookmakers as they can.  I imagine the situation here will be that the track proprietors will be most solicitous to see that the bookmakers have every convenience, so that they can get the maximum from their attendance. <Col N="913" /> I think on those grounds that amendment No. 12 is really unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not really studied the full history of the threat of the totalisator to greyhound bookmaking in this country. I should like to refer to a document I referred to earlier&mdash;the &ldquo;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Issue of Totalisator Licences for Greyhound Racing Tracks in the Irish Free State, July, 1932.&rdquo;  If the Minister has a look at that he will find that at one stage one particular greyhound racing track concluded that it had already been granted the necessary licence to install a totalisator.  I grant you that at that time the totalisator was to be the property of the owners of the greyhound track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We only take our views from experience.  The bookmakers suddenly found themselves told by this particular greyhound racing track that they would be shifted to a totally unsuitable place and that if they did not like it they could, in language occasionally used by the Minister, lump it.  In fact, on another occasion, they found themselves locked out because they were not going to bow to this position and they found they had to fight for their very existence.  Resulting from that, and apart from what happened in England, bookmakers' pitches should only be rearranged by agreement and certainly not to their detriment.  Amendment No. 12 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed</P>
      <P>licensees or the board, as the case may be, to alter to the detriment of bookmakers, sites occupied by them at the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the situation arises where the board has to negotiate with the licensee, that is, the track, for the installation and placing of the totalisator so that it will be reasonably usable by the public, it may in many cases have to alter the existing sites of bookmakers, and just as the board <Col N="914" /> will have to negotiate with the licensee so also should the board negotiate with the bookmakers.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to see this Bill, when it is complete and after all the discussion, a Bill that works.  I do not think anybody wants to see a situation develop from it where there will be constant irritation for those who are concerned in the earning of their livelihood. The public must be considered and we ourselves do not want to discover that we have made many mistakes and many omissions.  Therefore, there is so little between what this amendment adds to the section and what is in the section that I cannot see why the Minister can object.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was consciously or subconsciously that, when arguing about his own amendments, Nos. 11 and 13, the Minister should bring in the very arguments he used by even mentioning the bookmakers.  The Minister is consciously or subconsciously alive to the problem to which I am referring, otherwise why should he have brought in the bookmakers as the primary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> The difference, as I see it, is this.  The word &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; was a word that led to very costly action between certain building interests in Dublin and the Dublin Corporation.  The town plan was to be completed with all convenient speed and the interpretation of the councillors of the Dublin Corporation and their officials was that even this word &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; also implied costs to ratepayers but the court held the view that &ldquo;convenient speed&rdquo; was speed without any regard to any other circumstance or condition.

      <P>(3)  The licensee under a greyhound track licence shall have a right of appeal to the District Court from an order of the board revoking or suspending a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer in relation to this, to a number of other organisations that have a right of appeal to the courts.  Here while the Minister may set up the best board possible of honest, decent men, that board may be superseded by some other members as time goes on and some other Minister may be in control, <Col N="917" /> and I do feel that it is only a fair amendment.  We all have our likes and dislikes and there may be a track owner who, for some reason or other, had to give an impartial opinion contrary to some other people's opinions from time to time.  Those people might, as a result of circumstances, get on that board and try to raise a question as to whether his licence should not be revoked, and even go so far as to get other members of the board on their side.  If that track licensee or owner had the protection of the courts and knew that he could go back to the courts in a case of that kind, it would make the board administer its affairs in an impartial manner, because they would always realise that the courts were there.  The courts can be used and have been used by other bodies and boards all down through the years.  I feel, in moving this amendment, that it gives protection to a track owner or owners, as the case may be.</P>

      <P>I see the force of the point made by the Deputy, and I am prepared to accept the principle, but I would ask him to consider this: I do not know that the subject-matter of an application for a licence to operate a greyhound racing track is a suitable subject-matter for appeal to the District Court or the Circuit Court, because, after all, it is not the kind of material on which the court is peculiarly constituted to pass judgment on, as to whether a track ought to be here or there.  I will accept the principle of the amendment, and would suggest that the Deputy should withdraw this, and I will undertake to bring in on the Report Stage an amendment along the same lines, to provide an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to hear appeals of this character over which, say, a lawyer of not less than ten years' standing would preside, assisted by one or two assessors, as I think that would be a better form of tribunal of appeal than the District Court or the Circuit Court. Would the Deputy agree with that?</P>

      <P>Perhaps before the Deputy decides to withdraw, I would say that the Minister's suggestion goes a long way to meeting the position which we attempted to cover by this <Col N="918" /> amendment.  But, unfortunately, to my mind, the amendment is not sufficiently widely drawn, because I would have hoped that the question of the refusal of the board to grant a licence might be open for review by some independent authority.  I have already in the debate on the Second Reading and in the discussions on some of the earlier sections of the Bill referred to cases where people were not satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In that case, I suggest that Deputy Burke should withdraw his amendment and we can have the Minister's amendment on Report.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (f), lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;in the income of the respective greyhound racetracks or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> I had in mind a racetrack manager who over the years had invested his money in the track and had no other means of livelihood and was not a greyhound owner and had nothing to do with the owning or breeding of dogs.  This man had put his money into the business over the years and it was his livelihood for a long period. Under this Bill, the board could disqualify this man from being manager of a track.  I do not want to cite any particular manager, or to name anybody in this House, but I have one particular track in mind and I feel that, in justice to this particular man, the amendment should be accepted.  I know him to be a very honourable, decent man over the years, who has carried on in a most honourable way, impartial and strictly above-board in all his dealings with patrons, and so on.  I want the Minister to consider my amendment concerning this man, or men of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am not pleading for the man who is breeding greyhounds, racing them or owning them; I am pleading for a man with no other business, who has built up this business over the years and who is manager of the track.  Under this section, he could be debarred from being manager, or having anything to do with it, because he has money invested in it.  Therefore, if you consider the matter, I think it will be agreed that it is only just that we should protect an honest man of that kind in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept this amendment.  If there is one thing on which I think all parties are strongly agreed, who seek reform, it is that there is a certain limited category of officials of a greyhound race-meeting who ought to have no financial interest, direct or indirect, in the proceedings over which they preside. That, I believe, applies with special emphasis to the official known as &ldquo;the racing manager&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am obliged to concede to the House that I am not intimately familiar with the procedure but the racing manager of a greyhound track has the matching of the dogs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has a whole series of functions intimately associated with the outcome of the race.  Everybody seems to be agreed that the racing manager of a greyhound race ought to be ruthlessly excluded from taking any financial interest in the track or in any of the hounds racing at the track on that day.</P>
      <P>Note well that the whole section is permissive.  Therefore, it does not mean that it is a direction to the board that if there is, for instance, a woman interested in the track, she must not be allowed to take the entrance fees at the gate.  There is no absolute prohibition on the employment on the track of anybody who has an interest in the track.  However, the board has the power to declare that certain categories of employees at a race-meeting must not have a financial interest in it.</P>
      <P>I think that, on reflection, the Deputy will agree with me that certain persons, notably racing managers, ought not to have any financial interest in any aspect of the racing over which they preside to see equity and justice done between all parties concerned.</P>

      <P>In the case I am referring to, it is one and the same person.  Consider the position of the man I have in mind.  As the section stands, it means that, despite all the years he spent saving his money, investing it in this business and helping to build up the greyhound industry, he will now find himself at the mercy of a board who will say to him: &ldquo;In view of the fact that you have invested money in this track, we think you should have nothing whatever to do with it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  All they would say to him would probably be: &ldquo;You must not function as racing manager at the fixtures on your own track&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too persistent in regard to this matter but, so far, the Minister has not satisfied me.  I am speaking on behalf of a racetrack manager who has acted in that capacity for a long number of years.  I am seeking to ensure that that racetrack manager will enjoy the same confidence as he has hitherto enjoyed until such time as he commits himself in the eyes of the board.</P>
      <P>If a man has invested money in an industry and if he is honest and has carried out his work in a just, impartial and honourable manner, then, with all respect to the Minister&mdash;and I do not want to press him too hard in regard to this matter&mdash;I feel that such a person deserves more consideration than he is getting under this section. According to this section, we are looking upon racing managers and our track managers, as we know them today, as if they had not done a good job in the past.  I think we should be more impartial in our judgment of men who have tried to help the industry over the years.  Our attitude should be that until such time as, for instance, the particular track manager for whom I am speaking now, has done something contrary to the rules of the board, has been tried by the board and found guilty, he should be allowed to carry on as he has done heretofore. That is especially so when it is proved beyond doubt that he has no interest in the breeding or rearing or racing of greyhounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> There is the possibility that people may have given evidence of one kind or another.  I submit that people who may have given evidence in private might express a different viewpoint altogther if the inquiry were held in public.  Over the years, my experience of track managers is that they have done a great deal to improve greyhound racing and were it not for their keenness there would be a lot more corruption.  From my knowledge of the two track owners in Dublin, I should like to pay them that compliment.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is completely unfair that we should do or say anything detrimental to the interests of men who for years have helped to keep the industry clean and who have helped it in every possible way.  If, on occasion, they had to do something distasteful, it was only in relation to people who were warned off&mdash;and I support them wholly on the stand they took against such people.  I have yet to discover that any of the track managers I know have done anything that we would not be prepared to stand over.  There are people who were warned off for not playing the game and there are people who come along and give evidence against track and race managers.</P>
    <P>Through the Chair, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider my amendments and see how he can best meet my wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with any particular person in relation to this amendment because I feel certain that there would be more than one person involved.  I wonder, however, if the terms of the amendment are not much too wide. Certainly no person will say that a manager who is a racing manager, or who is merely the managing director, or general manager of the track, should be permitted to have any interest in the ownership of greyhounds raced on his track, or an income derived from betting on greyhound races which take place on the track.  But I wonder if the Minister has not cast his net too wide when he forbids any person performing a specified class of function from having any beneficial interest in the income of a greyhound track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I assume many of the greyhound tracks are run by a limited liability company.  Most of them are private companies.  But supposing a person holds shares in a company and his income is derived by way of dividend on those shares, would that make him liable to suffer a conflict of interest in discharging his functions, either as general manager of the track or as racing manager?  I do not think it would.  I think that a person who had a substantial interest as a shareholder in a greyhound racing track and who was, at the same time, an officer of the company operating the track, would probably be very concerned to ensure that everything done on the track would be open and above board, so that it would attract a larger public attendance and, therefore, of course, ensure that his dividend was maintained or increased.  And that would not either prevent him from drawing a larger income in time, so I think that, while it is quite clear that we should ensure that there be no conflict of interest by reason of the fact that a person is at one and the same time an officer of the track and owns or has an interest in greyhounds, in greyhound races on the track, or in the bookmaking business operated on the track, we may be going too far when we give the board power to prevent a person holding an appointment as an officer of the track, if his only interest in the track is that of a shareholder in the company that owns it.  I think the Minister might consider the matter from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to confess very much the same misgivings occurred to my mind as those expressed by Deputy MacEntee, and so I queried this and raised the very point he has raised.  If a man is a substantial shareholder in the track, would it not be to his interest, by the exercise of exceptional vigilance, to establish the reputation of his track as being beyond query or doubt?  But if you look at paragraph 77 of the report at page 32, there one will find set out certain general considerations; and then the report says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" />&ldquo;We are strongly of opinion that a racing manager should not have any financial interest in the company operating the track on which he officiates and that in his capacity as grader, he should be responsible for the proper performance of his duties, not to the company owning the track but to the control board.  We have, in fact, been informed that this is the position which obtains elsewhere and we recommend its adoption in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I sought further and better advice and, as far as I understand the situation, the racing manager is more or less in the position of a kind of cross between factor and a stipendiary steward; and the view appears to be, certainly in respect of that official, that he ought to be completely divorced from the track where he functions and be, rather, the enemy of all potential wrongdoers at that venue; and he is, in fact, expected to behave, not only as Cæsar's wife, but to appear to behave as Cæsar's wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, my first glance gave me much the same reservations as Deputy MacEntee expressed: were we not going a bit too far in saying that a shareholder should not act as a racing manager?  But the further I asked opinion on that from those deeply versed in it, the stronger the views expressed that, in respect of the racing manager, he ought not to have hand, act or part in the track, the dogs on it or anything associated with racing, other than his supervisory duties.  They were of so critical a character that anything short of complete divorce from all other interests associated with the track where he was functioning as manager should not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way: what greater guarantee is there that a track will be properly run in an impartial, honest way than the guarantee that exists if a man has his own money invested in the track?  Surely he will not do anything to derogate himself. If a man invests his money in a business, will he not ensure that that business is properly run?  Will he not <Col N="925" /> see that anything he can do to improve patronage of that business will be done?  Will he not take every opportunity to ensure that nobody will pull the wool over his eyes?  With all due respect to the inquiry, as I have said before, if that inquiry had been held in public, the racetrack managers might have had their say, too, and might have been in a position to show up some of the people who gave evidence. I will not go into that now, but our aim is to be fair.</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels he is capable of doing a particular job himself, he will not delegate that job to somebody else, and nobody will do it as impartially as he will.  He will not ask me or anybody else to come along and do the job for him.  Who will have a greater interest in preserving the integrity of his track than the racing manager who will be anxious to ensure that everything is right?  I think that is a guarantee.  I think those who decry these managers are the people who themselves were warned off quite justly.  For that reason, I am anxious to press this amendment.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider it in the light of the further evidence he has received.  I am anxious to ensure that justice will be done.  I do not want to delay the House, but I will not withdraw this amendment because I am so anxious to see justice done. Irrespective of what may transpire in Section 47, as things stand, I feel an injustice is being done.  An unfair statement was made about racetrack managers.  When the board comes into operation, surely if they find a track manager not playing the game, they will have the remedy in their own hands.  They are fully covered.  They have plenty of power under the Bill to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until such time as this board is in operation and can make an investigation of the various racetrack managers and managing directors of racetracks I feel that they should stand here as innocent men.  The implication here is that they they are otherwise.  Until such time as this board finds out for itself that the business of the greyhound tracks is not being carried out properly by the race manager or the <Col N="926" /> managing director of the track, no move ought to be made to discipline that man.  I suggest to this House that it is not in accordance with justice if anything else is done.  I cannot accept as being in accordance with the facts the arguments made in favour of this section in the report.</P>

      <P>I would submit, Sir, that you cannot say a good thing too often but I will try not to repeat myself.  I only wish to say that I will press this amendment because I feel that it is just and fair and I appeal to the Minister to consider the points that I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong in suggesting that the racing manager of a greyhound track is like a steward of the Turf Club.  As far as I know he is not.  He is an employee of the particular racetrack and he is not supplied, like a steward of the Turf Club is supplied, to handicap the horses.  He is a direct employee of that particular track.  I think the Minister was wrong in stating that he was some person apart who has no other function except to operate the machinery of the tracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has it in mind to provide a functionary as a racing manager it is a different thing altogether. I believe that the section, if it is carried as it is, would allow the board to prevent a shareholder or anyone with <Col N="927" /> an interest in a small racetrack from performing any of the functions at a greyhound race-meeting.  To my knowledge, and it is a limited knowledge, it is the shareholders who perform all these functions at the tracks.  If the board were to force a small racetrack to employ and to pay salaries to a different group of people such as vets and judges, that small racetrack would probably have to close down completely. I do not know if there is anything wrong in principle in an employee of a racetrack or a limited liability company being a shareholder.  I do not think there can be anything wrong in it.  He is an employee and he will serve his employers who are the directors of the board.  If he is employed to prepare race-cards, match dogs and supervise the races I can see nothing wrong with it.  If the board is to insist on a new group of people outside those who are employed in that capacity at the moment it might be found that some of these racetracks would not be able to function at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much impressed with what the Deputy says.  If Deputy Burke will withdraw the amendment, I shall look into the whole question again between this and the Report Stage, but I must have regard to paragraph 77 of the report.  I shall reexamine this question in the light of what Deputy Burke says.  What more can I say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had not quoted paragraph 77, I would have been very impressed.  We have here a document of 188 pages and the Minister only uses those paragraphs that suit himself and does not refer at all to the ones that do not suit him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are bringing in here much needed legislation and very strict controls. None of us disagrees with the report to the extent that we know there have been very serious abuses in many places.  When we are legislating here to set up a board that will have, not only control, but also the power of disciplinary action to the extent of revoking the licence of a track, we must have regard to the fact that over the years certain people, by their efforts <Col N="928" /> and their hard work and by their investment have created a certain position. We must not now suddenly put these people out of existence by legislation, particularly when it possibly concerns individuals who have reached the stage in life when they cannot find alternative employment.  Possibly this is the only walk in life in which such a person has experience.  You cannot put a track out of business by disemploying certain people from certain work because they have a financial interest as a shareholder.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take into consideration the fact that, whether or not that person in the past may have been guilty of some infringement or of some wrong, at least in the future that person is going to be under a control which did not previously exist.  I should like the Minister to say in some stronger fashion, more in line with the amendment itself that, while it may not be permissive in the future for the board to permit a person who is a shareholder, large or small, to suddenly take up the job, which he did not have before, of breeding dogs, where a man has been doing that up to the present, we must be fair and say: &ldquo;If we framed the Bill before you started, there would not have been a hope but you are there now; you have spent almost a lifetime in grading and we are not going to take it away from you because we know if you misbehave you will go out the gate anyway.&rdquo; Surely that is sufficient?</P>
    <P>I do not mind if the Minister does not want this amendment in the exact words here but if he gives us an undertaking that he will bring in an amendment that will safeguard the position of such people, particularly the case that has been stated by Deputy Burke, we will reach some understanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is great force in the Deputy's observations but I would ask the Deputy to ask Deputy Burke to put down an amendment himself. I will try to put down an amendment and we can see which is the better one on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the Bill but I would be glad if <Col N="929" /> the Minister would consider again this question from another angle.  When I was last on my feet I was making the case that the section was too far-reaching in so far as it prohibited a person from having any beneficial interest in the income from shares and I tried to point out that if a person's income was derived from the holding of shares I did not see that any acute conflict of interests could arise.  But there are other activities which possibly would create a conflict of interests.  So far as I can see there is nothing in this section which would prohibit a racing track manager from training greyhounds.  He would not own them; he might train them on behalf of another person.  I cannot see anything in this section&mdash;there may be something in another section&mdash;to prevent him from training or breeding greyhounds.  If the racing manager was dishonest and if the board is lax, that could happen.  It is important that the board should be alive to its responsibilities and enforce its regulations strictly.  Then perhaps some of these difficulties would not arise but there are those two activities in which it would be much more proper to prohibit a racing manager from engaging than to prohibit him from holding shares in a greyhound track.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that relate to officers of the board or officers of the club?  Section 37 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board may make regulations for the control of the training of greyhounds for reward.</P>
      <P>(2)  Regulations under this section may, in particular, make provision for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  prohibiting persons from training greyhounds for reward save under and in accordance with licences granted by the board at its discretion,</P>

      <P>It has occurred to me whether it would not be advisable to bring in an amendment prohibiting a racing manager from having any interest in the training, particularly, of greyhounds and, by extension, the breeding of greyhounds and, of course, the sale.  However, I want to get back to Deputy Burke's amendment and to suggest to the Minister that, on consideration, he will see that the words in the section are not worth the paper on which they are written because the thing can be so easily evaded.  I have in mind particularly the case of a person who is an officer <Col N="931" /> of a greyhound racing track and who owns shares.  What is to prevent him from transferring the shares to his wife?  Is it not much better that we should face up to the situation and delete the reference to income derived from the holding of shares?  That would perhaps narrow it sufficiently.  If the Minister does that I think Deputy Burke might withdraw his amendment in those circumstances.  Will the Minister bring in an amendment to cover the points we are making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>We are getting through these sections quite rapidly and this one is almost a statute in itself.  This is a section which consists of almost two pages.  We have had time to read it, but I am wondering whether it is not too sweeping.  We have already detected one case where the provisions are much too far-reaching, I think, to be even workable.  I wonder whether there is not some other aspect of the section which would require further consideration.  I do not wish to hold the Minister up. I know we have had time to look at this but this is an important Bill and we are debating it in a very depleted House.  The Minister will realise that we are not omniscient and there are aspects of this particular section which might call for discussion.  We will let the section go if the Minister would, on consideration, recommit it&mdash;because it is one of the difficult sections in the Bill&mdash;when we have a fuller attendance.  We could hold up the business by calling a House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back on that.  The Minister made a very serious mistake in stating yesterday that the bookmakers do not pay any levy whatsoever.  I have a little sum which I will present to him at some stage from which he will find that he made a very grave mistake and that they do pay a levy and are heavy payers of the levy out of their own gross profits.  That does not arise on this amendment.  The Bill does impose on the bookmakers a levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a penny.  I do not believe they pay a penny of levy.  It imposes it on the bettors, maybe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; we will go into it.  The Minister, last night, in his innocence, said that the public pays the levy entirely and absolutely.  That is not correct.  I went to the trouble last night of trying to get some education on this matter after the Adjournment. <Col N="934" /> I finally solved this.  If I am a bookmaker and have a turnover of £10,000 in a year&mdash;I take that merely as a figure for the purpose of illustration&mdash; and I lose £9,000 to my clients&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you are &ldquo;bust&rdquo; wide open.  That is the answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If I lose £5,000 to my clients, I collect from them the levy on the £5,000 which they have collected from me.  I have £5,000 left, but I have to pay the levy on that £5,000, and there is no allowance given to me for the cost of entrance, for the payment of staff and for my own livelihood.  The Minister, if he examines that proposition, will find I am correct and he is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if I say that his description of the situation is as daft as a halfpenny watch, though I appreciate the skill with which he has made the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of skill.  I am prepared to get the evidence of gentlemen who have been paying levies for a great number of years.  That is how it works out.  The Minister need not attribute to me skill in this argument.  He can accept from me that I have consulted a number of bookmakers to find out the exact position, because I was amazed at what the Minister said last night.  I am informed by them that what I have said is the position, except that I believe it is more like £1,000 out of £10,000 that they would make in the year than £5,000.  I can get further written evidence certified by some of their auditors.  Perhaps then the Minister will accept it.  I am telling him it is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced levies on the bookmakers, on the public, and he has introduced in respect of the racetrack owners a commitment to give free a site for the tote, the income from which does not go into their pockets.  Now he says that it would <Col N="935" /> be unconstitutional to ask the majestic organisation which, according to the Minister, will have four representatives on the board, to make any contribution whatever.  Is that equitable? Surely, the club can find ways and means, from all its minor clubs in all its four districts, of giving a contribution, if the board find it necessary to request something from them for the great services this board will render primarily to the Irish Coursing Club, for whom there is a Schedule in the Bill and which will have four of the seven representatives on the board.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's only fear is that acceptance of the amendment might result in a test in court as to constitutionality, I think he could easily take that risk.  I do not think it entered anyone's mind, until the Minister mentioned it here, that that was the objection he would have to it. I am sure Deputy Finlay would be a very competent person to indicate whether or not acceptance of this amendment would put the Bill in jeopardy in regard to constitutionality.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to recognise that the amendment is worthy of acceptance, because everybody has to pay.  Everybody who is being brought into the scope of this Bill and, ultimately, under the management of the control board, including the public, will pay.</P>
    <P>The only people who will escape any payment at all, are those for whose benefit this Bill has been brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that, on the merits, I do not think this proposal is a good one.  I want to make several points on this amendment.  On the merits, I do not think it is a good proposal that you should give the board the right to demand an arbitrary sum from the club, just because the board is reorganising the industry.  I am assuming that the board and the club are working in close collaboration for the general betterment of the industry. I would not exclude the possibility of the club contributing money to the board for some specific purpose &mdash;if the club wanted the board to do some particular job, they could make <Col N="936" /> some contribution out of their funds to that end.  I think it is a somewhat revolutionary proposal to suggest that this House could legislate to the effect that Seán MacEntee must pay £1,000 a year to Robert Briscoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But does that not strike the Deputy at once as an entirely new principle?  It is a perfectly legitimate thing for the House to make legislation providing that Seán MacEntee, Robert Briscoe or James Dillon must pay taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Income-tax can be imposed upon us all, but there does seem to be something revolutionary in the proposal that this House should take power to compel by legislation one person to pay money to another person. It may be that I am wrong and that, on closer examination, this is not an unconstitutional proposal.  On the merits, however, I think it would only give rise to trouble, if it means that the board is going to be in a position to requisition from the club large lumps of its funds.  Should that happen, the whole purpose of our legislation has failed, because I can see this business going on and becoming a running war between the Irish Coursing Club and the board.  I want to see collaboration between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I fail to appreciate the Minister's fear as to whether or not this amendment would be repugnant to the Constitution. Neither do I appreciate why he should consider the amendment so revolutionary, having regard to the proposals he himself has embodied in this section. After all, what are we asking?  Just this, that &ldquo;the board may require the club to contribute towards the general expense of the board to assist it in fulfilling its functions under the Act such proportion of the net revenue of the club as in the opinion of the board is reasonable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all we are asking them merely to make a contribution from <Col N="937" /> their net revenue, after they have charged their expenses out of their profits.  I do not think we are asking too much.  As Deputy Briscoe has pointed out, we are compelling the bookmakers to pay a levy to the board; we are compelling the patrons who go to the tracks and bet on the totalisator to contribute to the support of the board and provide it with finances to enable it to carry out its functions efficiently.  I do not see, therefore, why we should exclude the club which, under this Act, is being perpetuated.  The Minister appears to have overlooked the provisions of sub-section (2) of this section which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The club is hereby recognised as being, subject to the provisions of this Act and of the constitution of the club and subject to the general control and direction of the board, the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I was referring the Minister to his own proposal under sub-section (2) of the section.  Surely, that infringes much more deeply upon the rights of the ordinary private individual in this country than does the proposal contained in this amendment. This means that nobody else can purport to set up an authority to control breeding or coursing.  A man was, perhaps within the limits the Irish Coursing Club would permit him to do so, at liberty to go out and start a coursing meeting, or even to start his own stud book.  The Irish Coursing Club was born, we are told, as the result of private individuals who were interested in the sport coming together, and now they are allowed to prevent people from following their example by setting up a competing organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this sub-section, no other persons will be competent to set themselves up as an authority to control breeding or coursing in this country. The Minister has given the club all this <Col N="938" /> sweeping control, and the only difficulty about the thing is that many of us who have some knowledge of it are doubtful as to whether the Minister is justified in perpetuating the Irish Coursing Club at all.  Deputy Burke has his own views; I have mine, and I know there are other people outside the House who have views which are much stronger than mine on this subject. But this is a matter upon which there are differences of opinion and the Minister, disregarding these differences of opinion, proposes to make the Irish Coursing Club the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds.</P>
    <P>We are asked, to some extent, to ensure that breeding cannot be profitable in Ireland, and if breeding is unprofitable in Ireland, of course, greyhound breeders will not be able to pay the fees to maintain the Irish Coursing Club; they will not be able to give the Irish Coursing Club the substantial revenue of £16,000 a year.  Breeding cannot be profitable in present circumstances, unless we have greyhound racing and greyhound racing tracks. Therefore, it seems to me that to be quite logical and sensible, since we are by law making provision for the better management of the tracks, making better provision for the shop window of the industry and therefore making it more profitable for people to breed greyhounds and thus create a greater source of revenue for the Irish Coursing Club, that, as a matter of course, we should get the club to contribute to the support of the board which is being set up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that that is quite a logical, quite a reasonable provision to make, and quite a reasonable obligation to impose on the Irish Coursing Club.  It is all the more reasonable when, as Deputy Briscoe has reminded the House, the Minister has bound himself to take four members of the standing committee of the club&mdash;I think it is going to be called the executive committee of the club afterwards&mdash;and put them on the Racing Board, giving them control of that board, and giving them a majority on the Racing Board.  All we have suggested here is that the Racing Board controlled by the four members of the standing committee of <Col N="939" /> the Irish Coursing Club, should have power to require the club to contribute towards the general expenses of the board, to assist it in fulfilling its functions under this section.  I think that that is entirely reasonable and at least I, as a layman do not anticipate that the court would in any way find it to be repugnant to any provision of the Constitution, certainly not any more repugnant than some of the provisions of the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister, therefore, that he should accept the principle in the amendment and enable the board to require the Irish Coursing Club to contribute towards the expenses of the board in fulfilling its functions under the Minister's own Act.</P>

      <P>On this amendment, I appeal as one with my colleagues.  I know we have to be impartial here and we must try to make this Bill a good Bill for everybody. While I have my affiliations with the Irish Coursing Club, I am here as a Deputy to do my duty to all sections of the people and I have great pleasure in supporting my colleagues in their view, because if the board is to be a success I feel it is essential that there should be greater cohesion between the Irish Coursing Club and the board. I do not see anything wrong with the amendment in asking the Irish Coursing Club to contribute towards this board.  The board will have a specific function and a very big job to do.  It was set up primarily to encourage and promote the greyhound industry within the country but I do not see why the Irish Coursing Club should not make a contribution towards the board and towards the functions the board will have to carry out to improve the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking that stand from the national point of view and on behalf of the industry generally because we cannot have two bodies running contrary to each other in trying to improve the industry.  The Irish Coursing Club has done a good job as far as it is concerned; now we are setting up a board to do a better job and setting it up for the purpose of improving the greyhound industry, helping the industry <Col N="940" /> from the breeder up, helping the various small groups to do all the various other things that are necessary to improve the industry.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how it is unconstitutional to ask the parent body that has succeeded in carrying on its business since 1916 to make a contribution towards the board.</P>

      <P>It would seem to me that the movers of this amendment are losing sight of the ultimate, or what is likely to be the ultimate result of levying in any way a contribution from the Irish Coursing Club to the board.  As I understand the position, the Irish Coursing Club, as reformed under the Bill, will ultimately have three sources of income, one of which is fees&mdash;affiliation and registration fees&mdash;its ordinary fees which will be charged to breeders and owners and racers of greyhounds. Whether in the form of affiliation fees of various clubs or in the form of individual fees for registration and marking of dogs, these are sources of income. The second source of income will be from the owners of the greyhound racetrack which is one of its subsidiaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am talking about the Irish Coursing Club.  As I understand it, the Irish Coursing Club will have, as a subsidiary, the investments &mdash;put it that way&mdash;including the <i>Sporting Press</i> and the greyhound racing-track.  The other source of income will be the fees paid by members and fees in the form of registration fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is correct.  If you give power to take from the Irish Coursing Club some annual stipend, levy, tax or contribution where is it to come from?  There is absolutely no justification for imposing a levy directly or indirectly, on the one greyhound racetrack which is run by the Irish Coursing Club and not imposing it on all the other greyhound racetracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I take it those who propose this amendment do not suggest that, and therefore, presumably, the suggestion is that the Irish Coursing Club is to pay to this board out of its annual collection of registration, affiliation and licence fees, some amount.  The board already has power to levy, either directly or indirectly on all sections of the greyhound industry, and I do not see how we could possibly justify&mdash;or what possible purpose it would serve &mdash;giving power to levy directly on the Irish Coursing Club, with the idea, presumably, that the minute the board goes to collect £1,000 a year from the Irish Coursing Club, the Irish Coursing Club&mdash;as one would expect&mdash;will increase licence, registration affiliation and stud book fees, and re-levy on the increase to the ordinary people in the industry.</P>
    <P>I must confess I cannot possibly see the point of this amendment.  The only thing that would give it any point at all is if it were an attempt to tax the greyhound racetrack run by the Irish Coursing Club when no other greyhound track can be taxed.  I do not think that is the intention.  I think that would be too unfair and I do not believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very different proposition.  I can see quite a plausible suggestion which could be made to enable the Irish Coursing Club if it felt so disposed, to assist the board or to enable the board to assist the Irish Coursing Club, but the suggestion before us is that the board can get, whether the Irish Coursing Club likes it or not, a contribution each year from the Irish Coursing Club.  I say in plain language that you are going to stick a plaster ultimately on the ordinary people concerned in the greyhound industry.  The board has already got adequate power <Col N="942" /> to raise its finances out of the industry. To give it indirect power will not add to its revenue or change the pocket out of which the money will ultimately come.  On that basis alone, I cannot understand where the proposals are in this amendment to suggest from where the money is to come. It is simple to suggest that it is to come from the Irish Coursing Club, but where is it to come from after that?  It can come either from the pockets of the ordinary owners, breeders and racers of greyhounds, or from the tracks which are owned by the Irish Coursing Club.  The first is not fair and the second is not practical.</P>

      <P>From the Deputy, I would.  The Deputy dealt with the financial implications for the Irish Coursing Club if the amendment were accepted.  Before I refer to the amendment, however, I must say I was rather amused that the Minister, on the Second Reading of this Bill, should emphasise, with a certain amount of patriotism, the fact that the birth of the Irish Coursing Club took place in 1916.  The year 1916 is a famous year because it gave birth, on the one hand, to the nation in so far as we have control over the Twenty-Six Counties and, on the other hand, it gave birth to the Irish Coursing Club.  There, therefore, seems to be a certain sanctity attached to the Irish Coursing Club because of the year of its birth.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted the Report on the Greyhound Industry and Deputy Finlay took certain little phrases out of it.  I propose to put on record the paragraph which is the father to the thought of this amendment.  Paragraph 150, on page 61 of the report, states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" />&ldquo;We have already recommended that all fees in connection with coursing and breeding should be lodged with the reorganised Irish Coursing Club and that the club should be charged with responsibility for the publication of the <i>Sporting Press</i>, and for the printing business known as &ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited.&rdquo;  Consequently the new club will have a sizeable annual income.  We have previously proposed that final appeal should lie with the control board in respect of the financial operations of the club. Apart from this, and in the belief that efficient control and equitable distribution of its finances are essential if the club is to fulfil its functions properly, we are of opinion that the newly constituted club should at the outset establish a finance committee comprising members prepared to attend regularly and including, if possible, a person well versed in accounting matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 151 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the new club will receive considerable income from breeding and coursing interests, it&mdash;rather than the control board&mdash;will be expected to undertake primary responsibility for schemes for the improvement of standards in coursing matters and also standards of breeding, e.g. by the introduction of a premium dog scheme or the establishment of a central stud to enable owners to have their bitches mated with first-class dogs at reasonable fees.  The new club might also examine the possibilities of artificial insemination in the breeding of greyhounds.  In order to finance any such projects or experiments, we believe the club should require any subsidiary company to contribute substantially to its revenues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any contribution to the club has to be substantial.  The paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We do not assume that the new club will have as large a revenue as the present Irish Coursing Club for in the first place licensing fees formerly accruing to the Irish Coursing Club will in future be paid to the control board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> I do not know where that is brought in in the Bill.  There is no licensing fee, other than the licensing of a greyhound racing track.  All the other licensing fees go to the Irish Coursing Club.  The paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We anticipate moreover that the new club may modify the present scale of registration fees.  On the other hand, we assume that its finance committee will revise the financial structure of the club to fit future needs, subject to approval of such proposals by the control board. We have no doubt that any such adjustment should provide that the relatively large revenues of the club should in future be utilised to help greyhound breeding and the sport of coursing rather than be invested elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Finlay is listening to the reference to the very poor circumstances and conditions of the Irish Coursing Club.  In paragraph 146 of the report, it is stated &ldquo;the board might at its discretion decide to make a grant towards the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the exact opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the exact opposite now because the Minister is not, in the Bill, proposing to take the fees recommended to be taken from the Irish Coursing Club towards the maintenance of the board.  That is why I read the extract.  There is no use using one part of this recommendation when the Minister adopts it and ignoring it when the Minister does not adopt it.  What I want to say is this.  It is agreed, as a result of the examination, that the Irish Coursing Club has a very considerable income and very considerable reserves as a result of this magnificent income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose Deputy Finlay's argument were correct&mdash;I am not quoting him exactly&mdash;and that it could be used to mean that such fees would be put on to the Irish Coursing Club, regulated by the board, which would reduce the club's income considerably so that they would not have very much to give away, and that as a result any other demand on them would have to be <Col N="945" /> imposed very heavily on the greyhound owners and breeders, what I say is that the board should have power to demand a contribution to the general funds of the board from the Irish Coursing Club.  It could easily do it on the basis of a percentage of the revenue.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the registration fee is.  I do not know what the fee is for other services which this club renders, but I feel that 10 per cent. of the fees should be reserved for the board's general operations, depending upon the income.  The report recommends that there shall be some contribution for certain purposes which now will be dealt with by the board and not by the club.</P>
    <P>What I read implies that, if anything, the existing fee should be reduced.  Time will show whether they will have any surplus.  They are not supposed to have a surplus for the purpose of investing it.  It would be all the same to the breeding industry if the board said that, instead of improving such and such track for £1,000, they would like to give that £1,000 to the board for its requirements.  What difference would that make to the man who paid the fee for a specific purpose?  The purpose is served and he does not ask any question afterwards as to what happens to the money, as he never did in the past. What is wrong with including it in the Bill?</P>
    <P>If Deputy Finlay happens to be correct in his forecast, the fact of having this amendment included in the Bill will not make it mandatory on the Irish Coursing Club to pay something beyond its capacity.  Obviously the board will not put the Irish Coursing Club out of business by making heavy demands on it.  It will be a most sympathetic board so far as the Irish Coursing Club is concerned.  I do not know whether the Irish Coursing Club are the papa or the mamma of the members of the board but, if they are not, they are certainly the &ldquo;kids&rdquo; of the members of the board so they are obviously going to be sympathetic: they are one and the same.</P>
    <P>We talk here of no fewer than four <Col N="946" /> members of the Irish Coursing Club being on this board.  There is no guarantee that the other two members whom the Minister has to select may not also be members of the Irish Coursing Club in some form, whether it be four or six, it makes no difference because they have the majority.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen if, in the course of time, the Irish Coursing Club continues to have an ever-increasing surplus?  Surely the board has a right to say how it will be disposed of, including what they are precluded from doing now&mdash;a contribution to the board itself towards its responsibility to the breeding industry as a whole.  I ask the Minister to be reasonable and to put it in the Bill.  It will not destroy the Irish Coursing Club.  There may be a fear, if you like, that at some time in the distant future the constitution of the board may not be exactly as it is expected to be at the moment and that, therefore, at that time, the Irish Coursing Club might find that the board is, in their opinion, a little bit too hard or heavy in the sense of their contribution to the general headquarters. I do not see that happening as the Bill is now and I certainly urge the Minister to accept this amendment because the fears that Deputy Finlay seems to express are very small little ghosts; they are not something the Irish Coursing Club need even be worried about.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment.  The case has been put with such cogency by Deputy Finlay that I do not propose to add to it except to adopt what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is right to point out to the House that there is no vision of any such mandatory contribution as that by the Racing Board to the Turf Club. There is nothing in this Bill as it stands at present to prevent the Irish Coursing Club from making any grant it wants to make to the control board from time to time.  I do not propose to ask the House to put anything into this Bill empowering the board to compel the Irish Coursing Club to make a contribution.  There is nothing in the <Col N="947" /> Bill to prevent the Irish Coursing Club from making a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>I do not know why the Minister should insist on bringing in the Irish Racing Board as a red herring on this debate.  This Bill is not founded on the Irish Racing Board. It ought to have been based on the report of the Minister's own advisory committee.  I do not think we have referred to that board.  I did not refer to that board to-night and I do not think anybody else did until Deputy Finlay dragged it into this debate.  It is because the Minister is rejecting the conclusions of his own committee and ignoring their recommendations that we are concerned to ensure that the fruits of their labours are not going to be lost to the greyhound industry, that the reforms which they recommended should be carried out will be carried out in a practical and real way.</P>
      <P>The section to which this amendment has been put down provides for the reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club.  The more one looks into the proposals of the Minister as set out in the Schedule, the more one sees that the Irish Coursing Club, though it may be reorganised in name, will certainly not be reformed in nature or character. That is what we are concerned about on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay has referred to the report of the advisory committee dealing with the finances of the reorganised Irish Coursing Club.  Let me again remind the House of what the advisory committee did recommend in that regard.  I shall quote now from page 61, paragraph 150, of the report of the advisory committee on the greyhound industry.  Let me repeat again that this is the report of the Minister's own committee.  At that paragraph, the members of the committee say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We have already recommended that all fees in connection with coursing and breeding should be lodged with the reorganised Irish Coursing Club and that the club <Col N="948" /> should be charged with responsibility for the publication of the <i>Sporting Press,</i> and for the printing business known as the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited.  Consequently the new club will have a sizeable annual income.  We have previously proposed that final appeal should lie with the control board in respect of the financial operations of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are very important recommendations there&mdash;that the club should be charged with responsibility for the publication of the <i>Sporting Press</i> and for the printing business known as &ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited&rdquo;.  So far as I can see, there is nothing in the Bill giving effect to that recommendation.  I mention that because it is relevant to the argument which I am going to make in a moment.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have previously proposed that final appeal should lie with the control board in respect of the financial operations of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to give effect to that recommendation either. Therefore, I assume that, because the Irish Coursing Club is reorganised under this Bill it is not going to have responsibility for the publication of the <i>Sporting Press</i> and for the very profitable printing business known as &ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited&rdquo;.  It is not going to have the sizeable income which the advisory committee anticipated it would have if effect were given to all the recommendations of the committee in regard to the reorganisation of the club.  I wonder if that is why the Minister is refusing to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were accepted, then naturally I think we should assume that the other steps necessary to give the club the sizeable annual income to which the advisory committee has referred would be taken. Furthermore, we assume that if these steps were taken the control board, the Greyhound Industry Board, as it is styled in the Bill, would be the final arbiter in respect of the financial operations of the club.  It was in order to ensure that the club would have a sizeable income, in order to ensure that official appeal would lie to the <Col N="949" /> control board in respect of the financial operations of the club, that we put down this amendment.  If there is one thing that is clear from the report of the advisory committee, it is that it is essential that steps should be taken to put the financial operations of this club, the Irish Coursing Club, upon a proper basis from the point of view of the public interest.  The Minister may take refuge behind what Deputy Finlay said, but the Minister should himself justify to the House his reasons for rejecting, or for failing to act upon, the recommendations contained in paragraph 150 of the report of his own advisory committee.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 151 that advisory committee goes on to point out that if the committee's proposals are accepted:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . the club will receive considerable income from coursing and breeding interests, it&mdash;rather than the control board&mdash;will be expected to undertake primary responsibility for schemes for the improvement of standards in coursing matters and also standards of breeding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody will quarrel with the suggestion that the club should undertake primary responsibility for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds.  That would seem to be quite a legitimate responsibility to impose upon it; but, if we are going by legislation to compel greyhound owners and breeders in this country to accept the authority of the Irish Coursing Club, surely we are quite entitled to empower the greyhound industry board that we are setting up under the Bill to require the club out of its sizeable income, out of its considerable income, out of all these other assets which it had and which I hope it still has, to contribute towards the expenses of the board.  That is all we are asking.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a very reasonable thing to look for and I cannot see why the Minister should wipe out, with a wave of his hand, all the very solid and substantial reasons upon which his own advisory committee based their recommendations to him. The Minister is in a unique position in relation to this Bill.  He set up the advisory committee.  That committee <Col N="950" /> was composed of men of his own choosing and men, I assume, upon whose good sense, wisdom and judgment he would in all normal transactions rely. Yet, he is rejecting their recommendations in respect of these very important matters.  We have endeavoured in this amendment to ensure that these recommendations will be accepted to the extent that the board will be in a position to supervise the financial operations of the club and when these yield a substantial surplus, as they ought to do, then the board should be able to secure a contribution out of that surplus towards its own expenses.</P>
    <P>I have said that when Deputy Finlay was speaking, he did not exactly say that the Coursing Club was an impoverished institution but one gathered that he sympathised with the straitened circumstances in which it existed and endeavoured to fulfil its obligations.  I have not got any later figures unfortunately than those which are contained in the report but I find that&mdash;I am quoting from Table VI on page 49 of the report&mdash;for the year ended 30th June, 1948, the gross income of the club was returned as £24,420.  Its gross expenditure in that year was £16,548 and it had a surplus, before deduction of income-tax, of no less than £7,872.  I grant you, for some reason or other, the picture changed in 1949 because, for the year ending 30th June in that year, the gross income amounted to only £20,600.  It had fallen by £4,420, but the gross expenditure had jumped to £20,879 and there was a deficit in that year of £279.</P>

      <P>I want to conclude by quoting the last figure available to me.  For the year ending 30th June, 1950, the gross income of the club had continued to fall.  It fell to £16,890; but apparently some person decided he was going to put the officers of the club into a hair shirt because the gross income in that year was £15,814 and there was a surplus, before deduction of income-tax, of £1,076.</P>

      <P>Is this the considerable income the club has?</P>

      <P>The considerable income ranged from £24,000 to £20,000 and then down £16,000.  But there was considerable expenditure also on the part of the club.  The Parliamentary Secretary will allow me to say, before I sit down, that it is the expenditure, as well as the income, we are after because this report has something to say about the expenditure and we are very anxious to ensure that, if this club is to be reorganised, the fruits of that reorganisation will inure to the greyhound owner and breeder in this country.  That is why, as I have said, we put down this amendment to enable the controlling body of the whole greyhound industry to ensure that the Irish Coursing Club will contribute its fair share to the development of the industry.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 29th February, 1956.</P>
