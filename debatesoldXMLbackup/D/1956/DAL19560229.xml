      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that, as a result of the increase in the price of home-produced offals, there has been a serious reduction in pig production, and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  Whilst the price of wheat offals, which is not of course officially fixed but fluctuates with world market prices, has increased during the past two years that increase has been more than offset by a fall in the price of other pig feeding-stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in pig production has resulted from a reduction in the price for pigmeat exports to Britain following the reduction during the past two <Col N="964" /> years of 31/- per cwt. deadweight in the guaranteed price for British home-produced pigs, to which the price for our pigmeat exports was very satisfactorily linked under the 1951 Pigs and Bacon Agreement.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the fifth paragraph of my reply to a question by Deputy MacBride on 9th February about agricultural exports.</P>

Does the Minister think that the pig feeders of this country can afford to have income-tax collected from them in this form by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the extent of £617,000?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's somewhat complex supplementary, I have to remind him that there is no restriction on the importation of wheaten offals and that if he can buy wheaten offals anywhere in the world cheaper than he can do so in Ireland he will have my blessing.  Further, I wish to direct the attention of the Deputy to the fact that as of January, 1954, a combination of 30 per cent. maize meal, 30 per cent. barley meal, 30 per cent. wheat offals and 10 per cent. meat and bone meal cost £33 6s. a ton.  The same combination to-day is costing £30 per ton.  So, if the Deputy will now busy himself to procure from any other source in the world wheaten offals at a cheaper price than they can be procured in Ireland at the present time, he will be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>Before any alteration could be made in the regulations governing the close season for net fishing on the Slaney, or, indeed, on any river system, a public inquiry would be necessary at which any interested person would be entitled to attend and give evidence.  Before I could agree to hold a public inquiry, I would require a statement by the interested parties showing <i>prima facie</i> that the change sought would be in the interests of the fisheries of the river as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a burning question which did not arise to-day or last year but has been in existence for years.  The fishermen on the Slaney are looking for an earlier opening. Even two weeks earlier would be a great advantage to them because from now on the fishermen up river&mdash;the rod fishermen&mdash;have all the advantages and the fishermen lower down will not be allowed to start operations until 1st April.  That is a hardship on these fishermen who are solely dependent on fishing.  Most of them are small farmers or workers.  The fishermen believe that it is the conservators who are reaping all the advantages many of whom are colonels, captains and generals&mdash; foreigners.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is straying from the subject-matter of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon:</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's further question I know that he will agree with me that our main objective must be to improve the river for all the fishermen working upon it. If you take the years 1939 to 1946, the catches of salmon by the net fishermen fluctuated between 26,000 lb. weight and 34,000 lb. weight.  Then if you take the years 1951 to 1955, you find that the catches have fluctuated between 39,000 lb. weight and 53,000 lb. weight.  If would appear from that that, as time went on, the net fishermen were doing better.  There are now 95 net licences extant in that river whereas in the earlier days the number fell as low as 52 and 53.  I think the Deputy will understand that the fact remains that I am not able to do anything; I am prohibited by statute unless I hold an inquiry.  I cannot do that unless the net fishermen and the rod fishermen or some other group of persons properly interested in the river make a <i>prima facie</i> case to me for some change in the existing system.  If any such group do that, I will have it carefully examined with a view to determining whether in all the circumstances I would be justified in holding the inquiry.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the chairman of the conservators has boats on the Slaney and that he is <Col N="969" /> also an exporter of salmon?  Is that the kind of a man who would hold the inquiry?</P>

      <P>It is for the local authority to propose the works on which the grants should be expended, subject, in the case of county roads, to the works being included in the five-year plan of county road improvements approved by the council.

      <P>In the particular case of County Donegal, the Department of Industry and Commerce have made a special grant of £18,250 available through my Department to Donegal County Council for the improvement of the public roads which will serve the new turf-fired electricity generating station at Gweedore.</P>

As regards the linking up of important centres of food and fuel production with the towns and main roads, the county councils have been advised on this matter on the lines which I have indicated in reply to the Deputy's last question.</P>

      <P>In the first paragraph of his reply the Minister said the maximum grants from the Road Fund for road works have already been notified to all the local authorities concerned. In the case of Donegal, that information is rather serious, because of the fact that the amount of grants notified is about £7,000 less than last year, notwithstanding the fact that the Road Fund has increased and that we were assured that the total amount of moneys in the Road Fund would be allocated to various counties.</P>

Does he not agree that <Col N="982" /> a number of proposals are submitted to the Local Government Department by the local authority, but the final selection is made by the Department and that it is not, therefore, true to state that the council has the last word in selecting them?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>On Wednesday last, the following remarks were made by Deputies in regard to rulings of the Chair on amendments tabled for the Committee Stage of the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1955:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...We bow to the ruling of the Chair.  We accept majority rule, where it comes through the individual holding the high office of Ceann Comhairle.  But even at this stage we have every reason to say that we are totally dissatisfied with some of the decisions...&rdquo;&mdash;[Deputy Desmond, column 718.]</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... But it is the ones which have been overlooked, the glaring injustices which have not been covered by this Bill that we are worried about, the glaring injustices which have remained there because of the fact that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, ruled out of order amendments which would have brought about the desired effect ...&rdquo;&mdash;[Deputy James Tully, columns 720-1.]</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...It was rather discouraging that some of our main amendments were ruled out on a technicality, and if I may suggest, in one or two particular cases, a rather far-fetched technicality...&rdquo;&mdash;[Deputy Casey, column 723.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As these statements might give rise to the opinion that the Chair has a discretion in such cases, I desire to make the position of the Chair in the matter quite clear.  Each of the amendments in question would have the effect of imposing a charge on State funds by increasing the amount of Exchequer re-coupment <Col N="984" /> to be paid to local authorities. Such being the case, I had no option but to regard them as out of order under the provisions of Standing Order No. 115, and each Deputy concerned was so informed by letter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 29 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
      <P>I move the deletion of those words because they do not, in fact, add anything to the force of the Bill.  They, in fact, found their way into the Bill because of a desire in the first instance of adopting another approach to the problem.  In the examination of the matter, the deletion of these words was omitted before the circulation of the Bill on the Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply to the temporary use of a vehicle hired by the registered owner of a similar vehicle, in substitution for his own vehicle, for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the carriage of his own goods,</P>
      <P>(b)  the delivery to his customers of merchandise normally supplied by him in the course of his trade or business, or</P>
      <P>(c)  the delivery to and collection from customers of merchandise which is to be or has been repaired, cleaned, laundered or dyed by him in the normal course of his trade or business,</P>
      <P>provided that his own vehicle is not capable of being used for such purposes solely because of the need for repair or overhaul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Stage, the question was raised by Deputies on both sides of the House as to the position of a licensed haulier who felt it necessary to send a vehicle into a garage for repairs, or some type of overhauling, or where the vehicle had been damaged in the course of a road accident and was no longer available for use.  I pointed out then that the Supreme Court decision in this matter had not altered the law; <Col N="986" /> that, in fact, the law, as it stood from 1933, does not, in fact, permit the substitution of a usable vehicle for a non-usable vehicle where any vehicle is unusable and is under repairs.  It has been possible to surmount the technical rigidity by the fact that the Garda authorities always understood that substitution was necessary in these cases where a valid explanation was forthcoming. On the Second Stage of the discussion, I took a somewhat similar view myself, but it was pointed out that a legal difficulty might be raised somewhere throughout the country that the substitution of one vehicle, which was undergoing repairs, by another was not in accordance with the law, and, as we were tidying up the defects in the law revealed in the 1933 Act, I thought we might take advantage of the occasion to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>This amendment, therefore, has been produced for the purpose of making it possible to substitute one vehicle for another, in the circumstances set out in the amendment, which meets the viewpoint expressed on both sides of the House on the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met the viewpoint put forward very fairly.  I also think it is true to say that it is not possible to cover every single contingency in which it might be necessary to obtain the use of another vehicle temporarily. While I think the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the point of view expressed here, I hope the Guards will interpret this section in the same spirit as they interpreted the Act originally.  I think the Minister will understand what I am driving at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment covers a person who hires another vehicle while his own is incapable of being used, solely because of the need of repair or overhaul.  Of course, there will be other instances&mdash;I do not expect the Minister to cover them all&mdash;when the necessity to hire a substitute vehicle will occur.  One instance springs to my mind immediately. If an owner's vehicle is stolen and remains stolen for a week, a fortnight or a month, I should imagine that no one would have the slightest possible objection to his hiring one in the meanwhile.  I agree that the <Col N="987" /> Minister cannot cover all these things, but I hope the Guards will view the Act in the same way as previously.</P>

      <P>What is the position about the suggestion to try to meet the position of the agricultural community in regard to the change referred to on the Second Reading which has taken place in the present circumstances of transport by farmers?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that the discussion on that occasion was pretty wide of the target, but, in reply to the questions which were then raised, I indicated that I thought the matter was worthy of examination within the limited scope raised by some Deputies, but that it would cause all kinds of complications, if we were contemplating any such inroads on the 1933 Act as to permit people to carry merchandise in rural areas almost promiscuously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the matter was discussed on the Second Stage, I have given a direction that it should be examined in the light of the fact that, since the 1933 Act was passed, the mode of transport, mainly the horse-drawn vehicle, had in many areas been substantially reduced in number; that the tendency was not to use that method of transport now or to an increasing extent in the future, but rather to a lesser extent.  Therefore, I asked that the matter be examined and, when the examination is complete, I will be glad to indicate to the House, in answer to a parliamentary <Col N="988" /> question, what my views on the matter are.  Meantime, I note that the Opposition have put down an amendment asking the House to consider that aspect of the matter.  However, either through discussion in the House or as a result of the direction I have given, the matter can be examined, and in any case we will have an opportunity of reporting in due course.</P>

    <Title>Prisons Bill, 1956&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the temporary detention of prisoners in lock-ups provided in Garda stations or in any other places, being places designated for the purpose by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>There are, at the present time, five prisons open for the reception of prisoners, namely, those at Dublin, Portlaoise, Limerick, Cork and Sligo. For the past ten years the prison population has been falling steadily.  In 1946 the daily average number in custody was 683, whereas last year it was only 396.  There is accommodation in the five prisons for some 1,520 prisoners and there is, therefore, much more accommodation than is needed.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is proposed to close the prisons at Cork and Sligo in which the daily average number of prisoners in custody last year was no more than 15 and eight respectively.  Nor was this a freak year, as the daily averages have been low in these two prisons for several years.  Cork prison will be closed on the 1st April and Sligo prison a little later.  There will then be left in the other prisons sufficient accommodation for more than 1,200 prisoners, which is about three times the existing requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the closing of the two prisons, the prisoners serving sentences in Cork and Sligo will be transferred to Limerick and to Mountjoy, and no problem arises in connection with them.  However, provision has now to be made for the detention of unconvicted and unsentenced prisoners while their cases are being tried in courts <Col N="989" /> situated in areas that have hitherto been served by the prisons at Cork and Sligo, and also for the detention of convicted and sentenced prisoners pending removal to prison, since it will be no longer feasible in some cases, because of the distance to be travelled, to convey all such prisoners to a prison without spending a night somewhere en route.</P>
    <P>Up to the present, Cork and Sligo prisons have been available for the detention of prisoners awaiting trial and of remand prisoners but, with the closing of these two prisons, this will cease to be the case.  Unconvicted and unsentenced prisoners can be temporarily detained in Garda Síochána stations under the law as it stands, but a convicted prisoner must be taken straight to prison.  When Sligo prison is closed, such a requirement would be highly inconvenient, say, in a case being tried in Donegal which was not disposed of until a late hour in the evening, since the nearest prison will then be situated in Dublin.  For this reason there is included in the Bill a provision to authorise the detention of prisoners in lock-ups pending their removal to prison for a period up to 48 hours.  It is necessary to authorise detention not merely in Garda stations but in such lock-ups elsewhere as may be designated by the Minister for Justice because the requisite accommodation may not always be available in a Garda station.  It is, in fact, the intention to establish in Sligo a lockup, separate from the Garda station, by suitable conversion of two of the existing prison cottages.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will be satisfied as to the necessity for the Bill and I would ask it to give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that something has to be done on the lines suggested here.  All I suggest is that proper accommodation should be available, because as far as I know there is no proper accommodation for prisoners in the Garda stations.  I do not know very much about Garda stations, but I think that as a rule they have not got very much accommodation.  I understand from what the Minister has said that <Col N="990" /> in Sligo, anyway, they are making separate accommodation available. That is an important point.  This is the only point I want to make.  Otherwise the Bill is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham:</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that accommodation must be found in the Garda barracks if this Bill comes into effect, I would suggest that a problem arises.  We may have prisoners awaiting trial, or convicted prisoners, and if they have to be sent, say, from County Donegal to Dublin, we may have them thrown into places in which the barracks are entirely unsuitable for prisoners to spend a night or two. Another thing is that in many of our Garda barracks it may not be possible to have 24 hours' supervision.  I do not mean supervision exactly, but we have no guarantee that the wants of the prisoners, in the way of food, water and so on, will be properly attended to.  This is not something that the Gardaí have been accustomed to, and the danger is that in the case of a county like Donegal, where a prisoner must be prepared for a journey to Dublin, the conditions before starting on that journey may not be good if he has to spend a night, or two nights, or a day and a night, thrown into some back room in a barracks with very little attention by way of food and drink or bed accommodation.  That is something which is going to raise many headaches for the Minister and for the Garda authorities themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I agree with Deputy Boland on the matter of the unsuitability of some of the Garda stations to hold prisoners.  I feel, too, that apart from the amenities that might be provided some of these buildings might not be suitable at all to hold those prisoners.  Some of them may at some time or other have pretty tough guys, so to speak, in them, and some of those Garda stations that I know, throughout the length and breadth of the county, are made of corrugated iron and it would not be hard at all for prisoners to escape. That point should not be lost sight of. There is also another point which I would like the Minister to clear up.  I would like to know what is to be done <Col N="991" /> for the governors, the wardens and other members of the staffs?  Are they going to be retained in the service?  It would be very wrong if through this Bill they lost their employment, and I would ask the Minister to consider such people sympathetically.</P>
      <P>Going through the estimates of Mayo County Council recently, I found items there concerning the conveyance of prisoners for which the local authority was responsible.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position there.  Does the passing of this Bill mean that the local authority is going to have to bear further increased charges?  That is something that is arousing anxiety in certain quarters, and I would like the Minister to clear up that point as well.  If, for instance, in County Mayo we have to send our prisoners to Mountjoy I would like the Minister to tell us if that is going to mean a further burden on the ratepaying public?</P>

      <P>I think the difficulties referred to can be solved easily enough.  The Board of Works can attend to these matters.  I do think this Bill is necessary, and the reason is one that should give satisfaction to all of us.  It is a remarkable indication of our society, and a very good answer to those at home and abroad who have attempted to decry us.  I would ask the Minister, in replying, to indicate whether he has any plan or proposal in regard to the very fine prison building in Cork, which I am glad to see will not be any longer required for the purpose for which it was originally designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Barry I would like to know what the intention of the Minister is with regard to Cork jail, which has a very historic and sentimental interest for the people of Cork, especially any of those who were engaged in the fight for freedom. As the Minister, I am sure, is aware, the graves of many men were within the precincts of the prison until a few years ago, when portion of the jail was transferred to the university college authorities and they took over the care of those graves and the memorial <Col N="992" /> which is over them.  I feel that the whole jail should be handed over to the university authorities, because I believe that the whole of that jail is sacred to those who were executed and buried there and those who were executed in Cork Military Barracks and transferred and buried there.</P>
      <P>There are men who died on hunger-strike in that prison in 1920.  On the outside of the walls of the jail there is a memorial plaque to them.  As the graves of those who were executed were handed over to the university, I think it would be right to give charge of the complete block to the university authorities.  In my view, they would make very good use of it and respect it and respect those who were detained in that prison in those days.  I appeal very strongly to the Minister to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Hara, I am anxious to know how the warders and attendants stand in regard to their employment.  In connection with Cork jail, the problem we have in mind is the transportation of prisoners, whether convicted or on remand, from remote parts of the country, such as West and East Cork, as far as Limerick.  The time and expense that would be involved might be such as to make it economic to keep Cork jail open.  At the same time, we are satisfied with the Minister's statement that the expense of keeping that jail open does not warrant such a step.  It is very satisfactory indeed to find that we have reached a stage in our Irish history where we can close jails.  That is an advantage not alone to the State but to everyone concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the handing over of Cork jail, perhaps Deputy Barry did not know it but I am sure Deputy McGrath was aware that some of us on the Cork County Council put down a motion requesting the Government to hand it over.  As far as we are concerned, I am glad to say that the university will not get it.  I believe I am right in my view that, under the law, they will have to hand it over to the Cork County Council.  Surely nobody will suggest that the members of the Cork County Council and the staff <Col N="993" /> concerned would not have as much regard and respect for the memory of the men executed in that jail and for the men whose memory is commemorated on the plaque on the outside walls of the prison as the staff of any university?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork County Council will find a suitable use for it. If some authorities in Cork such, for instance, as the university, want it, we may sell it to them.  In that way, we would make money which, in turn, could be devoted towards keeping down the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen:</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which struck me in connection with the Minister's opening statement was that he did not talk about decentralising the prison, so far as Dublin is concerned.  I am surprised that Corkmen have allowed this opportunity to pass and have not claimed it for Cork.  It is not too late even yet.  Instead of closing Cork jail, would it not be as well to close Mountjoy?</P>
      <P>I want to deal with an aspect of this Bill which was mentioned by Deputy O'Hara.  I hope the Minister and his advisers are satisfied that there is suitable accommodation for human beings in some of the places where it is proposed to hold prisoners overnight. From what we know and from what we have seen, it is evident that some of these places are nothing but black holes where you would put a drunken person for a few hours until he got sober.  Such places are unfit for human habitation.  I am surprised that the Minister is satisfied that human beings can decently be accommodated in such places, even though they are prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these places down the country are black holes of Calcutta.  I think the House should not lightly give the Minister authority in this matter. Instead of travelling, say, a long distance in County Donegal at night and keeping Gardaí out of their beds, a prisoner on remand or a convicted prisoner can be put in a black hole in some part of the county.  We all know that there is very little respect for convicted prisoners but a good standard <Col N="994" /> is maintained in the prisons to which they are finally committed.  I suggest that the power of detention of prisoners overnight in such places is open to abuse&mdash;much more so now because it is left to the discretion of the local Gardaí down the country attached to any court to determine whether or not they will make a long journey late at night.  Under this Bill, they will have the right to throw a prisoner anywhere they like for the night.  I doubt very much that Dáil Éireann should approve of that without assurances from the Minister that a proper standard for human beings will be maintained so that, even though they may be convicted prisoners, they will not be detained overnight in any unsuitable place.</P>
    <P>Although this concerns a jail, perhaps the Minister would reconsider the question of decentralising industry and of taking something out of Dublin and establishing it elsewhere, thus reducing the necessity to take people from all parts of the country to Dublin City.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to house female prisoners in the local black hole?  That is a serious question and perhaps the Minister would answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Deputy Cunningham, who raised a point about proper food, and so forth, for prisoners who may be on remand that it will be there for them.  They will be in the charge of senior officers.</P>
      <P>There was accommodation in Sligo for warders and their families.  It must be obvious that, as the warders have been residing there for years, the two will now be converted into one and there will be better facilities than before and proper sanitary arrangements for the men.</P>
      <P>On the subject of staff, I may say that we have made all arrangements for the staff, in consultation with the officials of my Department.  No one will be victimised in any way and work will be found for those who have decided that they would like to be on duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we must all feel very pleased at the fact that we have now reached <Col N="995" /> a stage in our history where we are in a position to close up some jails.  It speaks well for the country.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about Garda stations.  If prisoners are left in Garda stations, it will be for only a few hours.  Take, for instance, a prisoner on remand whose case has not been decided upon by the District Court or whose case will not be decided until the following day.  Then again, his sentence may not be decided until late in the day.  Is it not only reasonable that, to cover such circumstances, and also to cover the possibility of really bad weather such as snow and frost and circumstances where transport would not be available, we should provide for the retention of a prisoner on remand for 48 hours?</P>
    <P>It is not usual to find Cork Deputies divided on any matter relating to Cork. However, so far as Cork jail is concerned, one Deputy wants it for one purpose and another Deputy wants it for another purpose.  Whatever decision will ultimately be arrived at will, I need hardly say, be in the best interests of the Cork people.  I agree with Deputy Desmond inasmuch as I am certain that whoever will become the owners of the jail will respect the memory of the men who were on hunger strike there and who were executed there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have mentioned the inconvenience that may be caused.  It is in order to meet that inconvenience that we have decided on this 48-hour period; prisoners on remand could discuss during that interval any matters <Col N="996" /> they might wish to discuss with solicitor or counsel, or meet relatives should they wish to do so.  As far as we are concerned, we shall do everything possible to create as little inconvenience as we can.  I assure the Deputies who have spoken that their views will be considered very carefully.  Due weight will be given to their opinions. As far as the staff are concerned, I can assure Deputies that the staff are quite satisfied with the arrangements made on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill and a memorandum explaining its provisions have been in the hands of Deputies since 14th December.  On the Second Reading I propose to give, fairly briefly, the broad general outlines of what the Bill proposes to do, why particular principles are followed &mdash;some of which are at variance with the principles followed in framing the Act of 1935&mdash;and why the Government feel that the ends sought can best be achieved in the framework of the Bill before you.</P>
      <P>First and foremost I feel that I should make a passing reference to the constitutional necessity to enact legislation dealing with the acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship.</P>
      <P>Article 9.1.2º of the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the task of framing legislation to give effect to the constitutional provision would have been undertaken more immediately following the coming into operation of the <Col N="997" /> Constitution but for the war, and its aftermath, and all the attendant problems. As it is, the proposals in the Bill before the House have been under the consideration of Government for some considerable time.  In some respects there was very little to choose between alternative proposals before the Government but it was finally decided to put forward the proposals in the Bill.  All these matters will, of course, be brought to the notice of the House in Committee.  The Bill is essentially a Bill to be examined section by section, and line by line.  The Government feel that examination of the Bill should not be hurried and that Deputies should take all the time that is required for a painstaking examination of its provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in five Parts.  Part I has the usual clauses relating to definitions, regulations and provisions for expenses, but the last section in this Part-Section 5&mdash;provides for the repeal of the Acts of 1935 and 1937 and at the same time it provides that all citizenships existing at the time that this Bill is being enacted into law will be preserved.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with the ways in which Irish citizenship may be established or acquired&mdash;established by birth in Ireland and by descent through the blood, with formalities to be complied with in certain eventualities; acquired, by alien women on marriage to Irish citizens, by posthumous children, by foundlings, by adopted children, by the grant of citizenship as a token of honour and by birth in an Irish ship or aircraft.</P>
    <P>Section 6&mdash;the section dealing with the citizenship of living persons born in Ireland or of an Irish father or mother&mdash;is, of course, the principal section of the Bill.  In the Government's consideration of how Irish citizenship should be established, for the future, we had to go back and examine the provisions under which citizenship had been established hitherto, that is, under Article 3 of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann (1922) and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1935, as amended by the Act of 1937.  Article 3 established citizenship at a particular point of <Col N="998" /> time, that is on the date of establishment of the new State&mdash;6th December, 1922; it provided for citizenship of both males and females domiciled on that date in Ireland who had been born in Ireland or whose father or mother had been born in Ireland or who had been ordinarily resident in Ireland for not less than 7 years; it also provided that &ldquo;the conditions governing the future acquisition and termination of citizenship of Saorstát Éireann shall be determined by law.&rdquo;  Now, in the event, the future &ldquo;acquisition and termination of citizenship&rdquo; provided for by Article 3 turned out to be the Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1935 (as amended by the Act of 1937).</P>
    <P>In framing the 1935 Act the then Government provided that in the case of persons born after 6th December, 1922, citizenship might be established by descent from the father; secondly, by birth in the Twenty-Six Counties; and, thirdly, by registration within two years of birth in the case of a person born outside the Twenty-Six Counties on or after the passing of the Act (10th April, 1935) of a father born outside the Twenty-Six Counties on or after 6th December, 1922.  There was no provision for citizenship by descent from the mother&mdash;as Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution seemed to foreshadow&mdash;and there was no provision recognising birth in the Six Counties as birth in portion of the national territory.</P>
    <P>Reading the debates (Volume 54) on the early stages of the Bill which, later, was enacted into law as the Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1935, it is apparent that some provisions in the Bill were framed with a view to avoiding the creation of dual or multiple citizenship.  This attitude was responsible, no doubt, for the rejection of suggestions that the Bill should provide for citizenship by descent from the mother as well as from the father and that alien wives should have a right to the citizenship of their Irish husbands.</P>
    <P>The experience of this and other countries in the last 25 years goes to show that dual or multiple citizenship creates few real problems and that such problems as there are <Col N="999" /> are solved reasonably satisfactorily by the rule enunciated by the Hague Convention on Conflict of Nationality Laws, of 1930, which lays down that a State in dealing with one of its nationals is entitled to disregard the fact that he also possesses the nationality of another State but cannot extend diplomatic protection to such a national against the other State of which he is a national.  In other words, an Irish citizen within the jurisdiction can be dealt with without regard to any other citizenship he may have but when an Irish citizen is resident in another country of which he is also a citizen he cannot call on the Irish diplomatic mission or consular office in that country for protection.</P>
    <P>Dual nationality cannot be avoided unless all countries were to frame their nationality legislation on identical lines.  As it is, most countries, including our own, recognise the principles of nationality both by birth and by blood.  Whatever the arguments may be against the concept of multiple citizenship this Government, at any rate, are determined that our nationality law should not be framed to exclude persons born in any portion of the national territory or persons who are of Irish stock.  We are making provision, accordingly, and we are recognising in our nationality law, the principle of derivation of citizenship from both the father and mother. While derivation of citizenship from the mother is new to our law it features, of course, in the nationality laws of many countries&mdash;countries such as France and Turkey provide for derivation from the mother in full just as this Bill does; the United States of America does with a residence qualification; Belgium, Portugal, Argentina etc., with opting qualification and so on.</P>
    <P>Under our existing citizenship law, the great majority of persons born in the Six Counties are Irish citizens. They are Article 3 citizens, or the children of Irish fathers, or citizens by registration.  But there are new generations growing up: the children born of Irish mothers and children born in the Six Counties of fathers born since <Col N="1000" /> 1922 in the Six Counties.  These generations are of Irish stock and this Bill provides for their Irish citizenship without the fulfilment of any artificial requirements on their part such as registration.  Citizenship is, in our opinion, their birthright.</P>
    <P>Before I leave Section 6, on which I have spoken just now as it affects the North, I should mention, of course, that the section will determine, without any shilly-shallying, the Irish citizenship of all those persons throughout the world who were born, before the establishment of the State, in Ireland or of a father or mother born in Ireland and who were not domiciled here on 6th December, 1922.  Under existing law, such persons did not have Irish citizenship unless they took up permanent residence in the Twenty-Six Counties or, if permanently living abroad and not naturalised citizens of any other country, registered their names in the registers of nationals kept for that purpose.  Under this Bill, they are Irish citizens without fulfilling formalities of any kind.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe in Section 7 that we give special recognition to the fact of birth in the Six Counties. As I have explained earlier&mdash;and this has been set out in some detail in the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated when the Bill was being introduced&mdash;the vast majority of those in the Six Counties who, of course, are of Irish stock will have Irish nationality and citizenship when this Bill is enacted into law.  The great majority who are Irish citizens under existing law will be turned into a still vaster majority but there will still remain a limited category born in the Six Counties since 1922 who are of entirely alien parentage without any racial ties, and for these, in recognition of their birth alone in that portion of the national territory which is for the time being outside our jurisdiction, we provide that on making a voluntary declaration their Irish citizenship operates from the date of their birth and is the citizenship of their children.  Section 7 also provides for citizenship by registration in the case of persons born outside Ireland of parents who are Irish <Col N="1001" /> citizens born outside Ireland.  This is somewhat similar to the provisions of existing law, but where our 1935 Act requires registration in the case of a person born outside the Twenty-Six Counties of an Irish father born outside the Twenty-Six Counties, this Bill requires registration only in the case of a person born outside the 32 Counties of either an Irish father or an Irish mother born outside the 32 Counties.  A result of this new provision is that birth in the national territory of the Six Counties is recognised, just as in the Twenty-Six Counties, as enabling Irish citizenship to be transmitted from either the father or mother to the children in a never ending chain, without any formality of registration.</P>
    <P>Turning to Section 8 which deals with citizenship in its relationship to marriage, the House will observe that we are providing that an alien woman on marriage to an Irish citizen will have a right to citizenship on making a declaration accepting citizenship.  This is a departure from the provisions of existing law under which such citizenship can only be acquired by process of naturalisation and by permission of the Minister for Justice.  To be naturalised, the alien wife of an Irish citizen must be residing in the State and <i>bona fide</i> intend to be resident here. Furthermore, such citizenship may be terminated on revocation of the certificate of naturalisation at the absolute discretion of the Minister for Justice. The provisions of the Act of 1935 are, we feel, out of harmony with the Constitution which, in Article 41, has concern for the institution of marriage upon which the family is founded. There are many ways in which citizenship in its relation to marriage might be treated.  We feel that we are adopting a procedure which implements the constitutional concern for the family unit and, moreover, is of substantial convenience to the parties concerned. We do not go so far as to provide for the automatic grant of citizenship to an alien woman on marriage to an Irish citizen as that might not necessarily be in the interests of the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>No doubt, we will go into the marriage clause fairly closely on the <Col N="1002" /> Committee Stage when we come to discuss Sections 8, 20 and 23.  And it will suffice to mention here, I think, that marriage of an Irish citizen to an alien does not affect the Irish citizenship; on the other hand, marriage of an alien woman to an Irish citizen by birth or blood enables her to voluntarily acquire Irish citizenship while a male alien on marriage to an Irish citizen by birth or blood may get citizenship by process of naturalisation in which he may be exempted from complying with the conditions which apply generally to applicants for certificates of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of Part II of the Bill are concerned with minor matters which scarcely call for comment just now, save, perhaps, Section 12 which provides for the grant of citizenship as a token of honour; the grant of a certificate of citizenship by the President&mdash;which, under Article 13 of the Constitution, is exercisable only on the advice of Government&mdash;is intended to attach a special solemnity and dignity to such a grant.  The certificate will not be revocable as was the corresponding certificate of naturalisation issued under the 1935 Act by the Minister for Justice on the direction of Government.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the acquisition of citizenship by process of naturalisation and the circumstances under which a certificate of naturalisation may be revoked.</P>
    <P>As under the 1935 Act, the Minister has an absolute discretion to refuse a certificate of naturalisation.  There are certain conditions as to character, residence, etc., precedent to the grant of a certificate and these differ only in minor respects from the requirements under existing law.  A new provision is that the applicant will require to make in open court before a district justice a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.  In special circumstances which are enumerated in Section 16, the Minister may dispense with the conditions of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>It is in the section dealing with revocation of certificates of naturalisation that the Bill differs radically from the provisions of existing law.  In the <Col N="1003" /> Act of 1935, the Minister has an absolute discretion to revoke any certificate of naturalisation and he is obliged to revoke in stated circumstances. Under the provisions of this Bill, revocation of a certificate of naturalisation may only be effected for stated reasons and after the person concerned has been given an opportunity of having the facts of his case reported on to the Minister for Justice by a committee with a chairman of judicial experience.  We feel that persons who acquire Irish citizenship by process of naturalisation should have a feeling of security in their possession of that citizenship.  They should be placed in a position of knowing, when they are acquiring Irish citizenship, that it can only be taken away from them for stated reasons and that before their certificate of naturalisation as an Irish citizen is revoked they can have the reason for revocation examined into and reported on to the Minister for Justice by a body, independent of his Department with a chairman of judicial experience.  This line of approach will, I feel, commend itself to the House.</P>
    <P>Before passing away from the naturalisation provisions, I feel that I should draw Deputies' attention to the fact that we do not propose to re-enact the provision in the 1935 Act which provides for revocation of a certificate when the holder has been convicted of a serious criminal offence.  We feel that once a person has been admitted to Irish citizenship, he should be subject to the law generally applying to citizens, and no more: this view of the matter has been reached after careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with loss of citizenship. In Section 19, we are providing that an Irish citizen ordinarily resident outside the Twenty-Six Counties, who is or is about to become a citizen of another country, may renounce his Irish citizenship by making a declaration of alienage in a prescribed manner. We are leaving it, as far as our laws are concerned, at the option of the Irish citizen living abroad who has a second citizenship, to retain or discard his Irish citizenship.  The laws of his <Col N="1004" /> country of residence may require an individual allegiance.  We do not think it right that we should insist on regarding as of Irish citizenship a person living abroad who is of, or is about to acquire, another citizenship and wishes to have only that citizenship.  There is no provision for renunciation of citizenship in the Act of 1935.  On the other hand, while there is a provision in the Act of 1935 that Irish citizenship is lost on the voluntary acquisition of a second citizenship, this Bill does not so provide.</P>
    <P>Here, again, is an acceptance of the idea of multiple citizenship which I mentioned already in discussing Part II of the Bill.  We recognise that there may be cogent arguments for following the precedent of our existing law, but, on balance, we feel that our law should not deprive of Irish citizenship a person who goes abroad and acquires another citizenship.  Ireland is a mother country, with large overseas populations, many of whom were forced to emigrate and to become citizens of another country for economic reasons, but who, nevertheless, have ties of affection and racial pride with the home land.  Why should we seek nationally to disown our own flesh and blood, if the laws of their adopted country permit the retention of the citizenship of their birth and heritage?</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of Part IV do not call for particular comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>Part V is, in general, a repetition of provisions in the 1935 Act: it deals with the grant of citizenship rights and privileges to citizens of other countries on a basis of reciprocity, the establishment of a registry of births abroad, and the grant of certificates of nationality which will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the citizenship of the holder.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go further into the Bill just now.  The memorandum circulated with the Bill gives, in detail, an explanation of the provisions.  My fear is that Deputies may be confused by the wealth of detail in the memorandum and that in seeking to give an accurate, comprehensive explanation of the provisions of the Bill, the memorandum may have lost clarity, in addition to brevity, at some points.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> I am confident that the principles of the Bill will receive general support and that any differences of detail will be ironed out in later stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad indeed that the Coalition Government are introducing this Bill.  It derives, as the Minister said, from the fact that, in the Constitution which was passed by the Irish people, in spite of certain very violent opposition at that time, Article 9.1.2º reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As far as I can see from the Bill and from the explanation given in the White Paper which accompanied the Bill when issued it differs in no great measure from the existing citizenship law, but it does bring it up to date. It does get rid of the out-of-date phrases applying to the &ldquo;Free State&rdquo; which were in the 1935 Act, and it brings the terms of our law dealing with citizenship into line with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There are only one or two points I would like to raise at this stage.  I agree with the Minister that the Bill can be more properly discussed in detail on the Committee Stage.  However, I do not think that Section 7 is as clear as it might be although the Bill as a whole is very well drafted, much more simply than the previous legislation.  Section 7 is difficult to read and indeed I have heard of two opinions being expressed by people who should be able to judge as to the effect.  It would be as well between now and the Committee Stage if the Minister and his officials were to go into Section 7 and see whether the idea that has been explained by the Minister could not be set out in clearer language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Section 16, the Minister may grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation although certain of the conditions for naturalisation have not been complied with.  Paragraph (a) says: &ldquo;Where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.&rdquo; Neither in the 1935 Act <Col N="1006" /> nor in this Bill is that phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; defined.  I am just wondering whether it is necessary to have it in the legislation of to-day.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (2) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An Irish citizen may not renounce Irish citizenship under this section during a time of war as defined in Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Article is very wide and covers not only a time when the State is actually involved in war but also covers a time like the last emergency during the war when we had to take certain steps to protect ourselves, although we were not actually engaged in war.  In order that the Government might be empowered to take those steps, we had to pass a resolution of emergency which has not yet been revoked.  While it might be right to deny a citizen the right of renouncing Irish citizenship during a time when the State was actually involved in war, it is rather hard to hold him to that in a period like this last ten years, although we still hold on to the declaration of emergency.  It might be better if, on the Committee Stage, we amended that section to give power to the Minister to agree to the renunciation of Irish citizenship by a person when the State is not actually involved in war.</P>
    <P>Section 23, as the Minister pointed out, amends the section which deals with this matter in the 1935 Act.  The Act of 1935 did give the right to a person who married an alien to hold on to his Irish citizenship if he made a declaration to that effect within a certain time.  However, I suppose there is something to be said for letting an Irish citizen who marries an alien retain his or her citizenship and if, in the working out over the years the Departments of Justice and External Affairs did not see any difficulty arising out of that situation, I suppose it is right to legislate in this particular way and to depart from the 1935 Act.</P>
    <P>Those are all the points I wish to raise at this stage.  This Bill is drafted in a clear and fairly easily understood way with the exception of Section 7 which, I think, is very difficult and perhaps it might be amended on the Committee Stage.  I am glad, as I <Col N="1007" /> said at the outset, that the Minister has introduced this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief in my contribution to this discussion.  Like Deputy Aiken I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  I have read the Bill and the White Paper issued by the Minister and I find myself in the unusual position of agreeing once more with Deputy Aiken.  The impression the preparation of the Bill and the White Paper made on my mind was similar to that made on his mind.  The production and presentation of the Bill show that a very thorough examination of the position has been undertaken and that great care has been taken in its drafting and presentation.  It is only right to say that because, whether we agree or disagree with the principles behind particular Bills, many of us often have the greatest difficulty in understanding what is written into the Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken has referred to Section 7 of the present measure.  The House should extend a particularly hearty welcome to this section.  As I see it, this section preserves the position in relation to people at present living in Northern Ireland who under earlier legislation had already been considered as natural-born Irish citizens.  It does more than that.  It also provides for many others who, because of the fact that they were not born at the time the provisions of the 1935 Act became operative&mdash;that is, that they were not born prior to the 6th December, I think it was, 1922&mdash; find themselves in the position that they are not under our legislation considered as Irish citizens.  When this Bill is passed and when Section 7 comes into operation, they can, without any shadow of doubt, acquire Irish citizenship by taking the necessary steps.  It seems to me that very many of the nationalists, particularly the younger nationalists, in the North of Ireland will welcome the manner in which their position is being protected by Section 7 of this Bill.  Deputy Aiken made the point that the position might be clarified to a greater extent than it is, but, as far as the existence of Section 7 in the Bill is concerned, I <Col N="1008" /> welcome it and I think every member of the House will welcome it.  I think it will also receive a very hearty welcome from Irish nationalists in the North.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the principal differences between this Bill and the earlier legislation, and has pointed out that many aspects of the Bill will require to be dealt with in a more detailed way in Committee.  I agree with him there.  There are some major alterations of earlier Acts.  I think the principal one, so far as acquisition of citizenship goes, is that citizenship by descent may be acquired now either through the father or the mother, whereas, under the 1935 Act, citizenship by descent could be acquired only through the father.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the introduction of this Bill.  I agree with the Minister that there are many sections of the Bill that might be fruitfully discussed in a more detailed way on Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Aiken in welcoming the introduction of the Bill, particularly Section 7, which, or something similar to which, could have been included in earlier Acts.</P>
      <P>Whilst welcoming the Bill, I think, in places, there is looseness in drafting which should be cured before the House passes the Bill.  I would refer the Minister to Section 16 (a) and subsequent sub-sections.  Section 16 (a) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, if he thinks fit, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in the following cases, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with:</P>
      <P>(a) where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (b) also mentions &ldquo;where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.&rdquo;  We should in some way try to define &ldquo;Irish associations.&rdquo; There is nothing in the definition section about it, and I think it is a bit wide and that the House should not allow the Bill to become law without in some way defining for the Legislature and for the State what <Col N="1009" />&ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; really means.  It could lead to mischiefs in future.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to Section 15 (f), which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application, if satisfied that the applicant complies with the following conditions (in this Act referred to as conditions for naturalisation):</P>
    <P>(f) he has made, either before a justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that that portion of the sub-section which says: &ldquo;or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows&rdquo; should be allowed to pass this House.  I do not think the Legislature should give <i>carte blanche</i> to Ministers in matters of that nature, should give Ministers too wide powers in a serious matter.  I suggest that that portion of Section 15 (f) could usefully be deleted before the Bill passes the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Higgins, I welcome the fact that a person can acquire Irish citizenship by reason of the citizenship of his mother.  The Constitution reserves a very special place for woman and it is only logical that we, in the spirit of the Constitution, should accord to mothers, as well as fathers, the compliment that the Bill proposes to accord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay:</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this Bill must, of necessity, be brief.  I appreciate, having examined the Bill and having had the benefit of the speech made by the Minister, that it is a Bill which is a compliment to the Minister's Department and to his draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little that can be said about this Bill on Second Reading that could not be very properly and probably more effectively, and more carefully dealt with in Committee.  It is reasonable to say that this is essentially a Bill for legal consideration <Col N="1010" /> and a Bill in which members of the legal profession on all sides of the House should take a keen interest. Remembering their own experience in dealing with the question of citizenship, as it arises from time to time in the course of their professional duties, it behoves them to give of their best to a Bill of this kind when it comes to that detailed consideration which is done for the most part in Committee.</P>
    <P>The experience of most of us, probably the experience of everybody here, members of the legal profession and otherwise, must be invaluable in the consideration of a matter as far-reaching as the one we are now considering. On this stage there are two matters to which I should like to advert.  One is that I think the introduction of this Bill will ease the lot of the person who had gone abroad and married somebody who was not an Irish citizen and who desired to bring that person back in order to acquire a little property in this country.  Any of us with any experience of examining titles and advising intending purchasers in relation to stamp duty, whether it be £5 or £50 in accordance with citizenship, must keep that section in mind.  This Bill removes the difficulties which were suffered by people who had been able to set aside certain savings abroad and who wanted to come back to their own country.  That is a very welcome feature of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The second matter to which I should like to refer&mdash;and I feel sure everybody else in the House welcomes it too &mdash;is the all-embracing nature of this proposed piece of legislation in relation to Irish citizens and in particular to persons born in that part of our country which is still divorced from us &mdash;the six north eastern counties.  As has been said, many people have been born since 1922&mdash;the qualifying date under existing citizenship laws.  Up to now some of those people have, of course, been affected by the fact that they have been born later than that date in the six north eastern counties, and I think it is a very admirable thing and a very welcome feature of this Bill that the Minister for Justice, on behalf of the Government and on <Col N="1011" /> behalf of the whole Dáil, is spreading the mantle and enveloping all our sons and daughters, not alone here and in the Six Counties, but all over the world wherever they have been labouring and living in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Barrett, I welcome the special recognition given to the position of mothers.  That is only in keeping, I think, with a very important legal decision given in this country some short time ago which also recognised the equality of position as between father and mother in relation to the custody of the children.  There does not appear to be any useful purpose to be served in making a speech on the Second Reading of a Bill such as this merely for the sake of making a speech and I shall conclude by again congratulating the Minister and his draftsmen on introducing this welcome measure.  I hope that on the Committee Stage he will be given all the advice and experience that certain Deputies are in a position to give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two criticisms to make of this very excellent piece of draft legislation.  I do not find myself in agreement with my colleagues about the proposed extension which is being suggested in Section 6 of the Bill by means of which the children of Irish citizens who will be born outside the jurisdiction of the State will become Irish citizens.  Under the existing legislation, the right to become an Irish citizen when born outside this country was confined to the children of fathers who were Irish citizens.  It is now proposed to extend the right of Irish citizenship to the children of mothers who were Irish citizens.  I feel we are extending this right too far by giving citizenship to the children of third generation Irish people born outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem to me that the principle which was enshrined in the 1935 Act should be maintained and that we should give citizenship only to second and third generation persons born outside Ireland when their parents, or one of them, was an Irish citizen.  In the draft Bill as it stands we are going to widen legislation passed in 1935 <Col N="1012" /> and extend to the children of a mother born outside Ireland the benefits of Irish citizenship.  As I say, it does seem to me that we are going to bring in a whole new section of people into the ambit of Irish citizenship and I feel it is too wide.</P>
    <P>My other criticism of this section of the Bill is with regard to the registration clauses.  Under the Bill as it stands, where a person is born outside Ireland and becomes entitled to Irish citizenship, because the person's father or mother was Irish, the person's birth must be registered in accordance with Section 27.  There is an important change introduced into this Bill in comparison with the Act of 1935.  Under that Act, registration had to be made within one year of the birth of the person and, in certain circumstances, two years.  That particular safeguard has been dropped. As the Bill stands a person who claims to be an Irish citizen under Section 6 and Section 7 need not be registered at any particular time so that it will become impossible for us to know at any given time what is the number of Irish nationals and citizens.</P>
    <P>There may indeed be a whole class of persons who would be entitled to be Irish citizens if they became registered but who would not bother registering themselves.  When some of those persons may desire to come here, they may go through the formality of registration.  I think this fluid position is an undesirable one and that there should be some time limit as to when the births of the persons who are born outside Ireland and who desire citizenship would be registered. It may be said that under Section 27 registration must be in accordance with the foreign births regulations and that perhaps in those regulations a prescribed period would be set down for the registration of births.  If that is intended, I do not think it is a very good way of legislating and if it is intended that the existing principle should be maintained, and that persons entitled to Irish citizenship who were born abroad by reason of their parents being citizens, should be entitled to claim Irish citizenship it should be put in in black and white into this Bill that registration should <Col N="1013" /> be made within a certain definite time.</P>
    <P>One other matter which occurs to me on this Bill is the fact that it has not dealt with the conflicting definitions of nationals which are contained in some of our earlier legislation.  I want to refer in particular to the Control of Manufactures Acts.  Under the present legislation a number of Irish nationals, or a number of naturalised Irish persons are not qualified persons under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  It seems to me an anomalous position that we should be passing legislation now dealing with Irish nationals and conferring rights of citizenship on certain persons and at the same time excluding a number of persons who would be citizens from the benefits given to qualified persons under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  I hope the Minister will accept an amendment of the Control of Manufactures Acts so that persons who become citizens under this Bill will become qualified persons under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  It is also a fact that under the Moneylenders Act of 1933, the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1933, and the Control of Imports Act, 1934, certain rights are given to a number of persons to whom this Act will not apply.  I think the time has come now to rationalise our legislation and it seems to me that in this Act we should endeavour to see that where in our previous legislation an Irish national is defined he will be covered by the terms of this proposed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill very much because I think we all feel that anything that gives an extension in this country of our citizenship with adequate safeguards is a good thing. I must say <i>en passant</i> that the debate so far has been conducted by the legal fraternity.  I think that we appreciate that in spite of some adverse criticism that has been directed towards that particular section of the community recently, it is rather fortunate we have them in this House for a highly complicated Bill such as this to give us the benefit of their expert advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot pretend to have any legal qualifications whatsoever, but there are <Col N="1014" /> one or two things that I feel will lead to a certain amount of difficulty in this Bill in relation to the citizenship section. It is our aim and object to extend as far as possible citizenship to those who certainly have Irish blood in their veins and I welcome particularly the return to Ireland under our own Government of many people who emigrated in bygone days.  I am now referring to those whose forefathers perhaps emigrated some generations back.  I feel that this legislation should be directed towards providing Irish citizenship for those whose forebears left Ireland, even though a considerable time has elapsed since they went away.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear in my own mind on reading this Bill as to whether this legislation is to be retrospective.  I feel when we introduce a Bill like this, that if we give Irish citizenship to our exiles, to descendants of exiles or to any other section of the community to whom we feel satisfied to give that citizenship, it should be possible with adequate safeguards, to make it retrospective.</P>
    <P>With regard to the citizenship clause, sub-section (1) of Section 6 says that every person born in Ireland is an Irish citizen from birth.  This is probably an innovation in citizenship legislation as it relates to the 1935 Act.  It is, of course, desirable in one sense that anyone who was born in Ireland should be entitled to be an Irish citizen, but it seems to me to carry a certain amount of danger with it as well.  There are, of course, in the world&mdash;I suppose there have been at all times&mdash;a great number of people who would be undesirable to us in Ireland, particularly in the circumstances of the world to-day, where it is divided more or less into two separate factions.  It is undesirable that we should have people in this country with rights of citizenship who might be not exactly satisfactory, from the standpoint of Irish culture and Irish thought, or to the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.  It may well be argued that anyone who is born here would, as a baby, inherit the national outlook on culture, and acquire the national outlook from the people in the country itself, but it is reasonable to assume <Col N="1015" /> from sub-section (1) of Section 6 that if you are giving nationality to anyone who is born in this country, you are also giving the right to the parents of that person, be it a male or a female child, even though they are not themselves obtaining citizenship, to remain in this country.  You cannot very well, if you give citizenship to someone born in Ireland, say to the parents: &ldquo;We do not like the look of you; you are unsatisfactory from our point of view; we think you ought to get out.&rdquo;  You cannot very well do that, if you give to the child itself Irish citizenship.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not a lawyer nor an expert on citizenship, but I do not see exactly how we are going to get round that point, and I should like to stress that point now, so that it might possibly be considered at a later stage, perhaps on the Committee Stage, or perhaps the Minister and his advisers would consider if there is any way in which we could give adequate safeguards. I suppose it is very difficult to say that anyone born in Ireland should not have Irish citizenship, but I see inherent danger in this particular section and when we go to Section 13 very much the same thing applies: &ldquo;A person born in an Irish ship or an Irish aircraft wherever it may be is deemed to be born in Ireland.&rdquo;  That really opens up the same line of thought and I do not feel quite satisfied in my own mind that we should leave it as it is.</P>
    <P>The other criticisms and suggestions I have to make with regard to the citizenship section is that Section 7 states that, pending the reintegration of the national territory, those born in Northern Ireland after the 6th December, 1922, are not entitled to the same rights, as are given under Section 6.  I think it is universally considered by every public representative in this House, that, although we have to endure the <i>status quo</i> as it exists at the moment in regard to our national territory, we do not accept it <i>de jure</i> even though it exists <i>de facto.</i>  It seems to me, if we are giving citizenship to anyone born in Ireland, we should let it be Ireland as a whole&mdash;if we are to enact this throughout our <Col N="1016" /> whole territory, the territory which by every right belongs to us and to nobody else and which should be under the jurisdiction of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Another matter that troubles me is that we could have been more liberal, as I said at the outset, to the descendants of Irish nationals, as I take it that we are not really giving citizenship to grandparents of Irish nationals. It is an accepted fact that Irish people who have emigrated, no matter at what period of Irish history they left the country, in the main, wherever they have been, have always created a colony&mdash;perhaps not in all cases, but in the vast majority of cases&mdash;of Irish and have married and bred as Irish amongst themselves.  That is very evident in the New World, in the western world, anyway.  We have large sections of the community who are of purely Irish blood down the generations. But by the clause which seems to come in under Section 7 we are excluding those people.</P>
    <P>Where people, no matter how long they have been out of the country, can prove by their pedigree that they are of Irish descent, they ought to be in a position to seek Irish citizenship.  If that were the case and if that became universally known, many of our emigrants, particularly in the western world, would come back to Ireland again and the vast majority of them would be glad to settle in the land from which their forefathers came.</P>
    <P>I recently spoke to a Canadian whose ancestors left this country as far back as 120 years ago.  He can prove pure Irish descent and pure Irish blood.  People such as these who can prove Irish descent should be entitled to Irish citizenship, if they want it. After all, we have made a good many people Irish citizens and occasionally one sees in the newspapers the queer names of people admitted to Irish citizenship.  I feel that we should liberalise as far as it is possible our legislation in order to permit the acceptance of those people who can prove Irish descent.  By doing that, we would help considerably to bring many of those to settle here who went away in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> There is one further point on which I should like clarification; it is a point upon which I have not been able to satisfy myself, either by going through the White Paper or the Bill itself, and that is as to whether any of these new clauses in operation are retrospective in any sense whatever.  I know of people who have come back to Ireland. In one particular instance, the person was of pure Irish blood.  His father and mother were both born in Ireland, but he was born outside the country.  This person returned to his native land and he was a man of considerable wealth and property.  He spent a lot of money in Ireland and employed a lot of labour, but was excluded by certain operative clauses with which this Department is not concerned from the benefits allowed to Irish citizens in regard to the imposition of tax.</P>
    <P>This particular person has not to go back to his grandparents to prove that he is Irish.  I should like to feel that this Act will put him in the position of entitling him to call himself an Irish citizen at all times.  We should be generous in that respect.  After all, if, under Section 6, we are going to allow citizens of doubtful alien parentage to become Irish citizens with all the benefits that flow therefrom, we ought to consider making our legislation as open as possible, so that Irishmen, or the descendants of Irishmen, can feel they are welcome in their own land; that they should be citizens from the day they came to the country&mdash;a country which they or their forebears left under conditions of hardship.  They should be welcomed back to the old country as being Irish from the time they were born, provided they can prove they are of Irish blood.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to confirm and give the force of law to an Order which I have made under Section 9 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of radio sets and accessories.  As Deputies are aware, the Fair Trade Commission undertook as its first statutory inquiry an inquiry into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of radio sets and accessories.  Having completed the inquiry, the commission duly furnished a report of the inquiry to me, describing the conditions which obtain in the radio trade and indicating whether, in the view of the commission, certain practices which exist and which interfere with competition are unfair or operate against the public interest. The commission's report has been published, and Deputies have had an opportunity to study the report and recommendations of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having received the commission's report, I gave very careful and detailed <Col N="1019" /> consideration to the many difficult and complex issues which arise.  Many of the considerations to which the commission direct attention in the report are ones of great importance, not only to the distributive trade but to manufacturers and the public as well.  I also consulted the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in order to obtain the views of these Ministers on the commission's report.  In this connection, Deputies will be aware that there is a statutory obligation on me under Section 9 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, to consult any other Minister who may be concerned before I proceed to the making of an Order prohibiting specified arrangements, practices or arrangements in a trade.</P>
    <P>It may facilitate Deputies if, at this stage, I give a résumé of the commission's report and of the recommendations which the commission make with a view to terminating restrictive trade practices which are considered to be unfair or to operate against the public interest.  The retail trade in radio sets is regulated by agreement between two trade associations&mdash;the Federation of Irish Radio Manufacturers, which is an unregistered trade union composed of manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers, and the Wireless Dealers' Association, which is a registered trade union composed of manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers.  More than 90 per cent. of the radio sets marketed are handled by manufacturers and distributors who are members of either of these two associations.</P>
    <P>Entry to the retail trade is controlled by the Wireless Dealers' Association by means of the maintenance of a list of approved retailers to whom the manufacturers of radio sets agree to confine distribution.  It is virtually impossible for a trader whose name is not on the approved list to engage regularly and openly in the sale of radio sets.  Application for admission to the list of approved dealers must be made to the Wireless Dealers' Association. Certain conditions as to premises and the stocking and display <Col N="1020" /> of radio sets must be complied with by an applicant and, in addition, an applicant must maintain a repair department in his premises, and, if he is not technically qualified himself, he must employ at least one service mechanic on a whole-time basis.  An applicant must undertake not to supply radio sets for resale to any person whose name is not on the list of approved retailers, and he must undertake also not to sell radio sets at prices lower than the retail prices specified in the manufacturer's list of prices.  These requirements are enforced rigorously by the association.  Breaches of the requirements may result in fines, or suspension or deletion of the retailer's name from the approved list.</P>
    <P>Assessing the actual and potential effects of the approved list system, the Fair Trade Commission have expressed the view that the system prevents or restricts competition and restrains trade.  They consider that such interference with competition and trade is unfair and operates against the public interest.  The commission point out that the system places in the hands of an association composed largely of radio traders the power to determine whether these traders should allow other traders to enter into the radio business.</P>
    <P>The commission indicate also that the existing arrangements provide a means of organising boycotts of manufacturers whose discount rates or list of customers are not acceptable to the Wireless Dealers' Association; that private enterprise in distribution is stultified and as a result the public is deprived of the benefits of healthy competition.  The commission have also adverted to the fact that the emphasis in the operation of the approved list of retailers is in favour of retailers resident in the larger towns and cities and that the restriction of business opportunities to the larger centres of population is not in accordance with public policy.</P>
    <P>The view has been widely expressed that if the approved list system is abolished, everyone would be entitled to engage in the sale of radio sets. The commission do not, however, accept the contention that the only <Col N="1021" /> alternative to the approved list system is widespread and uneconomic proliferation of retail outlets.</P>
    <P>They take the view that it is for individual manufacturers to determine the economics of distribution so far as the number of outlets is concerned; and they point out that, in the absence of collective restrictions, competition between manufacturers may be expected to serve as a deterrent to distributional arrangements which are irrational and uneconomic from a manufacturer's point of view.</P>
    <P>The commission consider that, in the case of any individual manufacturer, the objective of achieving efficiency and economy in distribution justifies the making of conditions by that manufacturer, if he so wishes, as to the volume and frequency of orders, or as to the provision of service to the public, provided such conditions are reasonable and are not designed or likely to restrain trade or limit competition unfairly.  It is the considered view of the commission that individual manufacturers, acting in this way, can ensure the avoidance of an undue proliferation of outlets while at the same time preserving fair and equitable methods of distribution.</P>
    <P>The retail prices of radio sets to the public are fixed by the manufacturers, and sets are sold to the retailer at the retail price, less a discount of 33? per cent., giving the retailer a gross profit of 50 per cent. on the cost price.  This rate of profit is substantial, and it will be observed from the commission's report that, even though retailers might be satisfied to accept a lower rate of profit, they are obliged to adhere strictly to the retail prices fixed by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The practical result of this arrangement is the establishment and enforcement of minimum selling prices in respect of all radio sets sold in the Irish market.  In normal conditions, enforcement of a fixed retail margin results in prices being higher than they would be in the absence of a fixed margin.  The purchase of a radio set involves the purchaser in a relatively substantial outlay, and the retailer's profit margin represents a large portion of that outlay.  An arrangement <Col N="1022" /> which deprives the public of the benefit of competition in respect of one-third of the retail price of a radio set is clearly a matter which affects the public interest in a very direct way.</P>
    <P>The commission have expressed the view that resale price maintenance, to which all approved radio retailers are required to adhere, is a practice which is contrary to the public interest.  The commission see no valid reason why retailers, wherever located and whatever their operating expenses and efficiency, should be compelled, regardless of their own wishes, to accept a margin of gross profit as high as 50 per cent. on the cost of radio sets.  The commission are of opinion that it is contrary to the public interest that retailers should be put out of business, if they choose to operate on the basis of a profit margin which, though less than the prescribed margin, is sufficiently remunerative in their own particular circumstances.  The view of the commission is that resale price maintenance, whether enforced by an association or by an individual manufacturer, should be abolished, and they consider that the abolition of this practice in the radio trade would be to the advantage of the consumer, would lead to increased efficiency in retailing and would not detract from efficiency in production.</P>
    <P>The argument most commonly advanced against the abolition of resale price maintenance is that such a step would lead to extreme price competition, with consequent instability in the trade.  Radio sets would, it is feared, be used as loss leaders, that is to say, offered for sale at drastically reduced prices in order to induce customers to purchase other commodities, the price of which has not been reduced.  A large concern, dealing in a wide range of goods, would be in a stronger position than a small retailer to make up for a reduction in the prices of radio sets by increased sales of other goods, and the consequence of this would be the large-scale elimination of the small retailer.  Persons without any real interest in the trade, and without any intention of continuing in the business, might seek a quick profit by reducing <Col N="1023" /> prices in order to increase turnover and so disrupt the business of legitimate traders.</P>
    <P>The commission consider that it is necessary to distinguish between price-cutting in circumstances where resale prices are fixed, though ineffectively or only partially maintained, and a situation where price competition is accepted as a normal condition of trading. The commission take the view that, in the latter circumstances, the opportunities for unscrupulous traders will be very limited, and regular retailers will be in a position to weigh the long-term consequences of a particular price policy in relation to other forms of competition.  The commission do not accept the contention that price competition would lead to the elimination of numbers of small retailers.  On the contrary, the commission consider that such competition would tend in some measure to favour the small retailer by providing him with a means of countering the attractions in the way of elaborate facilities offered by larger concerns.</P>
    <P>As regards the practice of loss leader selling, the commission's view is that having regard to the substantial cost, radio sets are much less likely to be used as loss leaders than are other commodities which are low-priced and have a high rate of turnover.  In any case, the loss leader device derives much of its sustenance from the prescription of fixed prices.  The fact that a very high proportion of radio sets is sold under hire purchase arrangements further reduces the possibility of extreme price-cutting.  In such cases, the customer is concerned with the size of the monthly instalment, which is governed by the duration of payments and the specific terms of hire purchase, as well as by the price of the radio set. The impact of price competition is much less direct in such circumstances than in the case of cash sales.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable, in the view of the commission, that the consumer should have to forego the benefits of price competition in order that retailers might be protected against the contingency that competition might at some time become excessive.  It is preferable to try to meet the risk of the <Col N="1024" /> emergence of such competition, not by eliminating all price competition, but by devising a method of checking excessive competition should it appear.  The commission consider, therefore, that in two sets of circumstances, the general prohibition against enforcement of resale price maintenance should be modified.  Firstly, if a retailer offers or sells a particular brand of radio set at a price less than or equal to the price at which he originally purchased it from the manufacturer, unfair trading might legitimately be alleged, and the supplier should not be prevented from withholding further supplies.  Secondly, if the goods are offered or sold at a price so little exceeding the purchase price as materially to injure the legitimate business interests of a supplier, the supplier should be at liberty to withhold further supplies, provided that he informs the commission of his intention. If, in the latter case, the commission, having examined the matter, notify the supplier that, in their opinion, the circumstances do not justify the continued withholding of supplies, the supplier would be obliged to continue to supply the trader in question.</P>
    <P>I have given careful thought to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission, and my view is that the commission are fully justified in making the recommendations which are contained in their report.  I agree with these recommendations, and I am satisfied that it is unfair that radio manufacturers who have the benefit of tariff protection should discriminate against dealers by refusing to supply them on the grounds that the dealers are not approved by a particular trade association.  I am of opinion also that it is wrong that it should be within the competence of vested retail interests to restrict the right of new retailers to enter into the radio trade.</P>
    <P>I consider also that a number of the conditions imposed by the Wireless Dealers' Association on new entrants to the retail trade are unduly onerous. I refer, in particular, to the obligation that a new dealer must maintain a repair department and, if he is not technically qualified himself, must employ at least one service mechanic on <Col N="1025" /> a whole-time basis.  This obligation, which, it may be noted, does not apply to firms which, prior to 1946, were on the approved list maintained by the Wireless Dealers' Association, bears with severity on the retailer in rural areas where the volume of repair work would not be sufficient to justify the employment of a service mechanic on a whole-time basis.  I am satisfied that it is contrary to the interests of the consumer that competition should be restricted both by the maintenance of a list of approved retailers and by the enforcement of minimum resale prices for radios.</P>
    <P>With the object of removing the abuses which exist and restoring conditions of free and fair competition in the radio trade, the commission recommend in their report that an Order should be made prohibiting the particular practices which are considered to be harmful to the public interest.  The commission recommend for instance that, subject to the adoption of safeguards against the contingency of excessive price competition, resale price maintenance should be prohibited and that it should be possible for retailers to determine their own selling prices in the light of their own operating costs.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the withholding of radio sets from retailers who have not complied with the rules of the Wireless Dealers' Association, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a manufacturer or wholesaler to discontinue supplies of radios to a retailer on the grounds that the retailer has not observed minimum resale prices.  As regards restraint of trade which arises from the exclusion from supplies of retailers who are not on an approved list, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a manufacturer to withhold radio sets from a retailer on the grounds that the retailer is or is not a member of a particular organisation or association or because the retailer's name does not appear on an approved list.  The commission recommend that no manufacturer, trade association or organisation should be permitted to publish lists of approved or non-approved persons which are likely to <Col N="1026" /> restrict entry to the retail trade or to be used as a basis for regulating the supply and distribution of radio sets. The commission recommend also that it should be made unlawful for any person to secure a boycott of any manufacturer of radio sets on the grounds that the manufacturer has refused to do any act which would be contrary to the terms of the Order.</P>
    <P>There are, finally, two recommendations by the commission regarding the imposition by individual manufacturers of terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders.  Firstly, it is recommended that a manufacturer should be permitted to impose certain conditions including conditions as to the volume and frequency of orders, provided such conditions are reasonable, are equitably applied, and are notified to the commission, which may, if the circumstances at any time so require, make fair trading rules in relation thereto.  Secondly, it is recommended that there should be a prohibition against a manufacturer differentiating between customers who should, in the normal way, be supplied on the same terms and conditions, having regard to the size and frequency of their orders.  The commission do not consider that a manufacturer should be prevented from advertising or specifying a resale price which is a maximum price or from withholding supplies from a retailer if the maximum price is exceeded.  Any such specified or recommended price will not, however, be binding on retailers as a minimum price.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at an earlier stage, I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the Fair Trade Commission, and a copy of the Order has been circulated to Deputies.  Section 9 (3) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill which I am sponsoring is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order.  Deputies are probably aware that proceedings have been initiated in the High Court seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that <Col N="1027" /> the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the inquiry held by the Fair Trade Commission in regard to the supply and distribution of radio sets, and the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radio) Order, 1955, are unconstitutional. The hearing of the action has not yet commenced and I do not wish to say anything which might be regarded as prejudging the hearing, but I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be proper that the Oireachtas should proceed with its consideration of the Bill for the confirmation of the Order.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of being amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters dealt with in the Order have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and the arguments in favour of adopting these proposals are set out fully in the commission's report.  For my own part, I have given the whole matter my most careful consideration, and I commend to the Dáil this Confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the radio trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first Bill which has been submitted to the Dáil to confirm an Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission in relation to restrictive trade practices, it affords to the Dáil the first opportunity of considering the working of the Fair Trade Commission since its establishment and, in a more particular way, the principles upon which it has based the recommendations made to date.</P>
      <P>This particular Order relating to the radio trade aroused a great deal of public interest and discussion.  I think that was due to the fact that there was a general assumption that other Orders, which might be made later on the recommendation of the commission, would be similar in character, differing no doubt in matters of detail, but based on the same principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> Because of the fact that this is the first Order, and because of the assumption that subsequent Orders will be similar in principle, it is clearly desirable that we should give careful consideration to this Order and debate in full the principles enshrined in it. I am sure every Deputy in the House has been approached by parties interested in the Order, either because they were engaged in the radio trade or engaged in trades in respect of which Orders might be made at some future date; representations were made against the Order, against the whole operations of the Fair Trade Commission, in some instances, and against particular details of the present Order.  The reception which the Dáil gives to the present Order, because of all these assumptions, because it is the first Order and because other Orders may be similar, is likely to be of general interest also.  There is, as the House knows, a particular problem in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act was introduced by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  That Government also set up the Fair Trade Commission and gave it its terms of reference. The first Bill to confirm an Order is submitted by their successors and there is generally an assumption that the whole operation from the enactment of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act to the establishment of the commission and the making of these Orders is not a matter upon which there is any difference of opinion in this House.  Because of that, it is possible that persons or interests opposed to the Order, or critical of the working of the Fair Trade Commission, may have difficulty in getting their views expressed here; or, if they could find expression, they may have difficulty in getting them accepted.</P>
    <P>For myself, I found it impossible to undertake to bring before the House some of the views regarding this Order which were expressed to me because I felt that that might result in some misunderstanding of my attitude towards it.  I want, however, to take advantage of this Second Reading discussion to state in a general way the views of the Party on this side of the House <Col N="1029" /> regarding this legislation and regarding also the operations and procedures adopted by the Fair Trade Commission. It seems to me the most important point to stress in connection with this whole matter of restrictive trade practices and the action which the Dáil should take regarding it is that there are two main divisions of it.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is the matter of collective agreements and arrangements comprehending manufacturers, suppliers generally and retailers to enforce restrictive trade practices by collective action.  And then there is the further question of those trade practices, admittedly restrictive, which are enforced by individual manufacturers or individual suppliers upon retailers.</P>
    <P>The Act which we passed here in 1953&mdash;the Restrictive Trade Practices Act&mdash;was directed against all trade practices, whether enforced collectively or individually, which were found on investigation to be inimical to the public interest.  But when that Act was being framed the Government of the day&mdash;certainly I as the Minister who was acting in the matter&mdash;recognised that the main source of public harm was to be found in collective action to enforce restrictive trade practices. We did not preclude the Fair Trade Commission from examining all restrictive trade practices, no matter how enforced, but the problem that the legislation was designed to deal with was created by the coming into existence of trade associations through which restrictive practices were enforced collectively.</P>
    <P>In that regard the position here is different from the position in Britain and different from the position that appears likely to continue to develop in Britain.  The British Monopolies Commission, which has published a number of reports dealing with restrictive practices in Britain and which has made certain recommendations which have been in the main accepted by the British Government and embodied in legislation which is now before the British Parliament, was limited by its terms of reference to the examination of collective agreements and problems caused by collective action in trades to enforce restrictive practices.  They were precluded from examining and <Col N="1030" /> did not examine the merits or demerits of those practices in themselves.</P>
    <P>The whole work of the commission was directed against the matter of collective action rather than against the nature of the practices which that collective action was designed to enforce.  The commission recommended that collective agreements to enforce restrictive practices should be made illegal, with some minor exceptions, but they did not deal with the merits of these practices when enforced by individual suppliers.</P>
    <P>It appears that the British Government is adopting that principle also and the legislation which is being discussed there is mainly aimed against collective action to enforce trade practices rather than the restrictive practices in themselves, and that very considerable liberty is being left to individual manufacturers in imposing conditions upon their retailers' outlets.</P>
    <P>As I said our Act was so framed that the Fair Trade Commission could deal with all types of practices, no matter how enforced, but as I stated in the Dáil when introducing it, the main problem was the development of these trade associations and the enforcement of restrictive practices through them and that the object was to end trade rings as the public ordinarily understands that term.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the case being made against this Bill&mdash;against the Radio Trade Order which is being confirmed in this Bill&mdash;by those who are interested in that trade, or those spokesmen of other trades who have spoken about it in the expectation that similar Orders would be made in relation to their trades, is based very largely on confusion of thought between those two main divisions of the problem&mdash;between the issue of collective enforcement of trade practices and the issue of restrictions imposed by individual suppliers upon their retailers.</P>
    <P>There is a case for some restrictions when imposed by individual manufacturers or individual suppliers upon retailers which can be fairly defended when it is based on the rights of the individual manufacturer or the individual supplier.  Action such as might be taken by a manufacturer to prevent, for example, the unauthorised adulteration <Col N="1031" /> of his product would certainly be accepted as reasonable.  No Deputy would seek to prevent a beer manufacturer withholding supplies from a retailer who, he found, was selling an inferior product in a bottle bearing his brand or was in some other way interfering with the quality of his product. Action taken by a manufacturer to prevent or to minimise the risk of faulty installation of equipment would also be regarded as reasonable because, apart from any public damage that might result from such faulty installation, it could well operate to give the products of that manufacturer an undeservedly bad reputation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, some manufacturers enforce conditions upon retailers designed to ensure the due fulfilment of commitments into which they have entered with the public regarding after-sales service.  Where a manufacturer has committed himself to give after-sales service and distributes his product through retailers, then he naturally and reasonably must make it a condition of supply to these retailers that they give the service he has contracted to give. All these regulations, arrangements and restrictions which an individual manufacturer imposes upon retailers to ensure proper standards of service and proper standards of maintenance and to maintain the quality of his products, cannot be regarded as contrary to the public interest nor fundamentally objectionable.  But a case made for restrictions imposed upon retailers on any of these grounds takes an entirely different aspect when it is used to defend collective action taken by all manufacturers or all suppliers or all manufacturers in conjunction with all retailers to enforce them.</P>
    <P>The examination of the problem here by the Fair Trade Commission, and, prior to the establishment of this commission, in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the examination which was also proceeding in Great Britain, proves that in all these cases collective action of that kind affects the public interest unfairly. In most cases, if not all cases, the disadvantages of such collective action far outweigh any advantages that may result.</P>
    <P>Our position, therefore&mdash;the position <Col N="1032" /> of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;in relation to this and in relation to any similar Bill that may be submitted to the Dáil to confirm other Orders made on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission is that we will support generally action taken to prevent groups and associations enforcing restrictive trade practices collectively, but we will examine far more critically any proposals which may be made to prevent individual suppliers enforcing conditions upon retailers.  We will examine such proposals for the purpose of satisfying ourselves that they are reasonable in all the circumstances of the trade.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Fair Trade Commission, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Dáil and the public should appreciate that collective action, the combination of manufacturers amongst themselves or with retailers to enforce trade practices, is the main enemy, that practices which are reasonable when applied by an individual manufacturer to his retailers, take an entirely different aspect when they are enforced by boycotts, penalties and exclusions through the medium of trade associations.  It is entirely wrong that these trade associations should arbitrarily determine for themselves the arrangements which are in the public interest, and enforce those arrangements by such methods as I have described, whether the arrangements relate to the matters which the Minister has mentioned, trading only with persons whose names are upon some approved list or some list of members, or trading with persons who are defined according to qualifications or status, the maintenance of minimum prices or of fixed profit margins.</P>
    <P>There are disadvantages in every case where restrictive practices are enforced collectively.  I know it has been argued, and will be argued, that there are some cases where the need for regulation is such that it has to be secured and that it is impracticable to secure regulation without some collective action.  In many trades there is, no doubt, a case for prescribing qualifications of knowledge or skill to be held by those who engage in the trade and a requirement of some safeguards <Col N="1033" /> against fraudulent misrepresentation. But our view is that it should be possible for manufacturers to enforce these regulations and safeguards where they are necessary without having to combine in an association with other manufacturers for that purpose.  If there are trades in which it is not practicable for an individual manufacturer to enforce necessary regulations and necessary restrictions without combining with other manufacturers and other suppliers, then in our view there is a case for legislation and for the enforcement of these safeguards and regulations by a public authority, not by a voluntary and, in the correct meaning of that term, irresponsible trade association.</P>
    <P>The Minister was, I think, quite right in putting the main emphasis upon the most objectionable practice of all and that is the operation of exclusive producer-dealer agreements designed to secure that goods will be supplied only to retailers who are upon some approved list, some list drawn up by trade associations of persons approved by them.  Any such arrangement can result in conditions being imposed in a trade which could never be adopted in circumstances of competition.  It means, as is apparent in the case of the radio trade, that applications for admission to the trade by new firms or individuals wishing to engage in the trade are determined by potential competitiors of the applicants. In the case of the radio trade it is clear from the evidence that the main concern of the members of the association, when considering applications for admission to membership, was to keep down the number of retailers to the minimum, to prevent any development of competition with themselves.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out also in the report, the operation of these restrictions tends to discourage if not prevent experimentation in new methods of trading.  They often involve the maintenance of standards of service which are higher than the public desire or more costly than the public need and they are nearly always associated with arrangements for maintaining fixed prices or profit margins.  The enforcement of these collective agreements places in the hands of these associations <Col N="1034" /> powers over individual traders which are often excessive and which are always dangerous.  Where resale price maintenance is included they go far beyond anything required to maintain stable market conditions or to eliminate undue competition, and they result in a waste of economic sources.</P>
    <P>So far, therefore, as these collective agreements are concerned, it may be taken that we of the Opposition Party will, in every case, support action taken to prevent the enforcement of collective trade agreements.  If there is any trade in which it is possible to say that some joint action is needed to impose safeguards necessary in the public interest, then we will argue in favour of legislation and supervision, legislation for the setting up of a public authority to do the regulating and supervising.  But we are not nearly as opposed fundamentally to certain restrictions which individual manufacturers and suppliers impose upon their retailers.  It may be that some of these restrictions or regulations are unduly severe or are undesirable from the public point of view, in which case there is power under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act to deal with them. In the ordinary course of events, however, we would urge that the effort of the Fair Trade Commission should be concentrated on the elimination of trade rings and of collective arrangements, and not so much to supervise or bring under control the arrangements of individual manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Sole agency agreements between individual manufacturers and retailers are not uncommon.  There is a number of trades in which these agreements are standard practice, and they may not be objectionable in operation or restrictive of competition.  It is true that in this country, with our protected home market where the number of suppliers of any particular commodity to the market may be small, even these arrangements between individual suppliers and retailers may create difficulty, difficulty which may not be experienced at all in larger markets. But I want to urge that we should not allow our hostility to collective agreements to cause a swing to the other extreme of prohibiting individual suppliers making their own distribution <Col N="1035" /> arrangements, even to the extent of giving exclusive contracts where that course can be shown to be justifiable.</P>
    <P>Of course, all this turns very largely on the modern development of selling goods under manufacturers' brands.  All radio sets are sold under some trade name or brand.  I doubt if there are any sold without such brands.  This problem of branded goods is one on which we need to clear our minds.</P>
    <P>In my view, the branding of goods by manufacturers is a practice to be encouraged.  It is a practice which operates mainly to protect the public. Indeed, the public has come now to rely very much upon the manufacturer's brand as an assurance that he is getting goods of the quality he desires to obtain.  I do not think anybody would dream of buying a bottle of stout or a bottle of beer that did not bear the brand or the trade name of the brewer; he would not accept the retailer's word for the contents of the bottle.  Nobody would think of buying unbranded cigarettes.  It is the manufacturer's brand which conveys to the customer the flavour, the quality of the product that he is buying.  There are many other examples that could be given where the use of brands or trade names by manufacturers is not merely a public convenience but an assurance of quality which the public should have.</P>
    <P>A manufacturer who uses a brand is, of course, committing himself to the maintenance of a standard of quality because, if his brand becomes associated in the public mind with poor quality, a bad article, he is out of business.  The decision of the manufacturer to use a brand or trade name on his goods supplied to retailers is based upon his conviction that he can stand over the quality of his goods and can guarantee uniformity of quality.</P>
    <P>Where there is a number of suppliers in the market, all selling goods under their own brands, and where there is clear competition between them, the greater the use of brands by manufacturers the better it will be from the public point of view.  Where competition exists, particularly if there are also unbranded goods on sale, as there might be in some instances, I can see <Col N="1036" /> no great public disadvantage in the extended use of manufacturers' brands and many advantages.</P>
    <P>Here we come up against the problem, to which the Minister has referred in his speech, that the branding of goods by a manufacturer almost necessarily involves the fixing of prices by manufacturers.  Clearly, a manufacturer putting branded goods on the market will seek to secure public familiarity with his brand by advertising the goods and, of course, the advertisement is no assurance of value unless the price at which the customer can expect to get the goods carrying that brand is also advertised.</P>
    <P>More particularly there is this problem of the use of branded goods as loss leaders, the specific problem to which the Minister referred in his speech. The loss leader technique, the practice of some traders of selling goods at much less than their normal rate of profit or even at a loss in order to give the public the impression that prices in their stores are lower than elsewhere or to bring in customers who, they hope, will buy other goods when they are there, operates to discourage the branding of goods by manufacturers, this desirable practice of getting manufacturers to stand over the quality of their products by putting their trade names on them.</P>
    <P>It certainly does operate to discourage the use of brands by manufacturers if these manufacturers have not got the right to fix the price at which the goods will be sold or to refuse supplies to those retailers who sell them at a price to which other traders could not be expected to conform.</P>
    <P>This was a very special problem here in the early days of our industrial revival.  Our traders were at that time accustomed to having a very much larger number of separate suppliers seeking their custom when they were drawing goods from Britain.  With the development of our own industries and the introduction of the protection policy, they found they had to deal with a smaller number of suppliers and found themselves in a difficulty in adjusting themselves to that new situation and in many cases the adoption of the loss leader technique by some <Col N="1037" /> stores created widespread problems which in a few instances very nearly put out of business the firms whose goods were being used for that purpose because nobody else would stock goods bearing their brand when they could not sell at the price publicised by the store using the loss leader device.  Because they were so much smaller in size, because they had no alternative market to that available in the country, they often found themselves in very great difficulties.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we must keep in mind that there are limits to which we want to allow competition to develop.  Competition is a good thing within limits but unrestrained competition leads logically to monopoly and while, no doubt, there are various counteracting forces which will prevent the monopoly ever becoming absolute, the main aim of a large trader who adopts the loss leader technique is to put his competitors out of business and to get all the available trade for himself.  That is why that technique, even though it is frequently adopted by traders in all countries, must on the whole be regarded as undesirable and particularly undesirable in our country where the number of individual suppliers of branded goods must necessarily be small and where there are not the same opportunities for gaining elsewhere trade that might be lost in one centre through that device.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that where competition is active, where there is no collective action, no collective arrangement amongst manufacturers for the maintenance of prices, for relating the price of their products one to the other or for the maintenance of fixed profit margins, then we do not have to condemn out of hand the practice of the individual manufacturer who fixes the price at which his brand of goods must be sold by the retailers to whom he gives them.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>One?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not talking of one.  I am talking of a dozen at the moment.  Where there are a dozen manufacturers acting collectively in competition with one another selling branded goods, I do not see there is much objection to one of them making it a condition on dealers that his goods must be sold at a certain price, so long as there is full and active competition between all the manufacturers selling goods of that kind.</P>
      <P>The difficulty arises where the number of manufacturers is very small.  If there is only one manufacturer the difficulty is obvious; there can be no question about the need for supervision in that case.  Of course the need for legislation arose out of the fact that in our peculiar circumstances it became easy for manufacturers to prevent competition between themselves on price and on profit margins.  That is not peculiar to this country alone; it is not a special kind of original sin of the Irish.  It exists in every country but it developed here to a stage since the war which necessitated the Government taking action and that action was expressed in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still hold strongly that where there are a number of manufacturers in competition with each other there is no reason of public policy why they should be prevented from refusing to supply <Col N="1039" /> these goods to traders who sell them at unduly low margins of profit or at cost, because the sole purpose of these traders is to eliminate competition in their own immediate localities and to put themselves in the position where they are exercising a monopoly of supply.  There is also another objection. Where, in the public interest, it becomes necessary that a trader should carry stocks of spare parts or should have facilities for executing repairs then the manufacturer who agrees with an individual trader that he will carry a certain stock of supplies, or to provide a repair service, should be allowed to give that trader a greater rate of discount, a price advantage, as against the trader who does not carry such a stock of spares or who does not execute repairs.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is need for an arrangement of that kind in the radio trade.  It seems that manufacturers are not precluded by the Order from dealing with suppliers on that basis&mdash;giving some larger discount to traders who give a better service to the public or who contract to carry certain stocks of spare parts and to execute repairs.  There is also need, I think, to recognise the limit of practicability of this matter of limiting price arrangements.  The British Monopoly Commission published a report some months ago in which it condemned the price fixing arrangements of British motor-car type manufacturers.  That arrangement produced a rather interesting discussion in the British Press when the motor-tyre manufacturers replied to the condemnatory report of the commission.  They pointed out that a firm in a dominating position can effectively fix the price at which all goods of the same class are sold, that other firms cannot sell higher even though their production costs might be higher, and could not sell at a lower price either, because if they offered the goods at a lower price, they would be giving the public the impression that their commodities were inferior in quality.</P>
    <P>You can have the situation where prices can be very effectively regulated by a firm in a dominating position <Col N="1040" /> without any trade association, though it is not unreasonable to assume that where such conditions exist there will be consultation on prices.  Where no association exists such consultation cannot be regarded as objectionable. In this country, if ever a situation arises in which the price of stout or beer has to be changed, all the smaller breweries will await the decision of the one main supplier and relate their prices to that decision, and anybody who knows that trade will realise that no other course is open to them.</P>
    <P>The same is true of profit margins. Here I speak with some personal knowledge, because I had to deal with problems which arose.  A manufacturer has to retain the good-will of his retailers whether he is dealing with some retailers who are his exclusive agents or supplying to all retailers, and in practice he cannot afford to throw away that good-will by giving a profit margin lower than other manufacturers are allowing.  So you will find the arrangement where one dominant supplier will determine the conditions under which other suppliers must trade.  The others cannot afford to lose the good-will of the retailers by trying to get them to sell their products at a lower margin than the principal supplier fixes.  And so, apart altogether from any legislation we may pass here, there are frequently circumstances in trade which will effectively determine price levels and profit margins and in a way which may or may not be objectionable but about which we can do very little.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of the Draft Order has some relevance to that situation. There is a reference in it to &ldquo;requiring or inducing&rdquo;.  I do not know whether the Minister hopes to make it illegal for traders, retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers, to consult with one another as to what the market conditions are likely to be and to relate their trading policies.  I do not think that is undesirable, unless there is a trade association determining some action arbitrarily, and enforcing it by boycotting or cutting off supplies from retailers who may not be on an approved list or who do not conform.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Order which this <Col N="1041" /> Bill is to confirm.  I must say that, having read the Report of the Fair Trade Commission I was forced to the conclusion that the practices in the radio trade stand to be condemned on every ground that I have mentioned and that legislation relating to that trade is consequently fully justified. The evidence produced and quoted by the commission showed that there existed in the trade all the objectionable things that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act was intended to eliminate &mdash;exclusive dealing, price maintenance, restriction of competition, restraint of trade by limiting the number of retailers, refusal to supply traders not on a list approved by the association and the determination of applications for admission to the trade by existing retailer interests.</P>
    <P>I know the Wireless Dealers' Association allege that the Report of the Fair Trade Commission on those matters is not correct.  Documents have been circulated to Deputies in which it is alleged that the conclusions of the Fair Trade Commission were against the weight of evidence given at the hearings and that the members of the association were impeded from making their case against the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission by reason of the refusal of the commission to give them a transcript of the evidence submitted.  It is not possible for an individual Deputy to decide the merits of that case.  No substantial case against the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission has, that I am aware of, been made.  So far as the Dáil is concerned we must act on the facts before us and I may say I approve of the decisions of the Minister and the Government to proceed with this legislation notwithstanding the High Court action to which he referred.</P>
    <P>As to the Order which this Bill confirms, I may say that in so far as it is directed against joint or collective action to maintain prices or profit margins or to withhold supplies or to impose terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders I am completely in favour of the Order.  I find much less convincing the case&mdash;in so far as a case was made&mdash;for restrictions on <Col N="1042" /> individual manufacturers acting individually and trading in competition with one another, but because of the conditions in this trade, because of the strong tendencies towards formation of rings which have shown up over many years I believe this Order should be made.  I framed the Restrictive Trade Practices Act deliberately so as to require the Dáil to accept or reject an Order of this character <i>in toto</i> without having power to amend it.  There is, therefore, no possibility of any Deputy moving to amend the Order in any detail, but I think we could say that later on as the reform of conditions in the trade is effected by means of the Order, at some future time we might consider modifying it in some of its provisions affecting restrictions imposed by individual manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I do not in any circumstances contemplate modifying the Order in so far as it is directed against collective action by manufacturers or by manufacturers in conjunction with retailers. Therefore, I can tell the Minister that we are supporting this particular Order for the reasons I have given and so far as we are concerned he can have the Bill in all stages to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself agreeing to a considerable extent with everything Deputy Lemass has said.  We are doing something this evening that follows a trend which is obvious in many parts of the world.  The Americans have been worrying for many years about the kind of process we are now attempting to deal with here.  The British are now thinking very deeply, and I hope they will think effectively, about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest that Deputy Lemass referred to as having been taken by the members of the radio trade in this Order struck me as a little smug.  They did not seem to stand back and look at what the people whom we represent here were trying to do and are quite entitled to do.  When one analyses what we are trying to do here, one finds that we are trying to preserve the capitalist system, because the essential of the capitalist system is that there should be a free-for-all.  In the curious way in which a wheel could go <Col N="1043" /> full circle, those industrialists, manufacturers, distributors and retailers could find they wanted to arrive at a stage where there was a completely organised system which could be justified in another country some thousands of miles from here.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very important debate, and I believe the public have had the benefit of the considerable hearing which it had in commission, of a report having been made, of the Minister's contribution this evening and of the contribution which Deputy Lemass has made to this debate.  I think the type of principles we are trying to set out are worth all that public attention.  It is a curious thing that, in this peculiar instance of the radio trade, I want to confess that I could have a mixed mind about how far we should go in prohibiting what I would call vertical organisation because the radio trade, particularly the manufacturing end of it, has a particularly good record in this country.  It is outstanding, I think, in that it has justified the protective measures taken by the people here, and the prices charged for the products have shown that the people are getting extremely good value, compared with pre-war price levels.  The fact that an export trade has been built up is proof that prices compare very favourably with prices abroad.  Of the radio trade, we could say the situation is good.</P>
    <P>The public is getting good articles at reasonable prices and if the radio trade organises itself in a particularly detailed manner, the net result to the consumer seems to be a good one.  Of course, we are not talking about that particular case, but about general principles, and I think it is a good thing to see that a number of manufacturers making similar, competitive articles should not so combine as to injure the public wellbeing.  I think the confining of entry to the trade to certain people was madness.  It was a very wrong way to go about it.  If a man wants to get into the radio trade, he should get into it and either succeed or &ldquo;go bust&rdquo; and get out, but nobody should say that he cannot do this or that.  It is a free country and I think this Order <Col N="1044" /> is assisting in maintaining that freedom.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the wrongs of what I would describe as horizontal organisation and he did make a case, with which I substantially agree, about the right the manufacturer should have to control his products from his factory into the hands of the consumers, and even after the consumers get them.  I asked Deputy Lemass if he felt that price control in a case like that would be justified, and, frankly, I think it would, provided, of course, that a number of manufacturers were making similar types of articles, such as radio sets.  He might want to adjust profits so as to give the retailer different margins&mdash;I must say the profits in the radio trade make my mouth water as a grocer and I hope these will be remembered, if the grocery trade ever comes into this business.  That, however, is another matter.</P>
    <P>I think that, although chaotic conditions or a free-for-all would probably be undesirable, it is still the essential of the system.  The chaotic conditions that could come with unlimited entry into the trade, unlimited practising of a trade, unlimited price control would probably injure the small but good retailer.  I am not talking about the man at the top, the big distributor, but about the small dealer who would probably be injured, but would survive, as the price cutter would take his business from him.</P>
    <P>The price cutter might become a more profit conscious retailer.  Some of the men who came to me about this particular Order were men who were able to enter the radio trade when there was no control in the matter of entry and who, to my knowledge, entered the trade successfully because they indulged in the practice of price cutting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am not quite as much in favour of this matter as the previous speaker although I find myself in agreement with him on some points.  I am also in agreement with Deputy Lemass on some points.  None of us really wants a free-for-all and no interest would be <Col N="1045" /> served by such a situation.  I cannot see how the interests of organised labour would be served by a situation in which the great majority of the firms in the retail trade or distributive trade were forced, by virtue of extreme price cutting, to a point at which they could not pay adequate wages.  That is one matter present in the minds of retailers and of all those engaged in the distributive trade generally when they look at the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.</P>
      <P>Many sections of the business community are afraid that they will not be able to earn sufficient profits to carry on their business.  Apropos of profits, it is sometimes forgotten that a very small proportion of the money invested in industry represents profits.  Recently I saw a break-down in regard to moneys employed in industry on the basis of units of £1.  For every £1 paid for goods or services, the amount paid in dividends amounted to 1½d.  Yet that particular firm paid quite a respectable dividend&mdash;a dividend of over 5 per cent.  Sometimes, when we speak of profits, we are apt to forget that profit is a very relative thing and bears an exact relationship to the turnover and various other factors.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the profit would be.  I am not speaking of the wireless traders. Actually, I was not thinking of that at all.  I was not discussing that particular point and I do not know exactly what profits they make but I am of the opinion that they have a case and I think we should let it go to the courts. Unfortunately, however, that does not appear to be the view of the majority of the people in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Fair Trade Commission, I should not like anything I said to be taken as in any way reflecting personally upon anybody who took part in that commission.  I think the officers carried out their work very fairly, but I am not too happy about the fact that this was thought to be the best method to arrive at the results desired, nor am I of the opinion <Col N="1046" /> that it was fair to the business community.</P>
    <P>I saw business men there and they inevitably felt, when being questioned by the commission, that they were almost in the dock.  I am sure that was not in any way intended, either by the members of the commission or by this House.  Nevertheless, I think a different set-up would have achieved the objects desired and in a way which would ensure better results for the business community.</P>
    <P>When we consider this question of restrictive practices and fair trade generally, I think we all must agree that up to a certain point men are entitled to protect themselves from what I might describe as the &ldquo;rogue elephant&rdquo; in the trade.  That is what the business community are afraid of. They are afraid lest this Bill will give the Government or any Minister who may occupy the position of the present Minister opportunities for encouraging wholesale competition and price cutting of a type which would result in the closing down of business, a depression with regard to the earnings of the labour corps engaged in industry and the total extinction of whatever profits there might be.</P>
    <P>Speaking some time ago, I said that we had here a delicate structure which was built up over a long period and that inside the framework of that structure there were trades which had a series of price gradations, interference with which could lead to very serious results.  I am still of the opinion that that is so.  After all, the wireless dealers, to take one case mentioned here, sell a series of articles, carry out work and attain a certain degree of skill in the maintenance and in the selling of these particular articles and everything to do with them.  They also maintain special types of premises which will sell these articles effectively and will show them off to the best advantage.  Is it really to the advantage of this community that anybody should be able to get such an article and sell it at any price they like?  It eventually gets down to that.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to say that it is wrong for any group of people to band together and demand from the <Col N="1047" /> public prices over which they cannot stand, prices which are too high.  It is also wrong, I think, for any group of people to band themselves together and to say that they will not allow certain people into the trade.  But on the other hand, is it right that I, who have nothing to do with the motor trade beyond the fact that I can, and do, drive a car, should be able to buy a motor-car at the same price or sell it at a price below that of a man who maintains a motor salesroom and maintains behind that the whole equipment of a service garage and also, perhaps, a sales organisation to buy and sell secondhand cars which are being traded in? I would say that it would not be in the public interest that I, as an ordinary individual, should be placed in that position.  I would also say that it would not be right that I, who am not a grocer, should be able to buy various articles of grocery, as my friend here behind me, and sell them if I like to the public at the same price as he does, or perhaps a cheaper price, when he has to maintain a shop and a premises and pay wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but still perhaps too many people have started in the morning and that is what is wrong.  We all want to see free competition maintained.  Competition is the life of trade and, as the Deputy said, is one of the essences of the capitalistic system.  But, on the other hand, where nowadays you have the organised labour demand&mdash;and I am not saying that in any way against labour; do not think that for one moment&mdash;practically every reputable firm in this country&mdash;I was going to say operating in a large way, but it even applies to very small firms&mdash;knows that they must pay any of their porters such and such a wage.  They must pay their shop assistants such and such a wage, either exactly defined or roughly laid down.  There is no possibility nowadays of people being engaged in retail business and paid slave wages. That day is long gone.  It is right and fitting that that should be so.  The <Col N="1048" /> person who is running the business finds his labour costs are an exact amount.  There is no way, even if he wanted to, of lowering them.</P>
      <P>Then he finds that he is paying what amounts to a fixed price for most of what he buys.  It is not always possible for him to buy in markets where he can import and sell cheaply.  He may now and again, but, as a rule, the greater part of his business will go through recognised channels from recognised and well-known manufacturers or perhaps wholesalers and if he is a small man he certainly will work in that way.  His taxes are uniform, his rates are uniform, he pays at the same rate as anybody else, and he finds probably owing to the high rate of taxation and so on, a very large strain from the point of view of liquid assets.</P>
      <P>Suddenly into this somewhat restricted and tightly bound pool comes, I was going to say a rogue elephant, but perhaps I should better say a wild hippopotamus who starts threshing about.  Nobody quite knows why that particular firm comes in and does that, but they may create a tremendous amount of difficulty, chaos and hardship, cause bankruptcies, and cause credit restrictions to be enforced, and at the end of it all, the trade is not any better by virtue of that, nor is the public getting their goods any cheaper than they would if the way had not been open to that particular type of attack on the existing commercial circumstances of that trade.  That is a situation which the commercial community is very afraid will develop.</P>
      <P>While I speak as a person who has some experience of business and would not for a moment advocate some of the practices which have gone on, at the same time I do think that there should be a degree of sympathy and understanding of the difficulties of business which is trying to carry on surrounded by very stringent restrictions, and which perhaps has to cope with a situation where prices have been wantonly cut down for the benefit of nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like this House to recognise the difficulties which firms are up against and which various types of <Col N="1049" /> trades are up against.  I should like the House to recognise that all restrictive practices do not necessarily work to the hardship of the general community, and that, when legislation attempts to interfere with what is a fair and just and equitable arrangement, it is venturing into a field where there is great difficulty.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister and to the House to exercise moderation in this respect. The business community generally do not in any way wish to see either manufacturers, wholesalers or retailers in a position to charge the public exorbitant prices and to give a poor return.  At the same time, they do not want to see the trade handed over to perhaps the unrestricted competition of somebody who only wants to get in for a short time and then clean the thing up and make as big a profit as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lemass set a very good headline when speaking on this Order.  He pointed out that this is the first Order under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and that we should consider it from the point of view of its general application to other trades.  I do not think there is very much to add to what he and Deputy Dockrell and other speakers have said; they have covered the ground fairly well.  I should like to put in just one plea, namely, that when the commission consider action taken by suppliers under Section 13&mdash;in which they are limited to make conditions of sale&mdash; they should bear in mind the necessity for establishing a good tradition of after-sale service in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of after-sale service applies possibly even more to other trades than to the wireless trade.  We need to adopt a vast number of new techniques both in industry and agriculture. They involve a multifarious group of machines and different aids and scientific devices, all of which, if they are to operate efficiently, have to be properly maintained.  If they are to operate efficiently, it is essential that the retailer (1) should have a reasonable profit on the sale of the commodity, and (2) that the supplier should be enabled to insist on reasonable conditions in regard to after-sale service. <Col N="1050" /> The same thing applies to even the demonstration of new scientific inventions and new machines.  This, again, could apply perhaps more to other trades than to the wireless trade.</P>
    <P>The cost of demonstrating new techniques and new inventions is extremely high, whether in connection with individual demonstrations, demonstrations at trade shows or fairs or under other circumstances. There is a very great element of conservatism, as the Minister knows, in regard to adopting new techniques, and, unless the margins of profit are sufficient, the supplier will find it difficult to get his accepted.  He will find it difficult to get some new invention accepted and adopted by the community at large and, when he has sold the article or the machine, he will find dissatisfaction among the public that there is not a proper supply of spare parts widespread in the country and, equally, that there is not an adequate service.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is going to have charge of this Order and that Section 13 may arise from time to time, in which individual suppliers are enabled to impose reasonable terms and conditions upon the retail trade, I hope he will see that a very sound tradition of after-sale service is insisted upon and that nothing he would do would prevent that developing in the community.  I think the Minister will agree that there is a great deal lacking still in the community in regard to that.</P>
    <P>I have had many complaints throughout the country in respect of a wide variety of articles that spare parts are not available and that after-sale service is not available.  It is most discouraging for people who have purchased new machinery of a new quality or an invention in advance of the times, when they are unable to get the machine properly repaired and serviced.  That is my main observation on this Order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said he was rather more keen on the collective functions of the Order than on the functions of the Order which relate to individual suppliers.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the need for after-sale <Col N="1051" /> services so far as the Order and individual suppliers are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell said he would request the Minister to be moderate in his application of this measure, particularly in regard to traders.  I feel that that particular point involves a very wide principle.  I was engaged in the radio trade myself for a number of years in a rural area. I am convinced that the city trader, for instance, has many advantages over the rural trader.  That was particularly so when electricity was not available in the country.  A high percentage of the radios sold and distributed there were of the battery type.  I often experienced difficulties in the purchase of, for instance, a dozen battery radios. When you took them into stock, you found that, perhaps, due to damage in transportation, one or two were out of order.  You were then faced with the problem either of having to get some competent mechanic to work on them or else, perhaps, of sending them back at your own expense to the manufacturers. It will be appreciated, furthermore, that the carriage on a radio is pretty high and that in many cases all these costs had to be borne by the individual trader.  The costs in respect of battery radios had generally to be borne by the country trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The percentage of sales in small towns was very low.  While the general public believed that radio dealers generally were making fortunes, I want to assure the Minister&mdash;I am not engaged in that trade now, so I can speak on the matter with an open mind&mdash;that the percentage of profit for the country trader was not as high as some people seemed to think.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Childers that it is important, not alone in the radio trade, but in every other trade, to have after-sales service.  Unfortunately, we do not seem to have that to the same degree here as they have it in other countries.  That is due in the main, I think, to the fact that the best of our people emigrate and go across the water, because they are paid higher wages there; and we fail to induce the best people and the <Col N="1052" /> most skilled technicians to remain at home.  For that reason, it is not easy to build up an efficient after-sales service.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the position since I have had personal experience of it myself. I will relate that experience for the benefit of the Minister and the House. When I first entered into the radio trade, I wrote to a certain firm of manufacturers.  Their representative duly called upon me in a week or so and put some questions to me.  Like Deputy Barry, I was engaged in the grocery trade and other lines.  I wanted to supplement my income.  This particular representative asked me what lines I had.  I pointed out the grocery; he asked me, if I was appointed as an agent, how many cycles and radios would I order from him there and then. I said about two dozen bicycles and two dozen radios.  He said: &ldquo;O.K; you have the agency.&rdquo;  Evidently the other local man could not give an order for more than half-a-dozen bicycles and radios at that particular time.</P>
    <P>Now I was a member of this organisation known as the Radio Traders' Association, or something like that, and I paid an annual fee of 5/- or 10/-. I continued in the trade for some time and I frankly admit I made no fortune in it: the 33? per cent., or, in some cases, the 50 per cent. is only so much profit on paper.  By the time all the deductions are made, one does not have anything like that percentage profit at all.  When my locality was pretty well supplied with radios and business in the radio line diminished somewhat, the particular firm evidently thought it would be no harm to move the agency in some other direction.  Incidentally, I had forgotten to pay my 5/-, or whatever it was.  That was overlooked and the next day I had a notice telling me I was out of the business, despite the fact that I had committed myself to the business, worked at it for quite a long period and had supplied a number of radios annually.  Actually in one year, I had sold something like 300 radios, and that in a rural area.  That created the situation that the people whom I had supplied had to look for service in another direction.  Naturally enough, they were rather unwelcome when they arrived at another radio store and it <Col N="1053" /> was discovered there that they had purchased their radio sets from me. Had I wanted to dodge the red tape, I could have done so because relatives of mine in the motor business told me they could get me supplies.  When all this talk was in the air about restrictive trade practices and inquiries and so forth, I felt there was need for a tightening up.</P>

      <P>A need for an examination of the whole position and the introduction of legislation to improve the position as regards the radio trade generally.  In the matter of radios, I think there should be less restriction. Reputable firms, either in the city or in the country, capable of handling such things as refrigerators and so forth should be at liberty to engage in that trade.  I see nothing wrong in having such people supplied with these goods and it should not be necessary for such people to be members of any particular association in order to get supplies.  If the radio traders have had to come before an inquiry and give evidence, they have brought quite a lot of that on their own heads, because &mdash;I have given my experience&mdash;some of them at any rate engaged in a type of practice in which no ordinary decent trader would like to engage.  I sincerely hope that the measures which the Minister is adopting to improve this trade generally will be a success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton:</NameTxt>
      <P>This has, I think, been a very useful and a very fruitful discussion inasmuch as the Bill has provided the House with an opportunity of reviewing the pattern and the type of inquiry which followed the enactment of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.  The House has now before it two reports of the commission.  It can see the pattern of the reports.  It can see the manner in which the commission proceeds to take evidence.  It has had an opportunity, as well, of examining the painstaking manner in which the commission has discharged its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Lemass's contribution here this evening was a particularly valuable one, inasmuch as it <Col N="1054" /> showed, as far as it was possible to do so, a detached approach to a problem which he could not accurately appraise when he was asking the House to pass the 1953 Act.  Generally speaking, I think he maintained here to-day the standpoint which he took then when the Act was being passed three years ago.  To a great extent, I agree with his line of approach.  I think, however, that some of his views would stand modification in the light of a closer examination of the report by himself; I think, too, that he would be well justified in re-reading the report of the commission in order to ensure that, in his desire not to go so far in one direction, he does not, in fact, open the door to a continuance of practices with which the commission was actually set up to deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass this evening referred to practices which he thought it was undesirable to curb.  I think at least one of these was an Aunt Sally put up by himself and knocked down by himself.  He said nothing should prevent a manufacturer from supplying goods to a retailer who, for instance, does some processing on the goods subsequently which has the result of causing a deterioration in their value.  He instanced the case of a person supplying beer to a retailer and the retailer watering that beer for his own benefit and supplying the customer presumably with a measure of beer which was not that of the quality prescribed by the manufacturer. There is nothing in this report which prevents a manufacturer of beer dealing with a gentleman of that kind. In fact, a gentleman of that kind ought not merely to be crossed off the list as an undesirable customer, but should be taken to the courts and made amenable there for actions of that kind.</P>
    <P>The report, as I say, does not prevent the manufacturer dealing with such a gentleman.  Neither does it prevent the manufacturer dealing with the person who will not pay his bills, or pay them promptly.  Nor is the manufacturer obliged to have strapped on his back for the rest of his manufacturing life the type of customer, who, from a number of <Col N="1055" /> points of view, can be regarded as either personally objectionable or commercially undesirable; so that it is not fair to read into this report suggestions that it imposes restrictions which, in fact, are not in the report.  Deputy Lemass's views, however, were more general in character in the main and, as I said, I think I could underwrite a lot of them as representing my approach to this problem as well.</P>
    <P>I think some Deputies see in the Order which is being made difficulties which in fact are not there and have overlooked reading some articles in the Order which I think are specially designed to obviate the difficulties which they fear will arise.  The possibility that the Order prohibited the continuation of certain after purchase service was mentioned by more than one Deputy but Article 13 of the Order provides in effect that it will authorise a manufacturer or a wholesaler to apply to the acceptance of orders for radios, conditions concerning the size and frequency of the order, the function of the retailer, the services to be rendered to the public, provided these conditions are reasonable in the interests of efficiency and economy in production and distribution or are necessary in the legitimate interests of the manufacturer's or wholesaler's business. Such terms and conditions will, however, have to be applied in a fair manner to all retailers placing orders for radios with the manufacturers and wholesalers concerned and no unfair discrimination will be permitted as between one retailer and another.</P>
    <P>There would, however, under Article 14 be an obligation on manufacturers and wholesalers to impose conditions of the kind mentioned, to file a copy of those conditions with the Fair Trade Commission, and to furnish on request to any retailer a statement of the terms and conditions upon which radios would be supplied.  So that, in effect, that article in the Order makes provision for the kind of services which Deputy Childers was anxious should be continued.  If those who had been complaining about the report and complaining about the Order would ask <Col N="1056" /> either their legal advisers or the Department of Industry and Commerce for an explanation of what was intended under Article 14, I think they would have found that the Order, and the series of articles set out therein, need not have such a frightening effect upon them as they appear to have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned that the Monopolies Commission in Great Britain has been dealing only with collective arrangements for price maintenance and for the abolition generally of restrictive trade practices.  I think that is not wholly so because, in the case of motor tyres, they recommended prohibition of price maintenance by an individual manufacturer.  I understood from the case that Deputy Lemass was making this evening that he would not interfere with the practice imposed by one manufacturer on those with whom he was dealing.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 111 of the Fair Trade Commission's report on radio sets and accessories is interesting in this respect.  The paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In their examination of the practice of re-sale price maintenance in the radio trade, the commission have considered the implications of collective enforcement as contrasted with enforcement by the individual manufacturer acting alone.  It is their view that enforcement by the individual manufacturer does not alter the fundamental objections to the practice in its bearing on prices to the public and efficiency in the trade. Collective enforcement entails a system of private law and punishment under which a dealer may, because he has reduced the price of the product of one manufacturer, find himself deprived of supplies by all manufacturers who are parties to the arrangement.  This method of enforcement tends to become increasingly thorough and more comprehensive in closing loopholes, reaching towards such matters as the allowances to be made for secondhand sets traded in, the prices of obsolete models, the supply of accessories, the use of canvassers and the terms of hire-purchase.  The maintenance of re-sale prices by the individual manufacturer, <Col N="1057" /> who would be primarily concerned with the prices of his own products, could not be so extensive in scope or command the same means of enforcement, but it might result in an even greater enhancement of margins than would take place under collective enforcement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the Fair Trade Commission, which gave extensive consideration to this whole matter, warns about the danger of leaving that loophole unplugged, because of the dangers which are likely to arise if you ban restrictive practices when applied collectively, while, at the same time, permitting an individual manufacturer applying a similar type of restriction which, in its effect, may not only be unfair to the potential purchaser but may, in fact, also have its repercussions on the price level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass raised the question of the maintenance of after-sale service as well and I think my explanation of the significance and intention of Article 13 covers that matter.  Again, he raised the question of a choice of customers. I have dealt with that matter, but for the purposes of the record, I would suggest that Deputy Lemass, or anybody else interested might peruse paragraph 85 of the report which deals with choice of customer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass dealt at some length with the branding of articles, but it seems to me that branding is beside the point here, as, in fact, all radios are branded and there can be no question of unbranded goods having any advantage in this respect.  If all the manufacturers of branded radios are subject to the same law, none has any advantage over the other.  The provision of Article 8 of the Order recognised the need to provide against excessive competition, and the remedying of it, should it arise, is set out in the Order.</P>
    <P>I did not quite follow Deputy Lemass in his references to competition between manufacturers.  He referred to the fact that branded goods were now coming on the market in greater volume and that he saw nothing wrong with manufacturers of branded goods imposing conditions in respect of the sale of these goods.  But I think what <Col N="1058" /> he overlooked is that the branded manufacturer is competing only for trade&mdash;that is volume of trade in the particular line of goods&mdash;but the public seem to get no benefit from that competition and are not likely to get any benefit from that competition, if there is no price competition at the retail level.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is the first Bill to give effect to a recommendation made by the Fair Trade Commission.  I think it has been received in a friendly way by the House and I think there appears to be a substantial measure of agreement as to the policy to be pursued in this matter.  I think one very valuable effect from the discussion is that, although the main Bill was passed three years ago and although a whole variety of things might explain differences of opinion between the atmosphere then and the atmosphere now, it is good in the public interest that, looking back on the Act three years after it was passed and looking back on the Act in the light of the hearings of the Fair Trade Commission, it is useful, and I hope it will have the salutary lesson in some quarters, that the main purpose of the House is the same to-day as it was three years ago, namely that the House abhors restrictive practices which detrimentally affect the community. There has been a reaffirmation here this evening that it is desirable to protect the public against restrictive practices which are unfair and which harm the public wellbeing.  It may well happen that reaffirmation of these views from both sides of the House this evening may make it in many respects much easier to obviate other occurrences of new restrictive practices or the maintenance of present practices.</P>
    <P>It has been a useful development from a community point of view that both sides of the House have indicated that the House regards itself as the custodian of the public interest, that the House will not stand for restrictive practices which are detrimental to the public interest.  If that fact is deeply and widely appreciated in quarters where the Fair Trade Commission will look for evidence of restrictive trade practices, it might make the task of <Col N="1059" /> the commission, the task of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the task of the Legislature generally easier in its dealings with this problem.</P>
    <P>In this Bill and in the Order, we are now setting our face against re-sale price maintenance in the circumstances presented to us by the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  I think that is a good thing.  It is a particularly good thing in the circumstances as reported on by the commission in respect of the radio trade.  I hope that any other cases which come before the commission will be cases in which those concerned will recognise that there is a public interest in this whole question of re-sale price maintenance and restrictive practices, and that they will display before the commission, if the need to go there ever arises, a sense of responsibility of what they owe the community and above all a sense of responsibility of what they owe a community which in many cases has been responsible for the establishment of these industries in Ireland which it is now sought to surround with restrictive trade practices detrimental to the very public who, by its support, was responsible for making it possible to establish these industries in this country.</P>

      <P>I think I should tell the House in respect of one amendment suggested last week, I agreed I would consider the matter without binding myself.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Lemass in effect was that the relief provided by the Bill would operate from the date upon which the mines had re-commenced work after stoppage.  I did examine the question and I came to the conclusion that it would be both impracticable and inequitable to deal with the matter on that basis.  It seemed to me that it was utterly impossible to differentiate between what was a temporary cessation and a permanent discontinuance, that in this type of mining there were frequently, all over the world and not merely here, cessations for the purpose of getting new machinery, waiting until mineral prices varied or, perhaps, in some cases due to exceptional flooding and that it would be almost, if not absolutely impossible, to differentiate between what was a temporary cessation and a permanent discontinuance. Therefore, that would be the position in respect of existing mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also felt myself bound to realise what would be the position in the future in respect of new mining operations. Quite frankly, it was that which finally clinched my mind against the amendment.  If I allowed such an amendment in respect of existing mining operations I would equally have to allow it in respect of new mining operations.  That would, I think, bring us into a situation that would be almost chaotic&mdash;if, in respect of the future, we were to try to differentiate <Col N="1061" /> between a temporary cessation and a permanent discontinuance.  It would result in producing the very thing we want to avoid, namely, an incentive, so to speak, to stop and start again. The second point absolutely clinched my mind that it would not be practicable in circumstances to operate on the lines that the Deputy suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that the argument which clinched the mind of the Minister has no relation to the question at all?  The Government announced their intention to bring in a Bill to give certain relief from taxation to new mining ventures.  Apparently, at a subsequent stage they decided that the relief should also be given to existing mining undertakings. The mine to which I referred had ceased to operate because it could not sell its products and then, when market conditions improved or new outlets for the products arose, went back into operation.  The Minister said an existing mine can benefit from this tax relief for a period of eight years from the date on which it commenced. If it was eight years in existence, it got no relief.  If it was seven years in existence it got one year's relief at 50 per cent.  The only question that arose here is the date of the commencement of the calculation of that period and I suggest it is common sense to start the calculation of that eight year period from the date on which the mine came into its present operations.  There is one case which I mentioned.  There may be others.  The mine concerned came into existence ten years ago.  It produced all during the war and for some years after the war and then went out of business because it was unable to sell its products, unable to make a profit from its operations. It was out of business for two years.  It was not because of flooding or because of waiting for machinery; it was for no other reason than that it could not keep in business.  If a new company had been formed to operate it would qualify under this Bill.</P>

The company I mentioned&mdash;there may be others&mdash; resumed operations in 1954, after the mine had been closed down for two years, and I suggest that in that case the commencement of operations was the date it started again in 1954, not 1942 or 1941 when it first started operations.</P>
      <P>May I say that, in that case, I know it is a completely different operation? The original working arose out of wartime conditions.  It was a product which was required in war by the people then buying and not required when the war was over.  The company then found a new market of a different kind for that production and it is now operating.  I suggest it is quite unfair to that company to say to them: &ldquo;Just because you originally commenced ten years ago, even though you re-commenced in 1954, you can never get any concession under this Bill.&rdquo;  The Minister could do it; as far as I know, it is not likely to cost him anything. They are not likely to make profits that would solve any Budget problems. The Minister should look at that again.</P>
      <P>I want to state my view that experiments in discriminatory taxation are terribly dangerous, and when the Dáil does approve of discriminatory taxation relief, it should be particularly careful to ensure that it is done in an equitable way.  It is not equitable to give concessions to some companies and not to give them to others, where the circumstances, we know, are almost precisely the same.  I think it is most unfair.  If that is going to be the precedent on which the tax weapon will be used as an economic incentive in future, it is just as well that it would not be used at all, and some other method should be adopted for dealing with such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have tried to persuade the Minister that, apart altogether from the desirability of doing this, if there is any serious intention of using this Bill as an incentive to get people interested in mining operations, it should be done as a mere matter of justice, as an attempt to get nearer <Col N="1063" /> the stage at which all taxpayers are treated alike under the law.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is under two misapprehensions.  First of all, he was under a misapprehension when he said a minute ago that, if another company had done this, if they had passed on to another company, the new company would get the relief. This Bill does not deal with ownership as such.  It is the physical operation that is the test in each case and ownership does not vary it at all.  The real difficulty the Deputy is in, as I understand his case, is that he is trying to get for temporary cessations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  I proposed that where the mine had ceased to be worked for three months, the date of commencement should be the date of resumption. I am prepared to make that a year.  I was concerned to eliminate any possibility of giving the relief where it was not intended.  The mine might be closed down merely because of some temporary factor, a machine being out of order.  If the mine was not operated for a year, then it must be assumed that it had ceased to operate.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,000,000 be granted to derfray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the National Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional amount I am asking the Dáil now to provide for the National Development Fund is £3,000,000.  This sum, taken together with the £3,000,000 which the House <Col N="1066" /> voted last year and the £5,000,000 voted in the previous year, will bring the total amount available to the Fund to £11,000,000.  In reply to the question by Deputy Aiken on to-day's Order Paper, I indicated the various projects towards which allocations have been made out of the Fund since its inception, the amount allocated to each project and the actual expenditure to date out of the Fund on foot of each such project.</P>
    <P>The total of the allocations pre-June, 1954, came to £6,521,900; subsequent review of the picture as it then presented itself reduced this figure to £5,560,700.  The payments out of the Fund in respect of these projects aggregate £3,599,493.  As respects schemes approved since June, 1954, the amount allocated is £1,729,236 and the expenditure £197,870.  All told, the allocations come to a total of £7,289,936 and the expenditure to £3,797,363.</P>
    <P>This time last year I gave the House an account of all the projects approved to date both by my predecessor and by myself.  The particulars I gave Deputy Aiken to-day cover these projects, of course, but they embrace, in addition, the allocations I have since made myself. Following are the figures:&mdash;</P>

    <P>There were minor variations of earlier allocations giving an extra £20,300, making the total allocations since I introduced last year's Estimate £1,504,536.  Deputies will see from the figures I have given that allocations out of the Fund come to within about £700,000 of the capacity of the Fund. New projects are liable to come along and develop at any time.  To enable me to have an adequate margin for such contingencies, I am now seeking a further £3,000,000 for the Fund.</P>
    <P>When speaking on last year's Estimate, I told the House it was the Government's intention that the Fund should be maintained to finance capital schemes of a productive character which would make a real contribution to the national economy. It was intended, I said, that the Fund should be drawn upon to facilitate the rapid expansion or the expedition of programmes of public works or to set in motion new schemes of development with a high employment content whenever we considered the employment situation so demanded.  While that is still broadly the policy, it is now more than ever essential to ensure that projects financed out of the Fund do not generate undue demands for imports and so widen the adverse trade balance.  In present circumstances, only projects that are essentially of a directly productive type can hope to gain access to the Fund.  If the House wishes to hear the further details which I made available to Deputy Aiken I will give them.  I presume, however, that will not be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass:</NameTxt>
      <P>They were to have been available last year but I think they will not be in commission now until next year.  It was with some reluctance that the E.S.B. undertook their construction because I do not think they were very enthusiastic about them.  At the time the scheme was devised, it was intended that the stations would be available to take any surplus turf offered for sale in their supply areas so that there was no responsibility put on anybody for organising a supply of turf equal to the demands of the stations.  It was recognised that these stations would confer a tremendous advantage on the areas in which they were situated and it was suggested that the supply of turf would be sufficient to keep the stations in full commission.  To ensure that, this scheme of road construction was introduced.  It was thought that the construction of the roads would indicate to the people of the areas concerned the desirability of producing turf and the availability of a market for their turf.  It was thought that the scheme would make the people concerned appreciate the importance attached to their keeping up a supply of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the E.S.B. have done anything about ensuring a supply of turf for these stations and if there has been a delay or a lack of enthusiasm in the fulfilment of the task of getting the roads constructed, the E.S.B. will have an alibi in relation to the delay in getting the stations ready for production; they can say that the supply of turf did not turn up.  It was our hope and intention that the supply of turf would always be there.  Somebody should give consideration to the steps to be taken now, even if it is only publicity or propaganda, to get the people in the area to understand that there will be a demand for turf, that the turf will be purchased for cash from them by the E.S.B. and that, as far as they require improvement of the roads to get that turf into the stations, grants will be made available for that purpose. That must be done; otherwise the stations will have no turf to burn. It was part of the scheme that, in the <Col N="1070" /> year previous to their going into commission, the stations would build up a supply of turf.</P>
    <P>That supply of turf should have been there last year&mdash;it certainly should be there this year&mdash;and I do not think it is.  I want to be satisfied in my mind that its non-existence is not due to the fact that somebody over there in the E.S.B. is not putting into the operation of these stations the enthusiasm and the energy that is required, or, if they regard it as no part of their job&mdash;as they possibly do&mdash;to organise the production and supply of turf for those stations, then somebody must be given that job, whether it is the E.S.B. or a local organisation in each case, such as the county council or somebody like that.  I could not say offhand who should undertake it, but somebody should be given the job of organising resources, to get the peat men in these areas to appreciate the advantage it would be to them to have the stations there, because the presence of these stations would mean that a great amount of money would circulate in districts that badly need that sort of aid.</P>

      <P>I notice among the items mentioned that money was allocated towards the repair of the sea wall at Bray.  There is an area in Wexford to which we have drawn the Minister's attention on a number of occasions, and that is Rosslare, where we have the problem of erosion.  I have always held that the Minister has sufficient power, without legislation, to make a grant in a most serious and urgent matter and that there is nothing in the world to prevent him from doing so in this case.  I have always believed that the object originally was to have a fund available that would not otherwise be available for such works or matters of urgency and I want to suggest to the Minister that at this stage out of the new allocation, he should allocate some money for the erection of barriers at Rosslare to prevent the homes of over 1,000 people being washed away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could tell us if he actually has the necessary authority to do what <Col N="1071" /> Deputy Allen has suggested?  I believe he has, but I should like to have a definite assurance on that, because, if it is so, I think the National Development Fund could be spent in no better way than in preventing coastal erosion, preventing the island from getting smaller.  Deputy Allen has referred to Wexford, but we have the same problem in other parts of the country to a lesser degree.  In the little seacoast village where I live, over the past 20 years, approximately 50 yards of the land along the seacoast&mdash;that is, 50 yards in width&mdash;has disappeared, and if the same thing happens in the next 30 or 50 years, there is a possibility, a danger, of the road and the houses along the seacoast being eventually undermined and washed away.  It is a very serious problem and something which should be considered as coming under the National Development Fund and if money could be made available, I think it could be spent in no better way.</P>

      <P>There is a big difference between storm damage and coast erosion.  One is the thing you can do and that is that.  Coast erosion is something in regard to which the important point is the maintenance thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully:</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it could be put under the heading of coast erosion and there may be storm damage in this particular case also, that is, where a water supply, a water tower, exists pretty close to the seacoast and, unless a barrier is put up, <Col N="1072" /> in the course of time that water supply will be cut away or destroyed because of the effects of the sea.  Sometimes during severe storms the seacoast will lose three or four yards or again for six or eight or 12 months, it will not lose three inches, but gradually, in the one particular instance to which I am referring, the sea has been creeping in, and, while the installation of that water supply cost a very considerable amount of money, no attempt is being made to preserve it.  The county council say that coast erosion is not their responsibility and up to recently the Government said they had not responsibility for it, either.  If the National Development Fund can be used for that purpose, I think it should be used for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the encouragement of people close to the E.S.B. station to grow more turf than they need for themselves.  While I agree that every possible facility should be given to people living in those outlying areas who want to make extra money by cutting turf and selling it, no matter to whom they sell it, I do not think that somebody putting down roads is going to be sufficient encouragement to those people to cut that extra turf.  If what is suggested is some kind of a publicity campaign to cut more turf&mdash;we had &ldquo;Grow More Something&rdquo; before&mdash;it may possibly be a success, but I do not know whether Deputy Lemass was referring to it as the only way of encouraging turf production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that, in areas where there are boglands, a lot more money should be spent from the National Development Fund for the purpose of actually developing bogs generally.  I do know a number of people who, for a long time, have been cutting fuel for themselves and selling it and supplying turf over big areas, and they find that, during certain periods of the year, they cannot get near the bogs at all.  It is a great hardship on those people that they have to work in such conditions, while apparently no attempt whatever has been made to give them decent roads through the bogs.  I think they should be encouraged, whether there is a turf burning station near <Col N="1073" /> them or not, and that the bogs should be developed by having better roads made through them.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has not been mentioned here and perhaps, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you may rule that it does not actually come under this heading, but as we are talking about the National Development Fund at the present time, we know that British coal is getting extremely scarce, and is there any reason at all why the deposits of coal which have been worked before in this country and which could, with the expenditure of some money on them, be worked again should not be worked?  Why could not some of the money out of the National Development Fund be used to find out whether this coal would be a paying proposition?  I know numerous instances where there is no road to the old mine.  Some of them are open-cast mines, worked perhaps up to 50 years ago.  Coal out of these could be burned&mdash;I saw some of it recently myself&mdash;and while it does not make a wonderful fire, it is an improvement on the American coal we had up in the Park some years ago.  If an effort were made to have some of these mines inspected, it would be money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the point made by Deputy Lemass and also by Deputy Tully with regard to the utilisation of the National Development Fund for the improvement of bog roads.  I should like to support them. It should be appreciated that, during the emergency period, particularly in the early years, when we found ourselves in serious difficulties with regard to fuel supplies, county councils had to embark on schemes of production of turf by private methods and also by direct action schemes.  Due to the fact that heavy vehicles operated on some of our bog roads&mdash;even horse-drawn vehicles were used more frequently than they normally would be, for the reason that increased supplies of turf had been stacked on the roadside for dispatch to different parts of the country where fuel was not available&mdash; these roads suffered very seriously, and as far as I can gather no Department <Col N="1074" /> of State has taken the responsibility of putting these roads in order since.</P>
      <P>It is true that some of them&mdash;a very small percentage of them&mdash;have been put in order, but, indeed, it is a very small percentage.  I would urge upon the Minister that portion of this money could be spent in no better way than on the improvement of these roads. During the emergency, people on uneconomic holdings of land earned sums of £100, £150 and £200 annually in this sort of work.  I understand that it is proposed at a later date to erect at Bangor Erris in my constituency a turf-fired electricity station.  This is an area from which a considerable number of people emigrate to England annually.  I foresee that if hand-won turf is going to be used in that station, it will help to reduce the number of people who are forced to emigrate annually.</P>
      <P>During the emergency, these people enjoyed certain incomes from the private turf which they produced under emergency conditions.  When the emergency was over, the schemes of turf production almost ceased, which created a very serious problem in these areas.  The fact that we can keep our young people at home and employ them in their spare time on such schemes is of vital importance. Before the erection of the turf-fired electricity station, it is of the greatest importance that some attention should be paid to the roads in the Bangor Erris area, Achill, Ballycroy and other places which have been badly neglected by different State Departments for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>I urge on the Minister the importance of spending portion of the money as early as possible on works of that nature.  That will have the effect of saving certain Departments from providing dole and unemployment benefit for many of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of coast erosion was referred to by Deputy Allen and Deputy Tully and, in that connection, I wish to refer to the position at Lacken, Ballina. There the people are obliged to wade knee deep through tidal waters. In this year of 1956, it is a scandalous state of affairs to have people wading knee deep through tidal waters in <Col N="1075" /> order to go to Mass.  I am asking the Minister, as I have asked the Minister for Agriculture and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, to do something about this.  These latter told me that the matter was beyond the scope of their Departments. I then tried to interest the Department of the Minister for Agriculture, on the ground that a certain acreage of land would be reclaimed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance told me that it was beyond the scope of his Department, but it ought to be within the scope of some Department and, accordingly, I think that portion of this £3,000,000 which the Minister is seeking in connection with the National Development Fund could be spent in no better way than providing some bridge or some type of breakwater to prevent the tidal waters from flowing in at Lacken.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance would direct his engineers to see the place for themselves, I am positive they would do something.  The people are enduring hardships, as their ancestors before them had to endure them.  The Minister should take immediate steps to remedy this situation, and I urge him to use this fund, in view of the fact that I have been turned down on this matter by other Departments.  Portion of this fund should be utilised for an important purpose of this kind.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider my proposal.  Let me repeat that the place to which I refer is Lacken, Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked over the list of allocations in connection with this fund and I am sure the House could not disagree with any of the items. They are all very praiseworthy objects which will bring increased revenue to every person in the State in the years to come.  I notice that the sum of £79,000 was allocated to the improvement of Limerick Harbour.  I am sure this will bring to the port of Limerick an increased tonnage in imports and exports each year and create greater opportunities in regard to trade, commerce and employment for the people of that city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> I, however, would like to have seen an item on the list for Drogheda Harbour, because at the moment the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners, of which I am a member, are faced with a rather extraordinary situation.  We have a reasonably good surplus of revenue over expenditure.  We are not bankrupt and the harbour is flourishing. Indeed, the harbour will and must flourish, because, as Dublin becomes the bottleneck, the nearest, best and most convenient centre of industry is Drogheda.  From Drogheda will go many products and to Drogheda will come many business men.  There is no question about that, but the state of the harbour at the moment can and will retard it.</P>
    <P>In conversation with any old sailor or person dealing in coal, you will be told the name, tonnage and draught of ten or 20 vessels which sailed up to Drogheda not so many years ago and which could not enter the port to-day. Two or three ships come on occasions weekly.  They are Dutch vessels and the stage is now being reached at which these boats can come up the river only during a certain period. That is a very serious and extraordinary situation for a port like Drogheda.  The largest vessel that I have seen come to Drogheda port over the past few months is the S.S. <i>Menapia.</i>  A few years ago, this vessel could enter Drogheda port without difficulty.</P>
    <P>At the moment she comes in at exceedingly high tide and is the cause and subject of quite a lot of controversy between her master and the pilots.  Faced with this situation, we wish to purchase a dredger of our own. Yesterday morning at a meeting of Drogheda Harbour Commissioners I was shocked to hear our harbour master verify what I had heard him say in conversation about three weeks before, namely that if the dredger were purchased and delivered tomorrow, it would have before it 15 years' work.  We want to get a grant for the purchase of this dredger, and it may well be that at a special meeting next Friday night we will seek a further grant for immediate work on the river, because we believe in Drogheda.  We believe it has a great <Col N="1077" /> future as a centre of industry, and that as Dublin becomes more and more the bottleneck it practically is at the moment, more and more heavy industries will come to Drogheda, and all we need is a sound and safe port to make sure that without the slightest shadow of doubt, prosperity and employment shall abound for all.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased to see the amount of the allocation made in this list to the Department of Agriculture, and particularly pleased to see the biggest one, for the Department's schools and educational services, namely, a sum of £150,000.  The greatest need we have to-day in agriculture is education, and the cheapest thing we can buy is education.  Macra na Feirme and kindred organisations, not the least of which is Muintir na Tíre, have done much, but without the necessary finance, schools and educational spare-time activities, not a great deal can be done.  Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre can provide the background and the base upon which we can build, but it is necessary that we have a good educational set-up within the Department of Agriculture. The advance of £150,000 from the National Development Fund will, I believe, bring back to us a much greater sum in increased earnings from agriculture.  We are not a rich nation. We cannot even supply the worldly goods we would like to put into agriculture, but, at least as long as the Minister is in his chair, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, the know-how will not be denied the average farmer of to-day.</P>
    <P>Similarly I am very pleased to see that there is a small grant for An Óige, because we do want to broaden our people's minds and to see people get around.  As things stand at the moment, a holiday away from home is very often beyond the reach of many of us.  An Óige performs a very useful function, but, again, any association such as An Óige must be hampered by lack of funds.  A grant of £29,000 to An Óige is quite a lot of money, because they do not believe in spending money wantonly.  If anybody has been in an An Óige hostel they will know that there, there is plain, decent comfort, <Col N="1078" /> and that the facilities to cook are provided.  Beyond that, the traveller who travels with the An Óige badge on his breast gets nothing, and in truth he needs nothing, because nine times out of ten he is a young virile person on a bicycle who can well fend for himself.</P>
    <P>The roads to the E.S.B. turf stations, I am sure, are badly needed.  We all saw during the war how the turf lorries could cut up the ground and could even destroy our county roads.  Turf lorries are heavily loaded vehicles, and very often adhering to them is quite a lot of mud and slime.  There is nothing so bad for a road, except a cement road&mdash; and I include in the list roads very severely damaged by wet mud&mdash;as honest-to-God muck.  It leaves a road, even a tarmacadam road, in a bad condition, and engineers will tell you that the farmer's tractor which comes out of the gate with half a hundredweight or hundredweight of muck adhering to its wheels, which it leaves behind to be beaten down into the road by following vehicles, does more damage than a farmer's tractor with spade lugs.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say, except again to impress on the Minister that, whilst it is not on this list, I hope that a grant for the improvement of Drogheda Harbour will be on the following list.  It is absolutely number one priority in my constituency, and I will fight as hard as I can for it.  I know that while the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are in their chairs as Ministers in their respective Departments, we will not stand very long unanswered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can all agree with the Minister for Finance that as far as possible the expenditure under the National Development Fund Vote should aim at being of a strictly productive character.  I take it that what the Minister means by &ldquo;productive&rdquo; in that case is something which will be of permanent benefit, help to create wealth and benefit the economy of the country, as well as the standard of living of the people incidentally.  The Minister, I think, will find a good measure of support from all sides of the House in his views that we should <Col N="1079" /> aim as far as possible at devoting the expenditure under this Vote to productive work, meaning &ldquo;productive&rdquo; in the narrowest sense, if you like, but, as I take it, the best sense.  If we ourselves were personally responsible and were expending the money as proprietors or managing directors of businesses, that is the particular way in which we would spend it so that it would be of most benefit to our business or our affairs&mdash;not merely spending it so as to create a splash.</P>
      <P>Of course when the fund was established it was certainly the intention that the aim should be to give employment as far as possible, but I think I can say without fear of contradiction that, as well as having regard to the productive character of the enterprise or the undertaking, the Government felt that it should not be the position that the National Development Fund would take on the normal responsibilities of either the central administration or the local authority.  It would be unfortunate if the discussion on the Estimate were to take the line that the Deputies from all the constituencies had to get up here, one after the other, and point to particular works or projects in their constituencies that they thought might be fitted in under this Vote.  I take it that works of that character might be more fitly discussed under the different Estimates, such as those for the Department of Local Government, or Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Fisheries and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as the productive aim, the objective in regard to the Estimate for the National Development Fund would be to initiate, encourage and foster undertakings or works of a productive nature that would not otherwise be undertaken.  Of course, there are works that would give employment for which particular authorities, either local or national, have refused to take responsibility.  Although it might be argued that they have responsibilities in connection with drainage or road works or even erosion&mdash;where erosion is going to cause damage to property or even, perhaps, danger to life&mdash;I take it that these well-discussed and well-travelled <Col N="1080" /> by-ways, which we are in the habit of bringing up here year after year, were not the types of work which the National Development Fund was intended to cover and that they should be the responsibility either of the local authorities or of the central authority in cases where, as in that of the Office of Public Works, it can be shown that there is a definite responsibility upon them.</P>
    <P>The list the Minister was good enough to give in reply to a question by Deputy Aiken disclosed that, of the £250,000 allocated for Gaeltacht projects before the change of Government, only £111,000 has been expended so far.  Perhaps the Minister would be able to indicate to us, in his concluding remarks, what the projects were and what the other projects are.  If it is not the position that all the projects generally are in course of execution and that the £111,000 is in respect of the fact that they are not all completed, if it is the case that some projects have, however, been undertaken and others for which money has been allocated have not been commenced, would the Minister be good enough to specify the two classes?</P>
    <P>Listening to the claims for harbours throughout the country and noting the large sums which have been allocated for the metropolitan harbour here and for the important Cork harbour one is naturally interested to know the position as regards our fishing harbours and the programme of fishery development which the former Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley, had under consideration and to which I have no doubt the Government has given attention, during the past 18 months.  One naturally wonders whether any of these projects for the expenditure of money on local fishing harbours, particularly in the West but also in the South, are included in any portion of the schedules which the Minister has been good enough to furnish to us.</P>
    <P>I take it that regard is had to the geographical distribution of the moneys in so far as the other objectives which I have mentioned are concerned&mdash;objectives which, if they are accepted by the Government must, of <Col N="1081" /> course, be the ones which the Minister will primarily bear in mind.  It would be natural that in tourist areas and areas where the need for employment is greatest and where the toll of emigration is heaviest there should be a general feeling that the utmost possible would be done when works such as the improvement of harbours, which might help the fishing industry, are in contemplation. They are one of the greatest natural assets we have and unfortunately, I think we have not been doing enough in that respect. The work should go side by side, really, with the work of agricultural development, agricultural research and agricultural expansion generally.</P>
    <P>Precisely the same arguments hold where fisheries are concerned though fisheries are not as important in the national economy when we consider the tremendous advantage that the coastal areas have&mdash;&ldquo;the millions of acres of fisheries&rdquo; as has well been said, that we have, the fishing waters which are available at our doorsteps. We are an island nation, and with the high cost of food and the anxiety about the provision of food generally, it is certainly mystifying, to say the least of it, why greater energy and thought are not given to this very important matter of the development of fisheries by every possible means.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask also whether there are any other industries in question in connection with the congested areas.  I asked whether there is provision for fishery development and harbour development and, side by side with that, whether there is any provision for any other industry such as the tomato-growing, industry&mdash;whether that appears under any heading.  The Minister has told us that most of the money that has been granted by this House has been allocated.  It has been allocated but it has not, of course, been expended.  With regard to the schemes that were approved, for example, before the change of Government, according to the reply to Deputy Aiken's question to-day, the total amounts that were allocated were about £6,500,000.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister, when he was introducing this Estimate, <Col N="1082" /> that the incoming Government reduced that total to about £5,500,000, of which about £3,600,000 has been expended. One wonders, however, why schemes that were approved so long ago as June, 1954, and even earlier, have not been carried forward to a greater extent than the proportion of £3.6 million out of £5.5 million or £5.6 million.  With regard to the amount provided for road works, for example &mdash;not the total but a very substantial amount&mdash;there was a reduction of £400,000 but nevertheless about £2,300,000 was expended on road works and £100,000 was expended under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Then, further down, we find that about £900,000 was spent on special employment schemes.</P>
    <P>It would seem, therefore, that very large sums are being spent on road works and employment schemes of a purely local character and not enough, I think, is being spent in proportion on the projects which could really be described as productive in the proper sense, whether they come under the aegis of industry and commerce or agriculture.  For example, in the list under agriculture, the total amount, including £600,000 for the eradication of bovine T.B., which the Government allocated for these agricultural schemes, schemes which had been approved prior to 2nd June, 1954, was over £1,000,000; but the amount expended to date is only £112,000, or about one-tenth of that sum.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to make an excuse with regard to the later agricultural items on the list of schemes approved since 2nd June, 1954, amounting to £556,000, of which only about £10,000 has been expended.  But one wonders whether the Minister is really sincere and whether any energy is being displayed in pushing forward these schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what has been said about the necessity for helping our educational institutions.  In the list before us, which was given to us to-day, it is of course only the agricultural schools and certain institutions under the control of the Department of Agriculture which appear; but if we are to give education its proper standing and its proper value, and to <Col N="1083" /> recognise that perhaps no money expended on any aspect of national work would be really so productive or so valuable to the future of our country as money well spent on educational development, we could&mdash;certainly I could&mdash;make a case to the Minister for doing more for technical education and research in various ways.  I think for the moment we might just ask him what exactly he has in mind with regard to the branch of our economy which he has stressed as being of particular interest to him, namely, agriculture.  In connection with agricultural education and research, what exactly has he in mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>When this fund was established, it had a dual purpose.  One was to help in getting greater production from agriculture and the other was to provide more employment.  From the reply to the question put to the Minister to-day I see now that the leaning is in one direction, namely, to provide employment.  The Minister has been around the country.  He has been talking at various places.  All his arguments have been based on greater production; if this country is to survive, there must be greater agricultural production.  Yet, here, when it is within the province of the Minister and the Government to help to get greater agricultural production, they have neglected to do so.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office, there were productive schemes before them.  Some of those schemes have been approved.  Others have not been approved because other Departments had come in and were entitled to a share of the fund.  Surely, the schemes that were put forward and that had been prepared by Agriculture were deserving of attention; and, if the Minister and his colleagues were sincere and were determined to get greater production, they would have examined these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals covered a variety of schemes.  There were to be, for instance, more demonstration plots and pilot farms.  Provision had been made for the eradication of bovine T.B. Preparations had been made and plans prepared for units of the agricultural <Col N="1084" /> institute; buildings and equipment for the Department's existing agricultural schools and farms; private agricultural schools and rural domestic economy schools were to get grants; there were to be live-stock progeny testing stations for cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry; grants for university research; additional laboratory facilities; production of fertilisers and feeding stuffs; a control station for eggs and poultry; the establishment of a fish farm; facilities for the drying and storage of grain; expansion of veterinary facilities; reclamation of marginal land and the improvement of hill grazing, mostly in the Gaeltacht and congested areas; improved facilities under the farm buildings and farm water supply schemes; disposal of sewage at creameries; heating of Gaeltacht glasshouses; grants for the establishment of factories for the production of fancy cheese; grants and loans to machinery contractors for certain machinery, such as lime and manure distributors; the provision of facilities for the drying and storage of onions; storage facilities for seed and ware potatoes; provision for tomato houses at power stations; poultry development in Connemara; and the provision of facilities for the production of foundation stocks of seed.</P>
    <P>These schemes and proposals were all there at the disposal of the present Government.  Every one was designed for the purpose of increasing agricultural production.  What do we find to-day? We find that, out of all the approved schemes, approved prior to 2nd June, 1954, out of over £1,000,000 provided, only £122,000, including what was approved since 2nd June, 1954, amounting to £9,700, has been spent to encourage agricultural production. Is there any sincerity in the statements made by the Minister and his colleagues when they go around the country telling the people they are making every effort to increase agricultural production and that, unless we increase agricultural production, this nation is doomed?  When they had an opportunity of increasing production, they neglected to avail of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>One of the most important schemes approved prior to June, 1954, was that <Col N="1085" /> in connection with progeny testing. Progeny testing in relation to pigs could be regarded as being of the most vital importance.  At that time, the Dutch and the Danes were capturing the British market.  The Danes have proved the value of progeny testing. We had made preparations to have progeny testing stations erected here. We knew we had the pigs.  We had the large White, which was as suitable as the Landrace they had in Denmark. We knew that we had good strains&mdash; the Large White York&mdash;here in the country, some of them equal to the best Landrace that could be found in Denmark.  It was a matter of testing them out and finding the best of that Large White York, so that our farmers would be able to compete with the Danes and with the Dutch in the British market.  We failed to do so.</P>
    <P>What do we find now?  We find now that, instead of 1,000,000 pigs that were killed in the factories in the years 1953 and 1954, that number has dwindled down to 5,000 or 6,000.  If it continues, the pig industry in this country is killed.  We could have avoided that in 1954 by erecting these progeny testing stations.  That was one of our failures.  We did not do anything about it.  We have not spent a shilling on it&mdash;not one shilling.  The same thing applies as far as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The buildings to carry out the work&mdash;the specifications were already in the Department.  These specifications had come from Denmark; everything was ready for the erection of that progeny testing station; but there was nothing done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, sheep&mdash;another important factor in the country.  We do know that <Col N="1086" /> the wool produced in this country is of an inferior quality.  We know that we have a market in America, but it is not for the manufacture of the highest quality cloths, and some time ago there was even a difficulty in selling it in that market.  We want to improve the wool on our sheep and that can be done in our progeny testing stations.  We can have our wool graded up and we can find out if we can produce more mutton on these sheep.  But it is only by progeny testing that you can do it.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the same thing applying to cattle.  We are in greater difficulty with regard to them than with any other of our live stock here at home.  We have so many breeds&mdash;milk breeds and beef breeds&mdash;that, if we are going to capture the beef market, we must find out which is the best animal to breed from, the most economical, the one that produces the highest quality beef, the one that is going to be of best value to our people. The same thing applies as far as milk is concerned.  We want to find the most economical cow, and it is only through testing that these things are going to be discovered, and, as I have already said, we in our time had made provision for a start on that.  But, of the £1,000,000 allocated by the Fianna Fáil Government, prior to the 2nd June, 1954, we have spent £111,000 or £112,000.</P>
    <P>What did we spend it on?  We spent £7,150 on the fish farm, for which we had allocated £25,000; we spent nothing on progeny testing and nothing on special veterinary research; on foundation stocks of seeds, out of £150,000, we have spent £31,000; on artificial insemination, out of £40,000, we have spent £2,750; and, on bovine T.B. eradication, for which we had made £600,000 available, we have spent the sum of £71,200.  Compare these amounts we have spent on this most important industry&mdash;the one from which the Minister is hoping to get sufficient money to balance his Budget, to get more prosperity for our people&mdash; with what we have spent on relief schemes and on road schemes.  We have been able to spend £2,295,129 on these schemes.  Under the Local <Col N="1087" /> Authorities (Works) Act, we have been able to spend £100,000.</P>

You spent £900,000 on relief schemes&mdash;almost as much on relief schemes as you spent on agriculture and agricultural development&mdash;and yet we hear the Minister shouting for greater production in agriculture from every platform in the country&mdash;our farmers must produce more, otherwise this country is gone.  And this is the assistance the Government has given: spending almost as much money on relief schemes as was spent on agriculture. Does it not show the sincerity behind all the statements that have been made up and down the country from every platform and at every Chamber of Commerce meeting?  Does it not show the sincerity behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many schemes&mdash;the heating of glasshouses, for instance.  We know that, in Donegal and Connemara, the one great difficulty for our people who have glasshouses is that they have not tomatoes on the market at the right time.  They are about two months too late.  The only way in which they can have tomatoes at a time when there is a demand for them, when there is very little opposition&mdash;at least two months earlier than they come in &mdash;is by heating the glasshouses. Experiments are being carried out, and I understand that the experiments have been successful, but the amount of money that is being spent on these experiments and the amount of money <Col N="1088" /> being spent on the installation of heating apparatus in these areas is not even mentioned here.  Gaeltacht projects are there, but we do not know whether they are included in that or not.  But we do find that the amount allocated to orchard planting in the Dungarvan district is £32,000&mdash;£32,000 to grow more apples.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not keep Deputy Donegan, or the other Deputies who wish to speak, very long.  Last week, I was endeavouring to convince the Deputies who put their names to this motion that, although they may in their own hearts believe that the implementation of this motion through legislation would help the ordinary man in the rural areas who has an interest in sport, its real effect would be to preserve intact the privileges which have been bestowed on the gentry, as I described them, in this country.</P>
      <P>I really want to be very fair to Deputy Finlay and Deputy Donegan on this.  It is rather difficult to criticise this motion as severely as I would like in view of the fact that I understand myself what Deputies Donegan and Finlay desire to do.  But my criticism is that what they really desire to see accomplished will not happen if this motion is accepted.  That is my charitable interpretation of their minds.  If I am to deal with the motion on the face of it, there is no doubt whatever that the case which can be put forward against acceptance is a very strong one.  Apart altogether from conferring a benefit on the privileged section in this country and others that are not dwelling here, I maintain that it shows no constructive approach towards the real preservation of game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain penalties included <Col N="1090" /> in this motion for a breach of the legislation if such is enacted.  I want seriously to ask those Deputies, some of whom are legal men well acquainted with drafting Bills, how they propose to implement those penalties or have them carried into effect?  Legislation that cannot be enforced is bad legislation, as we all know.  We have the example in many spheres, for instance in regard to the licensing laws, which are more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  If the penalties imposed and the restrictions suggested in this motion are put into the form of legislation there will be no respect in the rural areas for that type of legislation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is made that no game be sold until 21 days have elapsed from the opening date of the season.  Let us take the position of an hotel that has a certain extent of rough shooting, its own preserve.  A number of guests stay in that hotel and on the first day the season opens four or five of the guests have a considerable bag.  They are not going to eat all the birds they shoot. Is it suggested that some of these sportsmen&mdash;many of them perhaps are men who have been invited in by the hotel proprietor for the shoot&mdash;will not be entitled to sell what they shoot?  Is it suggested that from the opening day of the shoot, if there is game on the menu in every hotel, an inspector or member of the Garda Síochána must walk into that hotel and ask the proprietor: &ldquo;Where did you get that pheasant that I see Mr. So-and-So eating for his lunch?&rdquo;  Is that not the logical follow-up to a measure like this?  The proposal to put a penalty on the game dealer or the hotel proprietor is nonsensical.</P>
    <P>The individual who goes out a day before the opening day of a shoot is a man for whom I have no respect and I believe that that individual&mdash;describe him in any terms you like&mdash;is not popular with sportsmen down the country.  I want to see that gentleman's activities restricted, the gentleman who goes out and has his own unofficial shoot the day before the opening of the season.  I want to see him dealt with, but I am convinced that this is not the way to deal with him. In trying to deal with that gentleman <Col N="1091" /> under this motion you are hitting the decent sportsman as a whole down the country.</P>
    <P>The right way to deal with that person is this.  If you have formed in a rural area a gun club with a good secretary and a good committee who are interested in having a shoot over a certain area, those men will get the co-operation of the local farmers.  Many of the local farmers will be members of this gun club and I may tell you, if the local farmers have themselves an interest in the shoot, they will ensure that no illegal shooting takes place the night before the opening, because it is to their own benefit.  But if you introduce legislation that will confer a benefit on the gentry or on the people behind the demesne walls, you will lose the sympathy of the ordinary man down the country who will say: &ldquo;I do not mind So-and-So getting all he can out of that demesne.  I cannot shoot in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I dealt last week with the fundamental trouble in regard to both game and fishing, and said that there is no appreciation or respect in Ireland for either or those forms of sport for the simple reason that when land division and the allocation of bogs took place, the tenants were not vested with the shooting and fishing rights that were attached to their holdings.  If that had been done at the time, the best protection against poachers would be the smallholder.  If the smallholder has ten or 15 acres of bog on which there is game, he will ensure that no poacher will get in before him.  If the small farmer finds that he has only the agricultural rights on the land and that the fishing and shooting rights are held by Colonel So-and-So in London, he will not give a damn who shoots over his stretch of bog or land and, the remedy sought in this motion for the depletion of game will prove worse than the evil itself.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly convinced that the Minister, being a very sensible man, has not the slightest intention of accepting the motion.  Therefore, I do not propose to delay much longer.  The movers of the motion want the opening day for pheasant shooting changed <Col N="1092" /> from 15th October to 1st November.  I listened very carefully to the reasons outlined by Deputies as to the desirability of making that change.  To give them their due, they suggested that they would leave this as an open matter.  I have not got any reason for the suggestion of the 1st November as the opening day for pheasant shooting. Pheasant shooting is very attractive and pheasant is a very attractive meal. The argument is put forward that, very often, pheasant hatch and rear their young away from the preserve, and that, around the end of October and very early in November, the old birds take the young into the preserve.  That is a point of view that is very strongly held.  If that point of view is maintained, on whom will we confer the benefit by changing the date from 15th October to 1st November?  Put it this way: the pheasants will hatch the young outside the preserve or demesne, and, around the end of October, will bring the youngsters into the demesne where Colonel So-and-So will have arrived from London or a senior counsel will come down from Dublin and have his pot at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of views on this.  I should like the Deputies who put down the motion to consider my suggestion, that, instead of dealing with this problem of game rights and the preservation of game and so forth in a limited way, why not ask the Minister to go the whole hog and carry out an investigation into the whole problem of game <Col N="1093" /> and fishing rights?  It may sound rather time at this stage to suggest that a commission should be set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is no shortage of commissions, but I do believe that it is necessary to make changes with regard to the whole situation.  We should not confine the changes to sporting rights.  Fishing rights should be included.  The basis of any inquiry should be that the desirable situation we should like to see established is that the shooting and fishing rights be vested in the holders in Ireland, the powers vested in the Land Commission and other bodies acquired and these rights handed over to the small farmers and the big farmers.  The greatest incentive that can be given to the development of these two desirable sports is to give the right to the occupiers of the holdings.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that if the Minister is not prepared&mdash;I hope he is not&mdash;to accept the motion, he should throw out the offer to the Deputies concerned to put down another motion and widen the scope of the discussion, so that practical steps may be taken to deal with the problem at the base.  If that is done, I have no doubt that such a motion will get the support of all Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has asked a number of questions in relation to the attitude of Deputies supporting this motion.  The answer to a great number of Deputy McQuillan's questions is that the motion has nothing to do with them, good, bad or indifferent.  This motion was put down for the purpose of dealing with the question of preserving the stock of game birds in this country and preventing poaching.  It was not intended to deal with sporting rights. It was not intended to seek a commission to examine the position regarding fisheries, sporting or shooting rights generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a great many of the difficulties which Deputy McQuillan foresees are unreal difficulties if he relates them <Col N="1094" /> to this motion.  They are difficulties that are in existence at the moment and with which this motion does not deal at all.  I should like at the outset to try to emphasise a distinction which has been referred to by Deputies Finlay and Donegan.  In this motion we are endeavouring to deal with one kind of poacher only&mdash;that is the person who commits the offence of shooting and taking game out of season.</P>
    <P>We are not endeavouring to make any suggestions whatever with regard to the other type of poaching&mdash;the person you may call a poacher who trespasses in pursuit of game.  The person who trespasses is doing an injury to somebody else but it lies between the two parties.  If I trespass on Deputy McQuillan's land, I am injuring Deputy McQuillan.  Deputy McQuillan has a grievance against me. Deputy McQuillan can take his remedy but the person who would shoot out of season is not merely injuring some other individual; he is cheating the entire community and he can be properly dubbed a cheater and a person who is double-crossing every other person interested in this type of sport.</P>
    <P>I want to make that distinction quite clear because it is a distinction which is very often overlooked when people talk about poaching.  People very often refer to the person who has been guilty of the offence of trespassing and while trespassing shooting game on somebody's land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to debate this on the basis of question and answer.  If you accept the motion and the spirit behind it, you are making an honest effort to crush out and take away the fruits from the man who will deliberately go in before the season opens and cheat his neighbour and everybody else interested in preserving the stock of game birds in this country.  I have taken the case of two people who were poaching in the sense of trespassing. I do not hold a brief for either but I would far prefer to stand over the man who is at least prepared to wait to do the honest and decent thing before he does his trespassing. That, I think, is an important point which should be borne in mind.  Under this motion, we are endeavouring to deal only with the activities of the person I have described as a cheater&mdash;the individual who endeavours to shoot or take game out of season.</P>

I do not say this in criticism of the Minister or of his officials. I think, however, it would be preferable if the whole question of game protection were taken away from the Department of Justice and given, say, to the Department of Agriculture, because a number of the questions that have been raised on this motion and which must be raised in any discussion on game protection are questions which are linked to a great extent with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have borne in mind Deputy McQuillan's and Deputy Corry's points. They quite properly pointed to the problem of the landowners, the farmers throughout the country.  In many instances the co-operation of these people is very readily forthcoming. Deputy Corry's argument about the fact that you are preventing the farmer from protecting his barley or <Col N="1097" /> oats crop by putting back the duck-shooting date to the 1st September may be a fair one.  I know that in some parts of the country it would be a fair argument but I want to point out that we introduced this motion for the purpose of dealing with the preservation of game birds.</P>
    <P>We did not introduce the motion from the point of view of protecting the crop of barley and still less for the purpose of protecting the poachers. We introduced it for the purpose of preserving the stock of game birds. However, Deputy Corry made that point and I think that in some parts of the country it is a point of view that is of much importance and one that would have to be taken into account. If implemented in full, this motion would not rule out the possibility of taking into account points such as that made by Deputy Corry even under the existing law&mdash;under the Act of 1930. Provision is made, even where there is a Game Protection Order in force, for securing the written permission of the Garda superintendent in any given area to take or shoot game during the existence of that Order.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be extending any great licence to enable the farmers in those localities to have a shot at duck in August even if the duck shooting season does not come into operation until the 1st September.  I mention that for the purpose of showing that there is not any real obstacle to the motion in the point of view put forward by Deputy Corry.  One thing is significant in the discussion on this motion and it is that there seems to be agreement on all sides that it is necessary to do something in order to preserve the stock of game birds in this country.  It seems to be agreed on all sides that the depletion of the stock of game birds has been going on for some time and it certainly has been aggravated in the last year or two by the scourge of myxomatosis.  That accelerated the process, I think, in two ways&mdash;one, by depriving the fox population of its natural diet, with the result that foxes turned their attention to a very great degree to feathered game and, two, by bringing about the situation where the holder of a gun <Col N="1098" /> certificate, a person who in past years was content to go out after rabbits, was forced into a concentration on feathered game.  In the past couple of years, that situation has developed and, I think, has done a great deal to accelerate the depletion of the stock of game birds.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what Deputy Finlay and Deputy Donegan have said. They have dealt in detail with a number of the reasons which have brought about the present situation.  I think they have covered that ground adequately.  The position is that the depletion of the stock of game birds has taken place, and, if we want to do anything at all, some step must be taken.  If it were left to me to suggest what is the most important step that should be taken, I do not believe that setting up a commission would give the answer.  I think that it would be helpful to take this whole affair out of the Department of Justice and give it to the Department of Agriculture to deal with.</P>

      <P>With regard to the actual motion, Deputy McQuillan is disturbed about the 21 days, for the reasons he has given.  I do not agree with his reasoning.  Deputy Corry, while he criticised the motion, did concede that there was some merit in the proposal and he stated that, if instead of the 21 days suggested, there should be this period of prohibition for a week only, he would support it.  I want to say, in relation to the 21 days, my own personal view is that that would be the minimum effective period, but there is nothing particularly sacrosanct about the period of 21 days and I would be happy if the Minister would agree to introduce this prohibition clause, even for a period of seven days.  I do not believe seven days would fill the bill at all.  Nowadays, with a system of cold rooms and refrigeration and so on, birds can be kept indefinitely.  In any event, as Deputy Finlay pointed out, with most of the wild birds or game birds that you shoot in this country, you must hang them for a period of about ten days before they <Col N="1099" /> are in proper condition for eating, and for that reason I do not think that a period as short as seven days would be sufficient, but it would help.  Even if the Minister did agree to some period of prohibition, I think those of us who put our names to this motion would feel that we had achieved something.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan raised another point with regard to the opening of the pheasant season and I think the argument he made is a valid argument, as I said in interjection to him. I think it is a valid argument against pushing the opening of the pheasant season back to the 1st November. Again it is a question of one's point of view, because if you look at this motion from the point of view of endeavouring to do something to preserve stocks of game birds in this country, then Deputy McQuillan's argument is not an adequate one; but if you view it from the point of view of trying to balance up the shooting opportunities as between the bigger and smaller people in the community, then I think there is a lot to be said for it.</P>
      <P>I think it is true that when the harder weather comes, the young pheasants go back into the more heavily wooded country and, by reason of that fact, the later you leave the opening season, the more you are favouring the person who is fortunate enough and wealthy enough to own a preserve or to be able to rent one.  I see that that argument does exist and I concede that Deputy McQuillan is right in it, but I want to point out that he is wrong, if you are looking at it again from the point of view of trying to preserve the stock of game.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy looks back over what has happened in this country even in recent years he <Col N="1100" /> will see that there has been a complete prohibition on the shooting of hen pheasants for some years past.  That has done a lot of good.  Most people who go out with a gun nowadays will see anything from six to eight hen pheasants for every one cock they see. It has preserved the population of hen pheasants, and if there was complete prohibition on shooting of either cock or hen pheasants for three or four years, I believe it would bring back the pheasant population of this country to a very great extent.  That was done in the case of partridge and for a number of years the shooting of partridge was completely prohibited.  I do not know that the prohibition was left on sufficiently long, but, for the last few years, the open season for partridge has been only one month, and I do not think any great damage is done within the month.  Partridge in many parts of the country, in the west of Ireland particularly&mdash;I think I am right in saying&mdash;had practically died out.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the 21 days.  With regard to section (b) of this motion, there is not really any great justification for leaving grouse out of this motion.  The only reason that is done was that the 12th August has been the traditional opening day for grouse shooting practically from time immemorial, and we felt that if we suggested that that should be altered, many people would feel it was too drastic a break with tradition.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there is anything else requiring to be said on this motion. I should like to assure Deputy McQuillan that this motion has some merit that should appeal to the Minister and to the Government, and it is this, that the implementation of this motion would not cost one penny piece. We are not asking for money to be spent.  Other Departments of the Government are spending money endeavouring to preserve the stock of game birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Fáilte have initiated a scheme of giving hoteliers pheasants' eggs for hatching and rearing.  Money is being spent and the attention of the Tourist Board has been drawn to the fact that this depletion has been going on for some time and that it is necessary to do something about it.  I believe <Col N="1101" /> that if this motion is implemented, even in a modified form, the House will be doing something about it and doing that without costing the people as much as a penny piece.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked how you would be able to implement the penalty provisions of this motion if the motion were adopted.  That would be the least of our worries.  Under Section 17, I think, of the present Game Preservation Act, 1930, the penalties we suggest are already there, the only difference being that they are discretionary. We suggest that for the particular offence of taking, selling or buying game out of season there should be a suspension which, for a particular period, would be obligatory.  In other words, that to that extent, and in relation to that offence only, the discretion which at present exists under Section 17 of the 1930 Act should be withdrawn from the district justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I did not follow in detail the discussions on this motion but, having read it, I have a certain amount of sympathy with what the movers are trying to achieve.  I have a feeling that we are putting the cart before the horse in connection with the whole question.  I realise that the matter of our game rights could be a matter of great national importance.  In addition to our inland fisheries, which we have been neglecting very much up to very recent times, the game rights are most important from a tourist point of view as well as from the point of view of the local man with his gun.  They could be made an attraction in this country and a very good inducement from the tourist point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole trouble with this matter is largely bound up with the history of this country.  The trouble confronting people interested in running game clubs is the fact that, by virtue of our history, there is a strong public opinion which is very much opposed to preservation because the preserves in the main were behind the big walls of the estates throughout the length and breadth of the land.  You have throughout the country a certain amount of public opinion in favour of the poacher when he gets his <Col N="1102" /> chance.  Consequently, when you have the remnants of the &ldquo;Big Houses&rdquo; carrying out their shoots you have the ordinary local man waiting outside the walls with his gun to have a crack at the pheasants when they come out in the open from behind the demesne walls.</P>
    <P>In the case of fishing, you have an Inland Fisheries Trust, and something of the same kind is needed for gaming. Until we have a national board to take over gaming rights as a whole, so that ordinary &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; gun and game clubs can get a lease of the shooting rights from such a national board, we are largely wasting our time in discussing either the prevention of poaching or stopping people shooting out of season.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why, if the importance of this matter is recognised by the Government, some lead should not be given by setting up some body to acquire the game rights in the whole country.  The system at the present moment is completely unworkable, no matter how local clubs interested in the matter may try to operate preserves or preserve shoots.  In one stretch of the country, you have a section of land in which the tenants who own the land also own the game rights.  Mixed up with that you have another section of land where the game rights are reserved to the Land Commission. That body leases the game rights rather peculiarly from time to time for reasons which nobody but the Land Commission can understand.</P>
    <P>You have a third section where the demesne lord of the manor still exists and has his own preserves.  Naturally enough, people living near him do not forget the time when it was an offence, for which you could be transported or possibly hanged, to take anything off one of these preserves behind the big wall.  That feeling is still there and must be got rid of before you can have any kind of general satisfaction as far as this whole question is concerned.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible in my view, no matter how you amend the law or how severe you make the penalties, to improve the position in view of the present chaotic state of the whole business.  In many cases the Land <Col N="1103" /> Commission, on the acquisition of estates, have reserved the game rights for themselves, their assignees or their nominees for the future and I can see no reason why, through legislation, the game rights of the whole State should not be nationalised.  Having nationalised the game rights, the Government should lease out their rights to local democratic gun and game clubs just the same as fishing clubs can now acquire a certain amount of fishing.</P>
    <P>It is only by democratising the whole business and enabling the ordinary man in the street to come into a gun and game club and, through the gun and game club, enabling him to get shooting rights and in that way build up a healthy public opinion that you will make it the duty of everybody to protect game.  It is only by creating a healthy public opinion you can do that.</P>
    <P>As far as the fisheries are concerned, this House, as long ago as 1939, took over the power to acquire inland fisheries and salmon fisheries.  It was expected at the time of the passage of that legislation through this House that this country long ago would have taken over many of these fisheries and that ordinary people could fish rivers flowing through their own land.  Unfortunately, that day has not come.</P>

      <P>The question of fisheries does not arise on this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that the same considerations would not apply if the State nationalised game.  The obvious reason why the legislation enacted by this House was not given effect to in the case of fisheries was the question of the cost. To take over many of the fisheries would cost millions, whereas in nationalising game it would in my view, cost little or nothing because you have not the big commercial interests concerned with game that are concerned with fisheries.  It would be a question purely of passing legislation and the amount of compensation that could possibly be claimed by many of these people with preserves would be largely nominal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> That is why I am suggesting that here is something that the State could well nationalise without any great cost to the taxpayer.  I believe that unless and until this is done on a national scale&mdash;so that the one body will have control and you will not have, as I have pointed out, three or four different interests having gaming rights in the very same townland&mdash;it will be completely impossible either to preserve game in this country or to work out any satisfactory solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to the solutions suggested here, I cannot see any great argument against them, but I do not believe that they are going to be effective for the reasons I have given.  I am told, though I do not know how correct it is&mdash;no doubt the Minister for Justice will tell us in time&mdash;that, as far as pheasant shooting is concerned, the Minister for Justice has been dishing out licences <i>ad lib</i> for the purpose of shooting hen pheasants.  I do not know what the figures are but no doubt the Minister for Justice will tell us.  As far as the penalties provided here with the idea of preserving game are concerned, I believe that the movers are, no doubt, sincere in what they are trying to do, but without the effective co-operation of the public any penalties we provide here will not help to solve the problem which the movers of this motion have in mind.  I further think that a far greater amount of damage, certainly as great, is done by the scald crow and other pests than by many poachers.  That bird is very elusive to the man with the gun and very difficult to get.</P>
    <P>Again, unless you have the goodwill and co-operation of the people on the land, the farmers, you will make no great progress in preserving the game from the point of view of restocking or of any of the methods usually employed elsewhere to preserve game. You will never achieve success by any of these methods.  You will find yourself driven back to the question of co-operation with the landowners, the tenant farmers who own the land over which we all must shoot.  I see every reason why this matter should be tackled, but the root of the problem <Col N="1105" /> is the question of having game rights nationalised, to enable the ordinary sporting clubs throughout the land to lease sporting rights from the State. Then you will have the co-operation of the farmers and the local people, and, having got that co-operation, you will be able to tackle the poachers, and there will be some game left to shoot in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett):</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been one of the most interesting motions to come before the House for a considerable time.  All Deputies were sincere in the wishes they expressed for the preservation of game, and in their lack of sympathy with the poacher.  Their whole desire, though they expressed their views in different ways, was the preservation of game and elimination of the poacher. Deputies can, however, conceive the problem with which I was faced.  I met representatives of a large number of gun clubs, and not one club agreed with the views expressed by the previous deputation.  They all wanted different months, some wanted total prohibition for some birds for a year, others for a longer period.  Deputy O'Higgins in a clear and lucid way has pointed out some of the difficulties with which I was faced.  Deputy Corry put up a very fair proposition, that to carry out the terms of the motion and to have the season for shooting wild duck shortened to 1st September until 12th February would have a serious effect upon the small farmer who is a producer of barley.  I agree with Deputy Corry as regards the opening date.  Experts have advised that we should not have the open season later than the middle of February, because the mating season for wild duck commences in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was questioned why I selected the 15th October instead of the 1st November as the opening date for the shooting of pheasants.  I met representatives of a very large number of preserves and of gun clubs.  Some of them were insistent on the 1st November.  On the other hand, the representatives of the small working farmers and road workers, shopkeepers and others in the country places, who were not the owners of large sheltered preserves, <Col N="1106" /> wanted it from 1st October and, very rightly, put up a very good case that October is often a very severe month and if they did not get an opportunity in October of shooting they would have no chance after 1st November as the birds would have gone into shelter in the woods in the preserves.  Considering the representations from all sides, and trying to be fair to all sections, I compromised by putting the date at the 15th October, and I have found no strong opposition up to the present time to it.</P>
    <P>The suggestion put forward in some portions of the motion would require fresh legislation.  Having regard to the various opinions expressed in this House, if I were willing to bring in such legislation, Deputies can see the difficulty we would have in getting it passed.  I am not in favour of giving more powers to the Guards in the matter, as some would have us do, enabling them to go into houses to see whether pheasants were there for 21 days.  They have certain power at the present time, and I am not going, as a Minister, to be a party to giving the Guards extra duties or extra powers in relation to game preservation at the present time.  About sales at the start of the season, I feel that the owners of preserves should not be prevented from selling at the time they can get the best price.  They breed and rear game birds as a commercial proposition and we should be slow to introduce legislation which would interfere with their way of living.  To prohibit this trade completely for 21 days might have a serious effect on their business.</P>
    <P>Without bringing in any fresh legislation we all agree, I think, with the principle of the motion&mdash;that is the importance of trying to carry on the preservation of game and, as I said, showing no sympathy for the recognised poacher.  Very few Deputies who have had a gun, have not at some time or other crossed a ditch into another man's land.  They could be described as poachers, but nobody would refuse the chance of going across that ditch although he might be termed a poacher.  He is not a real poacher.  It is the professional poachers who make a living going from one place to <Col N="1107" /> another at whom we want to get, and for that we require the co-operation of farmers and workers.  We have a large number of gun clubs now established all over the country.  I was, as a matter of fact, at a very interesting meeting last night at which pictures from Bord Fáilte were shown dealing with the preservation of game in other countries.  They were very pleasant to see.  You have the road worker, the farmer, the shopkeeper, etc., all members of the gun club, their one purpose being the preservation of game in the interest of sport.  One farmer very rightly pointed out that he looked upon the shooting of game as in the nature of an extra crop which supported him on his land.  &ldquo;It is to my interest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to preserve it and to see that there are no poachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The motion wants the Guards to come in as gamekeepers everywhere.  I do not think that would be reasonable. I accept the principle of the motion, and I will consult, not one section, but all the game protection associations. I will put the views I have heard here from the representatives of various Parties before them and get their opinion and ask for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned tourists. We have not had very many tourists here for shooting because, by reason of unlimited scope for poachers, very few birds have been left in the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of legislation which some Deputies desire in order to oblige district justices to suspend licences on convictions, I think anybody with any little experience at all with a gun knows that if a district justice suspends your licence for three months it is practically for the season. By the time the three months are up and you appeal back to the court to lift the suspension the season is practically at an end.  I think we should leave full power to the justice to use his discretion as we do under existing law, rather than that we should make any hard and fast rule.</P>
    <P>I can assure the movers of this motion and every member of this House that we are all anxious to preserve game in this country.  I shall <Col N="1108" /> probably be able to come to some arrangement for improvements at the consultation which I shall have with the various representatives of the gun clubs but, Bill or no Bill, I am determined that, so long as I am here, I will bear in mind the interests of the small man in the rural areas.  I know a number of men in rural areas who are fond of shooting game and I should like such men to have an opportunity of shooting on their own land from the 15th October until the 1st November before the birds migrate into the shelters of the large estates.</P>
    <P>This motion has been very fairly debated by all Parties in the House.  It has been a very useful motion and, as I have said already, the debate has been most interesting and most educational from my point of view.  We have heard the advice of Deputies who have long experience of this sport and I can guarantee to the movers of the motion that the matter will be put forward and considered sympathetically so far as the representatives of the various gun clubs are concerned.  When the matter has been fully considered, we will see what we can do by way of regulation.  In view of the verious Bills which are before the Oireachtas at the present time, I can hold out no promise of bringing in a Bill to meet the various requirements in the motion.</P>
    <P>We will consider Deputy Corry's suggestion about the shooting of wild duck before the 1st September.  We will put all these points before men who are really interested in the sport &mdash;men whom I have described and men such as those whom I met last night. We want the co-operation of such men as, indeed, we want the co-operation of all sections of the community, particularly the rural community.  Even the townsman who is a member of a gun club will recognise the importance of the co-operation of the small farmer.</P>
    <P>We will go a long way towards trying to achieve the aims set out in the motion and the desire of Deputies on every side of the House.  I guarantee to have the matter considered very carefully and, if I have the power, I will make regulations to meet some of the wishes of members but, for the reasons which I have already stated, I can hold out no hope of introducing <Col N="1109" /> a Bill on the lines set out by the movers of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's speech on this motion, I am quite satisfied that we have his sympathy and support.  It was time to put down this motion as it will focus attention on the fact that some action is needed to preserve the game of this country.  We have heard a great deal about the poacher.  I think the poacher plays a very mild part in this matter.  There are three important factors in the decline of game in this country&mdash;(1) land acquisition and division, (2) land reclamation and (3) bog development.  These are the things that have driven the game of this country almost to extinction.  Consider for a moment the position as it relates to land division.  Usually a large estate is involved where there was a preserve.  That estate is divided up into small lots.  Game are very timid. They will always move away from noise or civilisation.  A pheasant will not live where there is much noise or civilisation.  Therefore, we find that, according as land is divided up, the game keep moving away.</P>
      <P>Then we have bog development. There are no grouse at all now.  They have all gone.  Big machines have taken their place.  We have no lakes in the Midlands but, of course, we had rivulets and brooks where there used to be plenty of duck.  With drainage and bog development, the duck have now gone.  They used always lay their eggs at the little brooks but there are no brooks now.  We have to wait for a few ducks to come in periodically. These are the things that have changed the whole life of the country so far as game is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that I could have had a great deal of sympathy 30 years ago with the speech Deputy McQuillan made so far as my county is concerned. In my young days, I found no greater sport than crashing across the demesne wall&mdash;but the demesne wall is there no longer in my part of the country. The preservation of game now rests on the small farmers and the middle-class farmers.  We want a new sporting spirit.  We want six, eight or ten <Col N="1110" /> farmers to join together and have the land more or less preserved.  Furthermore, we need to have gun clubs again in the country.  If we had that, we would have a hope of getting back a reasonable amount of game.</P>
    <P>The wiping out of the rabbit with myxomatosis has resulted in one of the biggest menaces to game that ever existed.  Whereas formerly the man with a gun could knock quite a lot of sport out of taking a shot at a rabbit, there are no rabbits for him to shoot now, with the result that he has to find some other form of game to shoot.  A man fond of a gun will have to have a crack at something.  There is nothing left now but a small amount of game and he will have a crack at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles:</NameTxt>
      <P>Something must be done about the whole situation.  We want a sporting spirit in the country to get people to come together in gun clubs.  We have that, in a reasonable way, in my county.  There is one thing, however, which we do not want.  When the Land Commission take over land, perhaps 300 or 400 acres of land on which there is game, for afforestation purposes, they take the gaming rights of that land.  Our experience in the country is that those shootings are given overnight to a group of solicitors or somebody else in Dublin City and the country people do not have the slightest chance of bidding for the rights or of being the highest bidders for them.  If the Land Commission continue in that way much longer I can only say that it will result in more poaching and I would not blame the country people for that.  In my village, people have tried several times to get a shot on some of these lands.  We always find that the officials in this Department or in the other Department have given the nod to a few boys in Dublin to get in and they get in as quickly as they can.  We, down the country, are always behind time.  We do not get the beck in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gun shoots should be put up for public auction and given to the highest bidder; we have as much right to them at £10, £25 or £50 and the auction <Col N="1111" /> should be published in the public Press.  Poaching will increase year by year so long as there are Government Departments playing into each other's hands.  The only hope I see is for small farmers to form groups to preserve the game on their own land.  I trust that they will not preserve it as the old landowners did, by putting a rigid wall around the farms.  I hope there will be friendly rivalry with other clubs and that they will stock the lands for the benefit of the sporting clubs in the various areas.</P>
    <P>The menace of the carrion crow must be tackled by every sportsman.  The carrion crow does away with almost 80 per cent. of the game that is destroyed.  The fox does not cause half the damage that the carrion crow does.  If for the next three years we were to do nothing more than to try to eliminate the carrion crow, we would do an immense amount of good.  Sportsmen and sporting clubs should devise some scheme to destroy the carrion crow the whole year round.  If that were done, game would increase.  The carrion crow is a menace to all types of game and attacks flocks of lambs.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable motion.  It was put forward for discussion.  It was not intended to be a bone of contention, which Deputy Corry tried to make of it.  Deputy Corry showed very bad sportsmanship.  I always heard he was a good gunman but I wonder in what respect he was a good gunman.</P>
    <P>We must try to create a sporting spirit in order to develop sport.  Only the small farmers can save game.  The big demesne walls have been broken down.  Farmers in County Meath have now their own shooting rights and it is in their own interest to preserve game. If they do not make every effort to do it, the day of the gun and the dog is finished.</P>

      <P>I have only a few moments to conclude.  Therefore I want to make a very brief and concise statement. We are very glad that the Minister has said that he will carefully consider the motion and its subject matter.  This is not the last he has heard of it.  He will be badgered by the <Col N="1112" /> Deputies who moved this motion from now until next season, in order to see how much we can get from him.</P>
      <P>There are two points I want to make. I say, for the 51st time, this motion has nothing to do with trespass.  It has everything to do with shooting game out of season and taking game illegally. It has absolutely nothing to do with demesne walls.  It has nothing to do with trespass, nor does any of its provisions, the obligatory suspension of game licence and confiscation of the gun, pertain in any way to trespass.  Its provisions apply only to shooting out of season or taking game illegally.</P>
      <P>The second point is this.  Great play has been made on the question as to whether or not pheasant shooting should start on the 15th October or the 1st November.  An attempt has been made to put us on the side of the person who has a large demesne or a large preserve inasmuch as we put forward the 1st November as the commencing day.  In my view, no matter who is shooting birds out in the field on the 1st October or 15th October, when many birds will be in an immature state, he would want to be blind to miss them.  In such circumstances a man, if he is mean enough, can shake half a pound of barley on the ground and, after three mornings, can look across the hedge and shoot eight pheasants.</P>
      <P>With regard to ducks, this matter has been totally exaggerated by Deputy Corry.  His county is the earliest county for barley in Ireland. Deputy Corry said that, normally, the barley is cut from the 15th to the 20th August.  Yet, he is greatly disturbed about the damage that would be done if the opening of the season were moved back to the 1st September.  If the barley is cut from the 15th to the 20th August, the flighting of the ducks will not do any harm. Is not that true?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan:</NameTxt>
      <P>These are Deputy Corry's dates, not mine.  He said barley was cut between 15th and 20th August.  Ducks do not flight in any other part of the country until the <Col N="1113" /> middle of September.  I want to impress these two dates on the Minister. I believe Deputy Corry has been deliberately mischievous on a nonpolitical motion.  I say and believe, first, that this motion has nothing to do with trespass; secondly, that if the season is the 1st October or the 15th October, a blind man may shoot pheasants if he has a good dog, in stubble and, if he is dishonest enough to do it, a man can shoot a covey on the ground by putting out corn. Thirdly, I believe that Deputy Corry's insistence that damage is done before the 1st September by flighting duck is all poppycock.  I want to impress that very clearly on the Minister.  I ask him to investigate this matter to the very fullest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in increasing the price of home produced wheat offals to that of imported offals, thus imposing, since September, 1954, an additional burden on pig feeders of over £600,000, to the detriment of the pig industry.</P>
      <P>I gave notice that I proposed to raise the subject matter of a question on the Adjournment.  I shall not do so, as this motion deals with the same matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that Governments, when in straits for money, search around to see where they can find it and, at times, with very little scruple as to whose pockets they put their hands in; but I hold that a Government, who put their hands into the pockets of what I would describe as the extra industrious <Col N="1114" /> small farmer of this country&mdash;the man who is feeding the pig&mdash;and by increasing the price of his feeding stuffs deliberately robs him of his profit, deliberately makes his industry an uneconomic one, and deliberately drives out of production a large number of pig feeders, are not a Government this House should approve of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried.  I am putting the case as I find it here, and I find that this Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in this House on 23rd March, 1955, made the following statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was originally calculated that the reduction in flour and bread prices as from the 1st May, 1954, would add approximately £900,000 to the bill for subsidy for the financial year 1954-55.  In actual fact, the reduction will cost £927,000 against which, however, can be offset items amounting to about £555,000, leaving a balance of £372,000 to be provided for under this sub-head.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The chief offsetting items, of which I shall give details in a moment, are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  increased receipts by flour millers from sales of wheaten offals over and above the amount originally estimated;</P>
      <P>(b)  savings accruing from changes in the millers' grist; and,</P>
      <P>(c)  the fact that milling costs proved to be lower than was thought when the original Estimate was prepared.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the particular matter that I am dealing with.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Increases in the price of offals, from £20 to £23 per ton in September, 1954, to £24 10s. in December, 1954, and to £26 a ton in January, 1955, account for increased receipts by millers of approximately £170,000. These increases followed similar increases in the prices of imported offals reflecting changes in the world price.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> That is to be found in Volume 149, column 515.  I was rather interested to know how far this game had been carried on and, when I got the returns from the Central Statistics Office showing the number of sows for breeding, the number had dropped from 99,575 in 1954 to 79,818 in June of this year, showing a reduction of 19,757 sows, or 19.8 per cent.; and a reduction in the number of other pigs of 159,476 altogether.  It showed that the pig industry in this country was sacrificed to the Minister's anxiety to find the money for the payment of the flour subsidy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The Parliamentary Secretary is living in a rural area, and he has a fair idea of the value that 159,000 pigs would be to this country. The 159,000 pigs have disappeared.  I was anxious to know what was the total amount of loot collected by the Minister in this manner and I put down a question here last week to find out exactly what was the amount.  I got the extraordinary reply then from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While the accounts furnished to me by flour millers show total receipts from sales of offals, they do not distinguish the amounts received from offal sales at different price levels.  I am unable, therefore, to give the information sought by the Deputy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extraordinary thing was that, although that reply was given to me at 3 o'clock, when I raised the matter on the Adjournment at half-past ten last Wednesday night, the Parliamentary Secretary was then able to give me the figures I looked for and which <Col N="1116" /> were not available at 3 o'clock.  The information I got&mdash;this is at column 494 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 154&mdash; was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Adopting the same basis as that used in estimating the probable amount of subsidy payments in the financial year 1954-55, the increased receipts by millers from sales of wheaten offals from September, 1954, to August, 1955, have been calculated to amount to £431,000; and for the period from September, 1955, to the 1st February, 1956, to £186,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That £617,000 has been extracted from the pig feeders of this country from 30th August, 1954, to 1st February, 1956.  It is no wonder that we find a reduction of 20 per cent. in the number of sows, and no wonder that we find a reduction of 17 per cent. in the total number of pigs in the country. We hear that the farmer does not pay any income-tax.  That was a source of complaint amongst many people; but here is the one small section of the farming community picked out and fleeced of over £500,000 of money by the simple expedient of increasing the price of the home offals up to the level of the price of the imported offals.</P>
    <P>One would expect, if there were imported offals coming in at a higher price and if the Minister was not prepared to give the farmer the benefit of the cheaper offals produced in this country by his fellow-farmers, that the Minister would say: &ldquo;Well, we will lump them and we will divide the price.&rdquo;  We have to pay £26 for imported offals, and at present the economic price of home offals is £18 a ton.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 1st March, 1956.</P>
