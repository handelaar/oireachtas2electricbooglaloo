      <P>and <b>J. Lynch</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will state, in respect of the calendar year 1955, (i) the value of imports of motor-cars and parts, including tyres, motor lorries and parts, and any other variety of vehicles propelled by oil or petrol, and (ii) the quantity and value of petrol and oil imported for use by such vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports are brought to account only according to descriptions specified in the Official Import List.  This list does not in all cases distinguish mechanically propelled vehicles according to the fuel they use nor does it distinguish all grades of oil and petrol for use in vehicles from those for other purposes. It is not therefore possible to provide the exact particulars required.</P>
      <P>The aggregate values in 1955 of all relevant import descriptions (including those which relate only partly to the particulars required) were as follows: (i) £16,500,000 and (ii) £15,500,000.  If re-exports are deducted the aggregates were: (i) £16,500,000 and (ii) £13,000,000.  These totals include all imports of such categories as &ldquo;Fuel oils&mdash; gas oil and distillate fuel oil (including diesel)&rdquo;, part of which only is appropriate to the particulars required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he <Col N="644" /> has made arrangements for future interviews with industrialists and other important contacts which he made during his recent tour of the U.S.A. with a view to establishing additional industries in the undeveloped areas, and particularly in Connaught; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The possibilities for establishing new industries opened up by my recent visit to the U.S.A. will be followed up by the Industrial Development Authority.  A delegation, consisting of Dr. J.P. Beddy, Chairman of the Industrial Development Authority; Mr. J. Leydon, Economic Adviser to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and Mr. C. Loughney, a member of the Industrial Development Authority, is about to leave for the U.S.A. for the purpose of meeting American industrialists with a view to active participation by them in industrial development in Ireland.  The delegation will, <i>inter alia</i>, stress the facilities provided for industries in the undeveloped areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whether he has received a report that an American industrialist who planned to transfer a million dollars worth of machinery here to start an industry was shown such a lack of courtesy at his Department that he took the first plane home; whether he has investigated the matter, and if he will make a statement thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent newspaper report.  I am satisfied that the allegations contained in the report are without foundation.  The interview in respect of which the allegations were made took place in the offices of the Industrial Development Authority and was conducted in a normal manner; and at no time did the parties concerned express any dissatisfaction with the way in which they had been received.  In the course of the meeting the visitors were informed that their proposal was found to be interesting. <Col N="645" /> They were informed of the intended visit of a delegation to the U.S.A. and a meeting with the American promoters was suggested, so as to save them any inconvenience.  The visitors left the meeting on the understanding that a questionnaire would be prepared and sent to them in relation to the project and that a meeting would be arranged to take place in the U.S.A.; the questionnaire was subsequently sent to the promoters and arrangements for the meeting initiated.  The meeting was held at an early hour as one of the persons concerned had previously indicated his intention to leave the country by air the same afternoon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if his Department has contacted the people referred to in his report to find out if the other side of the story is the same as that given by his Department?  Is he further aware that the people concerned are coming into the country independent of the Industrial Development Authority now because of the lack of co-operation they received when they visited the Industrial Development Authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce receive all persons in a courteous manner and go out of their way to facilitate people to establish industries here?  It is not a fact to say they do not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce receive everybody in a courteous manner and that they are painstaking in regard to the manner in which they receive foreigners and others interested in establishing industries here?  It is not a fact to say, as has been alleged, that they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience of the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce is that not only do they receive those interested in the establishment or extension of industries but they go out of their way, display every courtesy and take all possible <Col N="646" /> pains to render all the facilities and assistance they can.  In this particular case the persons were received, not by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce; they were received by the officials of the Industrial Development Authority.  I have before me here a report of the interview which was made immediately after the interview had taken place and before this paragraph appeared in the newspaper. I have given the Deputy a reply based upon the report which was made at that time and on information which I have subsequently received, and I want to underline what I say in my reply to the Deputy by pointing out that I am informed that at no time during the discussion was it alleged that any discourtesy was shown by any officer of the Industrial Development Authority towards the persons who were being interviewed.  I have testimony from many persons of how helpful the Industrial Development Authority are to persons who approach them for advice and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the officials of the Industrial Development Authority and of the Department of Industry and Commerce were very seldom disturbed by Deputy Hilliard in his time?  And is he not also aware that the complaint was made that the official referred to suggested to the American industrialist that he was coming in here because he was being run out of America by big business and his machinery was being scrapped?  Has he done anything to investigate that?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether it is proposed to reopen the lead mines at Glengolla, Oughterard, and, if so, when; further, whether a survey of this area has been made, and, if so, with what result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The mineral deposits in the Glengolla area have been surveyed already by the Geological Survey.  The results of the surveys, which are made available to interested parties, would not justify the undertaking of any further work in the area at State expense.  The Deputy will appreciate that the reopening of mines such as these is a matter for private enterprise and I will be prepared to grant any necessary facilities under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in relation to the Glengolla mines to an applicant who can satisfy the customary conditions as to financial and technical resources.  I may add that I have not before me at present any proposals for the reopening of these mines.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what is the present position in regard to the provision of a new boat for the Galway-Aran service, and when the contract is likely to be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by C.I.E., who are responsible for the operation of the Galway-Aran service, that the preparation of detailed plans and specifications for the new vessel to replace the s.s. <i>Dun Aengus</i> is nearing completion.  Until then, a firm contract for the new vessel cannot be placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate how long it will take to build this new vessel and what it will cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take approximately 15 months to build the new <Col N="648" /> vessel from the time the order is placed.  I cannot, of course, tell the Deputy the precise cost of the new vessel because the contract has not yet been placed, but he may take it that the cost will be of substantial proportions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been unreasonable delay in preparing these plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows only too well, the provision of this service is a matter, under legislation, for C.I.E., and not for the Department. In order to help in this whole matter, for the first time, I think, the Department, because C.I.E. had not much shipping experience, took a hand as far as it could in the acceleration of the arrangements for the placing of the contract.  This vessel presented unusual difficulties because the new vessel will have to be designed to meet the ordinary needs of the islanders as regards the transport of passengers, live stock and mails and also to provide for the tourist traffic in the summer season.  These requirements present a difficulty to a company not familiar with handling shipping problems. I think all the difficulties have now been surmounted and I expect at an early date that a position will be reached whereby tenders can be invited for the contract.</P>

The area will be reconsidered by the board in due course and the decision of the board will depend on how the returns for the area then compare with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Dundalk district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. The purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole in the Road Transport Acts which was disclosed by a recent decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1933, provides that, except in certain exempted areas around the principal ports, no person may carry merchandise for reward by road in a mechanically propelled vehicle unless he is the holder of a merchandise licence.  It was accepted up to recently that the Act prohibited the hiring of a vehicle for the carriage of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent case, a lorry owner hired his lorry to a building contractor, on the understanding that the owner was to keep the lorry taxed and insured and was to provide a driver.  In practice, he drove the lorry himself, but this did not affect the legal position. The lorry was used for the haulage of sand the property of the building contractor. Both parties were prosecuted for illegal haulage.  The defence <Col N="663" /> pleaded that the arrangement between the defendants was a contract for the hire of the lorry and not for the transport of goods.  The district justice accepted this defence.  The case was brought to the High Court by means of a case stated and the High Court sustained the decision of the district justice.  The Attorney-General then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court, but this was dismissed.</P>
    <P>The loophole revealed by the Supreme Court's decision would frustrate very substantially the objects of the Road Transport Acts.  Anyone who has goods for transport could now hire a vehicle for this purpose even though the vehicle owner is not the holder of a merchandise road transport licence.  The vehicle could be hired for any period, long or short.  A group of persons or firms could combine together to hire a lorry between them and use it freely for the transport of goods owned by each of them individually. Moreover enforcement of the Acts would become impossible.  It would be extremely difficult for the Gardái to obtain satisfactory evidence of cases of illegal haulage, because the parties concerned would claim that the vehicle had been hired by the owner of the goods.  If this position were allowed to continue a large proportion of the merchandise road transport business carried on by the public transport concerns (C.I.E., Great Northern Railway Board and other railway companies) and by hauliers licensed under the Road Transport Acts would pass to unlicensed hauliers. The existing organisation of public road transport would be jeopardised and the financial position of the public transport undertakings would be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to emphasise that this is not to be taken as an attempt by the Legislature to overrule the judiciary.  I am sure that no Deputy will wish to put that construction on the Bill.  The Road Transport Acts were designed to secure certain objects and were framed to give effect to a clearly defined transport policy.  It is now revealed that the Acts as drafted and enacted failed to give effect to the <Col N="664" /> intentions underlying them.  Until the recent court decision, the Acts were accepted at their face value by all interests concerned.  In effect, therefore, the Bill imposes no new restriction or control on transport; it will simply preserve the <i>status quo</i> by making illegal in fact what was hitherto regarded as illegal in practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill is designed to deal with a position created by a decision of the Supreme Court &mdash; a decision which gave to certain sections of the Road Transport Act, 1933, as amended by other Acts, an interpretation different from that which the Dáil intended &mdash; it cannot be very well opposed.  It certainly was the intention of the Dáil in 1933 to provide by that legislation that the carriage of goods for reward on the roads by means of mechanically propelled vehicles should be confined, with certain exceptions as to areas and classification of goods, to licensed hauliers.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably not unaware of the fact that the view has been expressed inside and outside this House that the position resulting from the Supreme Court decision should be allowed to stand, that is, that the breach of the intention of the Legislature in 1933 should not be repaired and that private lorry-owners should be allowed, in accordance with that decision, to hire out themselves and their lorries in the manner stated by the Minister.  In my view &mdash; and it is the considered view of this Party, which has discussed the matter carefully &mdash; if there is a case for the amending of the Road Transport Act, 1933, or a case for the repeal of the Act &mdash; which, I think, some people would be prepared to make &mdash; then it should be done as a matter of definite policy, following upon a policy decision and not merely allowed to happen because of the accident that the courts found it possible to interpret the Act in a manner different from that which the Dáil had intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be wrong and undignified for the Dáil to allow these Acts to be amended by a side-wind, or to allow the intention of the Act to be <Col N="665" /> set aside by a subterfuge, or to acquiesce in this pretence that, when the owner of a lorry hires out a lorry, with himself as a driver, to somebody else, he is not carrying goods for reward in the sense we intended that phrase to signify when the road transport legislation was being passed.</P>
    <P>A communication was circulated to members of the House from an organisation called &ldquo;The Merchant Lorry Owners' Association&rdquo;.  While that communication is, I think, inaccurate in many respects, it does bring to the notice of members of the Dáil certain important questions that arise in connection with our road transport legislation.  That circular suggests that the submission of this Bill to the Dáil gives the House an opportunity of discussing what is described as &ldquo;the nation's road transport problem&rdquo;.  I do not know to what extent the Chair would agree that this Bill is an appropriate medium for a discussion of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy agrees it is not; this Bill is amending one section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps something more than that.  I certainly do not want to contend that this is a suitable occasion for a comprehensive review of the whole transport situation; but this Bill is something more in the minds of many people than a mere rectification of a position that arose accidentally from a court decision. The contention of this association is that the purpose of the 1933 legislation has failed; that, at any rate, the aims which were then entertained have not been achieved, and they urge that the whole structure and policy of our public transport undertaking should be scrutinised and overhauled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the case against the Minister's suggestion that these questions do not properly arise on this Bill is the argument that the position created by the Supreme Court decision should not be remedied at all.  Admittedly, that would negative the policy of the 1933 Act.  It would be tantamount, in my view, to a repeal of the Act and I agree that that would be the wrong <Col N="666" /> way to repeal the Act and that, if there is to be a decision to repeal, it should be carried into effect by legislation submitted here and discussed here on its merits.  We certainly should not allow the purpose of the 1933 Act to be set aside by the process of permitting people to indulge in this legal fiction that, when they are hiring out their lorries and themselves to somebody else, they are not carrying goods for reward, within the meaning of the legislation.</P>
    <P>There are some observations I should like to make in that regard.  The Merchant Lorry Owners' Association have in their minds the idea, which is, I think, shared by many of the public, that the aim of the Road Transport Act of 1933 and the purpose of the restrictions imposed by that Act upon the carriage of goods for reward on the road by motor vehicles was solely to preserve the railways.  Now, that was not the aim of that legislation, and I can speak with some authority in the matter because I was responsible for framing it and for bringing it to the House; if any Deputy is interested enough to look up the matter, he will find that in the speech in which I submitted the Road Transport Act, 1933, to the House, I made it quite clear that that was not its purpose and that the aim was to provide this country with a nationwide transport service operating by rail or by road, as the public required, a service that would be obliged by law to carry, without discrimination as between persons, or trades, or towns, or ports all goods that were offered for transportation at known terms and at uniform fixed rates.</P>
    <P>In so far as the aim of that legislation was to provide that type of transport service, it cannot be said to have failed.  It is true that the public services have not, since the war, been able to expand their revenues so as to cover their rapidly mounting costs. But that situation is due to two factors: first of all, to the rapid growth in the number of private goods vehicles in use and that is something which has developed in every country, although its development here was probably accelerated by the number of stoppages through strikes in the transport services <Col N="667" /> some years ago, stoppages which were sometimes brought about at short notice; and the effect of these stoppages was undoubtedly to induce a number of business firms, which were using the public services, to build up their own transport organisations and to use the public services only as a standby or as a supplement to their own service.  Secondly, and I think this is the main cause of the difficulty of the public transport undertakings, there was their inability for a variety of reasons to replace the obsolete and uneconomic equipment which they were using.  In my view, it is far too soon to decide that the losses which the railway undertakings have been recording are permanent.  The process of re-equipping the railways, of giving them new locomotives and carriages and introducing new methods of working is only now in progress.  It is certainly far from being completed; and that is why I urge that the fundamental review of our transport problems and difficulties which this association asks for could not properly be undertaken at the present time.  I agree that the public will not be willing to maintain the present restrictions on the operation of private lorries on the roads, if the public transport services continue to need substantial subsidies from the taxpayers, or if they prove to be too costly in their operation, or incapable of giving efficient service to the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to contest the Chair's ruling in that regard, but I think that when the House is faced with the position that the Supreme Court has given a decision, which in fact, nullifies completely the intention of the 1933 Road Transport Act, and the Minister proposes that that decision should be reversed by a further amendment of that Act, the question is whether it is desirable that we should reverse it.  I think it is, but I do not think the Minister went far enough in arguing the case against those who, like this Merchant Lorry Owners' Association and quite a number of <Col N="668" /> Deputies, to my knowledge, feel that all the restrictions of that Act are no longer justifiable, are indeed operating to the public detriment at the present time.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go into the merits, or lack of merits, of the proposition that the whole question of public transport should be reviewed.  That, in a sense, is irrelevant to the observations I want to make.  I was merely contending that the time is not appropriate for such a review; that there is, indeed, no evidence that the public transport undertakings are relying upon the protection which the 1933 Act gave for the purpose of keeping in existence unduly costly or inefficient methods of working or obsolete equipment.  Indeed, all the evidence is that they are trying by every means to eliminate their losses. And they should be given a fair chance to succeed.</P>
      <P>However, as we are probably confined in this discussion to the consideration of the desirability of maintaining the 1933 Road Transport Act, I want to put forward the view that there is justification for the point of view that the provisions of that Act require examination and, possibly, amendment.  That is a matter which Deputies on this side of the House have discussed amongst themselves with some care.  When the 1933 Act was introduced, the Act which prohibited the carriage of goods for reward on the roads by motor vehicles, except by licensed hauliers, a great deal of the rural transport of this country was carried out with horses.  There was, of course, no restriction placed upon carriage for reward by means of horses. Most Deputies will, I think, agree that the horse is disappearing in rural areas and is rapidly being replaced by the tractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very large number of farmers are now using tractors, station wagons or motor vehicles of one kind or another to do the type of work that was formerly done by the horse.  The fact that they are using mechanically propelled vehicles brings them under the Road Transport Acts.  That is a situation which was not foreseen in 1933.  It was not intended that the public transport undertakings should <Col N="669" /> do that type of transport work in rural areas which was then done by horses, and indeed it was not conceived to be practicable that a nationwide transport organisation could attempt that task.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, are of opinion that it would be desirable to amend the Road Transport Acts so as to remove the restriction upon the carriage of goods for reward on the roads in the case of a person whose main means of livelihood is farming and within a reasonable area of the district in which he carries on farming operations.  In that way a farmer could carry the goods of his neighbours for reward on the roads as a matter of local convenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would confine it to a farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would confine it to a farmer.  There is a very big difference between the type of service which a farmer gives or could give in a rural area to his neighbours and the situation that might develop if you permitted merchants in towns, who own and operate lorries for the purpose of their business, to carry goods for reward when it suited them.  That was the main issue which we discussed in 1933.  At that time this business of merchants owning lorries, used mainly for the purpose of their own business, occasionally taking goods for reward was the problem of the day.  It was that development which was cutting in on the revenues of the public transport services and was creating a situation in which the very existence of the public transport services was in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there should be in existence throughout the whole country a public transport service that is bound by law to carry everybody's goods at fixed charges without discrimination. The merchant in the town who wants to operate his lorry occasionally for reward is not prepared to accept the obligations of a common carrier.  The Act of 1933 placed upon licensed hauliers, common carriers, having got their licence, the obligation not to carry on their road transport business on a discriminatory basis. <Col N="670" /> They were bound by that Act to carry the classes of goods they were licensed to carry upon uniform terms.</P>
    <P>If we allow a development to take place under which merchants may occasionally, when it suits them, cut in upon the business available for public hauliers and public transport services, then we are, I think, creating a situation in which these public services will either cease to exist altogether or will require a very heavy subsidy to maintain. Some limited development of that kind might conceivably be permitted but it would have to be so surrounded by restrictions that it would be of very little advantage to merchants.  The problem which has arisen is a rural problem mainly and it is a problem which, as I said, was not foreseen in 1933, namely, that the motor vehicle would replace the horse as the means of transportation of the rural community. I can see no disadvantage to the public transport services if we allow the farmer to use his tractor or his station wagon to carry goods for reward for his neighbours, that is to say, within a reasonable mileage radius of his own farm.  I do not think that business will ever be of interest or of profit to public transport operators. The removal of the legal restrictions &mdash; they are probably not very carefully observed anyway &mdash; would appear to be a matter of merely keeping the law in line with the developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be a very different matter to allow merchants the facilities they are seeking, the right to carry goods for reward whenever it suits them and without accepting any obligation to carry goods for everybody or to give uniform treatment to everybody. We cannot have it both ways, have public transport services operating without loss and, at the same time, unrestricted carriage of goods for reward on the roads by private lorry owners.  We must make a choice between these two courses and I am quite satisfied in my own mind &mdash; and I think most people who will examine the matter will arrive at the same conclusion &mdash; that the better choice is to seek to maintain adequate public transport services and adopt whatever <Col N="671" /> measures are deemed to be needed in order to make that possible without subsidy.</P>
    <P>Everybody can see the problems created by the present restrictions. They cannot visualise quite as easily the very much more acute problems that would arise if these restrictions were removed and if, as a consequence, the public transport operator, the common carrier, were to disappear from the countryside.  The principle of the 1933 Act was just that and I think it should be preserved.  I would, however, ask the Minister to consider the amendment of the 1933 Act as I have suggested.  It is our intention to put down a motion so that the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it. The motion will ask the Dáil to urge the amendement of the Act to enable a person whose principal business is farming to use a mechanically propelled vehicle for the carriage of goods for reward within a limited area.</P>
    <P>Most of the arguments which have been advanced to me in favour of not rectifying the Supreme Court decision, of allowing that decision to determine the law for the future, have been based upon that rural problem.  My contention is that it is far better to deal with that rural problem in a straightforward way by a proper amendment of the Act than by this back-door method involved in the Supreme Court decision of allowing a person nominally to hire out his lorry and himself instead of charging for the transport services that he gives.</P>
    <P>There are probably few matters which have aroused more heated discussion in recent years than these restrictions upon the operation of private lorries.  The discussion has been enlarged with the increase in the number of these lorries and while I agree that a stage may come when we may have to reconsider the whole position in that regard, we are not at that stage yet. In my view we certainly will not have reached it until the public transport undertakings have had the opportunity of completing their reorganisation and of showing what they can do, given proper equipment and following the <Col N="672" /> new methods of operation which are being introduced.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill gives us an opportunity of pressing that point of view on the Minister.  I may say that there was a suggestion amongst Deputies here that the passage of the Bill should be opposed, these Deputies merely desiring, as I understand them, to deal with that particular rural problem to which I have referred.  I convinced them that it was undesirable to deal with that situation by that roundabout method and that it was far better to make a straightforward proposition which would set out clearly what the intention was and which would enable the Dáil to consider the matter fully and to impose upon whatever idea emerged from the discussion, whatever modification of the restrictions might be decided upon, safeguards which are still needed if the public transport service is to be maintained properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's statement, which I think is everybody's experience, namely, that the decision of the Supreme Court to the effect that it is not a contravention of the Road Transport Act if a man who owns a lorry, instead of making an agreement to carry goods for a given reward, should hire out himself and the lorry for the same period for the same job and the same price, is not only against what was intended by the Road Transport Act, 1933, but is also contrary to what most people, including the District Courts, believed was the effect of the Act; in other words, not only was it intended by the Dáil in 1933 that that should be prohibited, but people acted on that intention and assumed, up to quite recently, that such subterfuge would not avail them in relation to contravention of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that I think the form of this amending Bill, as it is at present, also covers, and for the first time makes illegal, something which had always been considered legal and which certainly was legal under the Road Transport Act, 1933.  It is this: Take the case of a man owning his own lorry, having his own employee, say, a farmer with a lorry, a miller with a <Col N="673" /> lorry, or anybody else with a lorry, whose lorry is an integral part of his business.  If his lorry is laid up for any reason for a period of four or five weeks as such lorries often are, either after an accident or as a result of some mechanical trouble, up to this, as I know the position, he could hire from his garageman or anyone else willing to hire it to him, a lorry; he could put his employee into that hired lorry and for the four or five weeks could use it to replace his own vehicle which is out of action.  I think, from my own experience, that up to this that has been considered as not being a contravention of the Road Transport Act.  It certainly is not against any spirit or intention or policy of the Road Transport Act.</P>
    <P>I am concerned as to whether or not the effect of Section 2, which of course is the effective section of this Bill, if passed, will mean that when a man's lorry, perhaps his only lorry, is laid up for three or four weeks, he cannot hire from the garage a lorry and drive it himself or get his employee to drive it because, if he does, it will be carriage for reward of his own goods under this Bill.  I would like the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to amend the Act without covering that but it does seem to me that there are two possibilities, one, if you made a provision that such hiring agreement which provided for the driving of the lorry either by the hirer or by a person employed by the hirer who had been so employed for a period of, say, not less than two months before the hiring arrangement, that that would do or, secondly, if you made a provision that a hiring agreement should not be prohibited if the hirer could establish that at the same time a vehicle of similar type, in other words, in the case of a van, a van, and in the case of a lorry, a lorry, and so on, in his possession, was out of action, in other words, was not available to carry goods.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister very carefully to consider either of these two possibilities or any other possibility but I would not like an Act, intended as we intend this Bill now, to prohibit what may be described as a bogus hiring <Col N="674" /> agreement, in other words, a hiring agreement by a man who is really carrying goods for reward, to have the effect of meaning that a man who is using his lorry lawfully for his own purposes should, when his lorry is put out of action, be prohibited from hiring one instead and forced to take public or any other transport.  It seems to me that if a man has a lorry and drives it himself or has an employee regularly employed to drive it we should in some way make it lawful for him, when that lorry is put out of action and he has to hire one, to do so without a technical or actual contravention of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for every reason.  I will give the reasons here openly.  In my opinion, as we stand at the moment, the 1933 Transport Act is dead.  According to Deputy Lemass it is.  But this Bill seeks to reimpose it and seeks to fasten on the community, particularly the rural community, an octopus that is inefficient and incompetent. Every source of revenue, every penny that was in the country or that has come into it has been dragged in to subsidise incompetence and inefficiency.  Going back to 1951, I had to fight a pretty tough fight in this House for a period of two or three months when the then Minister for Agriculture refused to pay the subsidy out of the Counterpart Fund for the transport of ground limestone to the Irish Sugar Company.  I succeeded in that fight.  Deputy Dillon was then Minister and I succeeded in getting that through the House and in getting £30.000 refunded to the farmers of my area.  Since then, the Irish Sugar <Col N="675" /> Company have continued to draw that ground limestone and to spread it.</P>
      <P>The Irish Sugar Company are doing that job at a price 12½ per cent. less than is paid to C.I.E. for doing the same work.  They have drawn roughly 500,000 tons of this ground limestone per year.  That means that there is to-day in the Counterpart Fund over £200,000 more than would be in it, if I had not succeeded in the steps I took here.  The Irish Sugar Company have saved the Counterpart Fund by drawing those 500,000 tons of limestone each year.  The Irish Sugar Company are also a State subsidised body and apparently they lost nothing by charging this lower amount at which C.I.E. are not able to do the work.  Why? That is a question I ask, having heard Deputy Lemass say that at the present moment he did not think we should go into the whole question of transport.  I say the time is over-ripe for going into it, because in six months or 12 months we will be told that the money earmarked for the lime subsidy has gone.</P>

I object to the frittering away of money given by the American Government for the assistance of agriculture by subsidising an inefficient, incompetent body to whom a monopoly has been given in this country.  We might just as well have this thing out.  I find the amazing thing is that even a private firm starting out as a ground limestone plant has to pay hush money&mdash; I cannot call it anything else &mdash; to C.I.E. of 12½ per cent. of their charge for every ton of ground limestone they carry in the lorries owned by themselves.</P>

C.I.E. officials have also been known to tell private hauliers that they may not work their lorry longer than 11 hours in any one day.  Apparently these officials have some power.  God knows where they got it.  If they got these powers from this House, the empowering measure was passed in blinkers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the facts, and I know that a regular scheme of <Col N="677" /> intimidation is being used against people who want to work by those who do not believe in work but who believe the State should pay them for incompetence. Those people have collared more than £200,000 of American Government money over and above what the ordinary hauliers in this country would have charged for the haulage of this ground limestone.  That £300,000 has been taken out of the farmers' pockets.  Definitely that is so. Those are facts that cannot be contradicted. It is an outrageous state of affairs.</P>
      <P>At the moment, I shall not go into the matters to which Deputy Lemass alluded, but we know that if an unfortunate farmer at the present time draws a bag of manure on his tractor to one of his fields and if he has to cross a public road to do so, one of these spies is on top of him and he is prosecuted for not having the proper tax on his tractor.  If he goes down to the local well or pump on the side of the road for a churn of water, he is similarly prosecuted.  And the money to pay for these intimidations comes out of public funds.  If the Minister wants to show good example in this matter, there are other ways in which he can subsidise C.I.E. besides condoning a campaign such as we have seen carried out in the manner I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand by what law it is carried out.  One thing must be admitted, and that is that a merchant, or manufacturer, or industrialist should be entitled to deliver his own goods to the person to whom he sells them.  I am pointing out here that C.I.E., by some means, have intervened in that practice.  I take it they do it with Government sanction.  The ground limestone manufacturer who produces his limestone has to pay an added charge of 12½ per cent. for each ton he delivers with his own lorry, with his own help, into the farmer's yard. That added charge has to be paid to C.I.E. &mdash; for what service, I do not know.  It is a scandal and it is just <Col N="678" /> another way in which the Government digs into money which is the property of the agricultural community and with which it was proposed to subsidise the supply of ground limestone to the farmers.  I challenge the Minister to get up now &mdash; and he has officials to help &mdash; and deny any single one of the statements I have made.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture sat there in that seat on three occasions in three months and pretended at that time that this matter had all been settled, and I know that it was on the night, the last night, that those people sat there as a Government that I succeeded in extracting &mdash; as you would pull a tooth, and a tough tooth at that, out of a hoary old bull &mdash; the £30,000 that was robbed from the farmers of my area by that game before, through the activities of C.I.E.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that, since then, £203,000 has been saved to the Counterpart Fund by the fact that the Irish Sugar Company was allowed to haul and deliver that ground limestone.  There is altogether £300,000-odd gone by this extraction by C.I.E. of money they were not entitled to.  A large portion of this 12½ per cent. was not even earned by C.I.E. in haulage.  The actual position of these lorry owners at the present day is that it is C.I.E. who must pay them.  They are not paid their subsidy direct from the State as they should be paid.  The money is given to C.I.E.; they have to return to C.I.E. the number of tons of lime drawn by their own lorries and they get paid for that less the 12½ per cent. kept by C.I.E. to pay the fellow who did not work at all.</P>
      <P>That is something that can only occur in a country like this; I do not believe there is another country in Europe which would stand for it or another agricultural community that would stand for any of those things. That is why I say, in my opinion, as far as this Bill is concerned, we are rid of the octopus to-day &mdash; do not put him back on top of us.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with regard to public transport, but I hope he will not think I am being cynical if I express regret that those remarks were not pushed with effective vigour when Deputy Corry and Deputy Lemass were on these benches.  Deputy Lemass, I thought, made a very reasoned contribution to this discussion, but coming from Deputy Lemass, many of those remarks and many of his sentiments, I think, can only be described as astounding.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass was the architect of C.I.E., the architect of the present public transport system in this country, and my recollection is that the Transport Act of 1933, when it was sponsored by Deputy Lemass, was sponsored as being a measure which would give the people of this country cheap and efficient transport.  We have, 26 years later, a colleague of Deputy Lemass in the same benches standing up and condemning as an inefficient and incompetent body the transport system which Deputy Lemass created.  I trust that Deputy Corry and Deputy Lemass will settle their differences of opinion with regard to C.I.E. themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do think that Deputy Lemass is probably quite correct when he says that there is a general feeling that some review of the present transport position should be undertaken.  The system as created by him was one to give a monopoly in transport to one concern which has since become nationalised.  There is a monopoly there at the moment; that monopoly has not, I think &mdash; and I think there is general agreement on this &mdash; succeeded in giving the people cheap transport, whatever about the question of efficiency which so concerns Deputy Corry.  So far as Dublin City dwellers are concerned, we feel with some justification that, on the question of transport, as well as on many other <Col N="680" /> questions, we are expected to carry the entire country on our shoulders.</P>

Deputy Corry did complain that if C.I.E. have some of the powers which they are exercising to-day, the Transport Bill of 1933 must have been passed in blinkers.  There may be some truth in that, but if so, it is quite unfair for Deputy Corry to charge the present Dáil or the present Minister with having committed any error in that respect.  If Deputy Corry or his colleagues wore blinkers in 1933, the man to blame is sitting in the front bench in front of him and now that he has the blinkers off and is prepared to look at the position anew, I, for one, would recommend a new look from Deputy Corry and Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>There is one danger in this Bill which has been referred to by Deputy Finlay, and while I agree that this Bill should not be opposed at the moment, that it would be wrong to allow the decision of the Oireachtas to be stultified by reason of a slip in draftsmanship or something like that, or by a wider or different interpretation being given to the section as drafted, by the courts, I agree with Deputy Lemass and I think it would be all wrong for the Dáil to sit back and do nothing about it.  Consequently, I think the Minister's action in bringing in this Bill and asking the House to pass it is reasonable and one which should be accepted by the House, but I should like to express the hope that an opportunity will be given to the House in the reasonably near future to review the Bill and the future of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with the point which has been raised by Deputy Finlay, because it is an <Col N="681" /> important one.  If a person, by ill-fortune &mdash; a road accident, mechanical trouble or something of that sort &mdash; finds that he requires the assistance of a supplementary vehicle, that he requires to replace his particular vehicle for a limited period with another vehicle, I think it has been accepted that there is nothing wrong, nothing contrary either to the spirit or the letter of the Act of 1933, in any such procedure.</P>
    <P>I have read Section 2 of this Bill very closely.  I do not know whether Deputy Finlay is right or wrong in expressing the view that Section 2 of this Bill will alter that position.  If it does, I think the Minister should reconsider the position.  In a Bill introduced merely for the purpose of remedying a flaw discovered in the Principal Act, we should not, even accidentally, extend it to catch something that was not intended to be caught by the earlier Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one matter I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister in this discussion regarding public transport and that is the difficulty which our fishermen living in coastal areas experience. Representations were made to the Minister and to the Minister's predecessor time and again by groups of fishermen from West Cork &mdash; and from other centres throughout the country, I am sure, as well &mdash; seeking a relaxation of these laws, so far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>I, as one thoroughly conversant with the position, am of opinion that these people have a very justifiable claim. At the present time, I have representations from a group of fishermen in the West Cork area, places such as Schull and other such centres, asking that they be given permission to employ the nearest haulage system available for the transportation of fish to the marketing centres.  Whilst I agree entirely with the nationalisation of public transport, I believe that private enterprise would meet the needs of these people much better than C.I.E., the public transport company of this country, could</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, if these people have one ton of fish in Baltimore this morning, they will have to pay the very same <Col N="682" /> price, according to information supplied to me, to C.I.E. to bring that to Cork as if they had a six-ton lot.  You can imagine the difficulty of the man out all night at sea trying to get the fish from the ocean and having to pay a minimum carriage rate of a six-ton lot.  On the other hand, he does not know whether he will have a catch or not.  It may possibly take him four, five or six hours, or even longer, to get the C.I.E. vehicle to remove the fish, whereas if he were able to employ the nearest transport available, which might be a privately owned lorry, that fish could be brought to the market within a short space of time, possibly one hour.</P>
    <P>When representations are made to the Minister, as they were made by the Skibbereen and Baltimore Harbour Board, the answer is that C.I.E. can provide these facilities.  Of course, C.I.E. has given this information to the Minister.  It may seem right to view the matter from the theoretical angle, but, in practice, it is completely out of place.  Having regard to the nature of the commodity involved, that is to say, fish, it may possibly happen that, if there is a delay in bringing it to the market, it may deteriorate.  It may not be in time to make a particular market on days such as fast days, Fridays and others.</P>
    <P>I would ask the present Minister, a man who has deeply interested himself in these people, whether they are wage earners or self employed fishermen, to review the whole position as far as the fishermen and transport are concerned.  These men are being placed under the greatest difficulties.  I feel sure that many of the Minister's civil servant advisers do not know anything about these people, or are not conversant with their difficulties.  I avail of the Transport Bill to bring that particular matter to the notice of the Minister in the most forcible manner I can.</P>
    <P>I ask him, when he gets these representations from these groups of fishermen round the coastal areas, to deal with each of them on its merits, and if he finds the merits warrant it in any particular case, he should grant them permission to use whatever haulage is <Col N="683" /> locally available.  In doing that, he will not be acting in any way detrimental to the interests of C.I.E.  I feel sure that the revenue C.I.E. would get from the haulage of fish would not be so great and would not interfere to any appreciable extent with their general economy.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister to take note of the few remarks I made so far as the haulage of fish is concerned and to deal in a more lenient and sympathetic way in future with the representations he will get from those bodies of fishermen around the coast than they have been dealt with, both by the present Minister and his predecessor during the past number of years. I am sorry to have to tell the Minister that many of them are dissatisfied with his Department.  They claim they never got any sympathy when they put their grievances to it.  I would ask the Minister to change that policy.</P>

      <P>Possibly this Bill does not provide scope for a comprehensive debate on the problem of transport, but, on the other hand, if a Deputy were to oppose this particular legislation, it would mean that the whole purpose of the 1933 Act would be set aside and, therefore, a full dress debate on public transport in this country could, and would, be justified. The fact that a Deputy is not opposing it should not limit the scope of the debate.</P>
      <P>All of us have views with regard to transport problems, but I do not appreciate the attitude of Deputies who are prepared in this case to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  The 1933 Act is a very controversial one, and, in regard to any Act of that kind, one must tread on somebody's corns. The Deputies on the Government side of the House now seem to take a pride in condemning the Act which was introduced by Deputy Lemass and, at the same time, refuse to advocate its repeal in any substantial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker said he was totally in agreement with the nationalisation of transport and he went on to advocate the transfer of a great bulk of that transport to private hauliers.  We <Col N="684" /> would want to be clear in the House in regard to our thinking and our attitude with regard to this particular matter.  There is one point upon which every Deputy in this House must be agreed and that is the point made by Deputy Lemass, that we must have public transport and we must have some company committed legally to the haulage of merchandise in this country.  If we are to have such a company, we must see that it is given a reasonable chance of commercial success.  Those are the facts we must face.  It is easy for a Deputy to get up in this House and play a little towards every little section of the community for the purpose of ingratiating himself with those sections.  We must face the fundamental fact that we have got to have a company charged with public transport and, having such, it must be given a reasonable chance of commercial success.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that, while advocating support for this particular section, we must have regard to the fact that public transport in this country has not yet reached the stage where we can pronounce final judgment on it.  There is a transitionary stage at the moment, in which public transport is trying to conform with modern methods, which we hope will ultimately lead to economies and to a state where those public transport companies will be able to finance themselves without any subvention from the Exchequer.  That time has not yet arrived but sufficient experience has been gained in the past years to teach us that certain anomalies have crept in which would justify some review, at an early date, of the whole public transport system.</P>
    <P>One instance has been referred to by Deputy Lemass.  That is where the tractor or other mechanically propelled vehicle has been replacing the farm horse.  That change justifies some review of public transport in this country. Those of us from rural areas feel that position very much and we feel that any change in the present transport system which would do away with that anomaly would not result in any loss to any public transport concern. We have an instance in Donegal where <Col N="685" /> a few cwt. of certified seed potatoes arrive at a railway station for distribution to farmers.  One farmer pulls out his tractor to bring home a few bags of the seed and all his neighbours ask him to bring home a few bags to them. Of course he is entitled to charge them a few shillings for that if he wishes. The present position of the transport code makes it an offence for that farmer to do so and that is a situation which calls for an immediate remedy.</P>
    <P>As to whether the system should be further reviewed with regard to the carriage of perishable commodities, such as fish, is another matter but all of us have had occasion, time and again, in this House to take up the question of the private haulier, and to approach the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to anomalies.  I think the whole question of the private haulier requires very deep consideration. The private hauliers are seeking now that we should not set aside this position and that we should allow the position to remain as the High Court decided it should be, in other words, to let the Act go into disuse. I do not think that at this stage the time is opportune for action of that kind.  To allow the position to remain as it is at present would be tantamount to repealing the 1933 Act in its entirety.  I do not think that any Deputy wishes that we should allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies who have spoken from the other side of the House took the opportunity of pinpointing the enactment of this matter on Deputy Lemass but they did not indicate whether their Party, stood for the repeal of the Act or whether they were in favour of retaining it.  Now that this opportunity has presented itself to the Government and that they have chosen to repair the breach in the Act we can only take it that they, too, are agreed that the public transport legislation of 1933 must stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably give us some indication when replying as to what he thinks about reviewing the legislation at a later stage.  So far no Deputy from that side of the House has given us any indication of their <Col N="686" /> intentions.  We are completely agreed, with regard to the transport of farm produce, that the carriage of commodities which were originally carried by horse drawn vehicles should be allowed free passage without any interference from this House.  We claim that we should be allowed that particular privilege in the rural areas. People in a rural area like Donegal have a special claim in that regard. We have a very limited rail service which we are determined to hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting-Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While that rail service is the life line of our transport in the country, we are definitely experiencing considerable difficulty with regard to the transport of farm produce into the rural areas which are so inadequately served by the rail service at the present time.  Those people who are entirely in favour of private haulage perhaps do not visualise the position of the small trader and businessman.  He is well served by the present transport system.  It is very easy for a large trader to engage a lorry from a public transport company but a small trader who has to get a few packages of goods weekly or twice a week will not be so well served by the private haulier.</P>
      <P>Then there is the question of the return of empties which never was a profitable business for any transport system.  The railway company will deliver the goods and are bound to transport the empties back to their destination at a cheap and unprofitable rate.  That is the type of transport which private hauliers do not like and which the public companies are compelled by law to carry out.  It is an essential part of any commercial transport in this country but it is one of the smaller things which indicate the indispensability of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be content to hear the Minister indicate here to-day that he would be prepared to go on the lines suggested by Deputy Lemass and give us an opportunity, at an early date, to review the entire transport position with a view to making some changes <Col N="687" /> to meet the needs of the farmers.  It cannot very well be argued that that will in any way depreciate or take from the income of the present transport system.  It is a service, so to speak, from field to road.  It is only right that a farmer with a tractor in his own field or yard should be allowed to use the public road without hindrance, if he needs to use it for a short distance.</P>
    <P>I think that every Deputy and, I hope, the Minister will agree that an amendment of the present legislation would effectively bring about that situation.  Then, in the course of time, when the present public transport companies have had sufficient opportunity to bring about the complete modernisation of the system &mdash; the management and actual haulage and traction system &mdash; we should be in a position to say whether or not the public transport system of this country has failed.  Until such time, we are not in a position to condemn the present public transport system.</P>
    <P>I realise that the country cannot continue to give subsidies to railways indefinitely, but, with the will to tackle it, there is a way out.  That way out will not be found by condemning the Transport Act of 1933 and at the same time retaining it and advocating that a little bit be taken off here and there, which would only make it more unprofitable still.</P>

      <P>I think the Chair should be congratulated on allowing this debate to extend somewhat beyond the narrow limits of the Bill because it seems to be an opportunity for discussion which all sides of the House welcome.  I find myself in agreement with practically every person who has spoken so far in this debate and I say that, although I do admire the new strides that C.I.E. have taken.  Personally, I do not use any other type of transport and I have said here before that I think all Deputies should be compelled to use C.I.E. transport for their public work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important thing to-day, so far, has been the dramatic admission by Deputy Lemass that our transport legislation has not proved eminently <Col N="688" /> successful.  There is, indeed, every case to be made &mdash; while giving him what he wants to-day &mdash; for asking the Minister to undertake an examination of the progress that has been made as regards our transport system and whether a failure has taken place.  I am interested in Deputy Lemass's proposal that a carrier with an agricultural professional label should be permitted to operate.  I do not, perhaps, quite get his point there.  I should have thought that the very small type of local carrier would be a desirable enough and a sufficient enough development. I am not quite sure what Deputy Lemass is getting at there and I wish he would elaborate on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has been saying &mdash; and, indeed, not whispering it but saying it very loudly &mdash; that there is a great deal of complaint about the dictatorial way in which C.I.E. intervene in the matter of the lime distributing scheme and in the beet sugar industry.  I have always tended to suspect that Deputy Corry's indignation is for public consumption; perhaps I am wrong.  It is very hard to believe that such boiling indignation could have remained unchecked, without boiling over, for 23 years.</P>
    <P>In my view, the House should give the Minister what he asks for to-day, but we should ask him to give us an undertaking that there will be an examination by a committee or by his Department or by a public commission into our entire transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decision of the Supreme Court has given the House an opportunity, to a limited extent, of reviewing the existing transport legislation and all that it means to the country. This Bill has enabled some members of the House to give their views on the matter and to state whether or not they feel there is need for some change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those Deputies who believe that any piece of legislation passed through this House &mdash; no matter what Government sponsored it and irrespective of the length of time it has been in operation &mdash; is sacrosanct and should not be changed or altered in any way.  If, in the course of years, certain legislation is found not to be flexible enough, or not to serve the <Col N="689" /> needs of the people in all directions, I feel that the House, the Minister and the Government should never hesitate to come here with amending legislation or to set on foot investigations to discover how the transport system, or any other system set up by legislation here, was affecting the life and industry of the people.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that if the majority of the community were consulted in regard to this matter they would express satisfaction at the recent decision of the Supreme Court.  Since the passing of the legislation 23 or 24 years ago, and especially with the growth of motor transport, there has been a considerable grievance among many sections of our community that that legislation was too restrictive.  It was held that it was preventing many sections of our community from doing their business in the way they would like to do it themselves and in the way they felt it was in the best interests of the community to do their business.</P>
    <P>The restrictions imposed on the hiring of vehicles or the carrying of goods in motor vehicles for neighbours, and so forth, under the Road Transport Act, 1933, have, without doubt, injured and hindered many sections of the community over the years to a smaller or a greater extent.  After 23 years of trial and error, there is a clear viewpoint amongst many sections of the community to the effect that the present law might be altered to the betterment of the community.  I feel we would all be in agreement that if improvements can be made in any direction they should be made.  The fact that this House originally made the laws under which our public transport system operates at the moment should not mean that, if any of the laws have been found to be too onerous or too restrictive on any section of the community, they should not be altered.  I am of that opinion myself.</P>
    <P>I confess that for many years I believed some alteration along those lines was required.  I do not agree at all that the Transport Act has served the purpose it was originally designed to serve.  The public transport service has failed to retain its biggest source <Col N="690" /> of revenue during the last 20 years. Apart altogether from the restrictions put on other people, the public transport service has lost important revenues from the transport of goods, despite restrictive legislation. The millionaire oil companies have taken almost all their work from public transport. Surely that was one service to which public transport was entitled? These millionaire oil companies now have fleets of 40-ton and 50-ton lorries operating on narrow country roads, roads which are really unsuitable for such traffic; and other transport is restricted on these roads because of the operation of these enormous vehicles.</P>
    <P>We are reputed to have one of the largest breweries in the world.  Within the last couple of years, that brewery has put its own tankers on the highways, carrying stout and porter all over the country.  That brewery has left public transport altogether.  The real complaint, of course, comes from the agricultural community, in the main; public transport has failed to serve the needs of that community to a considerable extent.  Public transport is not available to farmers within nine or ten miles of fairs and markets. Of course, it could never be made available to them, and I do not blame public transport because such a service would be altogether uneconomic.  It would be uneconomic to have public transport utilised for the carriage of stock to fairs and markets, for the carriage of manure, grain and all the other things for which the farmer requires transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy M. P. Murphy mentioned an instance in which public transport failed to serve our fishermen.  Fishing, as a whole, has been badly served by public transport and that lack of service has been detrimental to our fishery interests.  I had some personal experience of that down in Kylemore in Wexford; it was only after the greatest possible pressure had been exerted on the Minister's Department that a group of fishermen, who bought their own lorry on a co-operative basis, succeeded in getting authority to carry the combined effort of several fishing <Col N="691" /> boats to the market.  I do not blame the Minister for that, or anyone else. The law was restrictive.  It has been relaxed&mdash;whether legally or not, I do not know &mdash; in order to provide these fishermen with a transport plate so that they can carry their fish to market.  Agitation had gone on for a considerable period before that authority was granted.  Agitation is still going on in other ports, but so far without success.</P>
    <P>After 23 or 24 years' operation, clear evidence is available, if the Minister wishes to make investigation, that public transport has proved ineffective and has failed to serve the community. I urge the Minister, as Deputy Lemass urged him, to set up some kind of tribunal to investigate immediately and to amend the law in whatever direction it should be amended, in the interests of the community.  Since the end of the war, farmers have become completely mechanised.  The horse is a thing of the past.  One never sees a horse on the road nowadays, even in the most backward areas.  Formerly, the farmer did all his transport through the medium of the horse. The small farmer cannot travel the roads now with a horse; he has been pushed off because of motor transport &mdash; lorries, buses, private cars, vans and so forth.  Apart altogether from that, the roads are now too slippery for horse traffic.  Therefore, the farmers require the service of a motor vehicle and the only way many of them can get that service is from some neighbour.  I think they should be entitled to take the service of that neighbour, if the neighbour is prepared to give it at a reasonable cost for the transport of sheep, cattle, pigs, corn, manure, or any other purpose.  Public transport has failed to serve that need. There is no blame to public transport for that, because such a service would be uneconomic.  The farming community should, therefore, be allowed to organise themselves in order to serve themselves.  This House must legislate in the interests of the community as a whole and hold the scales of justice evenly as between all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>When the 1933 Act was passed, the <Col N="692" /> total number of motor vehicles on the roads was not very big.  To-day, 30 times that number are using our roads. Every merchant has his own lorries. Some merchants draw wheat a dis tance of 150 miles in their own lorries. Many of the sources of revenue available to public transport 23 or 25 years ago have been lost to public transport to-day.  Oil, coal, corn, manure, stout, and porter have all slipped from the hands of public transport.  Side by side with that, while public transport was losing all that, the community at large was taxed to maintain public transport. I do not say there is no need for a limited public transport service, but I firmly believe there was no necessity for C.I.E. to have a monopoly of road transport at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just giving that opinion without widening it too much. I am sorry if I am taking advantage of the Bill to go outside the scope of the debate.  I was just going to say that I believe that that was the cause of public transport's biggest loss.  I have no proof of that, but I believe it.  Now public transport is entitled to carry passengers.  I do not think anyone would disagree with that, and they have proved most successful in doing that.  If they confine their activities to that, operate only in cities and towns and allow the rural community to look after themselves in the way they think best with the transport that is available to them, I think it would be best for the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the House should make the laws of this country and that it is the House that should alter them if necessary.  Although the decision of the Supreme Court may be welcome in the country, the House would be wise to close that gap and change the law into whatever direction they think best.  I agree with Deputy Lemass and other Deputies that that is the proper way of dealing with the matter.  I hope the Minister will consider this whole matter of transport for the rural community in the remote places outside the cities and towns and allow <Col N="693" /> them an opportunity of developing their business in whatever way they think best for themselves.</P>

      <P>The fact that it is necessary to introduce this legislation to counteract a ruling of the Supreme Court appears to me to be sufficient evidence that the transport of this country is not in a satisfactory state.  If C.I.E. found it necessary&mdash; and I presume they did &mdash; to press for legislation so that other people may be prevented from transporting goods and materials in rural Ireland, in spite of the fact that C.I.E. have had a virtual monopoly in the country for 23 years, it shows they have not been able to provide for the public the service which they should have been able to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the position that we must support this legislation introduced to-day because C.I.E. is an accomplished fact; it is a vested interest.  We owe a duty to the public to maintain our transport services. We find ourselves faced with the fact that this country is losing a sum of money annually.  I suppose the purpose of this legislation really is to enable them to grasp all the traffic they possibly can on the roads and keep everybody else out.  I am not putting any blame on those who created the situation because one cannot foresee the changes that may take place in a country or in the world&mdash; for instance, the change over from horse transport to mechanisation &mdash; but the fact is that had the situation existed in this country, whereby road transport services were carried out by private enterprise, with different companies in opposition to one another, I feel satisfied that you would have a better state of affairs than you have to-day.  I would like to appeal to the Minister &mdash; I can see the Chair looking anxiously at me lest I should transgress the Rules of Order but many other Deputies have travelled over a <Col N="694" /> fairly wide field &mdash; to give us an opportunity in the near future of discussing legislation in relation to road transport, in fact, in relation to transport in Ireland as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there is a single Deputy in this House who is satisfied with the present situation.  We cannot be, because each and every one of us is continually receiving complaints.  I whole-heartedly agree with what Deputy Murphy said in relation to the transport of fish.  Every district in Ireland is dependent for public transport, particularly the rural district, on C.I.E. and it is often very difficult to procure that transport. Deputy Murphy made a very good case in regard to fish.  Fish is a perishable foodstuff which has to be moved forthwith. The fishermen do not know how much fish they will have until they land it or if they will have any fish. The same condition of affairs obtains in my own constituency.  The fishermen must wait until they land the fish before they can make arrangements to procure a lorry.  It is not easy to procure a C.I.E. lorry in rural Ireland. It is the same in regard to transport for agricultural produce.  One makes application through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the only source of approach, and one always gets the same reply, that the transport of this country is in the hands of the C.I.E., that the situation in the particular area has been investigated and that there is adequate transport in this district.</P>
    <P>I should like to state categorically that, so far as my own constituency is concerned and every other constituency, as long as this monopoly has been in existence there has not been and there never will be proper transport in rural Ireland.  Until there is opposition to the existing company or until you liberalise the transport &mdash; and it is nothing unusual to ask for that because the transport is liberalised in other countries &mdash; there will be no improvement. It is simply in Ireland alone &mdash;where we have C.I.E foisted on us and we have to swallow it hook, line and sinker &mdash; that this state of affairs prevails.  I should like again to protest <Col N="695" /> in this respect and to ask the Minister to let us have in the near future a full-dress debate on transport, a debate which will be welcomed not only by every Deputy in this House but by every citizen in the State.</P>

      <P>We have heard a great deal of talk for and against C.I.E.  There is one thing this House must recognise &mdash; that were it not for the 1933 Act, dealing with transport and particularly establishing a public transport company, we would be a good deal worse off to-day.  I hold it is essential to have a public transport company.  While I hold that view I have very strong views regarding the method adopted in each area in relation to public transport.  In rural Ireland, for example, a change has come about since the Act of 1933; the horse has gone and the tractor has taken its place.  If we interfere with the tractors, we are interfering with the mode of transport that superseded the horse.  Interference of that sort is interference with the private lives of farmers.</P>
      <P>Farmers are not the biggest culprits as far as public transport is concerned. My colleague, Deputy Allen, referred to the various public companies who do not support C.I.E.  We must be reasonable in all legislation.  We are here to do the work as best we can and to be as just as we can.  We must take into consideration what is in the public interest and we must be impartial and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Deputy Murphy gave some of his experiences.  I have had the same experience in County Dublin.  Take the fishing village of Loughshinny. Sometimes boats cannot get into Loughshinny and have to go to Skerries. Fishermen do not know in advance the amount of fish they will land.  If they need a lorry to transport the catch and if they have to depend on C.I.E. they may not be able to get a lorry until the following morning and the delay might mean that they would lose the market.  If they were to arrange for a C.I.E. lorry to be there always when they would land the fish, considerable expense would be entailed. They might not have any fish. In view of all these considerations the Loughshinny fishermen decided to get a lorry of their own.  They could use the lorry legally in Loughshinny but when they went to Skerries they were outside the 15 mile limit.  The man who was driving the lorry was prosecuted. While I am all for public transport, I maintain that this is unjust to the fisherman.  If they had to depend solely on public transport they could not operate their industry economically.  Fishing is a struggling industry.  It has its ups and downs, good weeks and bad weeks.</P>

      <P>I do wish to stress the two points I have made.  While supporting public transport, I want the cases of farmers and fishermen to be considered.  I make a special plea on behalf of these two sections of the community.  If they had to depend on public transport absolutely, they would not be able to operate economically.  We must be fair to these people.  The only way to be fair to them is to bring in amending legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The patching-up of the Transport Act will still leave a <Col N="697" /> very great problem to be solved in rural districts.  In rural areas a very serious problem has arisen as a result of the change in methods of transport since the passing of the Act.  The remedy for that problem should be sought now.  The farming community and others must employ public transport to do the hundred and one transport jobs which require to be done on individual farms.  That system entails extra expense and is responsible for increasing the cost of production. When farm produce has to be transported by this method, which is the only legal method open to farmers, it adds enormously to the cost of their produce and to consumer costs.</P>
      <P>The same applies to other food-producing industries, especially to the fishing industry.  The public generally have to pay for a system of transport of farm produce which is entirely unsuited for the purpose and which is most uneconomic.</P>
      <P>For that reason I would suggest an overhaul of the Transport Act with a view to enabling farmers, fishermen and other food producers to use their own transport, their neighbour's transport or co-operative transport.  If the co-operative movement were developed in this country to the stage that has been reached in other countries the present transport problems would not arise.  If there were co-operative societies inclusive of farmers and fishermen, they could have their own private transport within these societies but, unfortunately, the co-operative movement has not developed in this country; the farmer is an independent individual.</P>

      <P>I am trying to show that the need to employ public transport would not arise if we had this co-operative movement on a wider basis.  We have not that widespread system and, therefore, it is necessary to amend existing transport legislation because of the fact that the farmer is independent and is not easily led into the idea of co-operating with a body of neighbours in a locality.  He may <Col N="698" /> co-operate with one or two.  It is for that reason that this change is urgently required if we are to keep down the cost of farm produce, fish, etc.  I can quote examples where the enforced use of public transport is adding immensely to farmers' costs.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I brought to the notice of the then Minister the position that existed in regard to the transport of potatoes to the Carndonagh alcohol factory.  We had there a number of farmers trying to use whatever tractors were available to transport potatoes a couple of miles or less to the factory. Of course, the railway company objected and the result was that a railway lorry had to come a distance of 20 miles in some cases to draw potatoes a mile or two from the farmers' fields to the factory.  Situations like that are being repeated in every rural area in Ireland because we have a Transport Act which did meet the situation in existence when it was passed but which does not meet the situation that exists to-day in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It would benefit the majority of our people, whether consumers or producers, if this facility were given to them.  It does not mean a wholesale slaughter of existing legislation; all it would require is that farmers and others who have tractors or small vans, as some farmers have, or jeeps, would be allowed to use them for the haulage of farm produce for themselves and for any neighbours who would want to avail of that speedy method of transport which could be acquired within a matter of hours rather than have to go booking a vehicle, which takes maybe a week to book, and which might carry seven tons, whereas the load that is required to be hauled is only about half a ton or, at most, a few tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that the matter be remedied by an amendment of the transport legislation.  Public transport companies, both C.I.E. and others, would be glad to get rid of this necessity, imposed on them by law, of picking up a ton here and a half ton somewhere else.  We should give the people of the country the facilities that an amendment of the Act would entail. This Bill seals up a loophole in the Act and, mind you, it is a pretty narrow <Col N="699" /> loophole at that.  The fact that such a large number of people avail of the opportunity of using whatever loophole there is, since it was discovered, suggests that the legislation needs to be remedied.  If there were no hardships and if there was not a grave demand for an alteration we would not have had such a large number of people, especially a large section of the farming community, taking advantage of that loophole to get more efficient transport for their produce. That is proof enough that the passing of this measure, while it solves a problem as far as the Act is concerned, does not do justice and does not help a large section of the people.</P>
    <P>It may be a good thing to have some guarantee that a company or companies are legally bound to transport merchandise for the public.  That, I think, is necessary.  Somebody must take responsibility for the public transport of merchandise and of passengers and I think everybody in the House agrees that the Government must have some say in that.  We could still have that and I maintain we could have a more efficient transport system if we allowed the other problem to be solved in the way that the people wish it to be solved&mdash;by allowing tractors, vans, jeeps and small lorries to operate for the benefit of farmers for the transport of their produce.  I should like to hear the Minister indicate what his intention is in this respect.  I know there is a feeling on this side of the House that it is very necessary to do that&mdash;to remove this bottleneck hindering both consumers and producers.</P>

So far as this Bill goes to safeguard the national transport of the country, I am in full agreement with it.  I believe that it is very essential to safeguard the main arteries of transport for our people and that we should not in any way let a higgledy-piggledy competition arise, with everybody for himself and the devil take the hindmost.  We had an example of that immediately after the war when cars <Col N="700" /> were not so plentiful and every farmer's son looked for a hackney plate.  The ordinary man in the town, who had to earn his living and support his family by driving a taxi or hackney car, was driven into poverty by these farmers' sons having discs on their cars driving to every football match and meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only indicating that in so far as this Bill safeguards national transport, I am supporting it, and I will come to the particular point I have in mind.  This Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Road Transport Act, 1933, in relation to the carriage of merchandise in hired vehicles.  Section 1 says that in this Act &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; means the Road Transport Act, 1933 (No. 8 of 1933) as amended by the Road Transport Act, 1934, and so on.  The principle behind all these Acts and this Bill is to safeguard the railways and all pertaining thereto.</P>
      <P>As we knew the railways in our young days, the goods train came in&mdash; let us take a typical example&mdash;to the town where I lived.  There were floats stationed there, and they carried goods to Granard, Castlepollard, Coole and other places.  These men got plates. All the legislation which followed the Transport Act of 1933 safeguarded C.I.E. and the railways, but left these carriers in the same position as they were in in 1933.  They got a plate to carry merchandise within a certain radius, say, 30 miles, and which enabled them to purchase a lorry weighing two and a half tons.  Since then, the horse has disappeared and these men are supposed to convey in that two and a half ton lorry to the railways, cattle, sheep, pigs, oats and everything else.  There is nothing to allow them to purchase a lorry that will carry five tons or seven tons or ten tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that when he is safeguarding the main transport industry of the country these people, who were part and parcel and an essential arm of that industry, should be seen after.  They should be enabled to buy a bigger lorry and the radius of <Col N="701" /> their service should be extended, because if the Minister is to safeguard C.I.E., these necessary auxiliaries to it, who were there when it was the G.S.R., the M.G.W.R. and everything else, should be rescued from the unenviable position in which they are now. I got up to support the Bill in so far as it safeguards the industry, and to make war, if the Minister desires to make war, on a competition which would drive half the people into poverty, smash our transport system, and do no good in the end.</P>
    <P>In making that case in support of the Bill I want to make a plea for these forgotten men whose grandfathers went with horses and cars to the railway, whose fathers went with lorries, and who are now in a very hard plight.  Let the Minister take them into account, raise the tonnage they can convey, and extend the radius of their operations, and he will be doing a good day's service for the transport of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the last speaker has drawn me to my feet.  I also find myself in the position of supporting the effort to keep the main transport company of this country in existence.  I am afraid however that when the original Act was being introduced here, many things could not be taken into consideration, because the positions then and now are entirely different.  This Act has to be amended because of the fact that a certain man claimed to be hauling sand from his own sandpit; a whole legal argument arose and was fought in the different courts.  At the time the original Act was introduced in 1933 there was no such thing in existence as haulage from sandpits in this country in the form which has since arisen.  That was done then by horse and cart occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man who had a sandpit of his own was in a position to take his horse, and deliver his gravel wherever he liked.  I remember we fought in every county council, when C.I.E. started, to prevent them trying to confine transport to within four miles radius of a particular job to horse-cart traffic.  To-day we find the position that, if a man has a sandpit and is to supply gravel to a local authority, he has to get a C.I.E. lorry, <Col N="702" /> because it is nearly impossible to get a local lorry with a plate to carry out haulage.  That immediately involves the county council in additional expense, and perhaps the sandpit is uneconomic.  There are many other things involved, and the county council says: &ldquo;We must have a central gravel pit and should deliver from that.&rdquo;  I think the day is at hand when we should have an entirely new Transport Act.</P>
    <P>Another consideration is the fact that quite recently the Minister himself has helped to run through this Act, because when a certain individual applied to have the unladen weight of his lorry increased, where there were a number of similar types of lorries, the Minister agreed in his case and the applications of the others were turned down.  I cannot understand why that should have been done, unless it was through the particular influence of a certain individual in this House.  If we find that the position is that an individual can have the unladen weight increased by the Minister, surely a case can be made for a new Transport Act altogether. That is one reason why I will not be fully satisfied with the amendment of this Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked a few minutes ago: &ldquo;why confine this to farmers?&rdquo; There is a reason that can be advanced from the farming community as to why they should be entitled to have their haulage of their live stock taken to fairs and markets, because there is no such thing as a C.I.E. lorry convenient to most of them to go out in the middle of the night or at three or four o'clock in the morning when they have to send their stock to a fair or market.  Again, if the farmer was to take a C.I.E. lorry to take cattle or sheep to a fair even ten miles away, the cost of that would take a lot of profit away from the farming community, while if he gets it done by a local contractor or private lorry he can get it at a very economic price.</P>
    <P>The question of examining this Transport Act and having a new one drafted is a very important one, and must be considered immediately.  There are a number of reasons why we should have a new Transport Act in view of <Col N="703" /> the modern tendency in transport and the development of the transportation of different commodities so far as the farming community is concerned anyway. Again, C.I.E. themselves have shown reason why there should be an amendment.  In each beet factory they go out and hire lorries, and the lorries they hire are the ones that are in open competition with them in the market square every day in the week, the ones that are driving them out of business. This year, I had to take up a certain matter with C.I.E.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the amendment now proposed by the Minister arose from a weakness established in law in the existing Transport Acts, it has provided an opening for co-operation which would be of advantage in the outlying rural areas and, to my mind, it is questionable whether the closing of that gap now might not cause more trouble and inconvenience to the rural community than leaving the present situation to continue until the whole question can be re-examined fully.</P>
      <P>The present system whereby people in outlying rural communities have to send long distances for big lorries when they have only small loads to carry makes the whole thing very cumbersome and very expensive, whereas if they were allowed to use their neighbours' lorries for these small loads and on what may be very limited occasions, I think it would not interfere at all with the main operation of the Transport Act.  Taking the point that the Minister for Finance mentioned a while ago &mdash; that we must have regard to the conditions of employment, wages and hours of duty &mdash; we could provide very inexpensive transport, if all these things were to be disregarded, but one of the main things under the Transport Act is to have proper conditions of service and proper remuneration for the people engaged in it.  If it were to provide a cut-throat system, I would not for a moment say anything in its favour, but I do feel that in our outlying rural communities this opening provided in the Act only allows the farmers a certain scope for co-operation on the very limited occasions that they need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger, of course, is that advantage would be taken of it to make it apply more generally and perhaps cut across the whole idea of a transport system and I presume that is the reason why the Minister is taking this course of action now.  I think if we <Col N="705" /> allow it to continue until the matter is re-examined, it would be the wisest course to take.  At any rate, it would be the one I would advocate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make only one small point, and it arises out of an experience which I had as Parliamentary Secretary just before the last change of Government.  It arises out of the remarks made by Deputy Murphy during the course of this debate with reference to the transport of catches of fish from small centres to the Sea Fisheries marketing depots. It appears that, at one centre of which I was made aware, there was an arrangement whereby local fishermen, having landed a catch at the pier, sent a message to the local merchant who had a lorry, and he transported the catch to the marketing depot, ten to 15 miles distant.  As a result of the law as it now stands, the local merchant was prevented by the Gardaí from carrying on that transport system and, because of that, many catches were lost on land.  The marketing of them was lost to the fishermen because they were unable to get a vehicle licensed to carry merchandise for hire, or were unable to contact a C.I.E. lorry.</P>
      <P>If the Minister could conceive some system by which an <i>ad hoc</i> licence might be given to a local merchant, limited to the carrying of a particular catch as soon as it landed on the pier, a licence which perhaps might be issued by the local Garda sergeant, it would help to relieve the hardship that invariably exists, particularly where fishermen are concerned.  They often come in and their catch might be carried on the carrier of a bicycle; on the other hand, it might be of such proportions as would require a vehicle such as a lorry to transport it ten, 15 or even more miles to the marketing depot.  This is only a suggestion I am throwing out to the Minister.  It might be worthy of his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill has very limited intent, the discussion has travelled over a very wide area.  A number of Deputies discussed the virtues of private transport as against <Col N="706" /> public transport.  The question of how fish is to be carried and by whom was also discussed, and what we should do for those ancestors of ours who had at one time found a livelihood by the carriage of merchandise by horse-and cart and who were displaced by the efflux of time and the inauguration of mechanically hauled merchandise.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to follow a number of the points which were raised because they seem to me to be quite outside the scope of the Bill, except perhaps to touch on them so far as they affect the Bill or affect the request that has been made that some opening should be provided for discussing some amendments which are now considered necessary in the 1933 Act.  Some Deputies spoke as if I were responsible for the 1933 Act and preventing amendment of it.  Some Deputies spoke as if the problem of the disappearing horse only arose in the past 18 months.  Might I take this opportunity of reminding those Deputies that the Party opposite were in office for 18 years after the 1933 Act was passed and in every one of these 18 years, they could have amended that Act in any way they desired?  Having failed to make any amendment in the 1933 Act in the manner they now desire during that period, they come along this evening and say: &ldquo;What are you doing about the 1933 Act?  Why do you not amend it?  Why do you not read it this way?  Why do you not read it that way?&rdquo;  Surely the Deputies who spoke in that kind of way and had that kind of slant have something to reprove themselves for in not having taken steps during the 18 years they were in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another revelation that has descended upon you in the past 18 months.  I can understand Deputy Lemass getting annoyed by all the Deputies getting up and saying that such and such was wrong with the 1933 Act; that such and such should never have happened under the 1933 Act.  They asked when were we going to amend the 1933 Act; what were we going to do with the 1933 Act; were we going to do something they could not get done in the 18 years they were in office after the 1933 Act was passed?</P>
      <P>What should one do with the 1933 Act after listening to the views presented this evening?  Half a dozen different views came from the benches opposite and a variety of views was expressed around the House.  If we were to amend the 1933 Act, it would not be plain sailing.  There are certain vested interests built up under the 1933 Act, some of which are affected by this Bill.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the 1933 Act was to amend the chaotic transport organisation, or so-called organisation, of the day, to bring to an end, as a result, the cut-throat competition of that period, and to provide a coordinated system of public transport for the community generally.  Since 1933, the Act has been interpreted in a particular way.  Recently, in the manner I indicated in my introductory speech, the courts took a different view of a particular section of the Act.  As a result of the court decision in that respect, it is clear to me, as it is to Deputy Lemass, that the courts have not given effect to the intentions underlying the 1933 Act, when it was enacted by the Oireachtas.  The simple purpose of this Bill is to put the 1933 Act back where it was intended it should be placed by the Legislature when the Bill was enacted 23 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable to do that for a number of reasons.  In the first place, <Col N="708" /> if every person were permitted to buy a lorry and to hire himself and the lorry out to anybody who wanted it, that would only have one result so far as C.I.E. is concerned.  People might hire lorries on a H.P. arrangement and would try to get any price they could operating the lorry themselves as driver.  Long hours would be worked at low rates of pay.  That would bring to an end the whole road freight service operated by C.I.E. to-day.</P>
    <P>Any such move in on C.I.E. of that character would not only reproduce the chaos which the 1933 Act was intended to eradicate, but it would, in addition, send to the employment exchange those people who now get employment from the C.I.E. road freight department and who are paid reasonable rates of wages &mdash; certainly rates of wages regulated by trade union conditions.  Does anybody want to go back to the chaos of 1933? Does anybody want to have the cut-throat competition of 1933?  Does anybody want to go back to the diabolic hours and wages of 1933 in the then privately operated road transport system?  I will certainly never be responsible for producing in this House a Bill which is even remotely likely to create the conditions of 1933.  We got rid of them and we should now continue to operate a road transport policy which has the appearance of continuity and which will not change when a Government changes, a policy the people can understand and one that gives our road operators and rail operators a chance of knowing where they stand, too.</P>
    <P>But if this gap were not closed in the law as now interpreted by the courts, a most serious situation would arise.  There are in this country a considerable number of licensed hauliers who have bought their lorries and operated them for a long number of years.  They have an interest in the lorry and the lorry is their mainstay. If these people have to meet the competition of anybody not now in possession of a merchandise licence who would buy a lorry and hire out a lorry, then these licensed hauliers who were a feature of the 1933 Act would be driven to the wall as well, and firms now operating successfully and on a well-organised pattern in the category <Col N="709" /> of licensed hauliers would be driven to the wall.</P>
    <P>Again, the question of cut-throat competition would arise, in my view, if we did not close the gap created by the court decision so that, from the point of view of the licensed hauliers, who were a feature of the 1933 Act, and from the point of view of the railway company, and with a view to maintaining order in our own transport organisation, I think an amendment of the 1933 Act is necessary in order to maintain the position which was believed to exist until the recent court decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde made what I can only describe as an all-out attack on C.I.E.  He thought it could not be abolished quickly enough.  He made two statements which, I think, are so far removed from the facts that he ought to get the correct information as soon as possible.  He said that C.I.E. had a virtual monopoly for the past 20 years and that, in his view, the remedy was to have as many privately owned companies as possible, leaving them all to compete, and in that way you would get order and organisation in the transport business and reasonably cheap transport as well.</P>
    <P>What are the facts about the C.I.E. monopoly?  In 1933, there were 8,400 commercial goods vehicles on the road and in 1954, there were 37,000.  I have not got the figures for 1955, but if they follow the usual tendency, they go up by 4,000 a year.  Commercial road vehicles increased in number from 8,400 in 1933 to 37,000 in 1954.  C.I.E. not only had to compete with the 8,400 which were in existence in 1933, but with the additional 29,000 which have come on the road since then, and to say that C.I.E. had a virtual monopoly when new lorries were coming on the road at the rate of 4,000 a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>C.I.E. has no controlling monopoly, so far as these 37,000 lorries are concerned.  In the main, they are owned by people who are transporting goods in their own lorries now, goods which, if we had not these lorries, would probably be transported by C.I.E.  More and more of these lorries are being used every year. C.I.E. would now be much better off if the number was 8,000, as it was in 1933, instead of 37,000 as it is to-day.  I think that one of the Bills we put through this House provided for knocking the 26 companies, at that time in existence, into one because it was recognised at the time that this multiplicity of companies could not give the country a national transport system. Some of them had as many directors as they had railway engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the transport of fish has been raised.  I know that there has been in the Department an attitude that additional merchandise licences cannot be given where C.I.E. is willing to provide alternative transport. I think that, generally speaking, that policy is reasonable enough.  However, representations were made to my predecessor and to me with a view to easing off in the case of fish.  I know that fish is a perishable commodity and that a fisherman does not know what type of transport he will need until he lands his fish, and that he does not know whether he will have fish or not to transport until he hauls in his nets. The representation made to me that the transport being supplied by C.I.E. was not always suitable was a <Col N="711" /> reasonable one, particularly where the lorry was not based on the village where the fish was landed.</P>
    <P>When the merits of the representations made by the Kilmore Quay Co-Operative Association were brought to my notice, I had investigations made, and I came to the conclusion that this co-operative effort by the local association should be recognised, and a licence was issued to them to transport the fish in their own lorry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did they need a licence?  The association could always operate a lorry without a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The society did not own the fish.  They had taken the fish from the boat, but it was the fishermen's fish until it was sold, and could only be transported by the fishermen. I gave the society a licence in order that the fish could be marketed more quickly and without loss.</P>
      <P>Similar representations were made to me with regard to Bantry and again I issued a licence for the transport of the fish in order to improve the marketability of the fish.  I directed the Department to consider individual applications for licences in respect of fish on their merits.  Where the merits were substantial, the applications were to be granted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Finlay raised the question of the position of a man whose lorry is undergoing repairs or cannot be used because of damage.  As I understand the position, it is that he is not at present, under the law as it stands, permitted in law to replace the lorry which is not serviceable. While that is the law in the matter, everybody, including the Garda Síochána, recognised that if a man's lorry is out of action, no objection was taken to his hiring another lorry of approximately the same tonnage and using it until such time as his own lorry was repaired.  It may be that this amendment of the law now puts the position back where it was believed to be before the recent court judgment.  I do not think, in fact, that any difficulty will arise where a lorry is substituted for another one in such circumstances. In fact, although the law since 1933 was that one lorry could not be substituted for another, the actual substitution did not present any difficulty or give rise to any problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the case where a person has a lorry for use. No difficulties arose where a merchant found it necessary, while one lorry was being repaired, to substitute another lorry for it.  In fact, the substitution took place and nothing happened. Similarly, as I understand the position, where a person had a lorry recognised for the transport of goods, if that lorry was out of action, undergoing repair or damaged, it could not be substituted, but notwithstanding that, no administrative difficulty ever arose in the matter.  If there is any great feeling in the House that the matter should be corrected, I would, if I were amending the Bill at a later stage here, or in the Seanad, be prepared to see if an amendment could be introduced to meet the situation and clarify the position.  I am telling the House, at the same time, that, in fact, no real difficulty has ever arisen in the substituting of another vehicle for one which was undergoing repairs.</P>

      <P>We got on for 23 years without any difficulty arising.  There is always the possibility that it might arise.  Any new interpretation by the courts might induce them to do what they did after 23 years in the case of a similar section in another Bill.  At all events, I will have a look at it between now and the Committee Stage here, or in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of a review of the 1933 Act, I think no impetuosity which a Deputy may feel towards the progress or lack of progress, as he sees it, of C.I.E. ought induce us to make changes in our transport code which are calculated to bring more uneasiness and uncertainty into the method of dealing with our transport problem. In the main, the 1933 Act has worked reasonably well.  It is true that the habits of the people have changed substantially since that Act was passed. One can even say that the pattern is likely to change, still more so, away from the 1933 conditions.  You must remember, however, that any amendment of the 1933 Act which, for example, is going to allow more people into the haulage business, to impact on existing hauliers, is going to be harmful to those who have to make a livelihood now out of the carrying of merchandise for reward.  If you permit farmers now to haul commodities which are at present hauled by the <Col N="714" /> railway company, you are taking more traffic from the railway company.  You may also import an element of unfair competition inasmuch as if you permit farmers to haul goods, while paying only an agricultural tax in respect of their vehicle in competition with firms paying full tax, trade union rates of wages and observing trade union agreements generally, you may at that point cause considerable unemployment for those who are at present employed in our transport company.</P>

      <P>Deputies sitting behind Deputy Lemass travelled much farther than he.  I think C.I.E. itself ought to be glad to get rid of what at times must be an irritating and expensive requirement, namely, having to have a lorry at a farmer's gate, on demand, to carry a particular quantity of merchandise, perhaps not a very long distance.  Getting away from all that detailed administration must, I think, have a beneficial effect on their organisation generally.  I think it is better for a national transport company, as it were, to keep on the main road of public transport and not to get into the boreens and laneways of transport; leave that to some other kind of organisation.  It may well be that the test of what the transport vehicle should be is the tractor.  Obviously, <Col N="715" /> that has advantages over permitting the farmer to use a lorry, even on a neighbourly or co-operative basis. I will undertake to have that matter examined specially to see to what extent it is possible and practicable to bring about an arrangement of that kind without impairing the finances of the railway company to any serious extent or impacting unfairly on other people.</P>
      <P>If, as well, the House desires a discussion on the general question of transport, I should be glad to agree, although it is a bad time of the year to do so now on a private member's motion as we shall be dealing with financial business next month.  If there is any desire to have the matter examined by any means other than a motion here, I would be willing, if Deputy Lemass is interested, to examine any suggestions which he cares to make in that field as well or, if he is satisfied at this stage, I am willing to examine the tractor proposition and then we can look at it in the light of what the examination throws up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section 3 of this section contributions must be paid in respect of service days occurring between the date of the commencement of Part III of the 1948 Act and the commencement of Part III of this Bill before they can be reckoned for pension purposes.  It has, however, now come to notice that established servants under the 1948 Act are entitled to reckon some of these days free of contribution.  Servants had a period of six months from the commencement of Part III of the 1948 <Col N="717" /> Act to opt for the present scheme.  If they opted they were deemed to be established &mdash; that is, pensionable &mdash; as and from the commencement of Part III, but their liability for contributions commenced only from the date their names were entered on the register of established servants; that is, they had a period of anything up to six months of free service.  Part III, as it stands, inadvertently requires payment of contributions in respect of the free period. The amendment will remedy this by excluding the free period from liability to contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that the position should be made clear that this Bill, in our opinion, is nothing like the Bill we hoped it would be. Circumstances prevented us from having certain improvements made in this Bill.  I am sorry to say that at this stage, while letting the Bill pass into law, we have to admit here and now that, before long, if we are to give justice as justice must be given to the employees of local authorities, more amending legislation will have to be introduced by whatever Minister or whatever Government may hold office.  I sincerely hope the time will not be long when such amending legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent a good deal of time, both in Committee and in discussions with the Minister and his officials over the past 12 months, trying to have introduced here a progressive measure to remedy the defects affecting employees classified as either officers or servants of local authorities.  Many people outside this House were not aware that, during the discussions on the Committee Stage last week, many amendments were put down by members of the Labour Party, and it was not just a case of those amendments not being moved; it was a case that, when I noticed it during an interlude in the discussion on these amendments last week, I personally, as one member of <Col N="718" /> the Labour Party, drew attention to the fact that amendments were not moved because they had been ruled out of order.  Not alone was that not made known to the public, but it was not recorded even in our Official Debates.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we have to be prepared now to say that much that should be enshrined in this Bill is being omitted.  We bow to the ruling of the Chair.  We accept majority rule, where it comes through the individual holding the high office of Ceann Comhairle. But even at this stage we have every reason to say that we are totally dissatisfied with some of the decisions.  After all, the Minister has come a long way towards helping local authorities by saying that he, holding the office as Minister for Local Government, is prepared to make provision for pensions for servants, as they may be termed, and employees of local authorities. What is wrong in our saying that local authorities should be made to accept what the Minister is freely offering? We fail to understand why any suggestion should be made to us that that, in itself, rules us out, because of financial commitments.</P>
    <P>There is much I shall have to discuss perhaps at a later stage.  As I said at the outset, while this Bill, in its own way, may be giving certain advantages, it is not going to give any of the advantages that we envisaged should be offered to these people, who have been denied these advantages all the years, advantages to which we maintain and have always upheld, they are entitled.  I do not wish to delay the House, but I do say that this Bill will not go down in history as the most outstanding Bill introduced here for the improvement of legislation affecting workers in the employment of local authorities.  It will not go down as an outstanding piece of legislation for the advancement of certain sections who may be classified as &ldquo;officers of local authorities&rdquo;.  As time goes on and the many weaknesses in the Bill become apparent, not alone to representatives of local authorities, but to the Minister and hierarchy in the Custom House, we will be proved right in the <Col N="719" /> amendments we tabled in order to improve this Bill.  They may, by then, be long overdue.  Eventually, in order to improve the superannuation system in local government, these amendments will, with the help of Providence, not alone be introduced, but carried in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I will not be able to say much in praise of this Bill.  In so far as it purports in its Explanatory Memorandum to be a substantial improvement on the Act it amends, I am afraid I can only say that the Bill has failed lamentably. When we on this side of the House, in conjunction with our colleagues on the other side, sought to have the Bill amended in order to relieve hardships that undoubtedly exist as a result of the passage of the last Act, we did so in the hope that we could truly label this Bill a substantial improvement on the Act it purports to amend.  Unfortunately this is not the position.  We were told that some of the shortcomings of the present Bill, if they were to disappear, might open the flood-gates of demands.  I submit that was no excuse.  If injustices were being done, the impact the removal of such injustices might have on local or State funds was not a valid excuse and should not have been taken into consideration; it was not a valid excuse for not having such hardships alleviated and injustices set aside.</P>
      <P>I will not refer to the amendments that Deputy Desmond's colleagues and my colleague and I sought to introduce. The Chair, in its judgment, ruled them out of order.  They cannot, therefore, be moved.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the amendments now appearing here on the Report Stage and the amendments that appeared on the Committee Stage are proof that disabilities exist, and continue to exist, in so far as the employment and superannuation of local government officials are concerned. Until such time as these are alleviated, we cannot claim to have a proper superannuation system for local government employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Second Reading, <Col N="720" /> I said that, in my opinion, the Bill should have been recast.  I said that for two reasons.  One was that I felt that the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1955, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, affects officers of local authorities who are more directly responsible to other Ministers.  When one seeks to investigate their conditions of employment to try to alleviate the disabilities from which they claim they suffer, one is often in doubt as to which Minister is ultimately responsible, whether it be the Minister for Local Government himself, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, in some respects, or the Minister for Social Welfare, in other respects.  Therefore, I think the time has come when some codification of local government law, in so far as it affects the employment of local government employees, is necessary and long overdue.</P>
    <P>I can only repeat what Deputy Desmond has said, that nobody can by any means claim on behalf of this Bill that it is the last word on this particular type of legislation.  Hardships do exist and disabilities are there to be set aside and remedied.  As long as they are there, I am afraid amending legislation will be necessary, and necessary in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the two previous speakers, must add my voice to the expression of disappointment which we feel in relation to the Final Stages of this piece of amending legislation. If it were a new Bill coming through the House dealing with an entirely new subject, we could possibly say that mistakes could be made which could at a later stage be remedied; but the original Act dealing with this subject has been in operation since 1948, and, while it was patently evident to everybody what the flaws were, it is just too bad that the amending legislation will reach the Final Stages with the position very little better in very many cases than it was under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do agree&mdash;and we are glad of it&mdash; that in a number of ways the Bill has remedied some of the defects which <Col N="721" /> arose in the 1948 Act.  But it is the ones which have been overlooked, the glaring injustices which have not been covered by this Bill that we are worried about, the glaring injustices which have remained there because of the fact that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle, ruled out of order amendments which would have brought about the desired effect.  I am sure that the Minister would agree that some of the amendments were highly desirable and could have been brought into the Bill.  It came as a surprise to us, as no doubt it came as a surprise to our colleagues across the way, to find to-day that these amendments were ruled out of order on the day when the Bill was coming up for consideration on this stage.  While it is a bit too late to speak, I am appealing to the Minister to do something about it.  Everybody will agree that numerous remedies for the defects which occurred in the previous Act &mdash; and which are recurring in the present Bill &mdash; could have been applied if they had been considered and considered properly.</P>
    <P>The one thing that annoys me more than anything else is that almost through the whole of last summer a committee of our Party and, I am sure, a committee of other Parties, met again and again in order to bring some or all of these defects to the notice of the Minister.  To find now, coming to the Final Stages of this Bill, that it is in many respects as bad a Bill as the 1948 one was, is surely most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>One particular question which many of us feel could have been considered is the question of the amount of payment. While all sorts of cases were made, I think our case for a reduction in the amount is unanswerable.  In any event, in looking over the Bill, we find that there are numerous defects which could have been remedied by a slight change in the wording of the Bill.  This was suggested by us, and, even though the amendments were ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, I am sure our amendments, at least, if not those of our opposite numbers, could have been included and taken advantage of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The only satisfaction <Col N="722" /> to be gained from this Bill is that it remedied a situation in regard to the payment of contributions by certain sections of the workers of Cork Corporation. Though we are all aware, as are the Ministers concerned since 1948, that it was not the intention of the 1948 Act that those people should be asked to make contributions, on some legal quibble, when the manager appealed to the Supreme Court, that court decided that those people should continue to pay contributions because the manager had failed to keep a proper register.  We must believe that it was through the failure of the city manager to keep a register that those people were compelled to pay the contributions.</P>
      <P>We are glad this Bill has cleared up that position and that these men will be repaid the amount taken from them and will not have to contribute any more.  However, as far as Cork City Deputies are concerned, that is all the satisfaction we will obtain from the Bill.  We met the Minister in relation to several matters.  We met him in regard to adding years of service in respect of local authority officials and servants who had given good service to this country and who, due to their activities, were not able to get into positions in the local authority until they were fairly advanced in years, and will not be in a position to secure full pension, or anything near full pension. We find the Minister will not agree to give those men at least ten years' added service which at one time they could have got.  We are told that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Defence to look after the I.R.A. men of those years.  I am not so innocent as to believe that the Minister cannot see the difficulties which the Minister for Defence would have in trying to do anything like that and I feel that the local authorities should be left in the position of being able to add up to ten years to their service.  I think all the city Deputies were anxious about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that other Deputies besides myself raised, namely, the position of pensioners who were pensioned when the £ was worth £1 and who are still on a very low rate of pension, a pension on which they <Col N="723" /> could not exist if it were not for the help they get from other people.  It is a very sad state of affairs that people who have given good service to local authorities should be left at the rate of pension they got in 1938 or at a rate very near that.  I think there was one increase.  I am sorry that the Minister did not take steps to remedy that position.  I said on Second Reading that the Cork Harbour Commissioners, who have not to get departmental sanction, brought their pensions up to date and recently gave to their pensioners two-thirds of the increase of 14/6 that was given to the workers.  They did the same for the clerical staff; they gave them two-thirds of whatever increase was given. If they were in the position that they required sanction from the Department their pensioners would still be on a rate of pension on which they could not possibly exist.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Desmond, Deputy Tully and Deputy Jack Lynch, I think this Bill falls very far short of what we all expected.  It does one thing for which I am glad &mdash; it settles the question of Cork Corporation workers.  That is about all this Bill does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is unanimity on all sides that this Bill can be deemed to be little more than a step in the right direction towards the provision of adequate and just superannuation rights and conditions for employees of local authorities.  As my colleague Deputy Desmond said, we had a committee that put quite a lot of work into this Bill and that went on many deputations.  It was rather discouraging that some of our main amendments were ruled out on a technicality, and if I may suggest, in one or two particular cases, a rather far-fetched technicality. While we have succeeded in some cases, through representations before the draft of the Bill came to the House, in having some improvements made in relation to the services of people whom we strive to represent here, we must be candid and say that the Bill in its final form represents very many disappointments for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, perhaps <Col N="724" /> one of the greatest disappointments derives from the fact that, although this Superannuation Bill has been introduced, any county council or corporation, to-morrow morning, can decide not to implement it.  We had hoped that the Minister would take his courage in his hands and say to all local authorities: &ldquo;We, the Government of the country, feel that it is just and equitable that employees of local authorities should have a just and fair superannuation scheme.&rdquo;  That has not been said.  We have here a Bill that provides for some sort of superannuation but it is up to the local authority to implement it or not.  Knowing some of the local authorities as we do, I am afraid that if their employees are depending on this Bill there will never be a pension scheme for very many of them.</P>
    <P>While that is a grave disappointment, it must be a disappointment to everybody in the House that in the year 1956 Dáil Éireann is passing legislation which includes a strike clause.  One would have imagined that we had advanced far enough in this country to deem it Gilbertian to put a section into the Bill which penalises officers of a local authority for standing up for their rights and taking whatever action their trade union decides.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, there was such a provision in the 1948 Act in relation to both servants and officers of the local authority.  The Minister has taken this opportunity to delete this penal clause in relation to servants, but he has retained it in relation to officers. I am anxious to know why there should be discrimination against one section in this respect.  I am tempted to suggest that it is because of the organised force of the servants and the strength of their trade unions that they had justice done to them and that because of the fact that officers of local authorities are not so well organised, they were dealt with in an unjust manner, a manner dissimilar to the manner in which servants were dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is a very grave disappointment to me, personally, that in the year 1956 any Irish Government should pass legislation containing such a clause.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I feel that the Bill has very many more shortcomings, but, please God, we are young enough to look forward to another Local Government (Superannuation) Bill.  I hope it will be introduced in the not too distant future and that these outstanding grievances will be remedied on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill. I should like also to thank the various deputations which I have met for the helpful advice they gave me before the various stages of the Bill reached the House.  When I say deputations, I mean deputations including members of all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I hope, like other Deputies, that the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1955, will not be the last Bill introduced in the House to give superannuation to employees of local authorities but it is, as Deputy Casey pointed out, a step forward.  Let us remember that, since the inception of the State down to 1948, no effort was made to give superannuation to servants of local authorities.  In 1925, shortly after the State was established, a Bill was passed through this House to give superannuation to officers of local authorities, but, from the passing of that Bill until 1948, no effort whatsoever was made to do anything for the servants.  This Bill has been introduced to remedy some of the faults in the 1948 Act.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies mentioned that we did not follow the pattern of the British system of superannuation in local authorities.  Let me remind the House that, so far as the servants and officers of local authorities in Britain are concerned, only wholetime servants are superannuated.  Unfortunately, in this country we cannot give wholetime employment to all the servants of local authorities but we go a good way towards making up for that when we provide for these 200 service days.  If they have 200 service days in the year, they become automatically entitled to superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are on the Final Stage of the Bill and I understand that we can discuss only what is in the Bill and not what <Col N="726" /> is omitted from it but most of the speeches here this evening were addressed to omissions from the Bill, not to its contents, and it is but right that I should refer to them now in reply.  Right through the entire discussion of this Bill and through the deputations which I have met, the principal points which were advanced were, first of all, that the contributions were too high; secondly, in certain cases that there be no contributions; and, thirdly, that years should be added to an officer's service in order to enable him to draw full superannuation.  Has anyone thought of the impact on the taxpayers and ratepayers?  No person seems to have thought of that.  We did try to meet it in the case of Cork, where we must refund some rightful dues to the servants of the corporation. We tried to cushion the ratepayers of Cork against the impact of that £23,000 or £24,000 that must be repaid to the servants concerned.  That is being done because of representations received from all sides of the House.  I decided to leave it to themselves in Cork as to how they would refund the money.</P>
    <P>We must think of the taxpayers and the ratepayers and it may be possible to review the Bill in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>Deputies Casey and Desmond made reference to the fact that it is optional for the local authorities as to whether or not they will adopt a scheme of superannuation.  I am very glad indeed that it is optional.  I am proud of the fact that we are leaving to the authorities their own decision in this matter.  After all, for far too long and for far too many years have we been dictators to local authorities in matters of local government, and it is only right we should leave it to them to decide whether or not they will adopt a scheme of superannuation.  It is much better to leave it to the local authorities to say whether or not they can afford or wish to implement the Act. Of course, I sincerely hope every local authority will adopt a scheme and, if compulsion is necessary, and I hope it never will be, it may be possible to review the matter at a future date.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should let the occasion pass without again paying tribute to my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy <Col N="727" /> Davin, for the amount of work he put into the preliminary stages of the Bill. I am only sorry he is not in the House to see the Bill reach its Final Stage. I also owe thanks to the House for the manner in which the Bill was received. I wish to thank the various Deputies who came on deputations and gave me every assistance in the preparation of the Bill and for its expeditious passage through the House.  If I could not meet them on every point, I hope I expressed myself in very simple language that they would understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £85,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1956, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (Secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (Sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951, etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs already approved by the Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1956, amounts to £7,707,000.  Owing to causes which could not be foreseen, this provision will be insufficient and an additional sum of £85,000 will be required to meet expenditure up to the end of the financial year.  The gross extra <Col N="728" /> expenditure on the sub-heads for which the original provision is insufficient is estimated at £196,000.</P>
    <P>The sub-heads affected and brief explanations of the causes of the increases are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (2) &mdash; increase £66,000: due to pay awards and the cost of additional staff for increased telephone and postal traffic, offset by reduction in staff for telegraph traffic; sub-head A (3)&mdash;increase £57,000: the increased sum is required to meet pay awards; sub-head E (5) &mdash; increase £22,000: air mail traffic increased to a greater extent than anticipated.  The additional traffic, it will be appreciated, produces increased revenue which more than offsets the increased cost of conveyance by air.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £15,000 in sub-head I (1).</P>
    <P>The amount provided under the sub-head in the original Estimate is a net figure which is arrived at by deducting from the total cost of the salaries, wages and allowances that portion of it which is attributable to telephone capital works and which is proper to be paid from telephone capital funds. The relief to the sub-head by this process was less than originally estimated.</P>
    <P>The increase of £7,000 in sub-head I (2) is due to an increase in the rates of subsistence allowances; the increase in sub-head K is £13,000 and is due to greater consumption of certain stores than was anticipated; and the increase of £16,000 in sub-head N (1) is due to the number of retirements from the service being greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>The increases to which I have referred amount to £196,000.  Against this, however, savings on other sub-heads amounting to £69,000 will be available and, in addition, Appropriations-in-Aid (sub-head T) will be higher than estimated by £42,000, leaving a net sum of £85,000 now to be provided.  The reason for the increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid is that more obsolete stores than estimated became available for sale and prices realised were higher than expected. This increase was partly offset, however, by reduced receipts from the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <Col N="729" />
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister certain questions about the different sub-heads.  It is noted there has been a reduction in the amount of capital expenditure.  Why? In view of the fact that the telephone service is self-paying, I always regard it as a pity if the amount of capital expenditure in a given year has to be reduced, owing to the fact that some envisaged plans have not materialised. I notice also that the cost of engineering materials is increased in the Estimate.  I should like to ask the Minister if the increased cost is just for current maintenance, or whether it has been due, to some extent, to an increase in the amount of capital work done and whether it will be to that extent offset in the capital account.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask whether the reduction in the capital sum to be spent is due to any delays in the recabling of Dublin, because I understood from the Minister that that was progressing satisfactorily, and I should hate to think there was any setback in the scheme in general, because, as the Minister knows, it is one of very great urgency.  It will be possible, when the scheme is completed, for people to get their telephones far more quickly in a number of Dublin regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether the pay increases in this Estimate are the result of conciliation and negotiations which took place within the Post Office service, or whether they relate to the general increase in the pay awards which forms the subject of the next Estimate but one, under the title of &ldquo;Remuneration&rdquo;; in other words, whether they are individual schemes for increased pay, or part of the general award made recently.  If they relate to the general award, I should like to ask whether they include any increase in pay for the female staff, whose remuneration by any standard has been very, very low for a considerable number of years, and about which there were difficulties relating to Civil Service standards in general.  In other words, successive Ministers have found it difficult to raise the salaries of that particular class of person, which, I think, during my term of office amounted to some £3 10s. a week, and the girls <Col N="730" /> employed, for some reason or other, were largely non-residential persons who came from the country.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the pay award includes that particular class of person.</P>
    <P>In connection with this general Estimate, which involves increases in pay awards and in certain expenditures and reductions in others, I should like to ask whether the increase in the case of engineering materials or the decrease in capital expenditure has any relation to the reorganisation proposals in the engineering department which were under way when the last Government was defeated, and which related to rerouting, redeployment of gangs, redistribution of stores, and control of stores, redeployment of the district offices, and the alteration in the areas of control, and a number of other matters.  I should like to ask the Minister whether those plans have any relation to the present Estimate.</P>
    <P>There was a proposal at that time to secure more efficiency in the service by the method of recruiting certain classes of officers, and there was a temporary period when it looked as though there might be less of a staff employed on telephone development work until the time would come when, as a result of reorganisation of the whole staff, more gangs could be recruited and the work could go on at a greater pace than ever.  I should like to ask the Minister whether this increase in the pay award has any relation to some of the decisions being made at that time.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister what his view is of the general increase in this Estimate.  I think it is extremely bad for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and worse still for the country, to have the taxpayer pay any portion of the increased cost of this service.  There have been very considerable increases in the cost of the service, and so far as I know the Minister has found it difficult, and still finds it difficult, to make the service pay.  The rising tide of inflation that has taken place for a considerable number of years made his task still more difficult.  I want to ask him does he intend to make the taxpayer pay for this or to finance it in some other <Col N="731" /> way when he comes to the question of the main Estimate for his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredByrne" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister if he will explain the cause of the delay at St. John's Road, Inchicore, where there are a number of casual men who have been left without an increase in wages that ordinary everyday workers have received.  These casual men &mdash; we will call them permanent casuals&mdash;have been denied the increase which the ordinary workers on the road have got, and they are all doing the same type of work.  This is not the first time it has happened.  I understand that last year and the year before an increase was granted and certain casual types of men were left without the increased wages.  One man representing 12 or 14 wrote to me and said: &ldquo;Dear Alderman Byrne: We are all doing the same work and we all eat the same loaf.  It costs the same.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They say that when it was brought up a year ago, and two or three years ago, there was to be a discussion in some internal department and a decision that they were to get the award.  I merely ask the Minister to pass that instruction on without delay, to say that casual men doing the same kind of work as other ordinary road workers or labourers engaged at St. John's Road will get the benefit of the award, with the arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to say that there has been no reduction at all in the capital expenditure. Deputy Childers is aware that this is more of a book-keeping transaction. The estimated amount at the start of a year, and how much work is to be done in a particular period, is decided as far as possible by the engineer, and he adjusts how much of that is on capital account.  It is not easy to be accurate on this in advance, <Col N="732" /> and on many occasions, practically every year, there is some difference between the estimated amount and the actual expenditure.  But there is no reduction whatever in the capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>In connection with the cabling of Dublin, it is going on apace.  Everything possible is being done to speed up the position because it is very unfortunate to have to refuse various applications for telephones; and, in addition to the staff of the Department working overtime, we have engaged a contractor who is giving very considerable help at the moment in the City of Dublin and on to Dún Laoire, which were the two big points of loss.  We are not up-to-date with it yet, but I think we are making very good and speedy progress.  Throughout the country, we have been able to overhaul a number of long-standing arrears for long line phones.  We are not yet happy about the position, but we have done very good work in the year past.  We got in 7,800 phones and there was a good deal of difficulty in getting to that point.  I hope that we will be able to do better than in previous years and enable the position to improve still further.</P>
      <P>There is no connection in this Estimate with the reorganisation proposed by the Deputy.  This is just supplementary.</P>
      <P>In connection with wages, the pay increases are not the Civil Service award at all.  They are the wages of the workers negotiated by the Department through the unions, and they are not connected with the Civil Service award, which is not covered by this. The sorting assistants are included in the pay award.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point introduced by Deputy Byrne, if he will give me particulars of that, I will get after it immediately.  I do not know the particular case to which he referred.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,054,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, <Col N="734" /> 1956, for payment of certain increases in Remuneration of Civil Servants, Teachers, Members of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces and of certain Employees of Local Authorities.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the year 1955 saw the development in employment generally of a round of wage increases which has come to be known as the fifth round of post-war wage increases.  It was inevitable that fifth-round claims should be made on behalf of persons in public employment and, towards the end of 1955, claims for increases in pay were lodged by the principal groups whose remuneration is borne wholly or partly by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The claim on behalf of civil servants falling within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration scheme &mdash; which was one for an increase of 15 per cent. on the existing levels of pay and allowances &mdash; was discussed in December, 1955, at the General Council.  As a result, agreement was reached on a pay revision which went a little over half way towards meeting the claim made.  The actual increases given were in line with those agreed for outside workers during the course of the fifth round and I am satisfied that increases of these dimensions could not reasonably have been withheld from civil servants.  The settlement arrived at is, in my view, fair both to the taxpayer and to his employees.  I subsequently discussed with representatives of the staff association catering for civil servants above the arbitration limits the claim of those officers for a salary revision arising out of the settlement within the scheme and, while I was unable to concede the full claim made, I agreed to an appropriate salary adjustment for these classes.</P>
    <P>As regards national teachers, the claim which was received from the Irish National Teachers' Organisation in October, 1955, was based not merely on cost of living and economic factors but also sought to improve the status of the national teacher <i>vis-â-vis</i> the other sections of the community.  The opportunity was taken to negotiate a comprehensive settlement with the national teachers under their scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> I should perhaps mention that no provision is being made in this Supplementary Estimate for increases to secondary teachers because this group has submitted a claim under its own machinery of conciliation and arbitration. This claim will be dealt with separately and in due course.</P>
    <P>The pay and allowances of members of the Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána have, as on previous occasions of general pay revisions, been increased in line with the Civil Service revision.</P>
    <P>Fifth-round claims were made on behalf of health authority staffs and, when the Civil Service claim had been disposed of, the Minister for Health indicated his preparedness to approve of certain increases in pay for the local staffs for which he is the appropriate Minister.  Under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, 50 per cent. of the expenditure of health authorities on approved health services including local administrative costs, is recouped by the Exchequer.  The increased cost to the Exchequer arising out of the present increases in pay for health authority staffs must accordingly be provided for.  Provision is also being made to enable increases, on the Civil Service lines, to be given to vocational teachers and to certain other employees of vocational education committees, should these committees grant such increases.</P>
    <P>The effective date of the pay revisions which I have referred to is, in each case, the 1st November, 1955, and the amount for which I am presenting the present Supplementary Estimate, £1,054,000 is, accordingly, the amount necessary to pay the increases in respect of the five months' period from 1st November, 1955, to 31st March, 1956.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Estimate, it is quite evident that, in accordance with the rise in the cost of living, there have been various increases in wages among different sections of the community and that, in accordance with custom and tradition, it is only right and proper that the <Col N="736" /> servants of the State should have their remuneration increased in line with the rest of the community.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he had in mind any point in the cost-of-living index when he made this agreement; in other words, what point had the cost-of-living index reached when this agreement was made, whether in the mind of the Minister or in the minds of those with whom he negotiated? Perhaps he would tell us that in replying?</P>
      <P>Having said this Estimate is inevitable under the circumstances, I think we should make the very essential point that this is a gross breach of promise by the present Government which said it would reduce the cost of living. They promised to reduce the cost of government by at least £10,000,000 or even £20,000,000 in a broadcast which was made, and which was heard by a majority of the people.  They promised manifold economies in the Civil Service and the Minister for Defence, speaking in my constituency, said Fianna Fáil had created a super-State in which so much money was spent by the Government, in which there was such a huge number of administrative officials, that the people had no money of their own left to spend upon their ordinary existence.  He characterised the entire civil administration of the State at that time, when we left office, as ungodly.</P>
      <P>This increase which will amount to over £2,000,000 in a full year is necessary, having regard to the general line-up of wages in this country, but it is very far from being a fulfilment of the promise that was made in the old atmosphere of the last general election which was characterised by the general suggestion that the Government should get out of its responsibilities to a considerable degree, that it was like a millstone around the neck of the people.  Now we know that no economies can be made sufficient to offset these necessary increases in pay and that all these promises have been ruthlessly broken.</P>

    <P>I would also like to point out that, just about the time the results of these <Col N="737" /> negotiations were announced, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach were making speeches informing the people of the country that salary and wage increases were largely illusory in their effect.  In fact, when the increases in remuneration had been fully announced, the Taoiseach, I think, speaking at a banquet in Cork, or the occasion of some annual function of some body, made a remark to the effect that those increases were largely illusory.  It was rather poor comfort for all the State servants involved, particularly those in the lower income categories.  They had had their pay increased and were told by the Taoiseach that so far as they were concerned the increases were likely to be illusory, that the cost of living would rise &mdash; possibly as a result of these increases &mdash; and would rise as a result of the increases paid to other salaried workers and workers taking part in the production of industrial goods.</P>
    <P>It was poor comfort to them, but as we are now suffering the process of inflation, it would be grossly unfair, unless these sections of the community had the same benefits as were given to the other sections of the community, whatever the results may be.  Of course, we notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Social Welfare when they speak, see no harm in these increases. They regard these increases in wages and salaries that have taken place in the last two years as complete justification for their elaborate promises to reduce the cost of living and the cost of government.  In their speeches, they never refer to the warnings given by the Minister for Finance as to the results of inflationary measures of this kind which may have the ultimate effect of undoing the good they are supposed to do.  In fact, at the moment, the Government has no policy in regard to inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. O'Donovan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that, when the Opposition have to make a case for which there is no evidence in reason or in logic, they always ask Deputy Childers to make it. There was in existence in this State, when the cost of living was put up substantially by Deputy MacEntee in his 1952 Budget, a scheme of arbitration, just as there was recently.  The civil servants were awarded in the ordinary way under that scheme of arbitration a certain increase in their remuneration to meet the increase in the cost of living in the year 1952 &mdash; an increase brought about by the Government of the day.  Was that implemented in accordance with Deputy Childers's words?  Was that implemented in accordance with custom and tradition?</P>
      <P>The House knows that the new Government had to pay that award for the period from 21st November, 1952, to 31st March, 1953, some years later. Then they talk about gross breaches of promise.  I took down the words of Deputy Childers &mdash;&ldquo;a gross breach of promise.&rdquo;  That was not just a breach of promise.  It was breach of the ordinary canons of decency between the master and his servant, the ordinary rules that govern a contract of service.</P>
      <P>I examined the subject referred to by Deputy Childers.  In each year that Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance, he increased cost of government in this country by £5,000,000 in the first half of each year.  It was not in a full year at all, but in the first half of each year he was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate is an effort by the Government to treat its <Col N="740" /> employees in the same way as private firms have done throughout the country due to the increases in the cost of living.  It is purely and simply a result of the increase in the cost of living which has taken place during the present financial year.  It is certain that, in the coming financial year, similar steps will have to be taken and that a sixth or seventh round wage increase will have to be met.</P>
      <P>These increases to the various civil servants, teachers, and so on, cater for a fairly small section of our people. These, together with the increases given by private employers, do not by any means cover a large section of the community.  We have a big section of our people who are their own employers. What will they do about the high cost of living?  What will the Government do about it?  Can the Government do anything for that loyal section of our people who are self employed?</P>

      <P>I just mentioned the matter as a contrast.  This measure makes provision and, rightly so, for the increase in the cost of living.  The cost of living necessitates this increase, if not more.  I contrasted that with the position of that section of our people who are self employed &mdash; small farmers, fishermen and so on who cannot appeal to anyone, who have no unions or other organisations to look after them, and who cannot appeal to anybody for increases along the lines and on the basis on which these increases were given.  It is a section of the community which must be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned increases for national teachers and that the sum covered more than the Civil Service award.  I should like to hear the Minister give the figures in relation to the amount given to teachers which is outside this Civil Service award.  I would say it is very small.  As a matter <Col N="741" /> of fact, some teachers got no increases at all under this and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These increases are necessary.  They will cost for a period of five months well over £1,000,000 and, in a full year, over £2,000,000.  I was amused to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that he can, at the next election, or at any time, go back to his constituency, stand before the people and say he has done his best, but there is hardly a Deputy, no matter on what side of the House he is, who could not do the same thing. All Deputies could go back to their constituents and say they have done their best.  That is no proof that the actions of the Government are in line with any promises they made.  If one's best proves to be damned bad, there is nothing great about going back to one's constituents and saying you have done your best, especially if your best does not serve the people of the constituency, and the best in regard to the present Government is by no means what the people want.</P>

On that basis I am entitled to ask where is the money going to come from and what is it going to represent, not merely in the Budget of this year, but in the Budget for next year.  I am entitled to remind the House of the statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government. I gather that is the office. There are so many Parliamentary Secretaries running up and down the steps of Government Buildings that they are falling over one another and I would suggest, for the guidance of <Col N="743" /> the people and of members of this House, that these functionaries should go around bearing a placard saying &ldquo;I am the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.&rdquo;</P>

The House would stultify itself if it were to pass an Estimate for £1,054,000 without asking the Minister is the money there and, if it is not there, where will it come from?  Is it going to come out of the loan which is now standing at a discount of 10 per cent.?  People who paid £10 on the loan are now anxious to sell that instalment for £9.  I want the Minister to let us know where he is going to find the money.</P>
      <P>My recollection is that he made no provision for a Supplementary Estimate of this magnitude in the Budget of 1955-56.  He told us that he had very carefully considered the question as to whether a provision should be made for Supplementary Estimates. This is now the first of many Supplementary Estimates which are going to come before this House before the end of this year.  Where is he going to get this £1,054,000?

      <P>This Estimate is only to cover expenditure from the 1st of November last.  It is only to cover expenditure for five months of the financial year.  This expenditure, together with the additional sum required under Vote 54 for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, will amount altogether to £1,139,000.  The two Supplementary Estimates together <Col N="745" /> represent an increase in expenditure at the rate of £2,800,000 a year.  Surely, in justice to the people who sent us here, we are entitled to ask the Minister for Finance where he is going to get that money?  I am certain he is not going to send the that round the Dáil in the expectation that he will be able to raise it from the impoverished members of this House.  I am perfectly certain he is not going to open a public subscription.  The only question I ask is this: Is he going to raise it by Exchequer bills from the bank? Has he the money?</P>
      <P>Before we vote this sum of £1,054,000, we ought to ask the Minister for Finance if he has the money&mdash; or are we going to be faced at the end of this year with another Budget like the Budget of 1951, which was almost £7,000,000 out of balance?</P>

That is the question which I think we are entitled to put to the Minister for Finance before we vote this Supplementary Estimate.  Seven million pounds was the order of the deficit in the 1951 Budget.  We do not want it repeated on the Budget for 1955-56.</P>
      <P>The Minister came in here last May and said he was going to balance his Budget for 1955-56.  In order to do that he had to maintain the taxes at the rates that were imposed before he took office.  What is he going to do next year in order to find the additional £2,800,000?</P>

This money, if it is to be provided at all, will be a recurring sum.  Therefore, it will have to be provided year after year at the rate of £2,800,000 per annum.  Has the Minister made any provision to meet this current expenditure out of current revenue?  He is asking the money that he may increase remuneration.  On the principles which he has laid down, he is, I suppose, entitled to increase public remuneration, if he thinks the country can stand it, but can the country stand it?  Can the country find this £1,054,000 without additional taxation?  Can the Minister answer that question?  That is all we are asking.  It is a simple question.  Will the Minister find that money out of current revenue?  Can he find it out of current taxation?  If not, what is going to happen?  Is the Minister going to borrow for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told when the last loan was being floated that the money was required for productive work.  It was going to be used for constructive expenditure.  Is this £1,054,000 to be found out of the borrowed moneys? Surely that is a relevant question and one that the Minister should answer before we decide to vote this money &mdash; or, if not, if the Minister has £1,054,000 at his disposal, could he <Col N="747" /> not employ it more beneficially than in this way?  Has he examined that question?  We are told that there has been a crisis in the Dublin building trade.  Would this money be helpful there?  Many people are finding it very hard to meet the cost of living.  Those people who are not covered by this Estimate, those people who will have to find a large share of the money which this Estimate is asking us to provide&mdash;would the Minister consider devoting that £1,054,000 to helping them to solve their cost-of-living problems? Surely these are some of the things we are entitled to know?</P>
    <P>I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government &mdash; I will have to be very careful about these titles &mdash; who, when I came into the House, began to attack me on the grounds, if you please, that I took up the attitude, in regard to all these moneys we were asked to vote, that we would provide them if the Budget of the year allowed.  That was the principle upon which I stood, anyhow, and it is the principle upon which in this debate the Parliamentary Secretary attacked me.  Has the Minister for Finance abandoned that principle? I want to know if this is the Minister's attitude: &ldquo;It does not matter to me what the condition of the Exchequer is, how high the rates of taxation are, how heavily the people groan under the burden of taxation which they are carrying at present, I am going to ask the Dáil to give £1,054,000 to a section of the community.&rdquo;  Is that what he is going down to Kerry to talk about?  Is that what is keeping the Parliamentary Secretary out of Kerry?</P>

It was certainly making retribution to the Minister for Finance and your Taoiseach.  However, I want again just to say this to those members of Dáil Éireann who are listening to me.  You will notice how empty the Labour Party Benches are. <Col N="748" /> They are not caring about taxation now on the poor man's pint.

      <P>The point I am putting is that they do not mind how the Minister for Finance spends the money so long as he spends it and they have no regard for the manner in which this money is going to be procured.  We have.  We would like to see the £1,054,000 devoted to the purpose of permitting the public officers to maintain a proper place and a proper standard of living within the community. However, before we vote the money, we are entitled to know whether or not the money is there, and, if it is not, how the Minister proposes to provide it, not only to meet the expenditure which he is going to incur in this year, but how he is going to provide it to meet expenditure which he is going to incur in the coming year.  That is the question.  It is up to the Minister to answer it.</P>

      <P>Every time Deputy MacEntee gets on his feet in this House, I get more and more amazed at him.  However, I am grateful to him this evening for showing again &mdash; for the second time within a very short period &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party is split from top to bottom.  About a fortnight ago, or less, we had evidence on another measure that the Fianna Fáil Party spoke with different voices. To-night we have had the same evidence. Deputy Childers took the line that it was necessary that public servants should have their remuneration dealt with in the same way as the remuneration of those outside in private employment.  Deputy MacEntee took a different line.  He asked one question that was relevant and with which I am going to deal in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope when Deputy Kelly goes back to Monaghan and when the postman brings him his post to-morrow morning, or Saturday morning, he will tell <Col N="749" /> the postman that the spokesman of Fianna Fáil on this Estimate this evening, Deputy MacEntee, does not approve of postmen's wages being increased commensurate with the fifth round increases.  I hope Deputy Brennan in Wicklow will tell the postman who calls to him the same thing.  I hope the other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party, when they go back to their homes in rural Ireland, will tell their constituents that Deputy MacEntee got up here and said that the £1,054,000 which this Supplementary Estimate represents should not be spent for this purpose.  I hope that will sink in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must say I am so lost in admiration of the phrase that I am glad to have it for use on a future occasion.  Deputy MacEntee does occasionally use clichés like that, clichés which are quite useful when they are ruled in order.  When Deputy MacEntee sits down and reads the record, he will see that he said, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that if the Minister for Finance had <Col N="750" /> this sum it should not be used for this purpose but should be used for another purpose.  I hope all the Deputies in the Opposition, when they go home to their constituents, will tell people like the rural postmen and the rural workers, the members of the Defence Forces and the Gardaí, that the official spokesman of Fianna Fáil does not approve of their being put on the same basis as others outside in relation to what has commonly come to be known as the fifth round increase.</P>
      <P>I must confess I am not quite clear whether I heard Deputy Cunningham correctly when he said that he thought there was a sixth round and a seventh round coming.  I sincerely hope I did not hear him correctly.  I sincerely hope that no such prophecy or prognostication of Deputy Cunningham will prove true because, if we get into the situation in which, as the Taoiseach said quite recently, wages are merely chasing prices, the increases will be illusory.  What we want is an increase in production and an increase in productivity, not merely an increase in monetary values.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers asked me a specific question in relation to the cost-of-living index figure on which this award was based.  I made it quite clear to the representatives of the Civil Service Associations, in discussion with me on this matter, that the award was made in a realistic appreciation of the facts of the cost of living as they were at the end of November, 1955 and not by reference solely to any index figure or to anything like an index figure.  We were not living in isolation.  We knew exactly the facts in relation to the cost of living itself at that time as apart from any question of the index figure; it was in the light of that realisation that the amount was fixed.</P>

I want to make it perfectly clear that it was not related to any specific cost-of-living index figure.  It was related to a realistic appreciation of the cost of living, as we saw it, at the end of November and the beginning of December.  At the time when the offer <Col N="752" /> was made, the cost-of-living index figure for mid-November had not been published.  It was published subsequently. It was not by relation to a figure that had not been made public and it was not by relation to the previous figure that had been published three and a half to four months before that the award was made.  It had, therefore, to be related to the facts as they were.  I hope that has sunk in on Deputy Derrig.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee asked me one specific question which was entirely relevant when related to this matter.  He asked me how the expenditure would be met.  I want to say quite frankly that when, at the beginning of December I was considering what offer should be made to the civil servants and when I made the offer that was ultimately agreed at conciliation level I made, at the same time, an appraisal, as best I could at that stage, with something like three and a half to four months of the financial year still to run, of the financial situation in the current year; and, in the light of that appraisal, I felt reasonably satisfied, notwithstanding the heavy and unanticipated charge on the Exchequer that the offer involved, that the Budget, unless something entirely unforeseeable should occur, would break about even on current account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say quite frankly that I accept Deputy MacEntee's statement that I was bound to make such an appraisal. I made that appraisal.  I came to the conclusion, with four months of the financial year still to run and with the information then available to me, that the best estimate I could make, even allowing for the fact that this was a <Col N="753" /> heavy and unanticipated charge, was that the Budget would about break even.  I hope that my Estimate will be realised, but I am not able to say whether it will or will not be realised until the out-turn of the financial year is concluded.  That, of course, is the position that there would be at any time in respect of any Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy MacEntee down the paths of previous projects.  He suggested, for example, in a most mischievous way, that this Estimate, this £1,054,000, was going to be met out of the proceeds of the National Loan.  Of course, the Deputy knows that that was entirely untrue&mdash;&ldquo;unbridled mendacity&rdquo;, was, I think, the phrase he used a second ago himself. If the Deputy thinks, as he said himself a moment ago, that my Budget of last year is going to be unbalanced to the tune of £7,000,000, he is in for a very big disappointment.</P>

However, <Col N="754" /> I am sure the Minister will be able to confirm what I have gathered from a study of Section 3, that in so far as it does prevent the export of any goods in contravention of any enactment or statutory instrument, the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; there would, of course, include live stock.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy MacEntee is serious or not.  I assume that he was not, for a variety of reasons, one being that I would not like to make any other Deputy sitting in the House at the moment uncomfortable.  As I understand the situation, the list in respect of export prohibitions is included also in the tariff list.  Deputy Briscoe will understand, in respect of exports, the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are not acting so to speak, on their own account, but as the agents of other Departments.  In respect of imports, we are, of course, acting on our own account, because of the duty element involved.  In respect of exports, no duty element is involved and we are merely acting as agents for the other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the tariff list, the Deputy will find also a list of the articles the export of which is prohibited.  I do not know whether the Deputy is referring to articles the export of which is prohibited in that way, or whether he is referring to articles the export of which is prohibited in a different way, namely, because of the factor of exchange control&mdash;the amount of hard currency that has to be provided for the purpose of bringing the goods in and then adding the necessary amount of work and labour here before they can be re-exported.  That is a different matter.  I hope the Deputy will find that he will get what he wants in the <Col N="755" /> tariff list issued by the Revenue Commissioners. If he does not, I suggest that he might apply to the Department which would be concerned with the particular type of article and I am sure they will supply him with the list. If he fails with them and he applies to me, I will do my best to assist him.</P>

    <P>(c) the grant of such sums to greyhound racetrack executives as may be required to cover the difference between the track charges to bookmakers under Section 48 and the track charges in force prior to the appointed day for this Act. &mdash;(Deputy Walsh.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment last week we had reached this amendment and it appeared to me, as a result of a little friendly cross-talk, that the Minister was disposed, if not to full agreement, to some agreement to what is in the amendment.  The purpose of the amendment is that entrance fees to bookmakers, who make their living by attending these tracks, shall not exceed five times the charge to the public.  The amendment envisages a certain situation.  We are aware that there are certain small greyhound tracks in various parts of the country that would never pay their way were it not for the fact that the limited number of bookmakers who attend and do business on those tracks have an agreement with the racetrack owners.  In one particular case, some ten bookmakers attend and they pay <Col N="756" /> £2 each per night irrespective of the entrance charge, even if they do not attend the meeting.  They do that in order that the racetrack may be economic and that it will be open to them to make their living.</P>
      <P>The big tracks in the City of Dublin earn a substantial margin of profit from the heavy entrance charge to bookmakers.  In the case of Shelbourne Park, it is well known that the entrance charge to the bookmaker to-day is 32/- although the entrance charge to the public is 3/6.  Obviously, in the case of the small country track, an arrangement such as suggested in the amendment might possibly involve loss and it is suggested that the board be empowered, if satisfied that the loss has accrued from the acceptance of the amendment, to give a grant to the particular track out of its overall income.</P>
      <P>The amounts involved in the case of the small country track that I speak of will not be very big.  On the other hand, the fair treatment of the large number of bookmakers in the big areas must be taken into account.  There must be some equity.  In the case of some racetracks&mdash;one in particular&mdash; this 32/- entrance charge is of recent arrangement and some people believe that it was in anticipation of this Bill. I would ask the Minister to accept what is regarded as reasonable in other forms of sport.  In the case of horse racing, this is enshrined in the Racing Act.  What I am asking him to do is to accept the amendment which will ensure that no bookmaker will be charged more than five times the entrance charge to the public and, where it can be shown that a loss has accrued to a particular country track, the board will have power to give a grant to make good that loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have had an opportunity of getting further advice from his officials as a result, possibly, of his direction to them to examine it further. I said on Second Reading and I say again&mdash;it is very relevant to this particular amendment &mdash; that I believe, in the case of the City of Dublin, where, certainly, the tote will be installed in both racetracks, that the added attraction of the tote will mean <Col N="757" /> increased attendance, which means increased gate money, apart from the operations on the tote.  I am convinced &mdash; and I have made inquiries and have discussed this matter with people who should know &mdash; that a definite increase in attendance will occur.</P>
    <P>We have to be reasonable in our approach.  The bookmakers will pay another form of levy to the board.  In other words, they will pay a levy for a certain period of years, at least until the tote produces enough revenue to pay for itself.  If the position remains as it is, in addition to these very heavy entrance charges, they will be asked to subsidise something that will be in competition with them.  I think the Minister will see that point.  This amendment asks for equity.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment as drafted I should like him to say that he is prepared to give some undertaking that the protection that we seek will be enshrined in the Bill. If he does so, we can deal with it again on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>There is no need for us to argue across the House as if we were concerned about personalities.  We are only concerned with justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>This amendment is related to Section 48.  Section 48 deals with the levies and the other possible forms of charge.  I mentioned on Second Stage that if this &ldquo;five times&rdquo; charge as a ceiling were agreed then it might be better, in view of the levy, to say that, whatever the charge is to the bookmaker for entrance, a similar amount could be extracted from him as a contribution to the board &mdash; in other words, that if the entrance to one part of the track in Dublin is 3/6, which, multiplied by five makes 17/6, each bookmaker will also pay 17/6 towards the cost of the board.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage also to suggest to the Minister that some consideration should be given to the State revenue point of view.  I should like the Minister to note that if I pay 3/6 entrance charge, the racetrack company must extract 9d. entertainment tax, but if a bookmaker pays 32/6 the State still gets only 9d. of that.  There seems to be something illogical in that.  The Parliamentary <Col N="758" /> Secretary talked about approaching matters logically.</P>
    <P>I shall not say much more on this matter at the moment but would sum up in this way: I ask the Minister to agree as far as this section is concerned that no racetrack shall be entitled to charge a bookmaker more than five times the entrance fee, except in cases where it can be shown that a loss has occurred to the racetrack, and it can only occur in a small country place.  All it will do in Dublin is to cut down the margin of profit, which I say will be regained by the added attendances and by the additional sale of programmes which, I believe, produce very substantial revenue at the moment.  Will the Minister accept that?</P>

      <P>I am most anxious to meet the Opposition on any amendment where I can meet them, and I hope that opportunity will arise in later amendments, but I would ask Deputy Briscoe not to press this on behalf of Deputy Walsh, because I do not think it is a good amendment for several reasons.  One is that it is an invitation to racetracks to raise what they claim to be the proper fee for bookmakers in the confident anticipation that, no matter what figure they raise it to, if the board make an order controlling entrance fees for bookmakers thereafter and that controlled entrance fee was only five times the ordinary admission charge, the board would have to carry the difference, whatever it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Briscoe may have overlooked the fact that there is no obligation on the board to make any order at all.  Perhaps the Deputy will recall that I tried to emphasise at several stages that this is not a Bill to give me or the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be, the power to run the greyhound industry.  It is a Bill designed to give to the controlling board the power that the existing controlling board, such as it is, had not got and therefore could not use to control the industry.  I want to equip a board properly to control the industry; the whole country wants a board representative of all the interests with powers to run the business properly. <Col N="759" /> When we come down to the consideration of this particular problem, the board has the power to do one of three things.  It can decide it will not exercise that power to control entrance fees and to leave things as they are&mdash; a matter of bargaining between the bookmakers and the track owners as to what will be a fair entrance fee for the bookmakers.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon if I misled him.  The board have permissive power and if they make up their minds that the best thing is to leave things as they are, then, they may make no order; but if they determine that they have a duty to make the order, then they can, without reference to any outside authority, fix an entrance fee for bookmakers, not in excess of five times the charge made to ordinary patrons. But supposing in respect of some rural track, it seems appropriate that the track owner should be allowed to charge more than five times the ordinary admission fee and they decide he should be allowed to take seven, eight or nine times the ordinary fee from bookmakers, that can only be done by an order of the board, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>They can leave things as they are and let the bookmakers make any bargain they like with the track owners.  That is the present position.  Or they can make an order allowing the track owners to charge five times the ordinary fee, and if they make an order sanctioning more than five times, it is inoperative without <Col N="760" /> the Order of the Minister.  Deputy Briscoe pointed out that all the information he can pick up leads him to believe that the developments likely to ensue on the enactment of this Bill will mean increased revenue.  I thoroughly agree with him.  I have not introduced this Bill in order that we should waste time.  Our whole object is to raise the whole standard of this business to a level which will attract more patrons to an honest, well-run sport.  If that object is achieved, it means that the bookmaker will also get more patronage and that he will do more business.</P>

      <P>Everybody seems so gloomily pessimistic.  What are we breaking our necks for passing legislation, if we are not going to make the business better than it was? Deputy Briscoe says it is a hardship that the bookmakers should have to pay a levy to the board.  That is an illusion.  They will not pay any levy. They will collect a levy from the punter and pay that to the board.  They will pay nothing themselves.  If you lay 2/6 on a dog with a bookmaker, the bookmaker has to pay to the revenue the duty on that, whatever it may be, and suppose you lay 2/6 on a dog at four to one and the dog wins, the bookmaker must pay you 12/6, but he collects a levy on the whole 12/6, only paying the levy on 2/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is pretty generally assumed that by and large this works out that the levy which the bookmaker collects from the better on the four half-crowns he wins in respect of which the bookmaker has not to pay anything balances up the levy he has to pay on the losing bets.  The bookmaker simply acts as an agent to collect a levy from the punter.  There is no levy on the bookmaker at all. What we are trying to do is to make this business a more enduring and a more satisfactory field of activity for the bookmaker.  Are we asking the bookmakers too much when we ask <Col N="761" /> them to collect a levy from the better and pass it on to the revenue?  The only people who make no complaint are the people who will have to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>You have often to deal with those asides when they are first made or they come to be accepted as sensible.  Nobody is asking the bookies to pay anything to anybody.  All that is being asked is that, in respect of the levy, the bookies will collect that for the benefit of the revenue.  The Bill as at present drafted without this amendment imposes no obligation on the board to change the existing situation, which results from the free negotiation of the bookmakers and the racetracks, but if the board, having taken over responsibility for the whole industry, determines that in the interest of the industry it is necessary to intervene and control the free contractual relation between the bookmakers and the racetracks they have the power, if they wish to use it.  But if they wish to use it in any way which would involve the bookmaker in paying more than five times the entrance fee, they can only do that by proving to the Minister for Agriculture that it is in the best interests of all that they should.  Surely that is a reasonable approach to this if we believe that it is the board which should run the industry and not Oireachtas Éireann or the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one issue that I think the Minister will have to come back to.  The Minister says that the position is that the board need not interfere at all, but if it interferes it can only impose up to a maximum of five times other than with the consent of the Minister.  But we are getting away from the basic principle &mdash; if I might stress, not a difference but a variance with the Minister.  What we are looking for here is the enshrinement of a principle that nothing will operate to allow anybody to fix an arbitrary figure that can be charged to the bookmaker.  I am not going to argue with the Minister on the question of whether it should be five or six or seven times, but I want to make the point that there should be a maximum ceiling beyond which legislation would not permit even the board to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point, as I suggest to the Minister, on which I am not in difference but in variation of purpose with him.  I will give him credit for his purpose, and in all reasonable circumstances the belief would be justified that the present system could work out in an equitable way, but it is to provide against the possibility that the board could be used for an improper purpose that I suggest to the Minister not to accept the amendment in its present form. Between this and the Report Stage it might be possible to work out a formula that would ensure that some maximum ceiling could be agreed on, so that the bookmaking fraternity would at least have the security that, once they conducted their business in the normal way and did not in any way transgress any rules or regulations the track might lay down, they could not be <Col N="763" /> stopped from working their business economically merely because of some extravagant claim that might be made, and possibly approved of, by some subsequent occupant of the office the Minister now occupies.  It is a very net point, and the Minister may feel that I am possibly being unnecessarily argumentative on the issue, but it is to enshrine in the Bill the principle of a maximum beyond which nobody can go that I am urging him.</P>
      <P>I am not going to follow Deputy Briscoe's line of argument, even though I might be aware of it, in relation to the position of bookmakers at the populous centres and the fact that there is a very substantial revenue derived from various racecourse executives by virtue of their continued patronage and that in their particular case an adjustment of prices can be fixed.  I am prepared to agree that there can be a case made in relation to country tracks that the bookmaker should pay more.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister will say to me: &ldquo;But the arrangement at the moment, Deputy, is that there is free negotiation between the track and the bookmakers to fix those prices&rdquo;.  But our circumstances are going to alter. We are going to endeavour to put this industry on a much sounder financial basis and hope to make the greyhound industry generally improved by this legislation, and enable the board to establish the industry on a more worthwhile, strong, and sound economic position.  I feel that the Minister will agree with me that, in the establishment of such a situation, he should not ask any one section of the interests supporting the greyhound industry to carry an excess share of the burden. I submit to him that if we cannot find a formula under which the bookmaker will find reasonable charges to enable him to carry on his livelihood as a bookmaker up to some maximum ceiling, and that, irrespective of any occupant of the office of Minister for Agriculture or any regulation, it will not exceed the maximum, he will naturally feel that he is not in a secure position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to argue as to where <Col N="764" /> it should be &mdash; whether it should be three times, four times, six times or seven times.  All I want to say is that between this and the Report Stage, as I have suggested, the Minister should in all earnestness, let us have some kind of a representative conference between the interests affected, because from my discussions in the last couple of days, I find that there is an anxiety between them to iron out a common denominator that can become the basic principle in the charge of admission section.  If the Minister would give us an assurance that between this and the Report Stage such a discussion could take place, and that he would meet that kind of a situation by an amendment on the Report Stage, our anxieties in connection with Section 16 would be completely allayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask Deputy MacEntee to do this &mdash; withdraw this amendment, and let us get on to amendment No. 20 to-night, for the purpose of having at least one amendment whereon we could find common ground?  We can debate this whole general issue again on Section 48.  If Deputy Briscoe would like to put this amendment down on the Report Stage I will agree to its recommittal, to have a full Committee discussion on it again in case it is inadequately discussed to-night. I would like to think that we could get on to the next amendment so that before nine at least there will be one amendment on which it is made manifest that the House is not divided on entirely Party lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister's suggestion might be more acceptable if we had some assurance from him that he was prepared to consider sympathetically the case of the small racing tracks which this amendment is really designed to help.  I think it is quite clear from amendment No. 24 to Section 48 that he visualises as much as five times the normal admission charge to bookmakers. But if you are to apply that <Col N="765" /> as Deputy Briscoe has said to the small greyhound track you would put them out of business.  I think the Minister visualises that when he says that if admission charges to bookmakers are going to exceed five times the admission charge to the public, then it will have to be done with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We should like to have some close consideration given to the small racetracks because they are not likely to have totalisators.  They are, however, important from the point of view of the greyhound breeder in whose district these tracks exist and also, of course, from the point of view of the bookmakers who attend them night after night.  Therefore, we do not want &mdash; simply by having a blanket ceiling which would cover everybody and would stabilise the prices charged to bookmakers for admission to the tracks at five times that to the general public &mdash; to put the small tracks out of business.  We are anxious to ensure, if we can, that while the charges to the bookmaker on small tracks where there are no totalisators will remain reasonable, at the same time, if these charges, in order to fulfil the conditions of reasonableness, have to be reduced below the level at which they stand now, the board, looking at the industry as a whole, will be empowered to compensate the smaller tracks for any losses they may sustain.</P>
      <P>If we could have an assurance from the Minister that he was prepared to consider that problem sympathetically and if he would bring in an amendment between now and the Report Stage which would meet our point of view we would like to facilitate him and we would withdraw the amendment at this stage, and allow him to proceed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Preservation of Game Birds&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, with a view to preserving the stock of game birds and to prevent poaching, Dáil Éireann is of opinion:</P>
    <P>(a)  that the sale or purchase of all game birds and wild fowl should be prohibited for a period of 21 days after the opening day of the appropriate shooting season;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the open season in respect of the following birds should be:</P>
    <P>(1)  wild duck, geese or plover &mdash; 1st September to 12th February;</P>
    <P>(2)  partridge &mdash; 1st November to 30th November;</P>
    <P>(3)  pheasant&mdash;1st November to 31st January;</P>
    <P>(c)  that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to a conviction for the offence of shooting or taking any game out of season, an obligatory suspension of the gun licence of the offender for a minimum period of 12 months, the offender to have the right, after the expiration of three months after conviction, to apply to the court for the removal of the suspension, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that, in addition to any other penalty which may be imposed, there should attach to the conviction of the holder of a game dealer's licence for the offence of purchasing any game birds or wild <Col N="770" /> fowl out of season an obligatory suspension of such licence for a minimum period of six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, when moving this motion, I dealt with what I might term the mechanical features of the Bill &mdash; the measures that were intended to stop professional poaching and to propagate game in this country. Accordingly, to-night I should like to deal with the importance of the motion.  The first thing to be remembered is that the shooting of game and the whole sport of shooting generally is a very important factor in the tourist industry in this country.  A European nobleman who was making a study of game on the Continent of Europe arrived in Ireland and left some three weeks later, stating that the only shooting we had was snipe shooting.  With that I agree.  We have some of the finest shooting country on the Continent of Europe. In Scotland, for example, people pay fabulous sums to come and shoot for a week, a fortnight or three weeks.  I hold no brief for that type of person, but it is a feature of our tourist industry and one which should not be neglected.</P>
      <P>I myself tend to think that this motion is more important, inasmuch as it looks after a bit of shooting for the decent fellow down the country, whether he is a farmer's son with a five shilling licence or somebody else with a game licence.  That may be an extraordinary thing to say, but I am not ashamed to stand up in Dáil Éireann and say it.  Provided always that the individual shoots his game during season and in a proper manner, I have not the slightest objection to a farmer's son going out with a five shilling licence and having a shot on a Sunday, holiday of obligation or any other day, if he has the time.  It would not cost me a thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion does not seek to hamper him any more than he is hampered already.  The motion seeks to deal with the taking of game out of season. Whether the Minister would like to give us all that is enshrined in this motion &mdash; and I think he should &mdash; it would be wise for him to reflect on the <Col N="771" /> fact that every year he collects approximately £80,000 from game licences and all that is gained by the shooter in this country from the collection of this money is the protection which the Civic Guards give.  It is a physical impossibility for the Civic Guards to protect the shooting grounds of Ireland in the week before the season, or in the first week of the season, when the damage is done, and with the tendency to close small Civic Guard stations, that position will be worsened.  It is impossible for one Guard in a country station to leave behind him the barrack orderly, go out on his bicycle and cover perhaps 20, 30 or 40 square miles of ground in any field of which there may be a poacher, in the week before the season, who walks out to the spot where he has put his corn on the ground to see if he can get a clutch of pheasant or partridge with one shot.</P>
    <P>We want to help those Civic Guards who are trying to help us.  We want to make it most unprofitable for the game dealers to have on their premises poached game.  We want to ensure that the poacher will not have such an easy time because the poacher is not interested in two birds getting up, but in ten&mdash;that is, if he is a professional poacher.  That is the type of poacher who should have his nefarious activities curtailed or eliminated entirely.</P>
    <P>In our motion, we say that the game dealer shall not have on his premises or purchase for 21 days after the start of the season game birds.  Therefore, the hotelier cannot sell them.  The Civic Guard can go to the game dealers in his area or, in the case of Dublin, to their premises and see if they have in cold storage game birds during the period in which we seek to prescribe they shall not have them.  I want to stress the fact that this is a very moderate motion.  It does not seek to do anything radical.  All it seeks is that, for 21 days, it will not be permissible to sell, buy or have game; that you must go out and shoot your game and give it as a present to a friend or keep it yourself, but that it shall be impossible to sell game to a hotelier or a game dealer.  That is not <Col N="772" /> a very great restriction.  Shooters and sportsmen have no surplus game to sell, if the game is shot in a legitimate manner.  They are, therefore, not interested in selling game.</P>
    <P>We do not seek to prohibit the selling of game throughout the whole season, but we do seek to prohibit it during the first three weeks of the season.  I received a letter from a friend in Deputy Corry's constituency which sets out what a group of sportsmen think on this matter.  I think it may be worth while reading.  I will quote from the second paragraph of the letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While all true sportsmen welcome this motion, they are of opinion that the sale of pheasants, in particular, should be prohibited for the period of three years.  There is no doubt that pheasants are being slaughtered before the opening of the season and, furthermore, we have a certain number of sportsmen (if you could call them such) who merely shoot pheasants for the sole purpose of selling them.  This generally leads to the shooting of hen pheasants as they retain the hens for their own use but sell the cocks to hotels and dealers.</P>
    <P>In the general opinion here, it would be of great assistance to preserve the game, if the selling of pheasants was stopped for the period as stated.  Undoubtedly the new sportsmen would get tired of shooting indiscriminately if they could not get a monetary reward.  You would find that true sportsmen would still shoot for the love of the game.</P>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity on behalf of my friends to thank you for raising the point and doing something to preserve the game in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our laws do not and have not preserved the game.  The number of game birds in this country has decreased over the years, without there being even one or two years in which there was an improvement.  I think this motion is the most moderate approach to the problem that could possibly be evolved.  In America, for example, you may not shoot more than five birds <Col N="773" /> in one day with one gun and there are many areas in America where the number of game birds is quite extraordinary. There are vast areas in America and in one area alone, as big as Ireland itself, it is not permissible to carry a gun.  With their level of game, they still take measures which we do not suggest, such as the appointment of wardens, which costs a lot of money.  The measure we suggest is not going to cost the State a penny, but something must be done.  These countries are doing something before their stocks are depleted.  Our stocks are depleted and it now behoves us to do something to preserve the game.</P>
    <P>The gentleman I have previously referred to, who can have all the shooting he wants, is not the kind of person we are interested in.  He said that as far as the shooting of game is concerned, Ireland is no use except to shoot snipe.  It is a strange thing, but a similar insulting opinion was given four centuries ago by an English King when he said that Ireland was no use, except for the shooting of snipe.  I would impress on the Minister the fact that this is the most moderate approach that can be made to this matter.  We do not seek in any way to impose any great strictures on anybody, but we do seek to do something for the protection of game in Ireland before they are completely extinct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I should like to say a few words in addition to what Deputy Donegan has said.  The first thing I should like to impress upon the House is what most rural Deputies and people who travel through the country will realise, but what is not generally accepted, and that is, that, when we come to the House looking for some measure of protection for the stock of game in this country and for something to be done, we are by no means looking for anything that is particular or peculiar to a section of the people who are well off or to any certain section of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever was the position 50 years ago in regard to shooting in this country, any Deputy who represents a rural constituency or who travels through the country will realise that <Col N="774" /> shooting is now a hobby followed by people in every walk of life up and down the country.  In any part of Dublin, there are now to be found people who are genuinely interested in shooting and who want to get out of the city for the week-end or for their holidays, so as to get a bit of shooting. There are many more people in Dublin now interested in shooting than there were in the entire country 50 years ago.  I should like very much to impress upon the House that, whatever the views of Deputies may be with regard to the details of the motion, or to the urgency of the Dáil interfering in the preservation of game, we are not approaching this matter as a problem belonging to one part of the country, or to one section of the people or to country rather than city.  I should like Deputies to realise that, in every part of their own constituencies, there are a couple of people, in village, town or country, who are genuinely interested in shooting.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is genuinely interested in shooting in this country or, indeed, anyone who moves around, must realise that, unless something is done, and unless something drastic is done, shooting as a sport will disappear from this country.  There is no doubt that, in the past 40 years, the available stock of game has dropped steadily.  I think the stock of inland fish would have dropped as well, except for the fact that a very large attempt has been made by the Inland Fisheries Trust to do for angling in this country what I think has to be done for shooting as a sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the drop taken place, both in game and in fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there are two causes for the drop in the stock of game in this country.  The first is that, whether you like it or not, when you disposed of the landlords in this country, you also disposed of their gamekeepers.  The landlords preserved their shooting rights over too large an area of country, with the result that other decent people could not get any shooting at all.  The second cause is that they kept down the stock of <Col N="775" /> vermin over very large areas.  They did not do it for the sake of the people living around them or for the sake of the farmers, but simply and solely for the maintenance of their own good shooting.</P>
      <P>However, it does not matter why they did it.  They did it, and the fact that it is not being done now is one of the main reasons for the drop in the game population.  The fact that there are now no gamekeepers to keep down the vermin over large areas of country is one of the reasons for the drop in game.  There is now no organised attempt to keep down vermin.  That is a fact that we have to face.</P>
      <P>I should like to be in a position to bring forward some wholesale scheme for the destruction of vermin.  I hope that, sooner or later, when more concrete facts can be gathered from inquiries now being made by myself and some other people, it will be possible to put such a scheme before the House. Changing the law is not going to kill magpies, or grey crows, or foxes.  However, it is a step in the right direction that this motion has been brought before the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has asked me why the stock of game has dropped.  The increase in the number of vermin is one reason and it is probably the chief reason.  Another is that, in the case of pheasants, there was at that time considerable artificial rearing which has decreased since then.  That only applies to one particular kind of game, of course.  The second reason is that there are probably twice, if not three times, as many people shooting in this country to-day as there were 40 years ago.  If you decrease the destruction of the chief enemy of game, namely vermin, that is, if you increase the vermin and at the same time increase the number of sportsmen, you are bound to have a reduction.  That reduction has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to some of the migratory birds, particularly with regard to woodcock over a period and possibly to a limited extent with regard to snipe, there seems to be a suggestion that because of some of the things happening very far abroad&mdash;<Col N="776" /> certainly during the war-troubled years &mdash; a lot of these birds migrate in large numbers to small areas.  There is the suggestion that if the Arabs, for instance, fall out with somebody else&mdash; countries where the woodcock migrate to &mdash; you get woodcock.  That is the third case.  Unless something practical, something that will appeal and something that is within the economic resources of the country can be put forward, we are contenting ourselves with this motion.</P>
    <P>There is only one thing I should like to say with regard to shooting, before we come to the general terms of the motion, and it has been mentioned by Deputy Donegan.  He said this has a tourist importance.  As far as I am concerned, in bringing any motion to this House with regard to shooting or the preservation of game, it is a lone man's sport to be enjoyed by Irishmen in Ireland.  I would not give two figs if a single tourist were never induced into this country in order to shoot game.  I do not believe you will ever get to the stage of having a sufficient stock of game in this country to be able to attract tourists, without running the ordinary fellow off the street.  Take the plain example of the man who lives in any town&mdash;say, Deputy McQuillan's own home town, Roscommon, where I spent some time at this sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why there is so little left for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as good or bad as that, I am afraid.  Take a man who has a half-day a week and can shoot on a Sunday as well.  There will always be a limited stock of game for him and, no matter what laws we pass, it will remain severely limited.  I do not believe it will be any good to him or anybody else, or sufficiently economically sound to make the sacrifice worthwhile, to start inviting tourists to shoot seven days a week in Roscommon so that when he goes out on a Saturday he will find he has nothing to shoot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the tourist. I do not think it is a tourist attraction. <Col N="777" /> I think angling, can be.  Obviously, lakes and rivers can be fished to a greater extent than is being done. There is room for tourists there but not for tourists to shoot.  I am not putting it forward as an attraction.  It is a small thing.  It is not important.  You will never make a fortune out of it. You will never have 1,000 people in your constituency asking you about it.  I am concerned with it only in so far as it affects ordinary people living in this country and wanting their shooting in this country.</P>
      <P>These are the three general grounds on which I should like to impress on the House something of the importance of this motion.  It is a facile thing, if you like, to say that the stock of game has dcreased but the extent of its decrease cannot be measured in numbers. I think it is true, or very nearly true, that, as Deputy Donegan said, we are rapidly approaching the situation where snipe is probably one of the only game birds left in a reasonably plentiful supply in this country.  Take grouse as an example.  The whole of Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Mayo particularly, and a lot of Connemara should hold, and held as recently as not very long before the last world war, reasonable stocks of grouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember areas &mdash; and I have records of areas before I was even old enough to go out shooting, particularly in Mayo and Cavan on the Swanlibar Mountains &mdash; where two people with a dog towards the beginning of the season could reasonably expect to get between eight and ten brace of grouse in a day's shooting.  It was not a great day out and they had not left the place bare after them.  I do not think anyone's experience since 1947 would point as far as that except on a bumper day. Where, before, two people with a dog might expect to get eight, nine or ten brace of grouse over a reasonable mountain at the beginning of the season, the most you can get now is two or three brace.  That has happened within my personal recollection since 1937 or 1938.  I understand from people who are older and more experienced than I am that that had happened before 1937.  It will be seen, therefore, that the ratio between <Col N="778" /> 25 or 30 years ago and the present is greatly increased.</P>
    <P>That is grouse alone.  Anybody with experience will tell you that it is one of the pleasantest forms of shooting.  It least lends itself to organisation.  It is not the mass shoots organised for six guns &mdash; 35 people taking part and only six shooting &mdash; that you have in other countries.  It is a very individual and pleasant type of shooting.  It comes at a time of the year when a great number of people normally get their holidays from work.  In every kind of job, holdiays are inclined to gravitate into the month of August and the first half of September.  Grouse-shooting is one of the few forms of shooting available to people at that time.  In my calling, that is the time we get holidays and that is the shooting that is to be found most available.  That is disappearing very rapidly off the face of Ireland. What are the causes?  I mentioned vermin and the increase of guns.</P>
    <P>This motion is put down on the basis that a third contributory cause &mdash; which can be checked without expense, without any extensive scheme and merely by the act of this House &mdash;is the unfair shooting before the season commences of a large number of birds by people who are not sportsmen.  I do not put this on any basis that it is sacred that a man should not shoot until the 12th August. I do not put it on any basis of the glorious 12th or that the opening of the season should be adhered to or that a fellow is not playing his part if he shoots before that.  It will be obvious, however, that if 85 fellows observe one particular rule, why should 15 get off with breaking it and scooping the pool &mdash; for that is the type of thing that is happening?</P>
    <P>A situation has now arisen with regard to pheasants in particular, grouse to a lesser extent and, to a certain extent, mallard, duck and, of course, partridge where, in every county in Ireland, a great part of the existing stock of game is being shot before the opening of the season by one or two men.  People who want to sell it could cover five parishes at this particular game before the opening of the season.  It is easy to quote examples. A year ago, I was aware of <Col N="779" /> one area in the country where a fellow presented himself on the first day of the pheasant shooting season &mdash; it was the year they opened on the 1st October and, admittedly, they were easy to see; they were running around like farmyard chicks&mdash;at two hotels about 30 miles apart and sold 37 pheasants to one hotel and 40 to the other. He sold them at about 3 o'clock in the day.  He had not shot 77 pheasants since that morning.  He was up terribly early.  It is only an example of what is going on.</P>
    <P>Coming down to our motion, the first suggestion and the one we should like to press very urgently is this.  There is no possible way of stopping what is happening unless you are prepared to put a sort of <i>moratorium</i>, a postponement, on the date on which a man may sell game after the opening of the season.</P>
    <P>I quite appreciate there are a number of people &mdash; I think the number is probably very small &mdash; who actually make their living out of shooting game.  I also appreciate there is a much larger number of people who keep themselves in cartridges and pay for their own sport and who probably or possibly would not be able to get the sport unless they were able to sell their game.  Fair enough; nobody wants to do them any harm, but, unless one puts a gap between the date on which the game is sold and the date on which the game may be shot for the first time, one will always get a week's activity by what is known as the professional poacher before the opening of the season.  If he gets out a week before the other people, operating by his own methods, he will make a tremendous hole in the stock of game in any area.  Make no mistake about it, he does that.  But he does not make a fortune out of it because the man who makes the fortune out of it is the game dealer.</P>
    <P>Go into one of several restaurants or hotels in any part of the country on the opening day of the game season&mdash; the opening day of the pheasant season, for instance&mdash;and if one is willing to pay 12/6 or 15/- one will get served the grandest hung ten-day pheasant in the <Col N="780" /> world.  It is in beautiful condition.  It has been hung for ten days, and this is the opening day of the season.  As in the case of oysters in Galway Bay, it is the opening day of the pheasant season and, therefore, pheasant is on the menu.  That is the situation in the most reputable establishments at the present time.  Now these birds must have been shot several days before.  It is not the poacher who is really guilty; it is the game dealer who buys from the poacher and produces them to the hotel or restaurant.</P>

      <P>If our motion is accepted, it will be illegal to buy pheasants until 21 days after the opening of the season.  If that is accepted and pheasant is produced on the menu in an hotel or restaurant on the first or second day of the season, for instance, I would hope that the proprietor would have a tremendous job persuading any district justice that he got a present of two dozen birds so that he and his hotel could put them on the menu.  In other words, if they are on the menu, it must be quite obvious they have been bought and it will be an offence to buy them if our motion is accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not done, there will be a continuation of what is going on at present.  The greatest objection to the present situation is that, apart from the question of the stock of game, there are one or two fellows who, by ignoring the existing law, are getting a completely unfair advantage over the rest of the people in the area.  They just go out and ignore the law and the rest have to put up with the back-end of the stock.</P>
      <P>The second matter we have before the House is the question of seasons. There is nothing sacred about this. We have tried to put down what we think would be reasonable dates. Probably there will be other views with regard to the different dates for the different seasons.  Taking them as they come, the first is the wild duck, geese and plover, 1st September to 12th February.  That is a shortening at both ends.  In the existing situation, they come into season on the 12th August and go out of season on the 28th February.  There are two ideas incorporated there really.  You may take it geese and plover are not affected by the opening of the season because they, normally speaking, will not be in on the 12th August or even on the 1st September.  Certainly the geese will not be in.  They are not, therefore, affected.  But they have always been bracketed with duck and it is easier to leave them bracketed with duck; and, in so far as you are not permitting a man to shoot wild geese before 1st September, whereas he used to shoot on 12th August, no difficulty arises because the first wild geese that arrive here arrive on the last day of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as plover are concerned, again I do not think the change is of much importance.  A certain amount of golden plover nest here, but I do not think anyone will suffer any very great hardship if he is not permitted to shoot plover until 1st September.  As far as wild duck are concerned, everyone's experience seems to be that the country is full of flappers on 12th August, young duck only half able to fly.  It may be that, when the 1930 Act was framed, climatic conditions were different and the ducks were <Col N="782" /> stronger.  Within the last six or seven years anyone who has any experience at all will tell you that, in the normal way, the majority of duck hatched out in any given year are not really fit to fly on 12th August and are very easily shot.  To a certain extent, they are fit to fly, but they are not able to look after themselves.  One will walk into a clutch of them and they will get up all round one and will be as easy to shoot as crows; they will drop down 50 or 60 yards on and one can walk on and pick up the rest of them.  It should not be any great hardship to put the date back to 1st September.</P>
    <P>With regard to the latter end of the season, there are two possible classes of duck.  The home duck is undoubtedly starting to mate towards the end of February.  Now, once they start to mate they lose all their wariness.  It is a common experience to find ducks paired towards the end of February. They are very easy to shoot once they pair.  Our suggestion is to put back the date; in other words, to shorten the season so as to give them an opportunity of pairing off.</P>
    <P>Next I come to the geese and foreign duck, such as widgeon and so on. Again, like all birds, once they start to collect in order to migrate, they lose a considerable amount of their wariness. That applies particularly to wild geese.  Whereas wild geese are normally very wary and very difficult to get up to, at the beginning of February and during the first ten days of February they start collecting together to make their migratory flight and they lose their caution altogether as the end of February approaches.  That is the reason for the first change for which we are asking.</P>
    <P>With regard to partridge and pheasant, we have made partridge 1st November.  They have been tied to pheasants and they have been a month back in so far as it is permissible to shoot them in the last few years.  It seems right to tie them to pheasants. They are not so wary and it is impossible to segregate them.  One idea in putting the date back to 1st November is because they are in very, very short supply.  Their shooting was prohibited for a number of years after the war, <Col N="783" /> but it is doubtful if that prohibition had the full result it should have had.</P>
    <P>One reason for not prohibiting shooting altogether is that they do not thrive if the coveys are not split up and they will not be split up effectively except by shooting.  One reason for putting it on to 1st November is that at that time of the year one is making it harder for the sportsman because the roots and stubble in which they are normally found have depleted considerably and they are not as easily kicked out of a field of roots or long grass and stubble as they are in October. They are a bit more wary, more difficult to shoot and more difficult to stalk.  If they are to survive at all, they will have to be given that extra chance.  That is why we put that date down.</P>
    <P>With regard to pheasants, we have put down 1st November, too, for much the same reason.  We left the date for the end of the season as it is.  There is nothing sacred about these dates. We would like the Minister to accept the general proposition that when he fixes the seasons each year, as he does, he should revise the present system and look at it anew.  Not merely are there special circumstances requiring special changes, but the whole system of opening and closing seasons should be brought up afresh and dealt with on the basis that the stock of birds has greatly declined and is continuing to decline; and it is in reference to that, that the seasons should be fixed.  We think that would be desirable.  We may be wrong, but we certainly would like to hear any views anyone else has.  We would above all ask the Minister, when he comes to fix the seasons for birds, to accept the general principle that they should be fixed with that particular idea of shifting the emphasis on to the preservation of the birds even if it means a shorter shooting season for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The other two matters which are dealt with in the motion are matters on which I would like to put forward a point of view which I hope is of some importance.  I accept straightaway that, generally speaking, the House should be careful in imposing on the <Col N="784" /> courts limitations on their discretion with regard to penalties.  It does not matter what the case is, whether it is for larceny on a grand scale or a motoring offence &mdash; it will be said that it is the judge who hears the case, hears the witnesses and the defendants, who should have the widest possible discretion in regard to what penalties he will impose.</P>
    <P>The general principle of criminal law undoubtedly is that outside of revenue offences, which are in a special category of their own, the judge is given a maximum he may impose.  He may impose a sentence, say, of not more than two years or a fine of not more than £50, but he is never given a minimum.  He can fine a man 1/- or give him a day in jail. The only immediate mandatory sentence which I know of is the suspension of a driver's licence, if a person is convicted of being drunk in charge of a car.  That is the only analogy for the suggestion we have in regard to the suspension of the firearms licence and of the game dealer's licence.  As you all know, when a man is convicted of being drunk in charge of a car the justice may sentence him to jail or may fine him up to £50 or as little as 1/- but, whether he likes it or not, once the person is convicted, he must suspend his driver's licence for not less than one year.</P>
    <P>Our suggestion is not as revolutionary as it may look.  There is a provision in Section 17 (3) of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, in regard to a person convicted of an offence under the Act &mdash; you may take it that largely applies to shooting birds out of season, and so on.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the person convicted of an offence under this part of this Act is the holder of a firearms certificate granted to him under the Firearms Act, 1925, (No. 17 of 1925), the justice of the District Court before whom he is so convicted may, in addition to any other punishment imposed under this section, revoke such firearms certificate....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are certain ancillary provisions, his certificate should be suspended for not more than five years and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> Section 23 of the same Act provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Upon the conviction for an offence under this Act of the holder of a game dealer's licence, the justice of the District Court before whom such holder is so convicted may revoke such licence and such revocation shall be in addition to any other punishment imposed by such justice under this Act in respect of such offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the existing law.  The position there is that where a man comes before a district justice for, say, shooting a hen pheasant when it is prohibited or shooting a pheasant ten days before the season, the justice may, if he likes, impose upon him a suspension of his firearms licence. Where a game dealer is found guilty of buying a bird before the commencement of the shooting season the justice may if he likes revoke his game dealer's licence and not permit him to trade in game dealing.  Our request is this.  Without in any way trying to interfere with the freedom of the District Court in this matter, I want to point out that these powers are practically never used or at least they are used on very rare occasions.  There can be no two ways about it: every fellow who goes out with a gun knows which bird is which and he knows the date for the opening of the season for that bird.</P>
    <P>If a man shoots a bird out of season he does it deliberately and when he is brought before a district justice and it is proved to the satisfaction of the district justice that he was guilty, the district justice may let him off and perhaps fine him 1/- if he is a poor man and cannot afford to pay a larger fine. We are not interfering with that discretion. We are suggesting, however, that that man should lose his gun licence for a period of not less than a year.  We are providing further, if the suggestion is adopted, that that same man can go back after three months to the district justice and make a plea for getting his licence back.  Therefore, if he has a good case or if he is a man who seems to show repentance for his crime the district justice can use his discretion and all the man loses is three months' shooting out of the season.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> We are not asking for anything very stringent or for anything which is going to cause hardship.  I do not believe anybody really lives by using a shotgun for game.  For most people, it is a sport and it does not seem a very harsh thing that a man who is using it as his hobby but who is unwilling to abide by the rules loses his opportunity to shoot for a period of three months. We believe that would put a stop to a great extent to ordinary poaching.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that even if a person is caught nothing much will happen.  He may only have to pay a small fine in the District Court.  The district justice who dealt with the case might think that birds should be shot for the 12 months of the year and might not regard is as a serious offence.  But if the person knew that if he were caught shooting birds out of season then he was going to lose his licence for at least three months it would be a great deterrent to the shooting of birds out of season.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that this penalty is not being asked for game trespass.  We are not seeking any interference with the existing law in that regard.  This is not a question of going in on another man's land or going in on a shooting preserve. We are not asking for any additional penalty or any alteration at all in regard to the business of one man going into another man's shooting. If a man wants to preserve his shooting let him preserve it himself and get whatever assistance he can from the Guards.  We are solely concerned with the question of shooting birds out of season and it is in that connection we are asking for this penalty of the suspension of the gun licence.</P>
    <P>The other matter dealt with in the motion is the question of suspension of a game dealer's licence.  There, again, under Section 23 of the Act, as I mentioned, the existing situation is that the justice may, if he thinks fit, suspend a dealer's licence.  There is an even stronger case for mandatory suspension in this case.  Who are the holders of game dealers' licences? They are people who are trading in poultry and game.  I do not suppose there is a great number of them.  I do <Col N="787" /> not know how many there are.  They make their living out of it.  There is an old saying, very often quoted to juries and when sentence is being imposed, that if there were no receivers, there would be no thieves. If there were no game dealers with a sort of slipshod view about what the season for game is, there would be very few poachers.  It is the same with regard to many other things.</P>
    <P>Certainly, with regard to this matter, if you could cut down or stamp out the game dealer who is willing to buy at the back door before the commencement of the season and to hang up and to cash in on the first market day of the season, then you would stop the before - the - opening - day - of - the season poachers overnight.  The poacher will not go out, unless he can get sale for the birds.  As Deputy McQuillan says, he can get some ready sale at hotels.  He can also get ready sale at private doors.  We know that.  We have to face up to that.  You cannot make the sort of law that will prevent the man that does not feel pushed about the open season.  Leaving that aside, however, you can stop the game dealer from filling his larder before the opening of the season with grouse, pheasant and duck and producing them out of the hat within the first few days of the season.</P>
    <P>A game dealer who does that knows very well what he is doing.  He knows he is encouraging poaching.  He knows he is trying to get one up on the straight game dealer next door to him who is in competition with him. He knows very well that if he has pheasants, grouse, duck, geese in his larder before the opening day of the season they are there illegally.  There is no doubt about that.  He knows he is buying them illegally.  Why should he, if he is caught and if he is convicted, not lose his game dealer's licence?  Surely he is not a suitable man to hold a game dealer's licence.</P>
    <P>This whole idea of licensing game dealers, created by the Act of 1930, was created with the idea of getting some control over game dealers and having some sanction over their heads and helping to make them keep the <Col N="788" /> law.  A man who buys before the season, knowing very well what he is buying and when he is buying, should have his licence suspended.  I can see no reason why it should not be suspended in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Again, I think anyone who faces up to it will agree that the first time a game dealer's licence is suspended as an obligatory matter &mdash; the district justice having no discretion &mdash; the first time a game dealer is convicted and his licence goes by the board, straightaway, you will find very few dealers willing to buy before the opening of the season.  A man would not take that chance any longer.</P>
    <P>If we are really serious about trying to improve conditions and arresting the decrease in the stock of game in this country, these are minimum requirements. As I said at the beginning, none of these ideas is sacred.  There may be better and other ideas.  In particular, I am convinced that it is essential that, besides these, or in addition to these or, some people would say, in priority to these, somebody should tackle the vermin situation very vigorously.</P>
    <P>I ask the support of the House for this motion, not on the basis that it is a tourist industry, or that we will have people flocking here from any other country to shoot.  I do not believe that they will come, and, whether they do or not, I do not think they would be welcome.  As far as shooting is concerned, it is our own sport, an individual sport.  It cannot be done in large numbers.  It is a lone man's game to a large extent.  It is a very pleasant occupation and the best possible enjoyment is got out of it by the people who live where they shoot.  I do not put it forward as a tourist attraction. I hope it will never be a tourist attraction. I put it forward as a hobby which more and more in the past 35 years has become the hobby of every section of the people in every part of the country.  It is a small matter.  You will never win or lose an election in any constituency by being for or against the preservation of game birds, but shooting is one of the things that make life very bearable for quite a large number of people.  No matter <Col N="789" /> what their job is, the thought of having this sport now and again keeps them going.</P>
    <P>If that is so, and I believe it to be true, we can, without spending 1/- of Government money or anybody else's money, at this stage, make one step forward in the preservation of game, and I believe that, if this House adopted in principle or in spirit the motion before it now, it would be an earnest of its desire to see game preserved in this country and it might easily have much more effect than the mere terms of the motion would carry. If people were convinced that the House was serious about this matter, it would be quite easy to come back with voluntary help and assistance and voluntary ideas to the House, as I hope to come back soon, and put forward some comprehensive scheme for game rearing and for vermin destruction which would really put us in a position of having good game stock again.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, for these reasons, to accept the spirit and the details, too, of the motion and I would welcome any views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering what were the reasons that made this formidable team of the legal profession so anxious for sport, until I read the sections of the motion to which we could impute a double meaning and say that it was a motion for the extra employment of the legal profession.  The motion shows a very poor knowledge on the part of the proposers of the habits of birds.  I wonder if any of the proposers ever spent a night, early in the month of August, waiting by a field of barley for a flock of wild duck to come in, or ever went into a field of barley in the morning and saw its condition when the flock of wild duck had spent the night in it.  That would be a considerable time before 1st September. Barley is usually cut from 15th to 20th August.  If they did, they would not put down this motion suggesting that the period for shooting wild duck should commence on 1st September.  It is a very common practice for a farmer in my country, who goes out with his gun to have a bit of sport, to go to the barley field when the barley is ripe, <Col N="790" /> or just after the barley has been cut&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Apart from the danger of their shooting each other, I would not be a bit afraid of what kind of game they would shoot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The duck would be quite safe with them around.  But to get back to this motion, I have stated my first objection to it.  I object strongly to the putting back of the date for opening of the wild duck season.  I think it is foolish and wrong, for the reasons I have stated.  I can tell the Deputies opposite that it is not flappers that sail in on a moonlight night about the 20th of August to a field of barley. They are anything but flappers and they do pretty considerable damage. We, as barley growers, are always only too glad to have a few neighbours come along and take a shot-gun with them for a bang at these duck as they come in.  However, I would agree with the limitation proposed at the other end of the season, because at the moment I feel we are coming very close to the mating season, but I think the proposal about the beginning of the season should be thrown out completely. This motion, to my mind, is not designed to preserve game; it is a motion seeking to limit the class who shoot game.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputies when they were making their case.  I should like to point out that the farmer's son who likes to go out for a shot on a Sunday or a holiday must pay for the game licence for his gun.  He also must pay pretty heavily for his cartridges, unless he is able to make up his own stuff.  According to <Col N="791" /> this motion, he is now to be prevented from getting any recoupment until 21 days of the season have passed.  If the Deputies opposite had proposed a seven days' limit during which game could not be sold, I would agree with it.  But what kind of a bird would you have if it were hung for 21 days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a humming bird.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be a hummer all right; he would be humming in more ways than one.  Why do the Deputies opposite seek that provision? Is it not so that a certain privileged class will have the first ten or 12 days of the shooting season?  Then, when the birds are well scared and frightened by the likes of Deputy Donegan, the poor devil of a farmer's son or the lad from the town who likes a shot on his half-day or on a Sunday will have nothing to shoot at when he goes out.  The farmer's son is not a millionaire; he cannot afford to shoot purely for sport.  He must at least get the price of his cartridges out of it. By this motion, he is to be prevented from getting the price of his cartridges. He can go out now, according to this, only when the cream has been skimmed off.</P>
      <P>I find that in this country the tighter you try to make laws of this kind, the more the people think the laws were made for a certain class and the more they break them.  That applies particularly to game or fish.  I have seen farmers paying rates for rivers and the entire fishing rights of the river were owned by some foreigner.  I have seen the results.  As I say, the tighter you restrict the rights of the ordinary man in regard to game or fish, the more liable you are to have the law broken.  According to the motion, district justices in future will not be able to consider the merits of such cases.  In future, there is to be no amelioration, because it is sought to have the offender's gun licence suspended for 12 months as well as any other penalty which may be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And then, so that the <Col N="792" /> legal profession may get an extra couple of guineas, the offenders are to have the right to appeal against the suspension at the end of three months&mdash; a double barrelled one, that.  Not only are we compelling the justice to take away the man's gun licence for 12 months, but we are also inviting the poor fellow to walk into a solicitor's office with another couple of guineas so that he may get his licence back. Would that be the real reason for the motion by any chance; is it a particular motion designed to increase employment for the legal profession?  It looks very much like it.</P>
      <P>Let us take the poor fellow I mentioned earlier, the farmer's son, who finds a flock of wild duck ruining his field of barley.  He decides to go out one morning to find out if the barley is fully ripe and fit for cutting and he finds a big stretch battered down.  He says: &ldquo;Very well, I will soon clear out these fellows&rdquo;.  He goes up again that night with his shotgun and, lo and behold, there is a Civic Guard stuck behind the fence ready and set to pounce on him.  He is lugged into court and whether the justice likes it or not, he must suspend that man's licence for 12 months, in addition to any other penalty he may impose.  I remember in my young days when you would come upon a gentleman hunting a fox and knocking down four or five of your fences in the process.  You would take him to court and what would you find lined up on the magistrates' bench but four or five other fox-hunting lads trying the case.  You gave one look at them and you knew the satisfaction you were going to get from the &ldquo;boyo&rdquo; who knocked down your fences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the sentence is already laid out; the unfortunate justice has not even the option of imposing a penalty, in lieu of a suspension.  He must suspend the gun licence, once he finds that a man is guilty of taking game out of season.  That is why I hold that, in the first place, the date is wrong, where it applies to duck shooting, at any rate.  In the second place, I cannot see any justification for the motion.  This motion, to my mind, is framed particularly to drive out of <Col N="793" /> sport the ordinary individual whom we all know and whom we, as farmers, all welcome &mdash; the neighbour's son who has a gun and goes for a shot on a Sunday, or the friend from the town, the ordinary worker who comes out on Wednesday evenings or Sundays for a shot.  He is dependent on what he shoots to provide him with the cartridges. He is deprived of that here for the first 21 days afterwards, because if the dealer is now caught showing a bird for 21 days after the season opens, he can be prosecuted and his licence taken from him.</P>
    <P>I do not think that laws of that type are going to be of any assistance whatever in the preservation of game in this country.  I hold that, in the preservation of game, you must have the co-operation of the man on whose land that game is.  You will not have that co-operation if you bring in laws or unjust motions of this type.  You are just going to put him in the frame of mind in which he will say: &ldquo;I am not going to have them.  Well, I'm hanged if they are going to be there for others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have all seen &mdash; I myself have seen &mdash; men cutting very carefully around a flock of pheasants in a field of grain and lifting the pheasants' eggs in the hope that later&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is like the man that mistook you for a snipe.  The bulk of those pheasants are not in the preserves and the bulk of them do not hatch out in the preserves; the bulk of them are scattered round in the farmers' fields, and particularly in the tillage farmers' fields, and the more you attempt to show him that these birds are not meant for him but for a <Col N="794" /> class above him, the more danger there is of having game birds wiped out.  That is my honest conviction.</P>
      <P>When Deputies here talk of duck being green at the start of the season, I wonder did these Deputies ever take a ramble along the seacoast at any sheltered little spot, for instance, in the past week in the really cold or sleety weather, and see 40 or 50 or even 100 duck get up right under their feet absolutely unprotected?</P>
      <P>I think on the whole the motion is wrong and is taking a wrong line.  The motion aims at excluding the people whose rights, in my opinion, should be preserved as far as the shooting of game is concerned.  I am referring to the ordinary farmer's son and the ordinary city worker who likes a day's shooting and who, perhaps, has difficulty in getting the amount necessary for his game licence.  Shooting at the present time is an expensive sport and by this motion we are aiming at depriving such men of the opportunity of getting any of their money back. If the Deputies are wise, they will drop this motion.  I cannot see it doing any good and I certainly cannot see it getting through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever that the Deputies who drafted this motion are very sincere in their efforts to preserve and increase game in this country, but I suggest to them that the motion, if passed, will have the very opposite effect to what they hope to achieve.  I approach the motion in the spirit in which Deputy Finlay approached it.  I want to be as reasonable as he was and put another point of view which is practically completely opposed to Deputy Finlay's.  I have nothing but the greatest respect for Deputy Finlay as a marksman and as a man who is keen on shooting.  I know he has no desire whatever to deprive any man in the rural areas or in the towns of an opportunity to shoot, if he has a half-day or a Sunday off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But whether Deputy Finlay believes it or not at the moment, this motion, if accepted, will have the very opposite effect to what he hopes to achieve and that for a number of reasons.  I asked, <Col N="795" /> in the course of his remarks, why it was he suggested that in the past 40 years the stock of game had decreased, as had also the stock of fish in our inland rivers and lakes.  He admitted that both had been reduced.  He gave two reasons for the reduction.  In the first place, his argument was that, when the landlords were got rid of, their gamekeepers were got rid of as well.  The result was that there was nobody to keep down the vermin. In consequence, greater depredations were committed on the stock of game in the various areas.  His other argument was that the number of those who used guns had increased at least threefold in recent years.</P>
    <P>These may appear to be very good reasons why the stock of game has been depleted, but I want to bring to the Deputy's mind a fundamental reason of which the reasons put forward by him are mere offshoots. When the ordinary tenant rights and agricultural rights were taken from the landlords, the shooting and fishing rights were left to them.  That is what we must get into our minds.  If we want to solve the problem of sport and gaming in this country and make it successful, in the ultimate analysis we have got to deal with the question of fishing and sporting rights in this country.</P>
    <P>To-day in rural Ireland, we have small holdings with a certain amount of turbary attached.  We have the extraordinary position that in many cases the majority of these small-holders are not allowed to shoot over their own bogs, for the very simple reason that the shooting rights have been preserved in the landlord who has departed from this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but in many cases I have come across myself from time to time it was never decided as to whether the Land Commission took the right over finally from the landlords or left it to the landlords.  In many cases it was left to the landlord. All that means that a spirit of animosity has been created in the mind <Col N="796" /> of the ordinary rural sportsman against those people who have held those rights so long, with the result that the poacher is really a genuine sportsman. The way I look at it is that he should have that right to shoot over his own land and bog.</P>

      <P>Let me keep the Deputy straight.  This motion does not seek to deal with the poacher who trespasses in the pursuit of game.  It only deals with out of season shooting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who will really benefit are not so much the clubs which are set up and which are so desirable in rural areas, but those individuals I am talking about.  If the motion is accepted, it means that Colonel Sir John So and So, who may be at the present moment resident in London and who has the shooting rights of 1,500 or 2,000 acres of moor and bog, need not come over here until his cold is better.</P>

      <P>I accept that Deputy Finlay is doing this in all sincerity, but, whether he agrees or disagrees, I maintain that he is conferring a real safeguard on the particular individual involved, in this respect, that if there is a 21 day limit imposed on the sale of game, the men who are now described as poachers and who are not really poachers at all, will not be enabled to shoot over this gentleman's preserve.</P>

      <P>The game dealer plays a very important part.  Up to the present, the game dealer purchases game from the poacher as we will describe him.  I think he is a very decent fellow in many cases who has relieved Colonel So and So of a surplus of pheasants.  The result is <Col N="798" /> that the gamekeeper who is doing a service to the community at large will now be penalised because Colonel So and So's pheasants are shot without his permission.</P>
