      <P>Control of Imports (Amendment of Quota No. 1 and Revocation of Quota No. 14) Order, 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the explanatory memorandum explains nothing and certainly gives no clue as to what the Government had in mind in combining three Quota Orders in one.  It says that the combination of the three Quota Orders in one facilitates the administration of import control; but clearly it does a great deal more than that.  Three separate Orders were not made merely because of some administrative arrangement. Three separate Orders were made because it was intended that there should be separate quotas fixed for three categories of cotton goods so that the importation of each category could be controlled separately.  By combining the three Orders in one the Government has made it possible for an importer to use a quota licence, given in respect of one category, for another category; and this would have the effect of considerably increasing the importation of some particular class of cotton goods to the detriment of our own manufacturers.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should say to the Dáil what are the quotas at present fixed under the three Orders: and is it contemplated that a quota licence given, say, under Order No. 43, could be used at the discretion of the importer to bring in goods that are regulated under Orders Nos. 44 or 45? Clearly, the effect of combining the three Orders is to enable that to be done, and the House should get some further explanation of the need for this change other than that it is to facilitate administration.  The Dáil is not concerned with facilitating administration. It is concerned in these Orders to ensure that the importation of cotton goods is regulated in a manner which will stimulate the production of these goods here.</P>

      <P>Did the Parliamentary Secretary ever hear of the Midleton cotton mill or the Youghal cotton mill? He was travelling about that constituency recently during a by-election and he ought to have learned something about it.  I am making the point that this industrialist complains that over £2,000,000 worth of foreign goods were being dumped in here to the detriment of the people in my constituency. I hold that this is portion of it.  I remember hearing Deputy Dillon, before he became Minister on the last round, looking for the stuff to come here at 3/9 saying that it would be for the good of the workers.  I am suggesting that activities in that direction previously proved to be very bad for the workers in Midleton and Youghal when they were on three days a week for six months.  I do not want to see that happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to extend the duration of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, as amended by the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953, for a further period of three years commencing on the 1st April, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The 1953 Act provided for the making by county councils of the following allowances by way of abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural holdings in rural areas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a primary allowance of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20;</P>
    <P>(b)  an employment allowance of £17 for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year, subject to the limitation that the total of the employment allowance shall not exceed the general rate in the £ on the valuation over £20.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Bill will be to continue these allowances for the next three years.  Legislation dealing with the relief of rates on agricultural land dates back for almost 60 years.  The agricultural grant was first given under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  The grant has been given each year ever since, but the basis of its distribution and the amount of the grant were altered on a number of occasions.  Prior to 1946 the amount of the grant was always a sum fixed by each successive Act.  Under the 1946 Act it was provided that the grant would be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20.</P>
    <P>(2)  A supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20.</P>
    <P>(3)  An employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance should not exceed £6 10s. Od. for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year.</P>
    <P>The agricultural grant was continued on this basis until the passing of the 1953 Act, which applied to the years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56.  That Act increased the employment allowance, abolished the supplementary allowance and established the method of distribution <Col N="1022" /> which is being continued by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amount of the agricultural grant increased from £4,938,555 in the year 1953-54 to £5,178,454 in the year 1954-55 and to £5,265,430 in the year 1955-56. The amount of the grant for the coming year is estimated at £5,600,000.  The total payable in 1955-56 was divided as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The employment allowance may be claimed only in respect of a man at work during the whole of the calendar year preceding the relevant financial year.  The 1953 Act which applied to the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56 did not become law until 23rd December, 1953.  Hence the Act could not have affected the number of employees until, at the earliest, the calendar year 1954 and claims in respect of those employees did not arise until 1955-56.  The numbers in respect of whom employment allowances were claimed in the period covered by the 1953 Act were:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It cannot be claimed, therefore, that the allowances under the 1953 Act have had the effect of increasing continuous wholetime employment.  Generally, however, available statistics in regard to employment seem to indicate that the decline in agricultural employment has been arrested.  It is too soon yet to form any definite conclusions as to the long-term effect of the 1953 Act on agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>The combined allowances afford a substantial relief of the gross rates assessed on agricultural land.  In the year 1955-56 the gross levy on agricultural land in county health districts was £11,404,000.  The amount of the agricultural grant applicable to this levy was £5,250,000.  The grant therefore afforded farmers relief to the extent of 46 per cent. of the rate levy on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> As I have said already the object of the Bill is to continue to 31st March, 1959, the system embodied in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953.  No new principle is involved.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the Minister introducing this Bill.  The Minister now proposes to continue for the next three years, which would be his full lifetime as Minister for Local Government and the full lifetime of his Party if they remain in office for that period, a Bill which he condemned root and branch when it was introduced.  I expected from the Minister something better.  I expected that he would take some steps to remedy the defects which he pointed out to his predecessor in office, Deputy Smith.  Instead, the Minister appears to be getting lazy. I cannot describe his action in any other words having regard to the fact that he comes in here on the last day of the session with a Bill like this. Speaking in this House on the 15th December, 1953, at column 2282, Volume 143 of the Official Report, the Minister pointed out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill will not benefit in any way the small farmer who goes in for mixed farming.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the small farmer of £20 or £30 poor law valuation who crops, say, ten or 15 acres of his land, must employ five or six hands during the spring and again during the harvest.  I submit that the aggregate number of days, if they were totted up, of all his employees during these periods of spring and harvest would total more than 365 days of one labourer's employment on the farm.  No provision is made in this Bill for the mixed farmer: he will derive no benefit under sub-section (1) (a) of Section 1 of this Bill.  I recommend to the Minister, in calculating the qualifying period under the 1946 Act, to consider seriously the matter of taking into account the aggregate number of days worked by the employees of a particular farmer.  If the Minister does that, he will give considerable benefit to small farmers in West Donegal and South Donegal who will derive no benefit whatsoever <Col N="1024" /> from the Bill as it is at present framed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's own statement in this House on the Bill which he is now asking us to pass &mdash; not for one but for three years.  He went further and made an appeal for the ladies, for in column 2280 of the same Volume he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am reliably informed that, during the recent war, 50 per cent. of the land workers of Britain were of the female sex.  Unfortunately, a considerable number of those lady workers on the lands of Britain were Irish citizens.  While in Britain they became adapted to employment as farm labourers.  Some of them have returned to this country.  Some of them have acquired farms here and some of them are employed as farm labourers here&mdash;driving tractors, driving threshing machines and, as Deputy Dillon said, in charge of piggeries. I think that the farmer who employs such female workers is entitled to some relief.  In all the legislation introduced in this country, there has never been discrimination, so far as I know, between male and female citizens.  Here, however, we are definitely discriminating in favour of the male.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the Minister.  He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister should seriously consider amending this situation. Very little amendment of this Bill would be required in the Committee Stage to place female employees on a par with male employees, in so far as farming is concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister then called attention to certain defects in this Act which I expected that he, as a good Deputy, anxious to serve his constituents, would remedy the moment he got the opportunity himself but, having got this heaven-sent opportunity, he comes along with Deputy Smith's Bill and slaps it down saying it is all right. That is my first complaint in connection with the Minister himself on this Bill but there is worse than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when speaking on this Bill in this House, said in column 1937, Volume 143 of the <Col N="1025" /> Official Debates of the 10th December, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am going to show, in relation to this Bill, that it is not the Bill which the Minister alleged it was when he was bringing it in.  The primary purpose of his Bill is to save the Exchequer at the expense of the local rates that are going to be paid on agricultural land.  In that purpose, the Minister is merely following on the line that has already been set by his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  It has, unfortunately, been the purpose in many things lately to shift the burden from central taxation to the local rates.  This Bill is going to continue that shift because, regardless of whether the figures for the present year which I have given are correct or not &mdash; I have said they have been obtained from the secretaries to the county councils&mdash;or whether the figures which the Minister has refused to disclose are correct, the fact is that every increase in rates in any county will mean, under this Bill, that there will be a reduction in the agricultural grant which would have been given if the legislation up to the 31st March last had been renewed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement from the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, speaking in this House.  He continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, the rates have been increasing.  It is unfortunate that that tendency is there.  All of us agree that the trend in regard to rates seems to be towards an increase. The effect of this Bill will mean that, every time there is an increase in the rates, what the farmer-ratepayers will get by way of relief under this Bill will be less than what they would have got under the legislation that was in force prior to the 1st April, last.  That is, of course, because the supplemental allowance was worked on a sliding scale in relation to rates, whereas now the employment allowance will be on a fixed basis and not on a sliding scale, having regard to the amount of the rates.  If the rates were to go down, it would mean that the local authorities would gain, but I am afraid few <Col N="1026" /> of us see much prospect of a reduction in the rates.  The likelihood is that the rates will tend to increase as they have been doing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, on the 10th December, 1953, during the debate on the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1953.  That represents his reading of the position obtaining from 1953 up to the present. One would expect some improvement when we would come to a matter of that description.</P>
    <P>I shall quote now from what the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, had to say on the 15th December, 1953, on that same Bill.  He had a lot of nice things to say about it.  At column 2274 of the Official Report, Volume 143, he is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The set-up prior to this brilliant brainwave of the present Minister was your first £20 of valuation was, in substance, relieved of rates in so far as agricultural land was concerned. In respect of the next £5 I think it was, you were relieved of the agricultural rate so far as agricultural land is concerned to the extent of two-thirds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not know how the supplementary grant was distributed, but in addition to the derating of the first £20 of valuation, over and above the supplementary grant which gave you a further relief after the first £20, you were entitled to a relief of £6 10s. 0d. in respect of every agricultural worker whom you employed for the full 12 months of the rateable year.  Everybody got the benefit of the supplementary grant but the employer of labour got the employment allowance.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is now proposed to remove the supplementary grant altogether and to substitute therefor £17 in respect of each agricultural worker, and the case made is that this Bill will encourage farmers to employ more men. In the present state of the rural labour market for agricultural labourers, every farmer who employs a man must pay him £5 a week if he <Col N="1027" /> wants to get £17 per annum, which means approximately 7/- per week. What farmer is going to employ a man for 52 weeks of the year for £5 a week in order to earn 7/- per week for himself?  Will this device induce any farmer to employ another man? Unless Dáil Éireann solemnly comes to the conclusion that the farmers are all daft, we are not going to legislate to induce a farmer to employ a man he does not want at £5 a week by offering him 7/- a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the present Minister for Agriculture on the 1953 Act which is now to be extended for a further three years.  Deputy Dillon, as he was then, continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we want to subsidise family labour, will anyone tell me, if a farmer has five daughters instead of five sons, why is he fined 35/- a week because Providence did not send him five sons?  Here is Deputy Mrs. Rice now and let her take the field.  Surely she has something to say for the farmer who has five daughters and whose daughters are helping about the farm.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Beegan: Would you like to have the daughters working on the land?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Let us not get sentimental about the daughters.  I do not want to see any daughter working on the land, driving a plough or sitting on a tractor, although some of them might not be averse to that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture&mdash; Deputy Dillon as he was then&mdash;continued and is reported at column 2277 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only amendment in this Bill which differentiates it from any previous Bill is that the supplementary agricultural grant is withdrawn and in lieu there is £17 provided for each agricultural worker.  The net result of this Bill is to collect about £100,000 from the land of Ireland more than was collected heretofore, for the benefit of the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read for the House the opinions held in 1953 by the present Minister for Finance, by the present Minister <Col N="1028" /> for Local Government and by the present Minister for Agriculture in connection with the Bill which is now to be extended for a further three years.  Is there any shame at all in the Ministers of this House?  Surely the Minister for Local Government is blushing?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government pointed out reliefs. I wonder what the unfortunate smallholders of County Donegal, whom he is so proud to represent here, will think of him now.  Surely he also is interested in the daughters.  Surely the Minister for Agriculture, who is so anxious about all those lovely young ladies who were ploughing with tractors, and so forth, in the fields and working on the farms, would be sufficiently interested not to put them in the position in which he says they are now &mdash; that a man would be fined 35/- a week because Providence sent him five daughters instead of five sons.  I thought I would see some reference to these things.  That is why I put down a question a month ago to remind the Minister that this Bill was due.  I did so, thinking he would then read up some of the things he said about it when it was being introduced into this House and that he would bring in the remedies.</P>

      <P>I intend to read out the speech of any Deputy over there who interrupts me.  I will remind him of what he said about Deputy Smith's Bill, when he was Minister for Local Government.  Deputy Deering is reported <Col N="1029" /> at column 2280 of the Official Report of the 15th December, 1953. He said he only wanted to make one point.  Here are his words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It concerns the position when two or more brothers jointly own a farm.  I think the Minister should consider bringing in an amendment that would ease such a situation. Cases of that nature, both in Kildare and Wicklow, have been brought to my notice.  I could have tabled a question about this matter but I hope that the Minister will take notice of it now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkDeering" hpid="Mr. Deering Mr. Deering">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deering</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will, too. However, the Minister himself was one of the biggest offenders in this matter. The present Minister for Local Government has the responsibility of bringing this Bill to this House.  We all know that rates have gone up since 1953.  We all know rates have flown up since then.  In Cork, we are faced with an increase of something like 7/- in the £ this year.  If, as stated in 1953 by the present Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, by the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and by the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, these were the effects that that Bill would have, where is their sympathy now for the farmers?  They are doing either of two things.  They are deliberately continuing the burden on the farmers and robbing them to the extent not of £100,000 a year &mdash; Deputy Dillon said they were being robbed by that amount in 1953 &mdash; but by close on £1,000,000 a year, or else they did not know what they were talking about when they were speaking in 1953.  Was Deputy Sweetman correct in his statement on this Bill previously or was he not? Deputy Sweetman is the financial genius of the Party and his statement was that the effect of the Bill would be that every time there was an increase in the rates what the farmer-ratepayers would get by way of relief under this Bill would be less than they would have got under the legislation which was in force previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, in view of that statement by the Minister for Finance, it would be far <Col N="1030" /> more in his line to go back to the Bill that was there previously.  If this guardian of agriculture &mdash; the Lord between us and harm &mdash; the Minister for Agriculture, was correct in his statement, will he now agree to this Bill being passed, having suggested that Deputy Smith should resign before he would pass such a Bill?  Speaking at column 2279, Volume 143, of the Official Debates of 15th December, 1953, the present Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But I do say this.  The public life of Ireland is degraded, and those of us who are proud to participate in it are humiliated... to see such conduct.  I like to think that, hereafter, public men who attain to the high honour of membership of an Irish Government will have that sense of personal dignity which would require them to resign rather than to be made... a doormat for their colleagues to wipe their boots on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the opinions that have been expressed here by the present Minister for Finance and the present Minister for Agriculture, is the Minister for Local Government now being used as a doormat for his colleagues to wipe their boots on, in the words of Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    <P>I would expect from Ministers who are elected to the honourable position of a Ministry in an Irish Government that, before they would introduce any measures into this House, they would at least go to the trouble of studying the measures they introduce and not come in here asking for a Bill to be continued for three further years on which those opinions were expressed, not by back benchers but by the present Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Local Government himself.</P>
    <P>So much for the Bill as it stands at the moment.  I hope to give the Minister an opportunity of trotting around that lobby and voting on amendments to every single section in that Bill if he does not bring them in himself.  I would like to point out some of the defects we have found in <Col N="1031" /> this measure.  One of them is that the Act as at present framed provides that a man must be employed for the full 12 months.  We were told that that would receive a generous interpretation from the county managers throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving facts as I find them.  We have 280 threats of prosecutions in Cork County under the present legislation.  There is not one of the 46 of us in the county council who has not gone on pilgrimages to the county manager and the legal adviser on this, and the legal adviser said: &ldquo;There is the law.&rdquo;  What we find is that a man is hired for 12 months, but for one reason or another in the middle of the year that man happens to leave.  You do not replace a good agricultural labourer now in a day or even a week.  It takes a little time. But under the Act as it stands if you replace that agricultural labourer even after a week you lose the £17 immediately.  I would expect that the Minister, in view of the fact that he had full knowledge of this, judging by his own statements, would remedy that condition of affairs.  There is not a rural Deputy listening to me who does not know that that defect is in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it at that. I have a kind of sympathy for the Deputy there in the corner.  I want that defect to be remedied.  If this Bill has all those defects that were set out by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, the Minister should remedy them.  God knows the old farmer has suffered enough and has got enough persecution in the past 12 months, with prices going down and rates going up, and in view of the fact that the present genius in charge of our finances has solemnly pointed to us here that we get no benefit, that every time the rates go up we lose and the Exchequer gains on this kind of dodge, as he said, that was brought in by Deputy Smith when Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Can we have it cured now?  I do not want to labour this matter.  There are other rural Deputies who are just as interested in this matter as I am and I shall not sit here coolly and see this condition of affairs prevail.  When you meet a farmer and he tells you that you are a Deputy and asks you what you were doing while they were doing this, he expects an answer.  He expects that you will not sit dumb and idle, as the Minister for Local Government has sat, while this Bill was being considered and brought before the House.  The Minister walks in flagrantly and throws the Bill on the Table, a Bill that he criticised tooth and nail, a Bill that his Minister for Finance and Minister for Agriculture criticised.  He walks in and throws it on the Table and says, &ldquo;That is for three years more.  Swallow it.&rdquo;  The Minister has treated this House with very grave disrespect, in view of the opinions expressed here by the Cabinet of the present day, by the manner in which this Bill has been brought in to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry has given us a unique speech this morning, unique for Deputy Corry.  Everything <Col N="1033" /> which he approved of, voted for and spoke strongly in favour of in this Bill which was introduced in 1953 he now has spoken more strongly against. Deputy Corry wants to pretend now that it was because the poor innocent man did not understand &mdash; just imagine Deputy Corry in the guise of innocence, particularly when it comes to a question of getting relief of rates &mdash; when the Bill was introduced in 1953 by his own Minister for Local Government that he voted in favour of it.  He did not understand.  Poor Deputy Corry did not understand that a man had to work the full 12 months before the farmer became entitled to the relief!  In case the Deputy was not able to read the Bill and understand it &mdash; which, of course, he is fully competent to do&mdash; it was pointed out to him by some of the eloquent speakers whom he has quoted that that was the position, but still Deputy Corry went on to inflict what he calls a great burden on the farmers of this country and through his vote, to use his own words, robbed them to that extent for the last three years.  The Deputy is playing one of his old tricks, trying to cover up his own responsibility and his own misdeeds in this respect by attacking others.  I really got on my feet to deal with one point.</P>

      <P>So, I will not say the Deputy's ignorance, because I know him too well to attribute ignorance to him, but the Deputy's innocence of what is contained in the Bill misled him so that he did not even threaten to do what he is now threatening to do, to put down an amendment. The Deputy did not realise <Col N="1034" /> during the whole of the debate, during all the speeches that were made, that a man would have to be employed continuously for 12 months before the farmer could qualify for the relief.  I do not know about anyone else on that side of the House or on this side of the House, but when it comes to a piece of astute, shrewd, political work or propaganda, I do not underestimate Deputy Corry's capacity.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Cunningham wants to speak he can speak after me and is quite well able to do it. Deputy Corry and I have been sparring at each other across this House before ever we heard the Deputy's glorious Donegal accent.  I have some respect for him.  The Deputy said we have to face our responsibility because, when we go back, we meet the farmer and the farmer is entitled to an answer.  He is entitled to a straight answer and a truthful answer.  The Deputy says that we cannot say that we sat silent and mute.  Just imagine Deputy Corry being mute, particularly if there is a chance to say anything that will be reproduced in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> for farmers.  However, that is not the point.</P>
      <P>I should like to be enlightened on this because, frankly, I do not understand it.  Unlike other people here, I am not a financial genius but I am told by Deputy Corry that this Bill is imposing a burden on the farmers of this country, that it will rob them of something which, by implication, he alleges they were receiving under the Fianna Fáil Government, in so far as I have followed it.</P>

The Deputy did say &mdash; this was not a quotation &mdash; the Deputy did say from himself that the farmer was being deprived of something, that this was imposing a burden on him, that the farmers would again be robbed.  The Deputy did say that and it will be in the Official Report.  That is not a quotation. I do not mind whether the Deputy's quotations from the people whom he quoted are right or wrong.  I am not concerned about that.  What I am concerned about is this, Sir: This gross sum &mdash; and I am not against it but I want the thing put clearly and intelligently &mdash; this gross sum of over £5,500,000 is being put up by every taxpayer in this country, including every farmer and farm labourer and working man, and the fact of the matter is that, unless I misunderstood the figures read out here this morning by the Minister, from now on there is being provided between £500,000 and £600,000 more for the agricultural grant than was provided and paid two or three years ago.</P>

      <P>The trouble with Fianna Fáil &mdash; the older they are the worse they are &mdash; is that they are the best in the world while handing it out and pouring it out and pouring out <Col N="1036" /> misrepresentation, but when somebody gets up to reply they cannot take it, whether he is on the front bench, the second bench or the back bench.  The Deputy is not going to put me off the point, and I say &mdash; and I hope if I am wrong the Minister will correct me on this &mdash; that we have the statement, made here by the Minister this morning in introducing the Second Reading of this Bill, that this year there will be between £500,000 and £600,000 more for the relief of rates for the farmers than there was under Fianna Fáil in their last Government after the 1953 Bill.  How you can impose a burden, much less how you can rob people by giving them £500,000 more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have far too much respect for the man in the Chair to lecture him or to reflect on him but I do say that if Deputy Corry or any other Deputy interrupts me I am entitled to reply to him.  Deputy Smith is the one man himself who would insist on it.  I now come back to the simple question from which Deputy Corry and everybody else seem to be driving me away.  How are we increasing the burden of a section of the community or robbing them if you give them £600,000 more?  I cannot see it, although there may be a perfectly simple answer or explanation to it.  I do not know.  I am looking for enlightenment because unlike people on the other side of the House, I do not pretend to know everything about everything.  That is the simple question.  I shall be interested of course to see Deputy Corry's amendment. It will be interesting to hear the speech he will make in support of the amendment which he has put down only for the purpose of discomfiting three Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a couple of comments to make on what has been said so far.  One is that I would be much more moved by Deputy Corry's speech if I did not know perfectly well, as everybody else does, that if the two sides of the House were reversed we would get the very same Bill.  Deputy Morrissey asked for some comment on how it could be that an imposition is being made on people when they are getting an extra £600,000.  It is quite simple.  If I understand Deputy Corry's argument, if the former method of calculation had been continued, the relief would have been a great deal more, but as far as the extra £600,000 in itself is concerned it is undoubtedly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must, however, be remembered that it arises because of the increase in the rates and the agricultural grant <Col N="1043" /> pays part of the rates, so that the £600,000, welcome as it is as a relief, is really a measure of a very much bigger sum now imposed over last year by way of rates.  However, my first concern on this measure is that it is going to last for another three years and there are one or two points I should like to put to the Minister.  I understand the Bill is required to go through fairly quickly for the convenience of local authorities and there may not be time to amend the Bill.  But an amending Bill can always be brought in later.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the improved allowance and to its effect on employment.  It was designed to increase whole-time employment of male workers.  The Minister has given the figures of employment in two or three years and they show that it did not encourage an increase in employment. To say that it held a decline is just wishful thinking.  The figures are not very encouraging.  I think it is a fair argument to say that £17 is not an encouragement to keep an extra man for a whole year.  My view on that, instead of a fixed sum of £17 per male employee, a sliding scale would, at the same expense to the State, have provided much better encouragement.  I do not think it is possible from a practical viewpoint to believe that a farm which employs one male worker will be encouraged by any sum given by the State, which would be reasonable at all from the State viewpoint, to increase from one to two employees, but it might be possible to encourage the larger farmers who employ three or four men to increase to five.  But the £17 will not do it.  If a sliding scale were adopted instead of a flat £17 it might have better results.  The former figure was £13 per male worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>£6 10s., in fact.</P>

If, instead of moving this £13 to £17, a sliding scale had been adopted by which the first worker would mean a relief of £13 the next £15, the next £17, the next £19, and the next £21 and so on, there would have been, I think, real encouragement given to <Col N="1044" /> employ a fourth, a fifth or a sixth worker.  That would seem to me to hold out a reasonable hope of extra employment being given.  I do not see that any encouragement is really being given sufficient to induce a man to keep two workers where he has been keeping one.</P>
      <P>Whether what I suggest can be done now, I am not sure.  It certainly cannot be done by an amendment put down by a private Deputy because the calculation as to the changing of the scale of employment allowances without affecting the total sum granted by the State would be too difficult.  It would inevitably mean that the amount for the first worker would have to be reduced and I do not think that would be very popular.  Such an amendment would have to be brought in by the Minister and I suggest that he should consider the matter to see if, later on, he cannot do something in the direction I have indicated, something which will give a real impetus to the employment of extra workers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Corry that some very small interval interferes with the possibility of getting the £17, there is a very simple remedy.  If a week has elapsed it is quite a simple matter to pay the new worker that extra week and date his employment as from the date the other worker left.  It means admittedly paying a week's wages, but there is no element of compulsion in it.  If I care to pay a man who sits in the City of Dublin and let him sit there he is still legally my employee.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith, of course, brought in a Bill similar to this <Col N="1045" /> and he has studied the subject much more closely than I have.  It is a pity he did not think of that difficulty then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another aspect. At any rate, I think one can take it it is the accepted practice.  Whether someone is by reason of that practice technically breaking the law I do not really know.  But it is a very simple solution.  Admittedly there is the difficulty that the gap between one employee leaving and the finding of another employee can extend to the point where it is not worth while claiming £17; in other words, it goes beyond three or four weeks.  A hardship can occur, but I do not think one can legislate by arguing from the particular to the general.  Because of the small number of cases involved, I do not think one could do that.</P>
      <P>On the question of providing for broken employment, there is the obvious difficulty that that defeats the purpose of the employment allowance. The purpose of the allowance, as I understand it, is to secure wholetime employment and, though I admit the difficulty and admit the hardship and admit that it would be very nice as an employer of farm workers to get some allowance for those who have to be employed on broken time, that is a different consideration altogether. While I am not saying I would not like to see it, it has nothing to do with the employment allowance provided, the purpose of which admittedly is to increase continuous employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I would like to make &mdash;I will admit it is not a very easy one to argue &mdash; is in relation to male relatives where the age limits are the same as for male employees, namely, 17 to 70.  The case has been made to me that considerable hardship can be caused where a farmer has a couple of sons who have left school but who have not yet reached the age of 17.  He is in a disadvantageous position as compared with a neighbour whose sons happen to be over 17.  I can see the difficulty that the State does not want to encourage people to take their sons <Col N="1046" /> from school before they absolutely must.  But there is a difficulty there, and it has been demonstrated to me in several cases, where boys who might have stayed at home have gone to England to other employment to earn money because the farm was not a rich one.  The allowance of £17 would have made all the difference in providing them with some pocket money but, because they had not reached the age of 17, that allowance could not be got.  That is one of those things in which at first sight the remedy would appear to be obvious, but I can see that there are all sorts of contingent dangers which might easily arise.  It might be argued that such a provision was tantamount to offering people £17 a year to take their sons away from school.  I think that might be got over.  It is a very complicated question, however, and it would need a good deal of consideration.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to raise at the moment is in regard to the grouping of holdings.  How far does that grouping take place in all cases? If a farmer happens to have two or three farms, all the separate holdings are brought together for the purposes of the Act, and quite properly so.  I understand the same applies to State bodies and semi-State bodies which own land in a rating district.  But I am not so sure that it applies to the Land Commission.  Where the Land Commission acquires land inside a local authority's rating area I am not quite sure whether, in fact, all the land owned by the Land Commission in that rating area is lumped together or whether they get relief under several primary allowances.  I think the Minister should look into that because I do not see any reason at all why the State should give the Land Commission the benefit of several primary allowances within the one county.  There may be administrative difficulty.  I may not even be correct in saying that that is the case, but I have reason to believe that that is so and I think it should be looked into. I do not see any reason at all why several primary allowances should be given to the Land Commission in respect of land they happen to have in their possession within the one county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> This relief of rates has been established now for some considerable time and I think, in general, the main trouble about it is that the allowance is always behind the present value of money and the present level of expenditure. Generous as it may seem when one looks at it as a sum of £5,500,000, its relationship to the burden of rates on agricultural land becomes successively less each year.  I think that is about the only reason I have for objecting to a measure making provision for three years.  I do not think the Minister can give us an assurance that rates will not increase during those three years so that, whatever relationship the relief may have this year to the rates in the present year, I am afraid we must be quite satisfied that by the end of the three years farmers will be getting less relief on a percentage basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in what the Minister for Local Government, or any other Minister, said so many years ago.  I am interested in the operational defects which have shown up in this Bill.  I think one of the major defects has arisen on this operative clause &ldquo;whole year&rdquo;.  In my end of the constituency, and in the greater part of the constituency of North Cork, there is no such thing as a 12-months' working period.  You will not get any man to work on a contract for 12 months.  It is something which employers are up against in that area. Every year the employees leave the farmers' employment on the 20th or 24th December and do not return until the 16th or 20th January.  I do not say that all the farmers in that area have deprived themselves of the abatement on account of that system because after a while they got wise and when the application forms were sent out one had to put in the dates of employment, from and to, and if anyone did so he failed to qualify.  The farmers discovered that if they put in those dates they would deprive themselves of the abatement and they did not put them in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That anomaly does exist; any farmer in the area who puts down the working <Col N="1048" /> dates deprives himself of the abatement. I think that that in itself makes a case for some few weeks, say a period of four weeks, respite in the operative period to qualify.  The period to qualify for the abatement should be 48 weeks and should be regarded as employment in continuity in view of the peculiar system which exists in part of Cork County.</P>
    <P>There is also another defect which has shown up in the operation of this Bill in certain areas where valuations are high.  In some parts of Cork County, you have a valuation of 30/- an acre and the Bill disqualifies the employer who employs a man who is the owner of land with a rateable valuation which exceeds £5.  In parts of Cork County, four acres would have a valuation of £6 and nobody could argue that the holder of such a holding is a farmer in the strict sense.  He is no better than a cottier but, should he be employed the whole year round, the farmer who employs him might not know what the valuation of that man's holding is. Then when it is discovered that the man has a holding with a rateable valuation in excess of the £5, the employer gets no abatement.</P>
    <P>I think these are defects which should be examined and I think the Minister should, before introducing this Bill in a permanent way, try to get over the operational defects which have shown up since the Bill was first introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all let us examine the pattern of these reliefs on agricultural land.  Under the 1946 Act there were three types of relief granted to farmers.  There was a relief granted to those with a valuation up to £20, there was the employment relief and the relief of one-third.  That was the pattern, the political pattern, of relief on agricultural lands as introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1946. When the first inter-Party Government came into power in 1948, they extended the period of the Act and it was extended again in 1949, 1950 and 1951. When Fianna Fáil returned to power, they changed the law and introduced the Bill of 1953 which later became an Act.  I stand by everything I said against that Bill when it was originally <Col N="1049" /> introduced in the House but I have respect for the legislation of this House and I have great respect for my predecessor in office and I think that the Bill which he introduced and, which became an Act, should at least get a fair trial.  That applies particularly to the effect of the Bill and the claims in respect of employees which have now arisen in 1955-56, the first year in which the effect will be felt by the employers.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill has not been long enough in operation to enable us to amend it.  We must give it a fair trial first and that is what I am asking the House to do.  That was exactly what Deputy Smith, as Minister for Local Government, had asked the House to do.  We should give the Bill a fair chance and then if it does not work we can see how we can amend it.</P>

      <P>I think that is one of the things the Deputy asked me to refrain from doing.  We should leave the Bill in operation for a period of three years and then if it is necessary we can amend it.  That is the pattern of legislation as I see it.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made by various Deputies all of which in my opinion deserve careful consideration before permanent legislation is introduced and I hope that whatever Minister is in office at the time will give careful consideration to all the matters which have been raised when the time comes for the introduction of permanent legislation.  Some points were mentioned by Deputy Corry which deserve replies.  For instance, the Deputy said that if the rates go up the farmer gets no extra relief in valuation. The Deputy knows that is not so.  On the first £20 of his land valuation the farmer gets relief to the extent of three-fifths of the rate in the £.  That means relief as related to the amount of the rates.  We must remember a very important fact&mdash;that there are 399,431 of the total of the 492,490 holdings in the country which are less than £20 valuation.</P>

      <P>It will stabilise the position, if I might put it that way. This is the first year in which we will really be able to procure any statistics on the subject.  We only hope that it will work.  The main purpose of this is to encourage farmers to keep their employees in whole-time employment. Deputy Moher pointed out that in Cork they only kept them for 11 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But the farmers claimed in respect of employment for 12 months.  It is a very simple matter <Col N="1051" /> of economics.  If you have a man employed for 11 months, and he does not stay for the 12th month he is not entitled to unemployment insurance or unemployment benefit.  There is a month in which he has nothing whatever. Surely it is bad economics that any savings he may have effected during the 11 months must all be spent by him in the 12th month.</P>

I sincerely hope that what he has said will be noted by the authorities.</P>
      <P>What I have said about the encouragement of whole-time employment also applies to the point made by Deputy Sheldon.  It is not so much to encourage farmers to take on more employment than it is to encourage them to keep in permanent employment the employees they have got.  Some Deputy referred also to the question of joint ownership.  I think it was Deputy Deering, by way of interjection, who referred to the fact that, where you have joint ownership, each should be entitled to the employment benefit.  The position is this.  It is not the registered owner who is entitled to the benefit; it is the beneficial owner.  If you have a dormant partner, in my opinion, you are entitled to claim the benefit on his behalf, if he works on the farm and providing he has not got a beneficial interest in the place.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is, far and away, the most important section in the Bill as it provides for the main source of citizenship&mdash;birth in Ireland. It also provides that citizenship, when established, may descend through the blood of either the father or mother. For a full understanding, its provisions must be read in conjunction with the provisions of Section 7 which require formalities to be complied with in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a preliminary, it is necessary to refer to the corresponding provisions of existing law governing the acquisition of citizenship &mdash; that is the law contained <Col N="1055" /> in Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution and Section 2 of the Act of 1955 which is paraphrased in pages 3 and 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons born before 6th December, 1922, existing law makes no provision for citizenship in the case of considerable overseas populations of the Irish race who were born, or whose immediate forefathers were born in Ireland.  In Australia, Britain, Canada, the U.S.A. and elsewhere, there are large numbers of persons who emigrated from Ireland before 6th December, 1922, and who did not have a domicile in Ireland on that date.  They are not citizens under Article 3 of the 1922 Constitution.  And for one reason or another&mdash;unawareness, perhaps, of the registration provisions of Section 2 (4) of the Act of 1935, or because they are prohibited by being naturalised citizens of their country of residence&mdash;they have not become Irish citizens by registration.  Only 4,409 persons have registered since 1935 and their sons and daughters, children of direct Irish stock, are not Irish citizens and could only become Irish citizens by coming to live in Ireland and taking out naturalisation papers.</P>
    <P>As regards persons born since 6th December, 1922, the provisions of Section 2 of the 1935 Act which govern their citizenship seem to us to be defective in many respects.  While citizenship is provided for by birth in the Twenty-Six Counties, birth in the Six Counties is treated the same as birth in any alien land; furthermore, the provision that a person born outside the Twenty-Six counties of an Irish father born outside the Twenty-Six Counties can acquire citizenship by registration only within two years of birth seems unduly restrictive; and derivation of citizenship through the father, in disregard of the mother, does not commend itself to us.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of this Bill (as qualified by Section 7) proposes to rectify that position.  If it is enacted into law, every living person born in any part of the 32 Counties before 6th December, 1922, will be an Irish citizen from birth; every living person born outside the <Col N="1056" /> 32 Counties whose father or mother was born in any part of the 32 Counties before 6th December, 1922, will be an Irish citizen; every living person who is the grandchild of a person born in any part of the 32 Counties prior to 6th December, 1922, will be an Irish citizen&mdash;provided that where the person and his or her parents are all born outside the 32 Counties citizenship is conditional on registration.</P>
    <P>That is how we propose that citizenship will originate in and flow from persons born before 6th December, 1922.  The vast majority of persons living in any part of the 32 Counties, to-day, will almost certainly be covered by this new umbrella of citizenship.  And their children born outside Ireland will be citizens by descent and so on into future generations.</P>
    <P>But, in addition to the line of citizenship flowing from our pre-1922 stock, Section 6 makes provision for citizenship which originates by birth in the Twenty-Six County State and is transmitted from either the Irish father or Irish mother to the children born abroad.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is yet a third originating source of citizenship: where birth, without Irish ancestry, takes place in the Six Counties on or after 6th December, 1922 &mdash; that fact alone enables the person concerned to declare himself to be an Irish citizen, in which case his citizenship dates from his birth and is the citizenship of his children.  Once citizenship is established in this way, it continues without formality of any kind through succeeding generations born in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There are ways, apart from birth in the national territory, in which Irish citizenship may originate, such as the issue to a person of a certificate of citizenship, under Section 12, or a certificate of naturalisation under Section 18.  The citizenship of the children born to such citizens is provided for in Section 6, which says that &ldquo;every person is an Irish citizen if his father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of that person's birth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that our proposals in Section 6&mdash;as qualified in Section 7&mdash;are <Col N="1057" /> just and generous and that they will have the general approval of the House.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 2 in Deputy Costello's name, what is wrong with the amendment is that it is making a distinction between citizenship derived from the father and mother born outside Ireland.  I think that the Minister should consider between this and the Report Stage whether the principle involved in Deputy Costello's amendment should be adopted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The second.  Under this section as it stands now we are going to give citizenship without either application or registration not only to the children of Irish citizens born outside Ireland but also to their children.  I think that tends to make citizenship very cheap.  If we take the idea in Deputy Declan Costello's amendment, and apply it to the children of fathers and mothers born outside Ireland, we would limit the granting of citizenship to a proper extent.  I think it is reasonable to grant citizenship without undue formality to the children of Irish citizens who are born outside Ireland&mdash;the children who are born outside Ireland &mdash; but I think we should stop there and not apply automatic citizenship to the children's children.</P>
      <P>If they want to become Irish citizens we can adopt the idea in the 1935 Act and also the idea in the amendment by Deputy Declan Costello.  I think the Minister should consider that matter between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> There is no reason why the second or third generation should not be compelled to register and thus show their interest in Irish citizenship before it is granted to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>Yes, under Section 2 (a).  We are not accepting Deputy Costello's amendment.  If we were to accept the proposals we would, of course, be bridging some of the gap between the existing law and the new Bill.  We would, I know, be acknowledging the Irish citizenship of a person born abroad of a mother born in Ireland but that would be going only a limited distance along the road to acknowledging that the blood of the mother is of the same value as the blood of the father in transmitting Irish citizenship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister go into the matter of the phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;? It seems to me to be very wide.  I know it was in the 1935 Act but 21 years have elapsed since then. As I say, the phrase &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; seems to me very wide.  After all, the rest of the section seems to provide a long list of categories to whom a certificate of naturalisation can be granted without complying with all the conditions in Section 15.  Section 16 gives power to the Minister to grant a certificate of naturalisation where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations, where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations, where the applicant is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of his minor child, where the applicant is a woman who is married to a naturalised Irish citizen, where the applicant is married to a woman who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation), and where the applicant is or has been resident abroad in the public service.  As I raised this point on the Second Reading, I should like to know from the Minister what exactly he has in mind or what type of person he has in mind to whom he wants to grant a certificate of naturalisation although all the conditions for naturalisation have not been complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the expression &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in paragraph (a), without definition has been queried.  This use was deliberate.  The same expression occurred in Section 7 of the 1935 Act which enabled the Minister to grant a certificate to a minor who has not complied with the ordinary requirements of naturalisation on account of his Irish descent or associations.  It is intended to cover cases such as those of aliens who join the Defence Forces or aliens who have many years residence in Ireland but <Col N="1060" /> are unable to complete a year's continuous residence prior to the date of application.</P>
      <P>We have a case in mind of a Stateless alien who has been here for a considerable number of years and has succeeded in getting a scholarship which requires his presence abroad for about two months in every year. Unless we have some loophole for cases such as this, the residence requirements, which are of value generally, will prevent the grant of citizenship to a person fitted in every way for the honour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the way this section is drafted could be described as leaving a loophole.  It is an actual highway.  Take the position of an applicant for citizenship in Section 16 (a) who is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  How is that to be interpreted?  It is quite open, under this, to dispense with all the other provisions there are as to qualifications for citizenship.  For instance, it appears to me that under this, if an Arab in Cairo drinks a glass of Irish whiskey it would qualify him for citizenship under this particular provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Mesopotamian goes into a business partnership with a man of Irish descent, he would have Irish associations and it would be open to any Minister to grant his application for Irish citizenship.  If we are left without some specific definition of what Irish associations may be, it means, in effect, that anybody in the whole wide world may become a citizen of this State if the particular Minister in power at the time is so inclined and is agreeable to give him citizenship.  By that it appears to me that all the other provisions in relation to residence qualifications and so on can go by the board because anybody from the ends of the earth if he desires Irish citizenship can get some kind of Irish associations. It will be very easy to acquire Irish associations and thereby qualify himself for a certificate of naturalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase occurred in the 1935 Act and there is no difficulty about applying it in the limited circumstances of Section 7.  It was deliberately left undefined here.  I understand that Deputy Moran thinks that an Arab who drinks Irish whiskey has Irish associations.  If there is a Minister mad enough to accept that interpretation, he is empowered to do so, but we do not often elect members of such calibre, or to accept that line of argument.</P>
      <P>There is an obvious case the Minister referred to, that of an individual whom I know.  He is a person of considerable academic qualifications who had to fly as a refugee from the Continent.  He is a doctor in three universities.  He came here and is associated with one of the universities. Because of his qualifications, he has succeeded in getting a scholarship under the U.N.O.  It means that he must get out of this country for a certain period each year and that means that he cannot qualify under Section 15 because he cannot complete a year's continuous residence prior to the date of application.  It is to meet that sort of case that the loophole is left.  Because a loophole is left, it does not necessarily follow that the Minister will be lunatic enough to extend it in the manner suggested by the Deputy, who would leave no discrimination to the Minister at all.  The phrase is here since 1935 and no effort has been made to widen it in any extravagant fashion.  Deliberately, the phrase has not been defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if we are enacting legislation here we should know what we mean.  I have asked Deputy McGilligan to give us a definition of <Col N="1062" />&ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; a phrase with which we are dealing here.  Of course, he cites that because he cannot define what is legally meant by &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;.  I suggest nobody in the House can do so.  It is the height of absurdity, at all events, to enact legislation the meaning of which the House does not understand.  It is a greater absurdity to write this into the Statute Book and expect that at some time or other some court will interpret it.  If it is the intention of the Minister and the House to state that the Minister can, in suitable circumstances and at his own sweet will, confer Irish citizenship on anybody, then let us say so.</P>
      <P>If we do it in that form the Minister, who may grant at his own sweet will Irish citizenship to anybody, will have to take the responsibility for it and we will not leave it open to any future Minister who might abuse that particular power to say: &ldquo;Well, it is written into Section 16 of this Act that this particular individual had Irish associations, whatever that may mean.&rdquo;  I far prefer to put the onus on the Minister by writing on the Statute Book that a Minister for Justice of this country in the future can, in suitable cases, confer Irish citizenship on anybody.  I think it would be far better to do that than to write in a sub-section of this type the meaning of which no Deputy understands, the meaning of which the country does not understand and one which certainly no judge would be able to understand or to interpret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Moran is not being reasonable in his approach.  First of all, we are on common ground that the definition of &ldquo;Irish association,&rdquo; if at all possible, might lead to the type of situation about which the Deputy would immediately start to wail.  In my view, this Act is designed to be interpreted by a reasonable Minister in the circumstances of each individual case.  I thought the Deputy was possibly being legal <i>ad absurdum</i> when he suggested that &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo; might simply be the drinking of a glass of whiskey with Irish representatives at, for instance, some international conference. Surely that would be an infusion <Col N="1063" /> of Irish spirit rather than &ldquo;Irish association.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With regard to this particular section, for obvious reasons the 1935 Act avoided definition.  I would say the reasons were, first, the impracticability of a clear-cut definition and, secondly, that the Government of that day were satisfied that the Minister for Justice, in interpreting the meaning of the expression &ldquo;Irish association,&rdquo; would act within the normal bounds of reasonableness as we know it legally and as a prudent man might.  There is no suggestion that this particular section will go any further than to give the Minister, as Ministers have under much of our legislation, a discriminatory power in relation to certain discretionary positions.  If there were some limitation to that, I think we would have infinitely more criticism from the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Let us see how the Act will work and how the interpretation of this section works out before we try to spancel it with difficulties that might be insurmountable afterwards in the normal legislation pattern.  It is not an easy thing to define.  That is common case. Why try and define it?  Why not, rather, allow the individual circumstances of each case and the examination of the circumstances of each case to be the yardstick by which the Minister will assess whether or not there is what could normally be interpreted as &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo; there?</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran may be making a successful debating argument but I think the practical approach to this matter is that it gives a flexibility that is necessary &mdash; one which can be safeguarded by the fact that we do not believe it would be possible ever for somebody to hold the responsibility of Minister for Justice and have the mentality that could stretch to the extended circumstances suggested by Deputy Moran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the explanations that have been given by the Minister and by the Attorney-General. There is no use in saying in 1956 that because something was written into an Act of Parliament in <Col N="1064" /> 1935 we should just swallow it without any examination or without trying to define something quite clearly.  This Bill is to carry out the terms of the Constitution.  In 1935, the Constitution was very different.  That was prior to the present Constitution.  I agree with the Attorney-General that the type of person he alluded to should be entitled to the grant of a certificate of naturalisation even though he does not fulfil all the qualifications that are in Section 16.  I agree also that the Minister should be empowered to grant a person who served in the Irish Army a certificate without fulfilling all the conditions of Section 16.  Parliamentary draftsmanship has improved very much in the past 21 years.  All one has to do is to compare the drafting of this particular Bill with the 1935 Act or to see how Acts prior to that time were drafted.  There has been an improvement. I think it is not beyond the wit of a parliamentary draftsman to cite a few cases or types of cases that would be entitled to this treatment rather than go through the roundabouts of Section 15.</P>
      <P>We have in Section 12 a ready-made provision that the President may grant Irish citizenship as a token of honour to a person or to the child or grandchild of a person who, in the opinion of the Government, has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation.  When a person has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation the Government are empowered to grant, through the instrumentality of the President and with all due formality, a certificate of naturalisation.  I think that, really, the types of cases the Minister has in mind and those alluded to by the Attorney-General could, if all went to all, be dealt with under Section 12.  If the Minister wants to put that into Section 16, I think he could get his staff and the parliamentary draftsman to give him a list of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now 21 years' experience of operating a Citizenship Act here. Before that we had no such experience. During those 21 years practically all the types of cases have occurred that are likely to occur in the future.  We are anxious at this stage, in adopting <Col N="1065" /> what is a really permanent bit of legislation about citizenship that may not be changed for a great number of years, to see it clearcut and defined, so that everyone will know where he stands.  I do not think the Dáil will be anxious that this certificate of citizenship should become a mere question of application to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider between now and the Report Stage whether he could not break down the various types of cases to which he wants it to apply.  I do not mind if it is in rather general wording such as the very general wording that is in Section 12 &ldquo;a person... has done signal honour or rendered distinguished service to the nation.&rdquo;  It may be a phrase of that kind to the effect that a person has given service of an economic nature or in any other way to the nation.  I am sure the Minister's staff, in association with the parliamentary draftsman, if put to this job between now and the date on which we discuss this on the Report Stage, will bring something in that will be more satisfactory than this form of section.</P>

      <P>As this sub-section stands it would have the result that a woman born in Ireland who lost her citizenship, by reason of acquiring her husband's alien citizenship and living permanently abroad, would regain Irish citizenship as from the passing of the Act.

      <P>To retain sub-section (2) of Section 23 would tend to cast doubt on the Irish citizenship of persons born in Ireland who lost their Irish citizenship under Section 21 of the Act of 1935 on acquiring another citizenship.

      <P>On Section 26, does the Minister see any difficulty where the Dáil has already approved of an agreement with another country, providing for an exchange of citizenship rights?  Although the Dáil has passed that particular agreement it is still left with power to reject one of the sections of the agreement.  Notwithstanding the fact that the agreement may have been approved by the Dáil the part granting reciprocal rights will not in fact become operative under this section until the Dáil passes another resolution.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill is a further step in the direction of allowing the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 to expire. It re-enacts the provisions of the current Orders relating to tea made under that Act, the effect of which is to prohibit (a) commercial importation of tea by any person other than Tea Importers Limited, and (b) wholesale dealing in tea by any person who is not the holder of a tea wholesaler's licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Deputies will wish that I should indicate the circumstances that gave rise to these Orders.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1939 war the bulk of the tea consumed in this country was purchased in, and imported from, London. On the outbreak of war the distribution of tea was controlled by the British Ministry of Food, which promised that this country would be given its due proportion of the available supplies for which there was an unanswerable case in view of the prewar practice.  The British Ministry of Food failed to implement this promise and in consequence from the early months of 1941 there was an acute shortage of tea in this country which involved the community in serious hardship.  In order that this hardship might be relieved so far as possible Tea Importers Limited, a State sponsored non-profit-making company, was set up in April, 1941, for the purpose of purchasing and importing from every available source supplies of tea to supplement the meagre allocation from Great Britain.  The company's purchases were financed from a bank overdraft guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, and their efforts were successful, resulting in appreciable additions to the weekly tea ration when most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> At the end of 1946 the Governments of India and Ceylon took action which precluded the British Ministry of Food from purchasing tea for re-export and this country was duly advised by that Ministry that all allocations from London would cease as from the 1st April, 1947.  Production of tea in 1947 was still substantially lower than demand necessitating the continuance of rationing here and elsewhere.  In the circumstances arrangements for the importation of our tea requirements from origin had to be brought into operation as a matter of urgency.  At that time the total production of tea had not caught up on world demand and it was considered highly undesirable that there should be competition for the limited supplies available between Irish buyers with the necessary financial resources to operate on their own account on the Calcutta and Colombo markets.</P>
    <P>It was also considered necessary at that time to ensure that the smaller Irish wholesaler was not placed at any disadvantage in securing a fair share of the available supplies at reasonable prices.  Accordingly, in agreement with the wholesale tea trade it was decided that for the time being Tea Importers, Limited, should be the sole purchasing agency as from the 1st April, 1947.  It was also decided at that time to restrict the issue of licences authorising the carrying on of a wholesale tea business to concerns which were conducting all the operations of a bona fide tea wholesale business from premises located in this country as it was considered that the admission of external wholesalers would increase the cost of tea to the consumer by introducing an unnecessary additional link in the chain of distribution.</P>
    <P>A subsidy to keep down the retail price of tea was introduced on the 1st November, 1947, and this development was an additional reason for maintaining Tea Importers Limited as the sole importer of tea.</P>
    <P>Up to 1950 world production of tea continued to fall short of demand and as the tea issued by Tea Importers Limited was heavily subsidised there was no incentive to any individual <Col N="1071" /> trader to import tea on his own account.  But in 1950 there was an improvement in the world supply position which enabled Tea Importers Limited to put on sale unrationed tea at a price which yielded a profit which was offset against the subsidy.  These developments provided the incentive to the individual trader to endeavour to obtain supplies of tea outside this country for sale at the unrationed price thereby depriving the Exchequer of the benefit of the profit which would otherwise accrue from sales made by Tea Importers Limited. Accordingly it was decided to prohibit commercial imports of tea except under licence and to restrict the issue of such licences to Tea Importers Limited.</P>
    <P>Following abolition of the tea subsidy and tea rationing in July, 1952, consideration was given to the question of restoring freedom to the trade to purchase and import this country's tea requirements subject to direct importation from the producing countries. Proposals made in this connection by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association for the replacement of Tea Importers Limited and involving continuance of the prohibition of commercial imports of tea except under licence have been under examination, but progress has been slow because of the complexities and uncertainties of the general tea situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the fact that the proposals made by the association contemplated retention of the restrictions on commercial imports of tea it is recognised that the absence of these restrictions would involve Tea Importers Limited in serious risk of being unable to dispose, without loss, of heavy stocks of tea purchased for supply to the wholesale trade with bank advances guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Early in 1955 when the question of the purchases of 1955 season tea was under review the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association made representations to the effect that the arrangements whereby Tea Importers Limited purchased and imported this country's tea requirements should not be discontinued <Col N="1072" /> earlier than December, 1956. It was pointed out by the association that the bulk of the demand in this country is for Indian tea, and they represented that on account of the seasonal nature of the Indian tea market it would not be possible for the successors of Tea Importers Limited to commence to land before December of the year in which it was bought sufficient suitable quality Indian tea to meet the full demand.  I agreed that the company should continue to be responsible for securing our tea requirements for a further period.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the company to continue to discharge this responsibility until arrangements of a permanent nature can be brought into operation it will be necessary to maintain the present controls on the importation and wholesale distribution of tea.  This is the sole purpose of the Bill, the life of which it is proposed to restrict to a maximum of two years. It is anticipated that a period of two years will be sufficient to enable arrangements to be made for putting the importation and distribution of tea on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to give favourable consideration to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday on the Supplies and Services Bill that this Government does not know what it is doing, and the introduction of this Bill here to-day as a matter of urgency is proof that that is so.  The Parliamentary Secretary has explained that this Bill is required to continue in operation the regulations relating to the importation of tea made under the Supplies and Services Act, but yesterday the Dáil agreed that the Supplies and Services Act should continue for another year.  The implication, therefore, is that this Bill was prepared on the assumption that the Supplies and Services Act would lapse at the end of March.  But it is not going to lapse at the end of March; it is going to continue until 1957 and, certainly, there is no obvious reason why the Dáil should be asked to deal with this Bill here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only conclusion to be drawn from the introduction of this Bill and <Col N="1073" /> the announcement that it will remain in operation for two years is that no change is to be made over that period in the measures that were adopted during the emergency for the importation of tea.  I think that is a most unsatisfactory situation.  I think we should try to get away as quickly as possible from these emergency restrictions on trade, that the trade in tea should be put back as soon as possible into the hands of private traders.  The implication of the introduction of the Bill is that that is not going to happen for some years to come.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that the wholesale Tea Dealers' Association asked that no change should be made in the arrangement until September of this year.  That attitude of the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association arises probably from the financial condition of Tea Importers, Limited, at the present time, but it is obvious that the Minister is preparing to keep these arrangements in operation long after the date mentioned by the Wholesalers' Association &mdash; September, 1956 &mdash; because if it was intended to change these arrangements before September, 1956, this Bill would not be necessary.  The regulations in the Supplies and Services Act would continue in force until then.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that a decision was taken by me in 1952 to restore the tea trade to private enterprise.  I informed the Dáil of that decision; I told the House that legislation would be introduced to continue the practice which had developed of importing tea direct from the country of origin and eliminating the British middle-men who previously got a rake-off on our tea purchases.  I told the House also that the arrangements which would operate in regard to future tea imports were being discussed with the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association and that proposals made by them which appeared to be acceptable in principle would probably involve legislation.  I held out the prospect that the measure would be introduced and in operation before the buying season of 1954.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is correct in saying that any change in the arrangements for tea imports must <Col N="1074" /> begin to operate in or around September because otherwise there might be a hiatus in tea purchases which would cause difficulty in maintaining supplies here.  I am not criticising the Minister because he did not find it possible to proceed in 1954 with the legislation which had been prepared then but I would at least have expected him to have had his mind made up by now about what he was going to do, and all the indications in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement are that the Minister has not made up his mind and is therefore taking the easy course of allowing these emergency arrangements to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>The importation of tea through Tea Importers, Limited, and the centralising of purchases through that organisation was justifiable in the circumstances that prevailed at the time Tea Importers, Limited, was set up after the war, but it carried with it some obvious disadvantages.  In effect, it limited trade in tea to those who were engaged in it then and precluded the possibility of new entrants to the trade, or of people developing from secondary to primary wholesalers. The Parliamentary Secretary need not advance to this House as justification for continuing the present arrangements the fact that their continuance has the temporary approval of the Tea Wholesalers' Association.</P>
    <P>It is not likely that there is among some of the members of that association a great deal of enthusiasm for the possibility of a situation being created in which new entrants can come into the trade and in which their present stabilised and secure positions may be interfered with.  It is true that the arrangements which were discussed in principle with the Tea Wholesalers' Association in 1953 contemplated the replacement of Tea Importers, Limited, by another centralised purchasing organisation established by the trade, in the operation of which the State would have no part and in the financing of which the State would not participate, and the making of an effort through that association to develop here a tea market such as exists in London.  But these arrangements provided that anybody could <Col N="1075" /> acquire shares in that co-operative importing organisation and enjoy through the acquisition of these shares the same rights, same privileges and same responsibilities as any other trader.</P>
    <P>The proposals of the Wholesalers' Association, as they were submitted following a vote among the members of that body, were not completely acceptable to the then Government in the form in which they came to us. They were, of course, prepared primarily for the purpose of securing the developments in the tea trade which the tea traders themselves desired.  But in some way they appeared to imply restrictions which would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions it became clear that changes could be made in these proposals which would make them unobjectionable from the point of view of the Government and the public. They were accepted in principle by the Fianna Fáil Government and legislation was, as I informed the Dáil, in course of preparation.  That legislation would have been primarily directed to continuation of the practice of direct importation of tea and secondarily to the carrying into effect of the proposals of the Wholesale Tea Traders' Association as approved. That has all gone by the board.  Why? I am quite certain that any reluctance by the Tea Wholesalers' Association to proceed with the proposals they made in 1953 must be due to some circumstances which developed in the meantime. It is quite easy to know what these developments are.  The arrangements were that this new importing organisation would take over the assets and liabilities of Tea Importers, Limited.  The liabilities have increased enormously since then and one can understand the reluctance of private traders to take them over.  The Government have created a problem by their mishandling of the whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And as Deputy Cunningham says, it will take two years to put that right.  The emergency Order made under the Supplies and <Col N="1076" /> Services Act for the regulation of tea was hastily drafted and not designed to provide the safeguards which should exist in permanent legislation.  It had relation to circumstances in which the practicability of anybody importing tea on a regular basis was not very great. There is obvious objection to continuing in a permanent form that hastily drafted Order.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said one of the purposes of this Bill is to continue the position in which the sole importer will be Tea Importers Limited.  That is not in the Bill and I invite any Deputy to see if he can find in it any expression of that intention.</P>
      <P>What is in the Bill is that the Minister may give to anybody he likes, and absolutely at his discretion, a licence to import tea and, absolutely at his discretion again, to take that licence away without notice or compensation. That is the power the Minister is proposing to take about importation of tea in the future.  He is proposing to bring under his absolute control powers which will enable him to deal ruthlessly, without consulting the Dáil, with the trade.  As far as the importation of tea is concerned what is in the Bill is that at his absolute discretion he can give a licence to anybody to import tea and take it away as easily.</P>
      <P>As far as the second group of traders &mdash;the wholesalers, whether they are importers or not, and they are not at the moment because all tea is imported by Tea Importers Limited &mdash; are concerned the wording of this Bill is completely unsatisfactory.  A person may apply for a wholesaler's licence provided he is an Irish citizen resident in Ireland and provided that person is in a company registered in Ireland, no matter who comprises the company or what nationality the people who comprise the company are.  The third category is a partnership, the members of which may be of any nationality.  If an individual wants a wholesaler's licence he has to be an Irish citizen, but if he cannot qualify all he needs is a partner in a company who may be a Chinaman as far as the Bill is concerned. But so long as there is a partnership the eligibility to obtain a wholesaler's licence exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> As I have said, it is quite obvious this was a very hastily drafted Bill, based entirely on an emergency Order and that very little serious consideration was given to the arrangements that should exist in the tea trade.  I said yesterday that the Supplies and Services Act gives to the Government powers they should not seek to retain in present circumstances and conditions. The Fianna Fáil Government recognised that and decided to end these powers in 1954.  Among the changes that would have to be made following upon the cessation of the Supplies and Services Act were those affecting the trade in tea.  Arrangements to make these changes were contemplated and were announced.</P>
    <P>The Dáil at that time, including many members of the Fine Gael Party, were pressing for changes in relation to the trade in tea.  They were urging that there should be no delay in restoring freedom to private enterprise in that trade and the Fianna Fáil Government recognised the need for that and were taking the necessary steps to achieve it, subject only to the overriding consideration of public policy which I then announced &mdash; the question of direct importation of tea and the bringing into operation of a system which would ensure that the importation of tea would be done by the most economical methods, by arrangements which would, nevertheless, leave it open to anybody who desired to do so to get into that trade.  The proposal was to relinquish completely the emergency control of the trade and to enable it to develop in a normal way.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any explanation for the delay in proceeding along these or similar lines other than gross incompetence and apparently that incompetence is to continue for another two years.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say why this Bill is necessary at all?  The Supplies and Services Act is continuing in operation.  The Order made under that Act will continue until 1957.  If there is any serious intention to comply with the wishes of the tea wholesalers, this Bill is not necessary because presumably before then the Order under the Act will have been <Col N="1078" /> revoked or some new legislation will have been submitted to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government would make up their minds what they are trying to do in this sphere and in other spheres.  They are leaving the people of the country guessing.  Should we not have on this Bill some statement by a responsible Minister of the general intentions of the Government in regard to the future of the tea trade, apart altogether from any details of the arrangements designed to make that intention effective?  It may not be possible to extract from any members of the Government a series of detailed proposals in relation to tea, but they should know what they are hoping to do eventually when they get round to thinking about doing something. The mere announcement that the present unsatisfactory arrangements, designed in an emergency to deal solely with emergency conditions, are to continue is not enough.  The Dáil should refuse to agree to the continuation of these arrangements.  We should force the Government to shake the lead out of their pants and produce some definite proposals relating to this trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this Bill proposes to continue the present system of importing tea, or permits the continuation of the system, I approve of it and support it.  It is actually a fact that the wholesale tea dealers have begun to think twice about the proposals which were very nearly brought to the stage of action before Deputy Lemass left office.  I think a number of people in the tea trade are now becoming afraid that they were carving a stick which could subsequently be used to beat themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the tea trade is that every year 25,000,000 lb. of tea are imported. That tea was always bought at a very fair price; some of it was bought in London, some in the East and some in Amsterdam.  That is the history of the trade.  I think then, at one stage, what happened was that a number of people began to eye this 25,000,000 lb. of tea and they asked themselves: &ldquo;Could we get our hands on to the control of tea imports?&rdquo; People who had not been particularly <Col N="1079" /> interested before then began to take a real interest in the tea trade.  A curious feature of that interest was that a few prominent members in the tea trade became bank directors; it would require a great deal of capital to get into this projected future scheme and one would want to be able to talk in a very big way in the matter of money. By the way, they used a patriotic device; they said it was very wrong for us to buy tea in London because of what the British had done to us in the past.  I always become suspicious when I find the bankers or the big money operators waving the green flag; I have a kind of feeling they are not waving it for death or glory.  They are thinking of other things.</P>
    <P>The scheme evolved into a very definite possibility up to 1954, when something upset the apple cart.  They very nearly had the job done.  I confess quite frankly now that I have not been successful in convincing our Minister that the proposal held a great deal of danger for the Irish people; I think it does.  The Irish people are great tea drinkers.  They like good tea and certain tea dealers, like myself, who have spent their lives in the business, without making a great deal of money out of it, have learned a great deal about the article and take a certain pride in the quality of what we sell.  If this importing organisation, composed of a bunch of boys who were going to whoop it up over the people's teapots, was successful, inevitably, if that canalising took place and that narrow source of entry was put into the hands of these particular operators, the filling of the Irish teapot would be a more costly business in the future. Possibly it might be very hard to prevent that and I think it would be a very serious thing to permit any such canalising of supplies that we do not produce here ourselves.  I think alternative markets should be availed of and people should be permitted to buy tea in London and Amsterdam as well as in Calcutta.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Lemass is right in his contention that the English dealer has been taking a rake-off, to my knowledge that rake-off has been a very <Col N="1080" /> small one and, on the whole, a very fair one, certainly up to 1939.  Remember, we had the advantage of buying in the world's biggest tea market.  It is not quite as big now, but the British dominated the tea production business because they consume some 700,000,000 lb. and the Indian output is 1,000,000,000 lb.  They are the dominant factor and their market is a market in which one can always buy excellent value.  If the big tea importing group, which was hoping to get control of our supplies, were faced with the possibility that other smaller groups were allowed under licence to buy on the London or Dutch market, if the Dutch East Indies comes into production again, that would all the time be a check, and I think a very desirable check, on prices and relevant to the upholding of the consumers' interests.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lemass was Minister, he proved that one could do things occasionally on the London market which were very valuable because, as I have said on a few occasions here, when Tea Importers Limited had a lot of tea that had been bought unluckily &mdash;I will put it that way; at any rate on the basis of current market prices&mdash; Deputy Lemass permitted them to go to the London market to buy teas there.  They bought a fine parcel of tea at a very reasonable price.  That declension in tea prices operates very valuably in markets like the London market.  Deputy Lemass permitted them to import 2,000,000 lb. at something like 1/2¼ per lb. on an average. The Irish consumer had to pay nearly 4/- per lb. for that 1/2¼ tea.  Now I have already said here that I know that that is an unfair way of putting the case but, in essence, it is true.  At any rate, from that day forward no tea was sold by Tea Importers Limited cheaper than 3/- a lb.  That was the price they charged the secondary wholesalers.</P>
    <P>At the very lowest estimation, that tea could not get into the consumers' hands much under 4/- or 4/6 per lb., and it had cost 1/2¼.  Of course, it was very sensibly used to leaven the high-priced tea held when the market had broken, and that is why I think it is a decidedly good thing to have access <Col N="1081" /> to as many markets as possible and to all the people who are entitled to trade.  I am not sure that I have convinced this Minister that that is a desirable thing, but I certainly intend to go on trying.</P>
    <P>The Bill is harmless enough.  It does nothing except maintain the <i>status quo,</i> and I am satisfied with the Bill for that reason.  I am satisfied because the Government has again postponed &mdash; I hope as a result of my representations, but I think as a result of the representations of much more prominent people in the tea trade than I am &mdash; the idea of making any change.  It might be wiser if we thought again over this scheme through which the bank-directors-cum-tea-mearchants were going to take over control of the import of tea from the Far East, with the tricolour flying bravely over the masthead.  When the patriotic reason is used to create a monopoly and when something is supposedly done in the name of the country, it becomes nauseating.  But that is what happens.</P>
    <P>There is an Englishman, a buyer in the tea trade in this country.  He is a very successful buyer.  He has been here for the last 20 years and he is now a director of his firm.  In a broad Lancashire accent he said: &ldquo;It is intolerable that we should have to buy tea in London.  We should go to the East.&rdquo;  Now he was a member of one of the groups which could put up a great deal of money; and one has to have money to get in on the ground floor.  If one does not get in on the ground floor, one would have as much chance as the very ordinary small dealer has now.</P>
    <P>There are a number of tea merchants all over the country.  The best of them are not very big financially.  They are very proud of what they sell and of the skill they use in the buying and selling of that commodity.  They are proud of their access to the London market and their access, to some extent, to the East.  If this change is made, they feel their future in the trade will be a limited one and their skill will not be as vital or as important in the practice of the trade.  I have rejected the status of primary wholesaler because I <Col N="1082" /> could not afford to buy tea on Civil Service invoice prices and I have put myself in the position of being a secondary wholesaler, and I buy on sample.</P>
    <P>I am very proud that I am able to do that.  I do it very successfully, I believe, and I have a very good business. The system has grown up whereby tea is regarded just as an article that earns money, and nobody bothers about the quality.  Some of the people concerned in this tea import set-up know a good deal about costs and profits, but they know nothing whatever about tea.  As to some of the men prominent in the tea business for the last ten years, I am sure that if I put a number of samples of tea before those men and asked them to grade it they would not be able to do so.  That has no interest for them.  Their interests are in prices and profits.  As the Bill does not do any harm, I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been let down and, therefore, finds it necessary to come into the House with a Bill like this.  He has found that the people in the tea business were not prepared to take over the position that now exists in Tea Importers, Limited. Due to the action he has taken, there is the position now that nobody wants to handle the business.  He now finds that, in order to remedy the situation, it is necessary for him to have a period of two years to do it.  When I first read this Bill I expected that the tea trade was going to be handed back to private enterprise; that we were going to get rid of the controls which exist. We find, however, that the Bill means something different from what it says. We believe that all that is intended by the Bill is to continue the present situation.</P>
      <P>For instance in Section 3 it states that no person shall import tea except in accordance with a tea import licence issued to that person.  Now we find that it is not the intention of the Minister to issue any tea import licences except to the one body.  Again, the section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister can grant or refuse such licence and he may attach <Col N="1083" /> certain conditions to such import licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister when he is replying why it is necessary that in sub-section (4) to attach conditions to a tea import licence.  The section further provides that a tea licence shall not be transferable and that the Minister may revoke a licence. All this seems to be superfluous in the light of the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his introductory speech said in effect that there was going to be no change.  That came as a surprise to me and to others who have read this Bill or the gist of it as published in the Press.  There are many people in this country who had, pre-war, been in the tea trade and who for some reason or other, were not in it during the war and are not in it now, but who would like to get back into it.  They will be surprised at the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary because they had hoped that it might be possible to get more people and more competition in the trade than is the case at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are regulations concerning the wholesale distribution of tea and whereas one would have thought on reading this Bill that a change was proposed, we are now surprised to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that there will be no change.  I know of cases of people who were in the tea business, but were resident at the time outside the State and who are now living in the State, and nothing will be done for these people.</P>
    <P>Again supposing that the provisions of this Bill were to be applied in permanent legislation, many of us could hardly agree to them because we have here a classification of the types or grades of persons or bodies who can engage in the business of wholesale distribution of tea.  In the first instance we have &ldquo;(a) citizens of Ireland normally resident in the State.&rdquo; That is all right as far as we are concerned, but &ldquo;a body incorporated in the State&rdquo; is a provision that could create difficulties.  In view of the <Col N="1084" /> Parliamentary Secretary's statement these matters do not arise immediately, because the proposal is in fact that that nobody except those already in the business will be admitted.  It will not make any difference now.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a proposal in this Bill that a body incorporated in the State can engage in the wholesale distribution of tea.  Was it necessary to have these things in the Bill?  I think it was not and that the Bill was not necessary at all.  The provisions of the Supplies and Services Bill which received final sanction yesterday, would I think be sufficient.  It could be extended for a further year if, at the end of 1956, the Minister for Industry and Commerce found that he had not the present muddle straightened out by that time.  It may be that the Minister for Industry and Commerce expects that there will be no Supplies and Services Bill next year, that sufficient permanent legislation will have been introduced in the meantime, and that all the regulations and Orders embodied in the Supply and Services Bill will have been embodied in the permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I think that it would be necessary merely to bring in a Bill to extend for one year only the matter dealt with here.  That is something which we would like to see in permanent legislation.  There is the partnership of two or more persons, with which Deputy Lemass has dealt; one may be, as he says, a Chinaman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <P>As a result of this Bill, there is dissatisfaction among the public and in the trade itself that the present situation in regard to the distribution of tea is to continue.  It is no wonder that Deputy Barry said that <Col N="1085" /> when the tea trade went into this they found that they were carving a stick with which to beat themselves.</P>

      <P>What did they find?  Did they find that there was a bit of a muddle or a liability that they were not prepared to take up?  The other thing that may have caused it was that they found it was in their own interests to have the present set-up as it now exists.  That is probably something that led them to say to the Minister: &ldquo;O.K., go ahead.  We are prepared to trade under existing conditions for another two years.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday there was great opposition to the passage of the Supply and Services Bill and Opposition speakers said that there should be permanent legislation where it was necessary.  This Bill is one step further towards bringing in that permanent legislation.  It has been brought in to allow the Supplies and Services Act to expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We continued it yesterday but this Bill has to be brought in until these matters are placed under permanent legislation.  This Bill is a step towards that permanent legislation. The Minister requires power to control the import of tea because he is insisting that it be bought in the countries of origin.  When Tea Importers were consulted about it, it was their desire that the control of imports would not be handed back to them until they were able to make better arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had they been allowed to purchase in Mincing Lane or in other wholesale markets they would have been able to make these arrangemens.  There had to be arrangements made so that the small wholesalers would not be at a disadvantage and so that the whole trade would not fall into the hands of a few large wholesalers.  From that point of view, they had to continue on the present arrangements until they were able to make better arrangements. <Col N="1086" /> This Bill is brought in for that purpose, to carry on the present arrangements for two years, so that when enough of other Bills have been passed there will be no necessity for a continuance of the Supplies and Services Act.  This is continuing the present arrangements until at the end of two years permanent measures can be arrived at in consultation with the wholesalers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Before opening my statement on this Bill I would like to draw attention to Deputy Lemass in his new role as the busy bee of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We might as well have a quorum while you are doing that.</P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just referring to Deputy Lemass in his new role of busy bee.  No Deputy in this House knows better than he that the process of tying up the loose ends which will exist in the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act is a lengthy one and the Bill to which I propose the House <Col N="1087" /> should give a Second Reading now is another of the many statutes which have to be enacted in order to make it possible to terminate the operation of the Supplies and Services Act without causing serious dislocation.  I know that when the Deputy wants to assume the role, not only of the busy bee, but of the efficient busy bee, he likes to make out and impress on the public that there is some lack of efficiency or expedition in this matter.</P>
      <P>We all know the Fianna Fáil approach to these matters.  It is to let the so-and-so's suffer provided Deputy Lemass is blameless.  This Government takes the more rational view that it ought to take every conceivable precaution to avoid any unnecessary inconvenience by precipitate action.  Our aim is to get the necessary legislation passed through this House so that we will not discover, when the Supplies and Services Act lapses, that some things which require to be done cannot be done because we have not the power to do them.  Deputy Lemass's approach is that we should abolish the existing legislation and, whenever some misfortune arises, come into Dáil Éireann pressing for the urgent passage of further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that if you come in and ask for the urgent passage of urgent legislation you are confronted with Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Burke, from Balbriggan, blathering away until you are weary listening to them and nothing happens.  We are taking the simple precaution of allowing the legislation under the emergency Supplies and Services Acts to survive until we have all the Bills of this character submitted to Dáil Éireann for its approval.  I am going to open a Bill and it deals with a very tiny segment of the total volume of Orders made under the Supplies and Services Act.  I think when Deputies hear my statement upon it they will realise that each of the provisions that I seek to preserve in the permanent law is very necessary for the orderly procedure of the dairying industry and that if any of them, by an oversight, were allowed to lapse without a permanent <Col N="1088" /> legislative substitute adopted by Dáil Éireann you could do great damage.  Now, of course, we in Dáil Éireann might not feel the pinch but the unfortunate farmers down the country might feel it.  Is there anything wrong in this Government saying: &ldquo;Anxious as we are to substitute permanent legislation for the Supplies and Services procedure, we are not so anxious that we are prepared to kick a small uninfluential minority of vulnerable people all over the place in order to soothe the restless conscience of the busy bee?&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, particularly if the humming of the busy bees is for a moment suspended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the aim of both the present and the previous Governments that arrangements should be made for the incorporation in permanent legislation of such controls operated under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Acts as are proper for permanent retention.  In pursuance of this mutually agreed policy, the Bill now before the House is introduced for the purpose of incorporating into the framework of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts the provisions of seven emergency powers Orders relating to dairy produce or the power to make by Order similar provisions if such are required at any time in the future.  There are no new matters of principle in the Bill.  These seven Orders in question (five of which are still in operation) relate to the borrowing powers of the Butter Marketing Committee, the payment out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund of certain allowances on creamery butter and other dairy produce, the distribution of creamery butter in the Dublin or other specified area, the fixing of maximum wholesale prices for creamery butter and for imported butter and the restriction on the use <Col N="1089" /> of creamery butter other than for household purposes.</P>
    <P>The first of the emergency powers Orders covered by the Bill is the Emergency Powers (No. 283) Order, 1943, which relates to the borrowing powers of the Butter Marketing Committee. The committee is a central marketing organisation operating under rules approved by the Minister for Agriculture under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) (Amendment) Act, 1941.  It is the only such central marketing organisation under the Act and its present functions cover the cold storage of creamery butter for winter use, the supplying of the creamery butter requirements of the Dublin and Bray areas, the import of butter as and when required to meet casual shortages and the export from time to time of surplus creamery butter.  So that it may fulfil the functions of arranging for the storage of creamery butter for winter use, the committee borrows the necessary capital from its bankers during the summer months and repays the money during the winter months according as it sells off the butter.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1941 provides that the Minister for Agriculture, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may guarantee the repayment of these borrowings but the Act limits to £500,000 the amount the repayment of which may be so guaranteed.  By the year 1943, experience had shown that a sum of £500,000 was not sufficient to enable the committee to finance its purchases of butter for cold storage and so, in those difficult days, recourse was had to Emergency Powers Order to amend the Act by increasing to £2,000,000 the amount of the borrowings the repayment of which could be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the position is that due to the increasing value of butter, the committee has found it necessary to obtain temporary bank overdrafts in excess of the guaranteed figure of £2,000,000, the excess being secured by private arrangement between the committee and its bankers but at a higher rate of interest than that applicable to the guaranteed portion of the borrowing. As it is highly desirable that the <Col N="1090" /> full amount of the committee's overdraft should be secured at the most favourable rate of interest obtainable, it is proposed in this Bill to increase from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 the amount of its borrowings the repayment of which can be guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>The Second Emergency Powers Order involved is the Emergency Powers (No. 270) Order, 1943.  The Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts enable the Minister for Agriculture to pay out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund contributions towards any approved scheme for the regulation of the sale of butter or any milk product. When it was decided in 1943 to subsidise the home-market price of creamery butter by means of allowances on production and cold storage of the butter, the Act was amended by Emergency Powers Order to enable such allowances to be paid out of the Fund.  The position still is that allowances are paid on production and cold storage of creamery butter and, in addition, allowances are now being paid on sales of such butter.  As long as subsidisation of creamery butter is continued, whether on its cold storage, its production or its sale, it is necessary that the power should be retained to enable any moneys available in the Fund from time to time to be utilised for that purpose in reduction of the amount which otherwise would have to be provided by the Exchequer. Accordingly, the Bill proposes to make permanent the relative amendment of the Acts which has been operated by the Emergency Powers Order since 1943.</P>
    <P>The third Emergency Powers Order, the provisions of which are incorporated in the Bill, is the butter (Control in Scheduled Area) Order, 1952.  During the years in which the domestic consumption of creamery butter was rationed, special arrangements had to be made to provide for the regular supply of the rationed requirements of butter in the Dublin and Bray areas, where, due to the large population and the consequential heavy supplies of butter involved, distribution arrangements could not be effected as easily as in other areas of smaller population.  To meet the situation, <Col N="1091" /> the supply of butter to the Dublin and Bray areas was, by Emergency Powers Order, canalised through the Butter Marketing Committee.  When butter rationing was abolished in July, 1952, the previous Government decided that all the then existing functions of the Butter Marketing Committee, including that relating to the supply of creamery butter in the Dublin and Bray areas, should be continued.  I see no reason now for altering this arrangement which has worked so satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Two other Emergency Powers Orders covered in the Bill are those relating to the maximum wholesale prices of creamery butter sold in bulk and in rolls.  The particular Orders at present in operation are the Creamery Butter and Butter Boxes Order, 1954, and the Roll Butter Order, 1954, but the general pattern of these Orders, varying only in regard to the level of prices prescribed, has remained unchanged since the early 1940s.  The Dairy Produce (Prices Stabilisation) Act, 1935, empowers the Minister for Agriculture to prescribe by Order maximum prices at which any specified class of butter may be sold wholesale but such Orders may relate only to the prices charged by the manufacturer of the butter.  In the case of creamery butter, therefore, the Act enables maximum prices to be prescribed only in relation to the sale by a creamery of butter of its own make.  It does not cover the price at which creameries may sell butter purchased from other creameries or from the Butter Marketing Committee, nor does it cover the price of creamery butter sold by wholesalers to retailers.</P>
    <P>When it first became necessary in 1940 to control the maximum retail price of creamery butter, it was also necessary to control the profit margins of wholesalers and retailers.  To do this, recourse had to be had to emergency powers to prescribe by Order maximum prices for all creamery butter sold by wholesale, whether the sale was effected by creameries to wholesalers, by creameries to retailers or by wholesalers to retailers.  As the maximum retail price of creamery butter is <Col N="1092" /> still controlled, the intermediate prices of the butter between the creamery and the retailer must continue to be fixed. The power to make such detailed prices Orders under the Act is, therefore, being included in the Bill in substitution for the similar powers at present operated by Emergency Powers Orders.  The latter Orders also contained provision for the compulsory return of empty timber butter boxes to creameries and the Bill proposes to retain this provision.</P>
    <P>Another Emergency Powers Order covered in the Bill is the Imported Butter (Maximum Wholesale Prices) Order, 1954.  In regard to this Order, which is not now in operation, emergency powers had to be invoked because the scope of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts was not sufficiently wide to enable maximum prices to be prescribed under those Acts for imported butter sold by wholesale. While I hope that it may not be found necessary in the future to import supplementary supplies of butter, nevertheless it is only prudent that the power to prescribe prices for imported butter should be retained in permanent legislation in case the need for the fixing of such prices should ever again arise.</P>
    <P>The remaining Emergency Powers Order which has been incorporated in the Bill is the Emergency Powers (Restriction on Use of Creamery Butter) Order, 1942.  This Order was in operation from June, 1942, to November, 1954.  It prohibited the buying, selling or use of creamery butter for any purpose other than ordinary household use except under a permit granted by the Minister for Agriculture.  It was originally made for the purpose of conserving stocks of creamery butter when butter rationing was introduced, but in later years was availed of for the purpose of recovering from users of creamery butter for manufacturing purposes, the amount of State subsidy involved in the butter so used.  The method under which this was operated was that on payment of a prescribed fee by the applicants, permits were granted under the Order for the use of specified quantities of creamery butter for manufacture of <Col N="1093" /> fruit cake, confectionery, short-bread, etc.</P>
    <P>The fee, which was fixed at a rate per cwt. of butter covered by the permit, was determined by the Minister for Finance under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, and represented the cost to the State of cold storage of the butter together with the amount of the subsidy payable on the production and sale of the butter by creameries.  As it may in the future be found necessary to re-introduce the system of issue of permits authorising the use of creamery butter for manufacturing purposes and to arrange for the collection of permit fees, it is proposed in the Bill to make permanent provision for the making of the necessary restriction Order whenever the need for such an Order would arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to one other minor provision of the Bill.  The opportunity presented by this measure is being taken to make a slight amendment of the Act of 1941 to enable levies to be imposed on stocks of imported butter held by creameries.  The Act already provides for similar levies on butter of all kinds held by butter traders and on stocks of creamery butter held by creameries but it omits to cover imported butter held by creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the pontificating rôle that the Minister assumed before he started the explanation of the contents of this Bill, the purpose for which the Bill was introduced cannot be objected to.  It was very difficult to understand from its terms the purpose of the Bill but we now understand from the Minister's statement that it is to give the force of permanent legislation to Emergency Powers Orders which were already in operation with regard to butter production and the dairying industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not, as was done in the case of other Bills of this nature, give us a Schedule with the Bill, of the various Emergency Powers Orders that are being incorporated in it.  As far as I remember, that was done in the case of other legislation.  Anyone who tried to trace <Col N="1094" /> the various Emergency Powers Order issued from the time such Orders were first introduced up to the present day would be looking for a needle in bundle of straw.  It is a pity that the Minister or his Department did no think of incorporating a Schedule that would give in handy form the name and numbers of the various Emergency Powers Orders that are the subject of this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy to say that the reason there is no Schedule is that we are not repealing any Order; we are allowing the Orders to lapse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have had a list supplied to us on a stencilled sheet or something like that, such as the Minister for Industry and Commerce supplies when he is introducing legislation giving permanent effect to quota Orders.  He circulates sometimes a stencilled leaflet giving particulars of the Orders and the purposes which they served.  That would have been very valuable and helpful to Deputies who are interested in this matter and who are anxious to scrutinise the measure.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the terms of the Bill are unobjectionable and they are a tribute to the legislation that was enacted from time to time since Fianna Fáil took office in 1932, in the interests of the dairying industry &mdash; the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act and the various Emergency Powers Orders made since the passage of the amending Act of 1941 to cover various problems that arose from time to time in regard to the dairying industry and its products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Minister mentioned something about the recent increasing value of butter.  I presume he was referring to the increasing value of butter in external markets.  If that is the position, it is to be welcomed, if there is any sale of butter in external markets.  I notice from figures published yesterday that the sale seems to have gone down very much recently. That is not a welcome piece of news. The position in regard to this industry is, of course, very important for the future of our whole agricultural <Col N="1095" /> activities.  The uncertainty that obtains at the moment in regard to dairying is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be in order on this Bill to refer briefly to some of the requirements of the dairying industry. We have had particular evidence of the position in recent times because of the agitation that has grown up amongst dairy farmers, sponsored by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, because of the delay that there has been in issuing the report of the Costings Commission.  The Minister, of course, has not mentioned this at all in his opening statement.  He has merely explained to us the various provisions incorporated in this measure. It is bad news for the dairying industry that there has been so much delay about the solution of this problem of costings.  I know of course that the Minister has given expression to the view here that this thing is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, the dairy farmers do not think it is.  The Minister should do everything in his power to accede to their oft-repeated request to have the report expedited, whatever the Minister thinks about it personally. He has told us already that he believes that it is all &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and that it will not confer any benefit at all, but the dairy farmers want it and it is only right that that important section of the farming community should know where they stand.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is putting in the form of permanent legislation all these various Emergency Powers Orders that were brought into operation from time to time as necessity dictated, is welcome and there will not be on the part of this Party any objection to the terms of the measure generally.  Perhaps, on further examination and with the explanation the Minister has given us now, there may be points here and there when the Committee Stage comes that we may have to elucidate more thoroughly than we have been able to do up to now in the discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises, I suppose, because of the necessity to amend emergency powers legislation passed since the end of the emergency. <Col N="1096" /> I wonder if the Minister would advert when replying to the fact that all this stabilisation-of-butter legislation applies to the home market, now that we have little or no export market. The question might well be asked whether it is all necessary seeing that we are only supplying the home market with a home product?  What is the cost of regimenting the whole dairying industry for the home market?  I suppose the Minister may have views of his own on that but could we not have more simple legislation in the future unless the Minister can hold out some hope that we will again enter the foreign markets with our butter.</P>
      <P>When the original Act was brought in, it was because of the fact that we had a problem on account of the price that was available in foreign markets at that time.  It represented an effort to get for the producers of butter at that time a fair price, or a price at which they could continue in economic production.  All the legislation since has sprung from that effort.  Whether it will be necessary, seeing that there is no prospect of getting an economic price for our produce in any foreign market, to carry out the same strict regulations about the production of creamery butter in future is something on which the dairy farmers would welcome a statement by the Minister. I am just raising those hares to get the views of the Minister.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Ó Briain pointed out, the Government and the Minister should take an early opportunity of telling the dairy farmers what Government policy is to be in the future in the matter of prices for milk and butter.  The price of milk is not fixed but the price of butter is, and it determines the price the farmers get for the milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Partly; there are additional considerations, you know, of commodities like crumb and other commodities which often earn a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there are these, if we can get a market for chocolate crumb, but the Minister let the chocolate crumb slip through his fingers rather softly.  I mean, the general opinion now is that he could have done <Col N="1097" /> something by way of subventions of one kind or another to help to maintain the chocolate crumb industry. Possibly Comhlucht Siúcra Éireann or somebody else could have helped it because this was a very valuable industry for the country and one which we should not have lost without more of an effort being made on the part of the Government to retain it.  It was a valuable export and a big help to our balance of payments and it was a means of getting rid of some of our milk products at economic prices. Seemingly it was not possible to get an economic market for any of them except through chocolate crumb, sweetened cream or something like that.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister or the Government should tell dairy farmers what Government policy for some time to come will be in regard to the price of milk.  That is absolutely necessary so that they can settle down to produce milk at the best price that can be found for them.  I think that the price stabilisation and marketing of butter and all that to which the Minister was very strongly opposed in the early years&mdash;there is no doubt but that he was strenuously opposed to them&mdash;are accepted now.  He now believes that was a good piece of machinery because he has not found any other ways or means of providing a better form of help for the dairying industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be in order to talk about farmers' butter. I do not suppose it would be, because the Minister might blow up and not retain his present amiable mood if I raised the question.  The fact that this creamery butter is being subsidised&mdash; if you like&mdash;to the consumer, is a further disadvantage to the farmers' butter but I suppose that is outside the scope of this Bill.  We have far-reaching legislation and all types of machinery to deal with creamery butter.  I suppose that is necessary in order to produce a uniform article capable of being sold in most countries. That was not bad enough; we found it necessary to get our own people to eat the butter and we had to subsidise it.  It does not speak well for it in some ways if we have to continue to <Col N="1098" /> subsidise it.  Either we are too poor to eat our own butter, when one section of the community has produced it, or there is something else wrong.  I do not know what it may be.  But in normal times, we have almost doubled our consumption of butter here since before the war.  Does the Minister see any hope in the future of sufficient butter being produced to enable it to be exported again?  I would like to hear the Minister on that.  It may be outside the scope of the Bill but all these are important matters.  The ordinary farmers want to know clearly what the future holds for them as regards the dairying industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister's introductory speech but I had an opportunity of having a glance at this Bill and I must say it surprised me that the Minister, with his past record and in view of the statements which he has put on the record, was introducing a measure of this kind to provide for these powers in permanent form as part of the ordinary law of the land.  Undoubtedly in times of emergency the Minister for Agriculture should have powers to see that a crisis in the butter situation is handled, but does the Minister envisage a permanent shortage of butter here to meet the home demand?  He is taking powers here to regulate imported butter, to direct its sale, to impose levies upon it, and he has taken powers to see that no one except somebody authorised by him can handle or distribute it.  We know, of course, that the home production of butter has dropped considerably within the last year or two.</P>

      <P>The figures published in London yesterday, and reported in to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i>, show that the export of butter from this country has dropped in these last couple of months very considerably as against last year.  The Minister is taking, in this Bill, powers to control imported butter.  He is not doing that just for fun.  He must envisage a situation in which we will not be producing sufficient butter to meet the home demand.  Of course the butter we are exporting is pretty heavily subsidised from the Exchequer.  At one time the Minister was very much against the idea of giving cheap butter to John Bull at the expense of the Irish consumer, but not only is he subsidising export butter out of the Exchequer but he is going to subsidise bacon.  It is a big change, seeing that the Minister and those associated with him denounced any idea of giving a stabilised price to farmers for butter and seeing that the price they would get on the home market was not governed by a disastrously low price on the world market.</P>
      <P>Section 4 is interesting from the point of view that it is introduced by the Minister for Agriculture who was formerly known as Deputy James Dillon who was against all sorts of inspectors and controls and wanted freedom for everybody to do everything they liked with butter and everything else.  Section 4 provides that the proprietor of a catering establishment or the head of an institution in the area outlined shall not purchase any butter to which this section applies unless he purchases it from an authorised body or a person who obtained it from an authorised body. It is an offence punishable by law if he purchases butter which he cannot prove he bought from an authorised person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is putting the onus on the purchaser. Unless he can prove to the satisfaction of the Minister's inspectors in the first place, and of the court, if he is charged, that he bought it from an authorised person, he is guilty of a punishable offence.  Surely, in permanent legislation, the Minister should be content to put the onus on the <Col N="1100" /> seller, to prove that a man who sold butter was an authorised person rather than put the onus on the purchaser.  It would be easier to control it than to require the purchaser to prove from whom he bought the butter.  The Bill seems to provide interference with the ordinary individual.  We know that in times of emergency it is right to take exceptional measures to safeguard the supplies of an essential commodity, but otherwise in times which we hope will be normal I think it is going a bit too far to put this onus on the purchaser. I am certainly surprised at the Minister for Agriculture, who fulminated so much against governmental powers and Government interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite honest, I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  If he had come in here when I was introducing the Bill, he would know this relates to the Dublin and Bray marketing of butter.  There is no obligation on the purchaser to prove anything.  The State must prove the offence.  There is no such thing as putting the onus on the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what interpretation is put on the section in the Dáil.  If carried, the ordinary meaning of the language used will be interpreted by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it operates in such a way as to put a burden of proof on the person who is alleged to have committed the offence, I will ask the Dáil to amend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider the matter now.  Section 4 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by regulations, made in respect of a specified area, provide&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and in sub-section (b) goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;that the proprietor of a catering establishment in that area or the head of an institution in that area shall not purchase any butter to which this section applies unless he purchases it from an authorised body or from a person who obtained it from an authorised body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> Surely anybody who commits an offence against this Act has the onus of proof put on him.  Anyway, how is the proprietor of a school to know that the person from whom he purchases butter is an authorised body?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised body is defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Or how is he to know that the person from whom he bought the butter, on behalf of the staff and children of his institution, is a person who bought the butter from an authorised body?  It is putting an onus on the purchaser to find out from whom the butter originally came.  He must find out if the person in the local village from whom he bought the butter was an authorised person or if he, in turn, had bought it from an authorised body.  He has got to go into the shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In times of emergency, extraordinary measures may be necessary. We hope we are going into normal times, at least normal in relation to the distribution of butter and things of that kind.  Before the Dáil passes permanent legislation making the head of a school responsible for seeing that the local grocer has bought his butter from a person authorised by the Minister, the Minister should reconsider the matter.  I think the present proposal is going a bit too far and I think the onus should be on the seller who must not, if the Minister so directs, handle butter unless he is authorised to do so. I think that is going quite far enough to meet the present situation.  If there were a famine in the country we might agree that the Minister should go a step further.</P>
      <P>In Section 5 it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may by regulations provide that a person shall not buy, sell or use butter to which this section applies for any purpose other than ordinary household use or a use authorised by a permit granted by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> This section applies to creamery butter and that sub-section goes very far indeed.  It provides that an ordinary individual commits an offence if he buys creamery butter and does not use it for household purposes, according to the reading of that sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not in the House when I was explaining all this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Minister again that it is not the Minister's explanation which will be the law.  It is what is in the Act of Parliament.  I am merely pointing out these defects to the Minister so that the Bill can be reconsidered.  He can have a fresh look at it to find out whether in fact the provisions are really necessary in what we hope will be normal times.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 5 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There shall be charged, levied and paid on the grant of a permit under regulations under this section such (if any) fee as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very wide power.  In very recent times, indeed, we have had the Minister for Finance imposing very big fees and levies on the importation of certain commodities.  If, at any time in the future, he finds himself short of cash he may put a very big fee upon the grant of a permit.  Remember, it is the Minister for Finance who will decide and not the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;such (if any) fee as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now under the 1935 Act the Minister for Agriculture came into the picture in relation to the fee.  I think the fee was definitely laid down.  There was a 5/- fee for one type of permit and £1 for another type under the provisions of that Act.  Before the Dáil passes this Bill I think it should provide that a fixed scale of fees be laid down.  If, later, they are found not to be high enough and the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture makes the case that they are not high enough, then the Dáil can amend the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> We have had the recent experience of people engaged in the normal business of distributing articles which they were importing, having had the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government and the assurances of some Ministers that everything in the garden was rosy, suddenly finding themselves faced with a levy of 35 per cent. on the commodities they sell, overnight, out of the blue, and without any warning.  A Minister for Finance who is prepared to do that in certain circumstances might certainly drive up the fee under this, not by 35 per cent., but by 350 per cent.  Before the Dáil passes this measure I think it should have some idea of the magnitude of the fees that are to be charged, at the sole discretion of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture not coming into the picture at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider introducing an amendment on the Committee Stage to fix a scale of fees which will be reasonable in relation to these operations.  I think he can get that done quite easily.  If provision is to be made for a permanent fee, I think the Minister for Agriculture should come in on it.  Sub-section (4) lays it down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All fees charged and levied by virtue of this section shall be collected and taken in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct and shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of that Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now that is something new in normal times.  There was no such provision in the 1935 Act as far as I can discover. That Act was designed for the regulation of butter prices in the interests of the farmers and milk producers.  This present provision would appear to be a way in which the Minister for Finance, if he is short of cash, can collect a lot of fees, or direct the Minister for Agriculture to collect a lot of fees for him, and use them, not for the benefit of the farmers producing the butter, but for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The Minister for Agriculture has no right even to object. <Col N="1104" /> They will be paid into and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister for Finance.  Instead of giving all this freedom, that the Minister for Agriculture was so anxious about over the years, no one in future will be allowed to buy or sell even a butter box unless he is permitted to do so under regulation made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives the Minister power to regulate the sale of empty butter boxes.  It provides that empty butter boxes of a specified description should not be sold save at specified prices and to specified persons.  It also provides that the expression butter box means a box in which butter has been sold.</P>
    <P>It somewhat amazes me that the Minister for Agriculture would have the face, in view of his past, to come in here and say that we cannot buy or sell butter boxes without his permission. If the Minister is taking power to do this in normal peace times, I should like to know what he would do if there was a real emergency.  He denounced all &ldquo;pipsqueaks&rdquo; of inspectors.  The farmer was to be able to tell every inspector to stay outside the gate.  Now the inspector cannot only go inside the gate to see if the farmer has bought or sold butter, but he can go inside the farmer's house and see if he has a butter box there and see if he is using butter for any other purpose than to feed himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, formerly Deputy Dillon, would not let pip-squeaks of inspectors look across the farmers' fields but he is now sending them into the farmers' kitchens to see if he has a butter box beside the fire.  The section providing for penalties is not left out.  Section 10 provides that a person who contravenes a provision of the regulations under this Act, or a condition attached to a permit, shall be guilty of an offence under the section and liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £20.  An offence under this section may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister.  The Minister may act as prosecutor.  I would love to see the Minister acting as a prosecutor in a court where a person was charged <Col N="1105" /> with the offence of having bought butter and used it for some other purpose than eating it, such as a person cleaning his hands if he got tar on them.  The Minister could either appear before the court himself or hire some lawyer and give him a big fee to go into the court and prosecute for him.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, between now and the Committee Stage, to consider whether many of these provisions are really necessary in permanent legislation dealing with normal times. The Minister might himself agree that some of these things are going a little bit beyond what is reasonable and necessary in these days.  I think it is wrong to put the onus on the purchaser. I think it would be sufficient to put the onus on the buyer.  For the purpose of directing this particular business, it would be better to put the onus on the people who are really responsible, and that is, on the sellers. If the Minister holds the seller responsible all down the line, it is not necessary also to take powers to deal with the purchaser, particularly when you come down to the point where the purchaser is an ordinary private individual or the head of a small institution.</P>
    <P>The people who cannot buy butter unless they buy it from an accredited person includes somebody managing a restaurant, a hotel, a boarding-house, a quest house, a café, a tea-room, a canteen or a club.  That class of person also includes the manager of a hospital, sanatorium, a convalescent home, a convent or a college or other ordinary institutions.  I think it is wrong to have that provision written into an Act of Parliament, whether or not the Minister intends to use it.  It is wrong that people of that type should be held responsible, if they purchased from the local grocer a few pounds of butter and use it in their small institution.  What the Minister really wants to make sure of is that there will be no wholesale dealing in butter if it is controlled, or subject to a levy or rationed, or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think that some of the provisions in Section 5 are unnecessary and that the Minister should tell the Dáil what the levies on persons who <Col N="1106" /> get permits under this Bill are likely to be.  It should not be left to the discretion of the Minister for Finance to fix these levies without reference to, and the concurrence of, the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Finance has powers to use these funds for the benefit of the Exchequer in accordance with his own directions.  If there are levies to be made the Dáil should know, in the interests of the dairy farmers of the country, what they are to be, and if they are to be changed the Dáil should approve.</P>

      <P>The ordinary courtesy of debate in this House, as I learned it for the last 20 years, is that a Deputy who has an interest in the matter before the House should take the trouble to come in and hear what the Minister has to say.  If the Minister has not properly explained the matter to the Deputy, that Deputy has the right to rebuke the Minister for lack of courtesy to the House and to require him to defend himself on such a charge.  I think that I did try to explain this Bill fully.  When Deputy Aiken spoke on this Bill, few of the people listening to him would believe that all the Orders to which he referred were Orders made by the Government of which he was a member.</P>

The inquiry is being made in all those cases where the information is not already available to the Land Commission and, so far, has been made in approximately 1,900 cases.

      <P>I thought I implied that in the reply.  A couple of months ago there were 2,500 plots or parcels that were allotted to occupiers of labourers' cottages in the past, and under Section 27 of the Labourers Act, 1936, before consolidation can be <Col N="1108" /> effected with the plot on which the house stands, it is necessary to inquire whether the tenant is vested or not. Recently I asked the commissioners to change that so that a parcel can be vested in a tenant who is not himself vested, who is not the owner of the house and plot on which it stands.  If the tenant is vested in the house and plot it is necessary for the Land Commission to know it, so that they will be consolidated.  If he is not vested they want to know so that they may, if they wish, vest the allotment that has been made by the Land Commission without taking into account the plot on which the house stands.</P>

I have here 20 such circulars from the people of County Wexford in different walks of life and of different opinions, who wish to have something done to stop the export of horses.  In the case of an emergency, we will be solely dependent on foreign oils if this export continues and there will be no horses to plough the land of Ireland.

If there comes to the Deputy's attention any individual case which, in his judgment, involves cruelty to horses in transport, I would be personally indebted to him if he would direct my attention to it so that inquiries could be made and effective measures taken to ensure that there should be no recurrence of such an incident.  I should add, I think, that there is a great deal of uninformed comment upon this problem.  I should be happy to place at the Deputy's disposal at any time the full dossier on this matter so that he can learn for himself the exhaustive nature of the precautions taken by the veterinary staff of my Department to ensure that no live stock, shipped or transhipped in or from the country, is allowed to suffer more than the best possible precautions cannot avoid.</P>

      <P>I make that observation because each individual point mentioned by the Deputy could not have caused the misapprehension under which he obviously labours if he had <Col N="1114" /> been here for me to explain them to him.  Each of the difficulties in which he found himself resulted from an entire misinterpretation of the section to which he referred.  This Bill, in fact, is a Bill designed to allow a number of the Orders referred to by the Deputy as being onerous and undesirable in normal times to lapse, but inasmuch as the Supplies and Services Act, the governing Act, is itself going to lapse, it was thought necessary that we ought to retain under this code the power to make these Orders again if the necessity arises.  Every word of criticism that Deputy Aiken applied to these Orders would probably apply, if they were justified &mdash; and I do not think they were &mdash; to his own colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that there is any justifiable criticism of them but, if there were, it would apply to his own colleague who made them, or to his colleague Deputy Tom Walsh who kept them in operation from 1951 to 1954.  If Deputy Aiken had been here to hear my explanation of them I do not think he would have felt the same apprehensions, but in fact he appeared to believe that this Bill was designed to make these regulations, the truth being that this Bill is brought in in order to allow them to lapse but to retain the power, which is general under the Supplies and Services Act, but which is particular in its relations, exclusive to the dairying industry, under this amending Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a number of powers in the existing Orders that it is not expedient to retain as permanent features of our legislation, but it may be very expedient to retain the power to bring them in if an emergency of any kind should arise in future and I think even that is debatable.</P>
      <P>If you were living in the days of William Ewart Gladstone, when the world moved at a slow and steady pace, there was always time to come into Parliament and get by statute a power requisite to deal with an existing situation, but in the modern world in which we live things happen so fast that, if you denude yourself of the power to make these regulations, you very often find that wholly unnecessary damage has been done in the inevitable interim involved in going through the pretty tedious procedure of drafting a Bill, submitting it to the Government in draft form and getting their authority to put it in White Paper form, bringing it back to the next meeting of the Government in White Paper form and getting their authority to get the First Reading, then getting the First Reading in Dáil Éireann, then getting it printed and then getting a Second Reading.  There may be something in it because of which some Deputy in any part of the House may say: &ldquo;No.  I object to taking the Committee Stage now&rdquo;, and another week elapses.  All that time, serious complications may be arising and you cannot bring them under control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Allen says, the Minister is still operating, and must operate, most of these regulations now, but I can see Deputy Aiken's point of view that some of them do seem to relate strictly to emergency situations.  I can sympathise with the man who says: &ldquo;Why do you want power to control butter boxes?&rdquo;  There again Deputy Aiken is under an illusion.  I have at present the power to permit a creamery to use a butter box twice and, where that is considered desirable, to require the shopkeeper <Col N="1116" /> not to sell the butter box for more than the creamery is prepared to credit him with if he returns it to the creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That butter box Order was the Minister's own and he said at the beginning of the speech that all these powers were Fianna Fáil powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not read what I said.  Listen to me.  I wish I could get rid of that Order at the earliest possible opportunity for I would like to see the entire butter trade in this country done in fibre board boxes manufactured in Waterford, Athy or elsewhere.  Why bring in Swedish timber boxes from Sweden if we can use our own?  People may say: &ldquo;Why do not you do it?&rdquo;  The answer is that if I issued a ukase in the morning that it must be done, I could cripple a whole lot of small creameries in the country because the expense on them of getting rid of the existing stocks they have and in changing their arrangements and doing all sorts of odd things that you would not know about if you were not in daily contact with creamery managers and creamery committees, would cripple the small ones.</P>
      <P>A lot of people would say: &ldquo;What are you fussing about?  Why not tell them to use what they like?&rdquo;  I will tell you.  It took us three years to test and establish a satisfactory specification for fibre board boxes to hold our butter.  You would think that was extraordinary when you remember that New Zealand has been using fibre board boxes, that Denmark has been using them.  You would ask: &ldquo;Why cannot you use them without any more test?&rdquo;  It is because we discovered that the kind of butter we make in Ireland is not susceptible of the same packing process as is used in New Zealand or Denmark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can use a fibre board butter box in Denmark of an entirely different specification from the minimum which we insist on but if we do not insist on that minimum, half the butter we consign would arrive in battered boxes with the butter subject to contamination. But if I had taken a snap decision on that, I might have specified too <Col N="1117" /> strong a box.  That could have put 6d. a cwt. on the packing costs of butter. On the other hand, if, in an attempt to spare the creameries as much expense as I could, I consented to a specification 3d. per box too low, the mills that made the box would have geared themselves up to the production of that box and I could have involved them in losses of thousands of pounds by condemning the weak box after I had allowed them to embark on its manufacture.</P>
    <P>We have now arrived at what we believe to be a standard specification which gives marginal safety so that anybody who wants to go over to fibre board boxes can do so, and I hope the whole question of the existing timber butter boxes will cease to be of significance hereafter.  In the meantime, I have the greatest sympathy with the person why says: &ldquo;Why on earth do you not take your nose out of butter boxes altogether?&rdquo;  My answer is simply to say that the moment my technical advisers tell me it is safe to do so, there is nothing I would welcome more.  But it is only a fool of a Minister for Agriculture who surrounds himself with technical advisers in a business as tricky as the creamery industry at the moment and who says to those men with 40 years' experience in the job: &ldquo;It does not matter what you say; I am going to do this.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fibre board box is coming and I imagine that within the next five years you will not see a timber box in use in this country.  There are pluses and minuses. If you remember the shape of the pyramid butter box and remember the cold storage of butter in pyramid boxes, and offset the economy in cold storage costs when you are able to pack butter like bricks in square fibre <Col N="1118" /> board boxes, that deducts something from the cost.  That consideration may be involved in the question of fibre board boxes used once as opposed to using timber boxes three times.  Over and above that, it is not desirable to send Irish butter abroad in boxes that have all the appearance of having been knocked about for some time.  We cannot contemplate exporting butter which is badly packed and we must ensure that when it is exported boxes will be used that will ensure its arrival in perfect condition.</P>

      <P>I thought Deputy Allen would never fall into that mistake, but instead I find him saying: &ldquo;You will never export butter again&rdquo; and he shakes his gory locks at me.  I would first like to ask Deputy Allen to inquire why is it that at the present moment there are no exports of butter.  Deputy Aiken was very eloquent about this and he says: &ldquo;You pointed the finger of scorn at us when we subsidised exports of butter back in 1936 and 1938 and now look at you!  You are quite prepared to contemplate exporting butter in the same circumstances.&rdquo; But there is a little figure in this equation to which Deputy Allen and Deputy Aiken have not referred.  I will supply it for them.  In 1938 we manufactured 766,000 cwt. of butter and our people ate 450,000 cwt., so that altogether we paid the British people to eat 328,000 cwt. of that butter.  In 1955 we produced more than we produced in 1938 but we paid the British people nothing to consume any of it and our own people ate the lot.  Was <Col N="1119" /> it better to have seen the standard of living of our people rise to the point where they ate all the butter that was made, more than was made in 1938, and was it better than to say to our people: &ldquo;You are eating too much; you are living too well; you eat &lsquo;marge,&rsquo; we will ship 366,000 cwt. of butter to Great Britain and we will pay the British to eat it?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In regard to the prospect for the coming year, I think a possibility is there&mdash;it is only a forecast because it is largely conditioned by weather conditions, as we all know&mdash; but I think there is a prospect that in the coming year there will be butter exports, that we shall have an exportable surplus of butter over and above our people's capacity to consume after the Government have provided a subsidy of 5d. per lb. to induce them to consume their own butter.  After they have consumed all the butter they can eat, I think it is possible&mdash;I cannot go farther than that at the moment&mdash;that there will be an exportable surplus of butter.  We know that Fianna Fáil were praying and storming heaven that we would have to import butter this year and it broke their hearts that we did not.  The fact is that we had a &ldquo;fluky&rdquo; kind of autumn.  Last September I thought we might have to import butter but on account of the very mild autumn and winter we did not have to import it at all.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy Ó Briain will sympathise with me when he thinks of the members of the commission having the report now for close on three weeks and not having told me what is in it though they paraded the town having it in their pockets.  The rumour&mdash;and let me point out it is no more than a rumour&mdash;which has reached me is that they have been advised by their technical directors that the prime cost of the production of one gallon of milk, including labour and raw material, is 1/3¾d. per gallon.  The farmers' representatives, I understand, claim there ought to be an estimate providing for payment of management and compensation for capital.  According to the rumour, I understand that the figures they have in mind are 4½d. <Col N="1123" /> for the management of the cow and 4½d. for the recruitment of capital invested in the cow.  I do not profess to be an expert in such matters or to be in a position at this stage to discuss the merits of this.  All I say is that rumour has it that the prime cost has been fixed at 1/3¾d. per gallon and that the cost of raw materials and labour are included in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the average cost for the whole year round.  I must tell Deputies again that I cannot give them a categorical answer for I do not know.  I have not got it.  I have given the rumour I have got and it is in respect of liquid milk for human consumption produced in the months of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, on the usual contract basis, that the farmer undertakes to deliver a uniform quantity day in day out to the wholesaler.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The average price, taking the whole year, has been estimated at something between 2/2 and 2/3 per gallon.  The prime cost of production is said to be something in the order of 1/3¾d. per gallon.  The house must not forget that the claim is made that there ought to be an allowance for interest on the cow and for management of the cow.  I do not profess to be qualified to discuss the merits of these claims and counter-claims.  I have given all I have got.  I have been assured that the corresponding information in respect of creamery milk will be made available to the commission by their technical director before the end of this month.  I would be inclined, in common sense and reason, to accept that assurance but I would not criticise anyone if there were two or three days' difference.  I feel sure they will be made available at the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know Deputy Ó Briain will agree with me that these figures should be made available to me at the earliest <Col N="1124" /> opportunity so that I can communicate them to Dáil Éireann.  I want to repeat in public what I have repeatedly said before, that I want those figures at the earliest possible moment, so that I may bring them to the knowledge of the only body in Ireland that is entitled to pass final judgment on them&mdash;Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of people throughout the country who seem to be making the claim that there is somebody superior to Dáil Éireann.  The sooner they get that notion out of their heads the better.  We are the elected representatives of the people of Ireland and we can pitch any Government out of office at our will.  We, the elected representatives of the people of Ireland, can determine policy and enact the law and we are the only authority in Ireland qualified to do that, whether we be the humblest creatures or the most exalted aristocrats in the land. But let nobody allow the illusion to grow in his mind that any outside interest in this country will ever grow so powerful that the Legislature of Ireland will be obliged to bow to its will.  We are the Government of the Irish people and, whatever Government sits in these benches by the authority of Dáil Éireann is the sole authority entitled to govern in the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>I should be most happy, if Deputies on the other side really consider it necessary to go through this Bill in detail in Committee to afford them every opportunity of doing so and to convenience them in every way.  I have not the slightest doubt that on consideration of the several sections they will see with me that, far from attempting perpetual, unnecessary, restrictive regulation, this Bill is designed to make it possible to suspend most of these regulations but to retain the power, should the necessity arise, of bringing them back into operation, without allowing invaluable time to elapse while the procedure of <i>ad hoc</i> legislation is being availed of.</P>
    <P>If that view prevails on the Opposition, I suggest we might get this Bill out of the way so that the general operation of making the Supplies and Services Act unnecessary can be <Col N="1125" /> expedited in every way.  On the other hand, if the Opposition feel that further examination of the Bill is requisite, then I am in their hands and it is their convenience that shall be met in connection with the Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that Deputy Lemass who, I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, had cast himself for the role of the busy bee of this Legislature, appeared to be highly critical of the length of time it takes this Government to produce legislation and submit it to the Dáil for its approval.</P>

      <P>Oh!  A master hand is speaking.  I want to make this further point.  I do not think it is a healthy thing that the efficiency or the effectiveness of the members of this Parliament should be measured by their capacity for churning out legislation. I think sometimes the mistake young Parliaments make&mdash;and old Parliaments, too&mdash;is that they are too fond of legislation; and, if they would give legislation a rest occasionally, it might be a very good thing.  If the Dáil does not produce a single Act in any particular month of our session, that does not necessarily mean that either this Dáil or this Government has failed to do its work.  There is plenty of work.</P>
