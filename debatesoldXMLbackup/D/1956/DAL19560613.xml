      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that in a private sale to the Land Commission in February, 1955, of a farm, being part of the lands of Garrowmillion Lower, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford, comprising 240 acres 1 rood and 5 perches, for the sum of £5,750, payable in 4¾ per cent. land bonds equal in nominal amount thereto, it was represented to the vendor that the purchase price would be paid in bonds realisable at par when the bonds were allocated to him; that the vendor would not have sold these lands had he not been assured that the par value of the bonds would be payable on completion; that the vendor now suffers a loss of 20 per cent. as a result of the depreciation of the bonds, and that the delay in the completion of the sale from the date the bonds were put to the vendor's credit to the date of allocation was due solely to the delay in dealing with this matter in the Land Commission; and, if so, if he will state when the bonds will be redeemed, and if he will compensate the vendor for the loss incurred by him in the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Land Commission that no undertaking was given to the owner of these lands that the purchase money would be paid in land bonds realisable at par.  In fact, in all communications to the owner's solicitors in the matter of price it was stated that <Col N="168" /> the purchase money would be payable in 4¾ per cent. land bonds equal in nominal amount thereto.  There was no avoidable delay on the part of the Land Commission in dealing with the allocation of the purchase money in this case; in fact, it is on record on behalf of the owner that &ldquo;this sale was completed in record time&rdquo;.  The rate of interest payable in respect of the land bonds and the capital repayment at par on redemption are guaranteed by the State but the guarantee does not extend to the day-to-day Stock Exchange price of bonds, and the Land Commission have no power to compensate the owner for any variation in such price.  The statutory position, flowing from Section 2, Land Bond Act, 1934, is that &ldquo;land bonds shall, as between the vendor, to whom they are issued, and the Land Commission be accepted by such vendor as the equivalent of the corresponding amount of purchase money&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that I have been informed by the vendor's solicitor that there was an assurance to the vendor that the par value of the bonds would be payable on completion of the purchase, and, in view of that, would he not have the conditions of the purchase investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Land Commission that no such guarantee was given and no such condition stipulated as that mentioned by the Deputy.  I do not think the Land Commission, or indeed, anybody, would be foolish enough to make such a forecast.</P>

    <P>With regard to a scheme for guarantees in relation to advances by building societies for the purchase or erection of new houses, I would refer the <Col N="181" /> Deputy to the statement which I issued on 23rd May in agreement with representatives of the principal building societies.

    <P>I have not the information requested by the Deputy in regard to the rates of interest which will be charged by building societies.  As regards the discontinuance of building loans by a friendly society, I have seen a Press report of the matter but I have no further information.</P>
    <P>The annual repayments calculated to the nearest £ on the basis of half-yearly payments over 35 years at 5¾ per cent. interest are as follows in respect of loans of £1,800, £1,600, £1,400, £1,200 and £1,000, namely, £120, £107, £93, £80 and £67 respectively.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister can give some indication as to what the rate of interest to be charged by the building societies will be?  In his circular of the 9th June in connection with this matter, he stated that the interest would be the rate charged by the building societies in the normal course of their business.  Surely he can now give us some indication as to what that rate of interest will be?  Further arising from the Minister's reply, would he state whether it is a fact that he has made representation to the Minister for Finance and to the Revenue Commissioners to consider an alleviation of the tax paid at present by building societies and, if so, whether any decision has been arrived at?</P>

      <P>(2)  That there shall be levied on the board in respect of the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, a stamp duty of £140,000, which shall be paid by the board to the Revenue Commissioners on or before the 15th day of March, 1957.</P>
      <P>(3)  That upon payment of the duty, the Revenue Commissioners shall certify that the board has complied with the provisions contained in this resolution, and the certificate shall be stamped with the amount of the duty paid and shall be issued to the board.</P>

    <P>(4)  That if the board fails to <Col N="193" /> comply with the provisions contained in this resolution, the amount of the duty unpaid, together with interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum from the 16th day of March, 1957, to the day on which the duty is paid, shall be a debt due from the board to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund and shall be recoverable at the suit of the Attorney-General in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>This is the financial resolution which is necessary because of the alteration in the basis of assessment to which I referred in concluding on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  The Racing Board, for which I have statutory responsibilities, came to see me and indicated that they would prefer to provide exactly the same amount of money as I had estimated would be provided by my original proposals in this manner rather than in the manner that I had indicated.  So far as I am concerned, as long as I am receiving the same amount of money, I am prepared to meet them to that extent, the overriding basis of my consideration being that this is the amount the original proposals were estimated to provide.</P>

Therefore, I do not propose to initiate a debate on this resolution.  I am, however, made somewhat curious by the Minister's estimate that the original proposals in the Budget statement would have produced the same amount of revenue as he is now expecting to get from this stamp duty. The revenue shown by the Racing Board Report for 1954-55, if the Minister's original proposals held good, would appear to yield £230,000.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his Budget statement indicated that he was prepared to consider a more general review of the code of direct taxation than was undertaken recently by the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry.  It is desirable to make it clear that we here would strongly support that proposal.  There is need now for a comprehensive review of our system of direct taxation.  The report of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry, and particularly chapter XI dealing with the general body of taxpayers, emphasises, by the information which it provides as well as by the observations of the committee, the need for that review.  The committee in their report stated at paragraph 209:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It appears that income taxation in Ireland is neither broad nor general in its incidence, and that there is an unequal distribution of the total burden over the different <Col N="196" /> sectors of the community.  It is no longer a relatively simple tax, levied at modest rates.  An increasingly formidable volume of legislation, and case law, adds to its complexity from year to year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The information contained in the body of the report gives rather remarkable evidence, not previously available in the same form, of the increased incidence of direct taxation particularly as it affects wage and salary earners, those whose tax is calculated under Schedule E.  Since the dates chosen by the committee pre-war, there has been an increase from 45,000 to 138,000 in the number of wage and salary earners paying income-tax, an increase from 62 per cent. to 79 per cent. of the total body of direct taxpayers. Furthermore, as a table published in that section of the report makes clear, the reliefs now given in respect of earned income to married men and to people with dependents, are relatively considerably less than they were before the war.  The actual rates of relief have been increased, but the increase in each case was not in proportion to the decline in the value of money in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The committee indicated that they had received evidence that the present rates of taxation on wage and salary earners had a serious disincentive effect.  Salaries and wages carried about 18 per cent. of the direct taxation burden before the war, but are carrying 27 per cent. of that burden now.  Having regard to the changes that have taken place, to the effect of the deterioration in money on the incidence of direct taxation, to the many anomalies to which the committee made brief reference, the time would appear to be ripe for undertaking the general review of the whole code to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>The annual conference of the Fianna Fáil Party last year passed a resolution favouring, in principle, the introduction of a pay-as-you-earn system of taxation on personal incomes.  I do not know if the Minister has as yet given any consideration to the type of inquiry that is to be set up or to the terms of reference to be given to those undertaking the inquiry; but it would <Col N="197" /> appear to be desirable that there should be specific reference to the practicability and desirability of introducing here a pay-as-you-earn system of taxing earned incomes.</P>
    <P>It is to be recognised that there are many difficulties likely to be experienced in devising a simple and workable system and it is clear that, before any official decisions are taken, it will be necessary to have consultations with those who are likely to be involved in the operation of such a system, whether as employers or as workers.  Indeed, I think that the terms of reference of the inquiry should be drawn widely enough to permit of the examination of the possibility of abolishing income-tax altogether.  I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the Fianna Fáil Party has taken any decision in principle in favour of the abolition of income-tax or has come to the conclusion that it would be practicable to abolish income-tax.  But there is, I think, a growing volume of opinion in favour of the view that taxation of income should be replaced, if possible, by some system of taxing expenditure.  In theory, it is altogether desirable that persons should be taxed on the basis of what they spend rather than on the basis of what they earn.</P>
    <P>In this country, where there is very urgent need to encourage increased savings, it would seem to be wrong policy to tax income which is saved at the same rate as income which is spent. It may be that no workable system of basing the direct tax system upon expenditure rather than income can be devised, but anybody or any committee that may be entrusted with the task of examining the whole code of direct taxation should not be precluded by the terms of reference from examining that possibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on the Minister also that there should be no delay in getting this inquiry under way.  We have had the experience of the Committee on Industrial Taxation and we know that it took a long time for that committee to produce its report: and, in matters of this kind, time is important. Having regard to the experience <Col N="198" /> of the working of that committee, I think the Minister should consider entrusting this wider inquiry to people who can give a considerable amount of time and are prepared to sacrifice a considerable amount of time to the work.  Many of the delays which are experienced in the working of Government committees and commissions are due to the inclusion in their membership of persons, who, while undoubtedly qualified by their experience to express views on the subject upon which they are asked to report, are not, because of other obligations, able to give any considerable time to the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The work of investigating the whole of our code of direct taxation is likely to be a very specialised type of task. Not many people will be available who are qualified to come in with the initial information which would enable them to get down to the work without delay.  As I say, I do not know whom the Minister has in mind. If he contemplates a committee in which members of the Dáil may be asked to participate he can assume that the fullest co-operation of this Party will be available to him.  But we would like to feel that the work will begin soon and that the organisation of the work will be such as to offer a fair prospect of having it completed within a reasonable time.  That will involve not merely the careful selection of members of the committee of inquiry because of their availability and willingness to give time to it but will also involve ensuring that they will have at their service an adequate staff to do the necessary research work.  If the Minister is now in a position to indicate when he hopes to get the inquiry under way, what type of inquiry he contemplates, to whom he proposes to entrust it and the terms of reference, that information will be very useful; and, if he is in a position to do that now, I would urge him to consider the desirability of getting the whole process started at least during this session of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I find myself to quite a considerable extent in agreement with Deputy Lemass on this matter. Where I differ from him is when he tries to suggest that the necessity for <Col N="199" /> this examination did not arise until now.  I think this type of examination might very usefully have taken place long before now, and perhaps at a time when it would have been much easier to get the type of inquiry needed and when, perhaps, it would have been much easier to bring in effective measures to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>It must be freely admitted that the type of direct taxation dealt with here in Section 1 has a very bad effect, particularly on producers.  There is a deterrent against going beyond a certain point.  Deputy Lemass referred to the workers, who, for the first time, are coming within the scope of the income-tax code.  Personally, I am glad that we have reached the stage where they are within that code.  That is something I used to wish for very heartily many years ago.</P>
      <P>It is true that, apart from whatever injustice there is, particularly in certain types of cases, in deducting income-tax from earnings, it has a very bad effect on production.  We know that even under the pay-as-you-earn system tried out on the other side, which Deputy Lemass now advocates here, when earnings reached a certain point and income-tax impacted on them an enormous increase in abstentions from work resulted; in a considerable number of industries&mdash;very large industries and, in the main, key industries&mdash;a full week was rarely worked by the entire staff.  I do not know whether that has happened to any extent in this country, but it has happened across the water and it could happen here or it would be likely to happen in a similar set of circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever of the adverse impact on producers, whether they be farmers who pay income-tax&mdash; if there are any such&mdash;or whether they be industrialists or people engaged in ordinary forms of commerce.  When a man reaches the stage where the harder he works, the more efficient he becomes, and the more he earns the less he will get, human nature being what it is, that man says to himself: &ldquo;Why should I work six months of the year for nothing?&rdquo;  That is what it amounts to in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> That is one side of the story.  The other side of the story is that the inquiry is only the beginning.  If the inquiry reports on lines which will lead to a reduction in the rate of income-tax, corporation profits tax, supertax or any other aspect of that particular range of taxes, or a changing about of it, will the sum to be collected from the taxpayer be any less?  If there is any reduction in the gross amount collected by way of income-tax, from what other source will it be sought?</P>
    <P>It is not just quite as simple as setting up an inquiry.  I am in favour of setting up the inquiry and, with Deputy Lemass, I have some appreciation of the difficulty the Minister or any other Minister will have in getting suitable personnel who will be able to give a good deal of time to it so as to get us a good report and to get it for us in as short a space of time as possible.</P>
    <P>Does anybody approaching this seriously think that you can relieve certain groups from the impact of income-tax without shifting it on to the shoulders of other income-tax payers or on to the shoulders of the general taxpayers?  Does anybody think there is any possible chance of reducing this tax or of giving any relief that will be of any great use or provide the incentive that is so desperately needed for more production, if expenditure is to keep on for ever mounting?  We are still carrying on in this House what we have been carrying on since the State was founded.  To-day we are demanding&mdash;from whatever side of the House we are on, let us be clear on that and admit it&mdash;more and more expenditure, and to-morrow we are demanding lower and lesser taxation.  We go on doing that year in and year out.  Everybody is looking for a larger slice of the loaf and at the same time everybody is insisting that the ingredients that go into the loaf are costing too much.</P>
    <P>We all know that one of the reasons why taxation is impacting so heavily on and affecting adversely the economic life of the nation is because every one of us is insisting on spending more than we are earning.  It is not necessary for me to say in this House to people who know me that I am not <Col N="201" /> an economist, and I certainly have not much knowledge of finance in the sense of the word generally accepted.  But I have, I hope, a little commonsense, and I have some fair knowledge of the country and the various sections that go to make up the country.</P>
    <P>I think I can claim to be at least as anxious as any other member of the House to raise the standard of living of our people as high as I possibly can.  I think I can claim to be as concerned about providing as good a social code as any other member of the House.  But we are not going to raise the standard of living and we are not going to provide an effective and lasting social code of services here by closing our eyes to the facts.  I respectfully suggest&mdash;and I am not now talking in any Party manner&mdash;that Deputies, both inside and outside the House, and particularly when they are speaking on other public bodies, ought to have a little more regard to the real position of affairs in this country and a little less concern about scoring points&mdash; apparently trying to score political points against their political opponents, but, in fact, doing definite harm to the credit of the State.</P>
    <P>As I say, I find myself in considerable agreement with the reasons which Deputy Lemass advanced in the course of his speech.  I favour the setting up of this committee of inquiry, but, any more than Deputy Lemass, I am not so foolish as to expect that, unless we are prepared to do our own part here and to do it long before this committee will be able to report, however sound its recommendations may be, we shall not be in a position to give effect to those recommendations.</P>

      <P>We are making some slight progress in the economic and financial life of this country when we hear Deputy Morrissey, when talking about financial problems, saying that we should face the facts.  For a certain number of years Deputy Morrissey, and those who voted with him in this House, would not face the facts. Whenever they thought of some good idea that would cost money to put into operation, when they were in opposition they always suggested that it would be quite easy to find the money <Col N="202" /> by reducing expenditure.  In fact, they had one wizard who, when he was in opposition, told the people of this country that they could reduce expenditure by £20,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let him come in here and tell us how to reduce taxation and avoid putting on income-tax or, if this commission which the Minister for Finance suggests, meets and recommends a reduction in certain sections of the income-tax code, where the money is to be found.  Deputy McGilligan did say that if there was a Minister for Finance put in here who had the will and the know-how to effect economies we could reduce taxation by £20,000,000.  All that propaganda in those days undoubtedly did harm. It created the impression in the minds of many people that the Government elected by the people, the Fianna Fáil Government, was deliberately salting them, trying to hurt them, trying to damage the country by imposing a level of taxation that would meet our day-to-day bills.  We are getting somewhere when a Deputy like Deputy Morrissey, who was so loud in his demands for all sorts of expenditure and at the same time a reduction in taxation, tells us that we should face the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government did not face the facts when they should have been faced.  In 1948 to 1951, they spent money like water and left the bills to their successors to pay.  Even in the beginning of this term of office, they paid sums to civil servants which they <Col N="203" /> had no legal nor moral duty to pay. The only section of the people whose incomes they cut down were the farmers who should have been encouraged to do something to build up the production of the country about which Deputy Morrissey speaks to-day.  The whole cry was that all our ills could be wiped out overnight by some financial wizardry.  There was no relation to the total income of the country, to its total production.  Everybody could have a higher standard of living without working harder, simply by pouring out more money.</P>
    <P>It was only when this Government came to the end of its tether, when the people refused to put up even 50 per cent. of the money that was required for capital expenditure, at a greater interest rate than was ever offered in this country, that the Government started to face a few of the facts.  They are facing only a few of the facts and, if we do not face them all in relation to our economic and financial life, we will be brought up hard against it some day and, unfortunately, I am afraid it will be sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>It may effect some good purpose if the commission spoken of by Deputy Lemass and previously by the Minister is set up.  It would be a good thing also if the Government themselves sat down and had an inquiry into the effects of their total financial operations. Undoubtedly, one financial operation, the saving of some money on wheat in the price given to the Irish farmers, will save the Exchequer a little, but at the expense of our balance of payments.  If our balance of payments position becomes more difficult our business is bound to go down, our general production will tend to decline and the income-tax that we are now discussing will require to be even higher to meet the commitments that the Minister for Finance has to meet.</P>
    <P>If only we could get the benefit of the advice of Deputy McGilligan, if he would just tell us how the economies of £20,000,000 were to be effected, we would not want this section in the Bill at all; we could do away with income-tax. <Col N="204" /> The people, seeing that the general taxation has been so much increased and income-tax not lowered, will at least expect the Minister to inquire as quickly and as thoroughly as possible into the income-tax code, to see if something can be done to speed up production and to effect some of the savings which Deputy Morrissey said were so necessary.</P>
    <P>We are all involved in this.  The ill effects of a financial policy do not stop at the ranks of the Government or the Government supporters, no matter what that Government may be; they reach the whole community.  At this time of dire need for more production, it is well that every aspect of financial policy that affects the level of production should be examined.  There is much greater need to-day than ever there was to take all the measures that are open to the Minister for Finance or any other Minister to encourage increased production.  If we do not increase production, if we do not increase the size of the loaf, people cannot get a bigger division of the loaf.  We tried to add to the loaf, the national income, the volume of our total resources, by pursuing a steady policy over the years.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go into every aspect of the Finance Bill, a Cheann Comhairle, but if we had a higher income, in money terms, even, the rates of income-tax which we are discussing in this section could be lowered and incomes would be higher. It might be, of course, that, with the higher monetary incomes, we could buy less goods and that the standard of living would fall.  Indeed, some sections of the community to whom this present Government doled out money find themselves in a worse position as a result of the increases they got because prices rose faster than even the Government were prepared to dish out money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us hope that, before this debate ends, we will find the wizard, Deputy <Col N="205" /> McGilligan, coming in to show the Minister for Finance how the economies could be effected which would reduce income-tax and other taxes and stir him up to effect these economies.  His proposition was two-fold.  There must be a Minister for Finance with the will and somebody with the know-how. We want Deputy McGilligan to show the Minister for Finance how to do it and stir him into activity to get it done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section extends for a further year the legislation in force on 5th April last in respect of income-tax and surtax.  This legislation consists of the various Finance Acts passed by this House since the establishment of the State, together with a large volume of British law taken over under the Adaptation of Enactments Act.  No one denies that it is both obsolete and archaic.  The Minister in his Budget statement announced the somewhat indefinite intention not to review this code of income-tax but to consider the question of having it reviewed. I urge the Minister to treat it as something of great importance.</P>
      <P>The tax code is extremely inequitable in its impact on very many of our people.  The report of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, has produced evidence for the first time which makes that very clear.  May I say, in passing, in regard to the information revealed in chapter 11 of the report&mdash;information regarding the yield of the taxes and the spread of the tax burden&mdash;that I hope that information will continue to be made available to us each year in the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners, which in its present form is a most inadequate and uninformative production as far as the information which it makes available on income-tax and surtax is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our tax code was originally laid down in its present form as far back as 1853 and we are now being asked to extend it for the 104th year.  That, to my mind, is a rather extraordinary state of affairs.  Having regard to the information now revealed and the inequitable impact of the tax code, particularly upon the wage earners and <Col N="206" /> salary earners&mdash;those under Schedule E &mdash;I would urge upon the Minister to see to it that this is the last year upon which we will be called to extend this obsolete code.</P>
    <P>This report makes available much valuable information in its survey in regard to the general body of taxpayers. That section is the most valuable section in the report.  I am well aware that there are serious problems confronting the industrialists of our country, but I feel that, relatively speaking, industrialists are not by any means the most sorely depressed section of taxpayers.  I welcome the concessions made to industry in this Budget and I hope they will be fully availed of, but, at the same time, I would state that, until such time as the Minister gives an instalment of justice to those who are assessed under the other schedules of our income-tax code, industry has for the time being received enough by way of concession.</P>
    <P>I am compelled to agree with the opinion expressed in Reservations 1 and 2 of the report by Mr. Leo Crawford and Mr. Patrick J. Dempsey respectively, who agreed with the majority recommendations and, with the Chair's permission, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a passage from Mr. Dempsey's reservation which, to my mind, sums up the position very admirably.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must qualify my concurrence in the recommendations with the proviso that if the reliefs to industry are to result in any increase in the present tax burdens of the salary and wage earner it would, in my view, be essential first to investigate the entire existing tax structure with the object of providing a system of taxation more equitable than the present one.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give the reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted from the final paragraph of Reservation No. 2 of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Taxation on Industry.  The report reveals that, as compared with pre-war, the number of wage earners and salary earners now paying tax has increased threefold.  The number of <Col N="207" /> persons paying tax under the other schedules has remained relatively static.  I think they have actually increased by 18 per cent.  The contribution of wage earners and salary earners amounts to 27 per cent. of the total income-tax revenue and that is notwithstanding the fact that the relative share of the national income accruing to wage earners and salary earners has declined somewhat.</P>
      <P>These people are regarded as fair game by the Revenue Commissioners in assessing income-tax.  Their income is readily ascertainable and their employers are forced to act as collectors. They are obliged to return the salaries which they pay and altogether I am of the definite opinion that they get a very unfair crack of the whip, so to speak.  The rule as to expenses which may be claimed by wage earners and salary earners is most inequitable as compared with the position of persons paying income-tax under Schedule D, that is, commercial persons and professional people.  As wage earners and salary earners are taxed for every 20/- in the £ in respect of the annual amount of their salary, they have no way out of the mesh. Even this week, I think it is true to say that there is not an employer in the City of Dublin who is not, on instructions from the Revenue Commissioners, deducting arrears of tax from his employees.</P>
      <P>The principle upon which relief is granted to wage earners as compared with other taxpayers is completely inequitable. The rule as to expenses is enforced with extreme rigidity.  I am aware of numerous cases where the same item of expense allowed to, say, a commercial person assessed under Schedule D is disallowed under the tax rules applied to those who are taxed as salary earners under Schedule E.  It is extremely serious that the Minister is relying on salary earners to such a great extent&mdash;to such an inequitable extent&mdash;for his revenue.  The position merits special treatment.  Some concession should be made to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said a few moments ago, and as <Col N="208" /> Deputy Lemass pointed out, this report has revealed some very significant figures for the first time.  To my mind, there is one piece of information which has been revealed which is really startling.  It is, to me, a matter of considerable surprise that it has not been commented upon either in the Press or by any informed commentators in the past few weeks since it was revealed.  I should like to refer the Minister and the members of the House to Table 49 of the report where the estimated yield of income-tax for each schedule is shown.</P>
    <P>Under Schedule A, property owners and householders contribute £1,500,000 to the tax revenue, constituting 7 per cent.; Schedule C&mdash;certain dividends and interest&mdash;2.7 per cent.; Schedule D&mdash;commercial and professional profits, largely&mdash;63.1 per cent.; Schedule E&mdash; salary earners&mdash;£5,500,000, which is equivalent to 27 per cent.  Under Schedule B, our major industry, farming, contributes the princely sum of £105,000, which is equivalent to half of 1 per cent. of the total tax revenue. Comment on that is superfluous.  The report points out that that is the case notwithstanding the fact that agricultural profits have increased fourfold since pre-war times according to the Statistical Survey of Estimates of the National Income.</P>
    <P>The report also points out that we have in this country a large number of farmers whose rateable valuation exceeds £100.  I am not for a moment suggesting that the majority of farmers should be liable for tax as ordinary business people would be liable.  They certainly would not and it would be completely uneconomic.  Nevertheless, I suggest that £105,000 paid in income-tax is a miserable contribution for the agricultural community.  It would be better for the Minister to abolish the tax and leave them alone because I doubt if it is worth while collecting it.</P>
    <P>We have 7,000 farmers of over 200 acres.  We have 11,700 farmers, as this report reveals, whose rateable valuation exceeds £100.  That is a fairly sizable rateable valuation.  Those men are in business in a fairly big way.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Department of <Col N="209" /> Agriculture alone takes £10,000,000. The relief of agricultural rates costs £5,000,000.  The capital services for agriculture amount, I think, to about £3,000,000.  By how many subsidies, bounties, reliefs and doles of one form or another are the agricultural community benefiting?  These large farmers&mdash;the 200 to 300 acre men&mdash;have the benefit of an agricultural policy designed by a benevolent Government to enable the small producer, in many cases the owner of an uneconomic holding, to make a reasonable living from agriculture.  To that extent, they have a differential profit, an excess profit from their holdings.  I think every member of this House knows that the big farmers nowadays are in the money in a big way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They pay £105,000.  I doubt if that situation can be defended. I want to emphasise that I am not concerned about the small farmers or the medium sized farmers.  We are told the farmers pay heavy rates.  Reservation No. 4 to the committee's report, inserted by the representatives of the agricultural community, makes that point.  In no part of the country are rates heavier than they are in Dublin City.  Within the next few days, the people in Foley Street in my constituency will receive from the Dublin Corporation a notice of an increase in their rents following upon the recent increase in rates enforced some weeks ago in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case is made that the farmers are contributing to the general burden of direct taxation by virtue of the rates which they pay.  That case is made rather naively in this reservation, without anything to substantiate it.  There <Col N="210" /> are included in local rates certain items which, in an ideal system, would perhaps more properly be charged to national taxation but the extent to which that prevails is somewhat problematical. Certainly, I think it can be said that, by and large, a farmer paying his rates pays for no more than direct services made available if not to himself personally then to his relations, neighbours and friends within the confines of his own county.  He is contributing nothing to national revenue.  He is not even contributing to the revenue necessary to run the Department of Agriculture through which he is benefiting to the extent of £10,000,000 per year.  His local rates, farming rates&mdash;and it is very conveniently ignored in this report&mdash;are subsidised in the Supply Services to the extent of £5,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>A concrete case is given in this example of a large farmer with a rateable valuation of 22/- per acre who is making only £6 per acre of his farm.  I take that with a grain of salt.  I could give the Minister a concrete example which I do not suggest for a moment is typical.  It is an example of an extremely efficient farmer, a man who farms 560 acres not 100 miles from Nelson Pillar.  His rateable valuation is about £600.  He pays £1,000 in rates, but, under the Relief of Agricultural Rates Act, he gets relief amounting to about £250 or £300.  He is an extremely efficient farmer and well capitalised.  His realised cash profits, arrived at after ample provision for depreciation and replacement of stock, averaged £8,000 in each of the last three years.  His income-tax is £207.  He pays no surtax, and, of course, no corporation profits tax. Would any member of the House have the hardihood to defend that state of affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An ordinary commercial businessman with similar profits would pay income-tax approaching £4,000.  My friend, who has £8,000, pays £207 per annum in income-tax.  It is a fantastic state of affairs.  It is more than that; it is a demoralising state of affairs.  The worst of it is the effect which this <Col N="211" /> unjust discrimination has on those citizens who are paying their legitimate taxes.  There is an acute and rising sense of public indignation over this discrimination.  None of us wants to see a rift develop between town and country in this State as has developed in countries on the Continent, but I would issue a word of warning to the extent that such a rift may develop, because there will be a growing public consciousness of this injustice, according as more and more people are drawn into the tax mesh.  I certainly know that in my constituency there is acute public resentment at this discrimination, and I understand it exists also in certain country towns like Mullingar and Athlone where the townspeople know only too well just what the loss is, just how much the large farmers are getting away with.  There is also a fair amount of public cynicism about this matter.  The people say that the farmers constitute a powerful vested interest and that no Party or Government will engage that interest, lest it might be voted out of office.  I wonder if that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, we can despair of any improvement in the future.  If the Government are to give way to the farmers in this matter, because they represent a powerful vested interest, we would just be throwing considerations of justice and equity to the wind and we could despair for the very future of democracy in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number involved does not amount to more than 7,000 and I hope the Minister will not tell me it would be administratively impossible to undo this great wrong.  I do not believe it would, and it should be quite a simple matter to assess all those whose holdings are valued, say, at more than £100 per year.  Under the rules of Schedule D, as the Minister is aware, the whole basis of assessment under Schedule B has long since been abolished in Britain&mdash;for about 10 years at least.  To my mind, one of the <Col N="212" /> most significant features of our Finance Bills is the extent to which we reproduce here those features of the British Finance Bills by which we turn the screw tighter on those unfortunates who are in the tax mesh, without at the same time adjusting our tax code to current conditions and without bringing in those modifications introduced in Britain from time to time which have served to ease the lot of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is one further point to which I should like to refer.  As I said at the outset, the tax code is based on outmoded principles.  The economists of the last century are nowadays largely discredited.  They have left us one most unfortunate legacy in our Schedule A income-tax, commonly known as property owners' tax.  I think that is a misnomer: I call it the householders' tax.  These economists of 100 years ago told us that the ordinary householder, the independent type of man who owns his house, perhaps through buying it on mortgage, paying heavy rates, and hard-set, perhaps, to keep it in repair, has what they call a &ldquo;notional cash income&rdquo; from his ownership of that house and it is assessed in tax accordingly.</P>
    <P>Such a man has no more a notional cash income from his house than I have a notional cash income from the shoes on my feet or the hat I wear. It is a crackpot theory.  It operates extremely unfairly against that type of person whom it is most desirable for social reasons to encourage.  He is the man who wants nothing but to pay his way and he acquires his own house, perhaps on mortgage.  His only boast is that he can meet his overheads out of his own slender resources.  The more independent homeowners we have in the State, the more stable will be the population.  This Schedule A tax is based on crackpot economics and I would appeal to the Minister to review it.</P>
    <P>I want to point this out to the Minister too: I think it is a most important point of which some Deputies might not be aware in regard to Schedule A.  Its yield appears at £1,500,000, according to the figures <Col N="213" /> recently made available.  That is a most deceptive figure.  The effective yield of that tax is a lot less than that and I suggest to the Minister that it is correct to say that the only people who are effectively paying their tax under Schedule A are very largely the resident occupiers of their own houses. I am aware that Schedule A tax is assessed on owners of commercial property, on business people, but it is important to remember that those people receive allowances in computing their profits under Schedule D, commercial profits, and an allowance is given them on tax already paid under Schedule A.</P>
    <P>As far as they are concerned it is obvious that what the Minister makes on the swings under Schedule A is lost on the roundabouts under Schedule D. If the tax is abolished, therefore, there will be nothing like a loss of £1,500,000 because a considerable portion will be recouped under Schedule D.  Pending the abolition of this tax, I suggest to the Minister that the time has come to make some concession to the independent homeowners by restoring the repair allowance, which I think was abolished at some time during the &rsquo;30's.</P>

      <P>There is undoubtedly a need to review the whole income-tax code now.  Unfortunately, I feel that it is a problem coming for examination not at the best time as there is a certain urgency in regard to other problems which affect this one. But I suppose we have got to take it as it is.  In regard to this examination, the first thing I would like to say is this: the examination should be on a practical basis with a view to definite implementation.  It would not be sufficient to draw general conclusions. In fact, many of those have been drawn for us already.  It is a question of translating into practical fact and practical legislation provisions for collecting the taxes that are required. I am not going to go so far as to say the whole question of income-tax in principle should be examined, but maybe it should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxation of industry has been dealt with fairly fully in the report <Col N="214" /> which has been mentioned and I do not intend to delay on that.  There are other aspects of the matter as well as that. I think there is something in the contention that the present incidence of taxation where industry is concerned has a certain inhibiting effect and that there is a case for revising it, and particularly for revising it with a view to stimulating development and the replacement of plant.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the question of the incidence of taxation on the community as a whole.  The last Deputy spoke of a class of people with whom everybody has a great deal of sympathy&mdash;the lower paid salaried classes, the so called white-collar workers.  Up to about ten years ago workers in other grades were not taxed because of their rates of pay.  Tax did not attach to them; there was no question of collecting it from them and, consequently, they were not so interested in the question of income-tax except in so far as income-tax was advocated by certain people, who professed to represent them, as a mode of getting money off other classes.</P>
    <P>That situation has changed very much in recent years, seeing that workers in these categories are now faced with the problem of taxation. Nevertheless, the load has tended to fall on the middle register even more strongly than it did before.  One finds that the clerical worker is completely unable to avoid the payment of tax, whereas in other classes of employment the incidence of income-tax is more elastic.  The question which must be worked out in the national interest and in the interest of justice is how much must be taken from that class of worker in comparison with other classes.  The answer will not be found merely in an adjustment of the scales.</P>
    <P>The rates of pay of people employed in manual labour, even of a casual sort, are now, in most cases, sufficient to attract the attention of the Revenue Commissioners so that tax is payable in respect of them.  Nevertheless, there are problems of collection and so forth that need attention.  First of all, an outcry in respect of income-tax is coming <Col N="215" /> from a quarter from which it did not come before.  I do not think that calls for much comment, as it simply means the problem of finding the money for all of us to live in the community is being spread over a larger number in the community.  In the second place, it must be looked at from the point of view that it means a levelling up at one end or a levelling down at the other in incomes, so that the problem of providing the money for our own housekeeping is being levelled out over the whole community more evenly.</P>
    <P>This involves another type of administrative problem&mdash;how is this income, particularly in respect of casual workers, particularly in respect of certain manual work which may be intermittent, to be provided for?  The pay-as-you-earn system has been advocated, but I think it was Deputy Morrissey who pointed out that even that solution is not without its disadvantages. Some solution needs to be found, particularly in reference to the permanently employed worker who has no escape from paying income-tax.  That is the fair play side of it, but the other side represents the point of view of the worker who, in various ways, is earning a certain income that is taxable but in respect of whom the tax return is not made equally but by divers successive employers.  Many of us know of such cases.  That worker's taxable income may be traced down and the man may find himself faced with a large debt to the Revenue Commissioners. He then has a problem.  I know of such problems and I know of cases where people have emigrated to escape them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known of such cases.  In fairness to the rest of the community and to the people themselves some adjustment is needed there.  If a man finds himself faced with a bill of £200 or £300, if he is a single man he is likely to say: &ldquo;My fare is only so much.  I am off&rdquo;.  I have not yet heard of such people coming back under other names to repeat the process, but that would seem to be the <Col N="216" /> logical thing to happen under this system.  That is a fault in our system and what the answer is I do not know. This &ldquo;tax evasion&rdquo; does mean a disproportionate division of the burden, as the last Deputy pointed out.</P>
      <P>So much for the narrow viewpoint in respect of income-tax&mdash;that is, thinking of it as income-tax and of the ordinary mechanics of collecting it and thinking in terms of adjusting the system.  Over all, there is another side of this which affects both industry and farming.  The last Deputy complained about the farmers.  I do not think we should lose sight of one important fact in respect of farmers.  That is, that we all live on the farmers.  It is not inappropriate that I, representing a city constituency, should point that out.  As a community we live and depend on the farming community. Without going into a general debate on the subject, our urgent problem is to step up our production in our main industry, agriculture, and also we must be aware of the fact that it is the exports of our farmers' produce that enable us to maintain the standard of living we have.  Whether we be salaried workers, workers on a building scheme, businessmen or professional men, by and large, with the sole exception of such other industries as are exporting&mdash;we have one or two significant exports as well as agriculture&mdash;our agricultural exports are our mainstay.  It is by virtue of our agricultural exports that we maintain the standard of living we enjoy and that the money that is left after the deduction of income-tax is of any value to us at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very proper to point out that we have heard cases argued, which no Government have completely accepted, for the complete derating of agricultural land.  Certainly, on all sides there is agreement on the importance of giving such reliefs and encouragements as are given to the farmers.  I am not so sure that, because of their primary importance, similar principles should not rule in our taxation code.  That principle may be extended also to such industries as are earning for us as a community.  Those are industries which are producing for <Col N="217" /> export.  If you wish to include them in that category I will not quarrel because both are in a vitally important position, taking economics by and large, in the world in which we live. That being so, I for one would have no hesitation in subscribing in principle to the idea that these particular activities may call for a preferential, if you like to use that word, or a privileged treatment.  In fact, it is not a privileged position.  It is simply good business for the rest of us.</P>
    <P>I would like to warn the Minister for Finance, when he comes to set up a commission for the examination of a problem of this kind, that he does not approach the question purely with an accountant's viewpoint.  It is unnecessary to talk about the academic approach because I do not think we need worry about the academic economists, who, so far, do not appear to have deduced anything worth while. In getting down to the practical business of running the country, the Minister for Finance, is, to some extent, in the position of the accountant of the firm.  That is a very vital and important position.  Life is a dynamic thing and we have to take into the business of running the country the managerial functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture.  These are equally important in this problem, to mention only two of the other important factors.  The purely accountant's approach to this matter would be extremely dangerous.  I think the matter should be approached from the larger point of view, from the point of view of the necessity for stimulating our exports and of producing towards that end, the necessity for stimulating activity at home here with the very particular objective of cutting out all importations from abroad, whether necessary or unnecessary, in any category where we can produce them at home, thus conserving our purchasing power abroad for the essentials which, in modern times, we must import to maintain our standards.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, and I hope he will, seeks the co-operation of this side of the House in this matter, every co-operation <Col N="218" /> will, as Deputy Lemass said, be given to him.  There is the necessity for looking into this problem and for getting a practical result from the examination of it.  In doing so, I would ask the Minister to keep the managerial aspect of the problem in mind as against the purely arithmetical or accountancy approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>How many businesses have had this experience; they have salesmen out in the working territory opening accounts or selling some line.  They have an accountancy department collecting accounts. If the accounts department and the sales department are not properly co-ordinated, and the accounts department is too greedy to get in the money, it sometimes can happen that the accounts which the salesmen open are closed down because the accounts department is in too much of a hurry to collect the money.</P>
    <P>In the light of that, then, where the farmers are concerned, I do not think that we should be led into a controversy as to who, or what, are paying in relative proportions.  By all means, let us get fairness and justice but one must look at the other fundamental aspects of the country's life as well.  It will not help the people who are in receipt of salaries and wages to divert their attention from what is the real position to the discrepancy between what the farmers' position is and what their position is.  There is something much greater than that involved and the less said about that aspect of the subject, the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Major de Valera has said about the undesirability of trying to set one section of our people against another, not with the object of trying to improve everybody's position, but with the object of loading everybody with an equal burden.  I am sorry that Deputy Byrne took the line he did in regard to taxation of our agricultural producers.  With that exception, I find a great deal to admire in his speech and it was a very valuable contribution to this debate.  We sometimes forget that farmers have one good year, and perhaps two, out of <Col N="219" /> three.  They have one good year and they have long intervals of what some of them regard as a disastrous peace. We are emerging now from an era when the farmers enjoyed a sellers' market.  Our farmers, in particular, are facing very serious competition abroad.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Byrne vitiated his argument by citing as a general one a solitary case of a well-capitalised and well-managed farm that has been in the hands of one family for many generations and telling us of the enormous profits made.  I would suggest to Deputy Byrne that he look up the agricultural statistics and see how many of our farmers own enough land to provide them with anything more than a mere subsistence.  There is no use in trying to get, out of a desire to impose upon everybody the same sort of imposition as income-tax payers, are subjected to, from farmers, year after year, a return under Schedule E.  Many of them would find it a task beyond their capacity to do so.  Even if everyone were compelled to do so, the return to the Exchequer would be insignificant in the extreme.  As Deputy Egan, and some others, in their reservation to the report, have pointed out, the probabilities are that probably not more than 10, and certainly not more than 20 per cent. of the agricultural producers would fall to be assessed for income-tax at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to deal with the administration of this country with regard only to that aspect, and not to the practical effects which will follow from our actions, I am afraid we shall find ourselves in a very queer position.  I am not aware that any businessman operating his business operates it with regard only to the principle of social justice.  He looks at the practical side of things and says: &ldquo;Is it worth my while to bring everybody inside the net?  Is it not much better that I should let these small fish escape because if I try to catch <Col N="220" /> them the cost of doing it will be very much more?&rdquo;  That is the way in which a Minister for Finance dealing with this business in a practical way has to look at it.  I know, of course, that there are politicians imbued with a certain political philosophy to whom the landowner is little better than vermin, something to be exterminated, but we have not evolved to that degree yet in this country.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that, there is something to be said for cherishing our farmers, for treating them with some greater consideration, perhaps, than we extend to other producers in the community.  They are the one section of producers who have to sell in a very highly competitive market.  They are the one section of producers who are subject to all the vicissitudes and risks of the weather.  They are the one section of producers who have to work hard, no matter how they may feel from day to day, and they are also the one section of producers whose terms of production&mdash;that is not precisely the phrase I want to use&mdash;is a long one. The farmers do not just walk into a shop and having opened it say: &ldquo;I will have ten, 12, 20 or 30 individuals coming in here.  I have everything put on my shelf and I will sell at a profit to-day.&rdquo;  Their transactions are long term speculations; they have to look ahead.  They have to take a gamble with all the unforeseen circumstances that may arise as between one year and another and even between one month and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely what has happened in regard to cattle prices within the last four or five months should make us all realise that the agricultural community cannot be treated precisely the same way as you can deal with those connected with ordinary manufacturing industry or ordinary commercial operations. Therefore, even for that reason alone, there is no justification and no sound ground for trying to equate the position of the farmer with that of an industrialist who enjoys in this country a very highly protected market or with that of the worker who has his conditions of employment set out for him and who has a whole corpus of social <Col N="221" /> welfare legislation to betide him over bad times if he should be called upon to endure them.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this problem on which it would be well if we pondered.  We all know&mdash;it is a commonplace of our ordinary economic discussions&mdash;that our agriculture is under-capitalised and the fact that it is under-capitalised is manifested by the many demands we hear to provide our farmers with cheap capital.  Would somebody tell me what is the rationality of collecting something from the farmers in the form of income-tax at very considerable expense, having regard to the return which would be received, and then giving it back to him at further expense in the form of cheap loans or heavy subsidies?  Is it not much better that we should, for the time being, until Irish agriculture has developed to the situation in which it can compete equally in the world market with products of those economies which have developed over generations and which have not been subjected to the vicissitudes of our Irish farmers, allow whatever profits the farmer may make to remain in his own hand to fructify?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ with the Deputy.  It may be that our farmers are not so prone to invest as they were during the periods 1920, 1921 and 1922, the period which I remember very well when our farmers not merely took their money out of the banks but went into the banks and involved themselves very heavily with the banks, and as a consequence of that, in 1930, 1931 and 1932, farms were lying derelict because the farmers could not meet their obligations to the banks or even the Land Commission. Our farmers have long memories; they have to have long memories.  They remember the boom conditions that existed during the war of 1914-18 and afterwards, and they remember, too, how because they were filled then with the spirit of optimism, they wanted to acquire more and more land, wanted, if you like, to farm more progressively, <Col N="222" /> and involved themselves in these heavy commitments that they were unable to face.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that they are very wise in accumulating deposits in the banks.  It might be better&mdash;I think it would be better&mdash;if they took them out and reinvested them in their own industry. But I am sure Deputy Byrne knows as well as I do that these deposits do not remain stagnant in the banks.  They are going into Irish manufacturing industry.  If the farmers do not use their own money, other people are using it for them.  Let us look at this thing in its proper perspective; perhaps it is regrettable from the point of view of Irish farmers that they do not employ more of their capital in their own land and in their own industry, but if they did the people who are trying to live in the cities would be crying out because we should find it more difficult and more expensive to get capital for our manufacturing industries.  However, what I intended to say when Deputy Byrne set me off in this digression was that from the point of view of the general community, and it does not matter which side of the House I would be on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, and if you will only go to the country I will be.  It is much better that, instead of going after the Irish farmer merely to put him in the same miserable plight as the urban income-tax payer, we should allow the money to remain in the Irish farmer's pocket.  It would be best of all if he would use it on his own land and in his own industry but, if he does not use it on his own land, there are other people who will come along and use it for him, and are using it for him. It is a wrong approach to this whole question to say that we must, because we are groaning under the burden of income-tax, bring in the farmers and make them groan as well.  I do not think that is the sort of angelic chorus we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income-tax is a rather dubious tax in some cases because it is essentially <Col N="223" /> a tax on production.  It is a tax which discourages people from working as hard as they otherwise might.  No tax, let me say at once, is a virtue.  Taxation has nothing but disadvantages, by and large.  I said that income-tax is an objectionable tax fundamentally because it is, in its present form, a tax upon earnings, a tax upon labour, a tax upon industry and a tax upon enterprise.  From that point of view it is fundamentally unsound but as against that you have other taxes, indirect taxes, which are taxes upon expenditure and, if it were not for income-tax, we would speedily find ourselves in the position in which we were, before the Fianna Fáil Government changed the situation and freed tea and sugar from taxation, of being taxed upon foodstuffs.  Therefore, since we have to get the money in some way, we have had to have recourse to the fact that we cannot get all the money by taxing expenditure and we have been forced to fall back on the fact that, where earnings seem to be large by comparison with the general average, we should take from those who receive this much larger than average &mdash;I shall not use the word &ldquo;normal&rdquo;&mdash; remuneration some part of what they earn.</P>
    <P>But we have gone a long way from regarding income-tax as being merely a supplement to indirect taxes, a supplement to taxes upon expenditure.  It has now become one of the principal elements in our tax structure and it has become that to such an extent that it has now evolved into what is in my view an inequitable tax, inequitable because it has become so burdensome upon a comparatively small proportion of our people.  If the Minister for Finance were in a position to do so, I would re-echo what the Parliamentary Secretary said last year: the best way of helping this economy would be to reduce the standard rate of income-tax.</P>

We see, first of all, that under Schedule D, which may be described roughly as taxation upon profits and ownership, whereas in 1938-39 £2,950,000 was collected from all these sources, representing 58.1 per cent. of the total yield from income-tax, in 1954-1955 the yield had increased to £13,480,000, representing 63.1 per cent. of the total yield from income-tax and representing a yield which, expressed as a percentage of <Col N="226" /> the 1938-39 figures, was 457 per cent. Similarly, under Schedule E, which as everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy repeat the last figures he gave us and show how he gets the increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>457 per cent.&mdash;the yield expressed as a percentage of the 1938-39 figure, which is the only way in which the significance of it can be brought out.  We were collecting 457 per cent. more under Schedule D, than we were in 1938-39.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in regard to Schedule E, tax on earnings, in the year 1938-39, the total yield was £915,000, representing 18 per cent. of the yield from income-tax.  In 1954-55, that yield increased to £5,713,000, representing 26.8 per cent&mdash;we may say 27 per cent. That is an increase of 50 per cent. in the fraction of the whole which Schedule E represents.  But, expressed as a percentage of the 1938-39 figures, the yield was 622 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that, under circumstances like those, when one sees these figures, it is easy to realise why it is that people are not disposed to earn overtime.  There was a time when people would like to work overtime. There was a time when people would like to earn a few pounds more than they normally earn.  We realise now why most people are reluctant almost to increase their earnings, particularly if these are earnings which are inevitably going to come under the review of the tax collectors.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from that, there is an obvious element of social injustice because, after all, while the percentage received from Schedule E tax has gone up by 50 per cent.&mdash;there is a 50 per cent. greater proportion of the total yield from the tax than in 1938-39&mdash; the earnings upon which this tax is assessed have declined very substantially in real value per unit of currency.  That is shown in Table 47 on page 75 where we find that, although the exemption rate for earned income has jumped from £150 in 1938-39 to £240 in 1955-56, in terms of 1938 values it has in fact declined to £102.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> It is difficult to try and convey what that means.  It means, as far as I can follow it, that if we were suddenly to be transported backwards in time and we were to be living again in 1938, we should, instead of having £150 of earned income exempted, have £102 of earned income exempted from income-tax. Similarly&mdash;and perhaps this is a bit easier to explain&mdash;if I were a single person living in 1938-39, I should be getting an allowance of £125.  That allowance has been increased in monetary terms to £150.  But if I were back again living in 1938 then, in terms of 1938 values, what I am getting at the present day would only be worth £64 to me.  The same thing is true in regard to the married allowance. Though it looks in terms of money to represent a substantial increase over the allowances given in 1938-39, in real fact it is a little bit more than half of what a married person would have got in 1938-39.</P>
    <P>One can go entirely through Table 47 and everywhere one will see that, in relation to every other tax which we are imposing&mdash;and not excepting the taxes on beer, cigarettes, tobacco and other things&mdash;our income-tax imposition has become progressively heavier and is falling with particular severity upon the employed person.  I do not want to go on here all day about this, but there are many other figures which would be worth pondering over in this.</P>
    <P>The main plea I am going to make to the Minister is this.  I think we should have this examination of income-tax as it affects all classes of taxpayers, but we should particularly have it in relation to its incidence upon those who are employed and upon those who are dependent or whose income is mainly derived from the carrying on of a business or profession, whether that income accrues to them as the owner or as the employee in it.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we should consider whether we have not reached the stage at which income-tax has become positively detrimental to our continued economic development.  It is, at its present rate, highly inflationary.  It leads to all sorts of abuse.  I do not <Col N="228" /> want to try and shirk any part of the personal responsibility I may have had for the fact that it is standing at 7/6; but will somebody tell me what very great difference is 6/6 compared to 7/6, when you are considering income-tax as an inflationary factor in an already inflationary situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is much more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind it is not. I think that you have already, with the rate of 6/6, long passed the danger line, and that, if we are going to try and get any sort of control over our general price level and if we are going to try to effect it in any way, one of the first things you must consider seriously is the effect of income-tax upon all sorts of costs&mdash;and not merely on all sorts of costs, but upon all sorts of, perhaps, unjustifiable and improvident expenditure.</P>
      <P>These are the things which I would suggest to the Minister.  I think we have reached the stage at which there is no use in talking now about what happened in 1947 or 1948, about what happened in 1951, 1952 or 1953.  I believe we are facing a very serious situation in this country and, fortunately or unfortunately, perhaps to the relief of many of us, it is the Government which made the promises and produced the situation that now has got to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the discussion on this section has centred around the possible setting up of a committee of inquiry into the income-tax code generally.  I have listened very carefully, as one who has no financial training whatever, to learn from the speeches made by men who have had experience in this House of dealing with financial matters and have been charged with the responsibility of guiding this State for many years.  I felt that the discussion was rather fantastic at the present time.  Deputy MacEntee, in his closing remarks, in the last sentence he spoke, painted a true picture of the situation.  In that short sentence he indicated that he realised that a serious position was facing this country, <Col N="229" /> and, rightly or wrongly, he said, he was more or less relieved that it was the present Government who would have the responsibility of meeting that serious situation.</P>
      <P>The position is that all Deputies are anxious for an inquiry to be held in order to establish whether the present system of imposing and collecting income-tax is fair and just to all sections of the community.  We had, on the one hand, speakers suggesting&mdash;I think, Deputy Morrissey and others&mdash; that, as far as the income-tax code was concerned, it was preventing the producers from expanding.  It was harsh, and there was no incentive for production on the part of the producers. Deputy Morrissey did not tell us to whom he referred as the producers. Was he referring to the agricultural industry, or to the industrial arm that has been set up here in the last 30 years?  Other speakers spoke about the harsh imposition income-tax means to the salaried and wage-earning classes, and, naturally, the general feeling throughout the House was that, so far as the farming community was concerned, they could not be touched at all.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Paddy Byrne for what I think was his maiden speech in this House.  He gave a very clear, concise statement setting forth his own personal views.  Perhaps Deputies as a whole did not agree with his findings and his solutions, but nobody can contradict the figures and facts he has given.  I shall come back to that again having arrived at the position that all sections of the community are clamouring for investigation, that they have complaints regarding the imposition of income-tax and want to sit around the table and take a bigger bite out of what Deputy Aiken describes as the national loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see, judging by figures made available to us in the last ten days, figures of the most grave import for our future as a nation, the inquiry that is to be set up to examine income-tax will have very little to examine if we continue losing our people at the rate we have lost them in the <Col N="230" /> last five years.  It is ridiculous to talk about dividing the cake in more equal portions when the people who should be producing are decreasing in numbers.  If we face the situation bluntly and seriously, from that point of view, we would not be arguing here for a day on who should carry another 6d.  or be relieved of 1/- with regard to income-tax; there is a far more serious matter facing us, and that is production and the stopping of emigration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey made it quite clear that his view was that some people had or would have to work for the Government for six months of the year at the present rate of taxation, and that nobody felt like doing that. The suggestion, I presume, he is making is that the income-tax burden should be relieved as far as the industrial groups are concerned.  On the whole, those engaged in industry for the past 30 years have got a fair crack of the whip.  I do not think it can be denied that all Governments were sympathetic and helpful to all those who wished to establish industrial concerns in the State.  We had the tariff walls, quotas, State loans, guarantees of all sorts, to those anxious to set up, and to this day protection is provided and foreign goods are not allowed in here except under certain circumstances; they are not allowed at any rate to do harm to what is produced within the State.  Are we to take it that they are not satisfied with that protection, and that those industrialists, to expand further now, want further reliefs with regard to taxation?  I think they have got a fair crack, and they should not press too far on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke about stimulating production as far as industrialists were concerned.  I remember within the last fortnight I happened to go into a particular hotel. There was a large gathering there of prominent businessmen and industrialists from all over Ireland.  While I was waiting for my meal which was being prepared, I went into the lounge and sat down and watched.  In the course of that wait of three-quarters of an hour, quite a number of those gentlemen had refreshments at the bar, <Col N="231" /> and for curiosity I just counted how many Irish whiskeys were sold in that three-quarters of an hour.  There were three Jamesons sold, and 14 Scotch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, Sir.  Those are the people who are asking for relief with regard to taxation in income-tax and so forth, who are saying that the burden as it stands at the present moment as far as income-tax is concerned, lies too heavily on them. They want that burden reduced.  Not alone do they want it reduced, but they want protection for their industries. But when it comes down to setting a good example of supporting home industries they are prepared to spend their own money on something which comes in from outside.  They cannot have it every way.  I merely told that little story as an example of the mentality of possibly many of those people who want jam on it in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is quite a lot to be said for the case stated by both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Byrne with regard to salaried groups and wage earners.  There is no escape for them at all, but they would be satisfied if they did not find others every day of the week, escaping the net, who should be brought into the net as well. Their biggest criticism is the fact that their next door neighbour is getting away with something because loopholes are available or the inspectors are not aware of the situation with regard to the individuals concerned. As a matter of fact, apart from anything else, I think this House should set a good example.  I do not know whether I am in order in stating this, but the House that imposes income-tax, if it was only for the sake of setting a good example, should be the first to pay the income-tax imposed on the Dáil allowances or the Dáil salary. In my opinion, there should be no such thing as freedom for one section in this House to tax people outside while not <Col N="232" /> being liable for income-tax on what they receive as members of this House. They should set the good example in that regard.  Perhaps there is no harm in setting up a committee of inquiry into the income-tax code.  There was a commission that inquired into the problem of emigration for a number of years, but we do not see much sign of their report being implemented by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has this to do with it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that this question of committees to inquire into this business is sheer waste of time.  There is nothing but committees being set up to examine problems in this country.  I do not know whether it is a fair comparison or not, but this House is like Nero fiddling while Rome burns.  This House is discussing petty little matters while the life's blood of the country is leaving it every week. No real steps are being taken by this Government, or were taken by the previous Government, to deal with the major evils that beset us.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne mentioned in the course of his very interesting speech that the farming community subscribe very little, as far as income-tax is concerned. He gave figures that should interest this House with regard to holdings.  When those figures are given by a city Deputy like Deputy Byrne, possibly more heed will be paid to them and he may impress the House more than I would, although I have given the very same figures with regard to holdings for years past in this House.</P>
      <P>The position at the moment is that there are 11,600 odd holdings in this country with a total poor law valuation of £2,250,000 and there are almost 280,000 holdings with a valuation of slightly less than £2,000,000.  In other words, 11,600 holdings represent 3 per cent.  of the holdings of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Three per cent.  of <Col N="233" /> the number have a valuation of over £2,000,000; 70 per cent.  of the number of holdings have a valuation of less than £2,000,000.  That is the situation and there is agricultural stagnation. Let us face it from that point of view.</P>
      <P>In spite of the so-called tremendous work done by land re-distribution programmes and so forth, no real impact was made on the group in the valuation scale over the £100 mark.  It cannot be denied that the small man in the State has to produce in order to live.  His methods may be bad.  I shall not develop this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, except to come to the point that Deputy Byrne made.  A small man has to produce in order to rear his family.  The man in the over £100 valuation group is not paying income-tax. Deputy MacEntee says that he is a producer, that we all depend on the farmer, that he should not have to pay income-tax, that he should be allowed to plough this money back into production and to fructify.  What do we find?  We find that the money is deposited, perhaps, in the banks.  Nobody sees where it goes then.  Perhaps, if the Minister for Finance cannot get money for a national loan, he puts the squeeze on the bankers and gets some of that.  Perhaps it is invested, without the farmer realising it, in British securities.</P>
      <P>My point is that, as far as the farmer is concerned, if he feels like putting it in the bank, that is fair enough.  As long as he knows it is safe and that he can draw a certain amount in interest rates, he does not mind if the banks give it over to the Government for reinvestment within the State.  There is no need to ask the farmer to withdraw it.  We know perfectly well that the farming community, those with money, are a conservative people and slow to change their attitude and mentality.  They regard the bank as the safest place in which to put their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mistake all of us in this House have been making up to the present is that we have decided that, because the farmer puts his money in the bank, the State should have no say in where that money goes afterwards.  The State <Col N="234" /> should have a great say.  As long as the farmer is in the position that, if he wants to withdraw a dowry for his daughter, he can do so, as long as he can withdraw £700, if he so desires, he does not mind what use his money is put to in the meantime.  The position is that the commercial banks are putting this money to use outside the State.  Until there is a decision made in this House, as far as responsibility for the spending of that money or its control is concerned, that the commercial banks must toe the line of Government policy, we will not be able to do very much about the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the question of income-tax for the farming community.  Deputy Byrne made it quite clear that he was not anxious to have income-tax imposed on the medium and smaller sized farmers.  I do not think anybody can criticise him for his method of approach.  His argument is&mdash;he gave specific examples&mdash; that there are very large so-called farmers in this country at the present moment who are not getting the production out of their land.  Where I agree with Deputy Byrne is that something must be done in order to get the production out of that land.  Whether his solution is the right one or not, I cannot say at this moment.  There are many views on it. Dr. Lucey of Cork has views on it that should commend themselves in many respects to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of imposing income-tax on the farmers is, in general, one that does not appeal to any Deputy and Deputy Byrne remarked, rather cynically, that he felt that no Government would be prepared to go to the country on that issue.  I think it would not be safe for them to go out of the House, if they brought in a programme that the farming community should be subject to income-tax generally.  I do not think Deputy Byrne meant to suggest that or that it should be done in any case. Whatever else I may have to say on <Col N="235" /> this matter, I would like to get this in: that some way must be evolved.  If it is not a matter of getting a return from these large so-called farmers through income-tax, we will have to get that return in some other way.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is&mdash;I do not know whether it is appropriate on this&mdash;that all those farmers with valuations extending from £100 and in many cases up to £600 and £700 should have their valuations doubled on every pound over the £100 valuation.  If they kick against that there is one solution.  They can sell the land and there should be one purchaser for the land and that should be the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer is the primary producer and it would be outrageous at this stage to suggest that the farming community as a whole should be subject to income-tax.  The Minister will have to examine very closely what action lies within his power in connection with the group I have mentioned and which other Deputies have mentioned&mdash;the group of individuals who hold land to the valuation of £2,250,000.  If we can get something done in that respect, I maintain that it will ease considerably the Minister's problem and he will not have to suffer the embarrassment of coming in here at Budget time asking for permission to increase the income-tax rate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the position, as I see it, is that we have the organised worker, the salaried group, the wage earner on one side asking for a certain amount of ease in connection with income-tax. We have the industrialists, the big business magnates, on the other hand, suggesting that they cannot increase their output unless they get relief so far as the income-tax code is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The Minister now suggests that he will have an inquiry held and try to thrash out some solution.  I cannot see how any solution can be thrashed out when you have such divergent views expressed in this House.  There is no question in the world that if you have £100 and you have three sections of the community demanding their own share of that £100 the strongest and best organised section may grab the biggest portion of the £100.  When times change, another section may best them and get a better whack but that same £100 has not increased.  All that happens is that the demands by each group on the £100 are getting bigger and more insistent and that, mark you, at a time when production has not increased and when the output from our primary industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash;is going down so that, perhaps, in order to satisfy the people in question, the industrialists, the big business people, the worker and the salaried worker, etc., the Minister is setting up this inquiry. Maybe in two years' time or so a recommendation will be made.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any recommendation made in two or three years on conditions existing at the moment will be realistic and can be fulfilled at all but if it suits the political situation and eases the pressure on the Minister and on all sides of the House to have this inquiry held, I suppose there is really no harm involved in holding the inquiry.  It may postpone the time when real action has to be taken not upon a question of income-tax but upon a question of production so that the present income-tax burden as it stands can be borne by all groups concerned without further cribbing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend of this debate seems to have been as to whether or not there is a sufficient measure of taxation in regard to the farm or the factory.  The speakers on both sides of the House&mdash;I should also like to draw attention to Deputy McQuillan's position speaking from the centre&mdash;more or less talked as if Ireland were the universe, as if there were not any outside influences, as if the Minister for Finance had no problems and as if this country could levy taxation as it liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> The first thing we must remember is that Ireland is not the universe; that Ireland itself is a country which is, I suppose, affected more than any other European country by the winds of economic storms which may come from anywhere, America or England.  For that reason and having regard to the peculiar structural framework of our economic set-up, it is rather silly to hear people say that industry bears too great taxation or that farming does not bear enough.  These ideas must, of course, be examined by the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture minutely before anybody can come along and make broad sweeping statements that may probably hit the headlines in to-morrow's papers, gain or lose votes for one or other of us here and may please or displease certain sections of the electorate.</P>
    <P>The thing we must remember is that successive Ministers for Finance, no matter from what side of the House they came, had a problem which was that Ireland had fought all her wars over a period of 700 years because of land.  The wars were the land wars. Secondly, beside us, within a few hours distance for goods as well as passenger traffic, there was a huge empire which should, I think, be properly termed an industrial empire.</P>
    <P>When we gained our independence there had to be protection and in such a situation there had to be palliatives and encouragements for the farmer and to believe that this could be changed or turned right-about in 30 years is, of course, ridiculous because palliatives form a habit and an economic trend.  We must deal with the facts.  We cannot just say that the farmers are overtaxed.  We cannot just say that industry is overtaxed.  We cannot just say that the farmers are getting everything or that the industrialist is sitting behind a 33? per cent. imperial tariff and that everything for him in the garden is lovely.  It is not right to say all these things about the present Minister for Finance or any past Minister for Finance.  The approach must be factual.  Largely, the approach <Col N="238" /> has been the same.  Successive Ministers for Finance may have varied in regard to the imposition of taxation, as the approach of Parties dictated it and as their personal approach to problems dictated it.  Parties may have said that food subsidies must eventually disappear and, on the other hand, they may have said that they will maintain food subsidies.  These are the things which affect taxation and the Bill before us to-day.</P>
    <P>It is just plain codology to make sweeping statements.  There were arguments in relation to the 50 per cent. taxation on anything manufactured on the Continent of Europe and the 33? per cent.  on anything that is manufactured by the British people next door &mdash;that is, in relation to anything that is not manufactured in this country. Farmers point out that they must pay the 33? per cent. tax on their requirements which are not produced in this country and yet must sell on a market which takes no account of the 33? per cent.  they had to pay for the machinery, implements and raw materials they used in the production of the finished product.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrialist may say that taxation presses too heavily on him and that farmers are not taxed. The farmer may say that he pays far more rates than the person who gains a similar income in industry or in ordinary commerce and that there is no means by which he can avoid paying those rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle was accepted many years ago of relief of agricultural rates.  It still exists in the form of a relief from the payment of a certain amount of money per year if the farmer employs a man for the 52 weeks.  That trend, which was established so long ago, whereby the farmer pays far more rates than anybody else is still in existence.  Deputy Byrne, and I think all the Deputies who have spoken, will appreciate that the farmer pays rates on his house and, in addition, pays rates on his land.  The <Col N="239" /> amount of rates he pays on his land is much larger than the amount of rates the average businessman pays on the premises in which he carries on his business&mdash;if he does not carry it on in his pocket, as he often does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  The farmer pays far more rates than the average businessman. Take, for example, a businessman earning £500 a year.  He pays a certain amount in rates on a small shop. After that, he pays income-tax.  A farmer with an income of £500 a year pays rates on his house, based on the same method of assessment as that for the businessman, and also on his outhouses which would, I am sure, even there, always be of greater cubic capacity.  Therefore, a higher rate would be struck on the farmer than on the shopkeeper.  After that, he must pay for what I regard as his stock-in-trade, namely, his farm, the ground his cattle walk on, and his crops grow on.</P>
      <P>Similarly, one could say in reply to Deputy Byrne that there was a time when rates meant just the expenditure on the roads and, maybe, the poorhouse in two major towns in the county.  That is not the case to-day. Many other things have been heaped on the rates.  The Health Act demands a 50 per cent.  contribution from the local rate.  In my constituency, we voted £55,000 towards it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  At the same time, the man who is earning £500 a year in Dublin, while he pays income-tax, is not paying on the same valuation.  He is merely paying on his small shop, but he is not paying on what I regard as the farmer's stock-in-trade, his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the industrialist can put up a case that he is paying certain taxes.  If his company is a limited company he can point out that he is paying 7/6 in the £ on every £ he earns.  Of course he is, but so is every businessman in every other country in <Col N="240" /> the world&mdash;and the businessman here is enjoying a 33? per cent.  protection and 50 per cent.  protection if he competes against a rival on the Continent.</P>
    <P>In my view, all these things are what I would call &ldquo;pressure group arguments&rdquo; and pressure group arguments would be an irritant to every politician in this House at some time or another, irrespective of the side of the House on which he might be sitting. We must say to all these pressure groups that any case they may put up to the Government as it stands to-day will be examined, not in the light of the pressure group argument that highlights the silver lining of the cloud that hangs over the other and the black cloud that hangs over themselves, but in the light of the common good.  In my view, this Bill has examined the matter in the light of the common good.  No section of the community can say they have been treated badly or roughly or have been forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am sure that when I sit down there will be plenty of Deputies to stand up and introduce again arguments in favour of their own constituency or their own cartel, but it is not right to do so because we are here not as agitators but as legislators and, please God, we will always be here as such.  I believe this Bill meets the difficult circumstances that exist as well, as comprehensively, and as kindly as possible, and I congratulate the Minister upon it.</P>

      <P>Any Minister for Finance has got to find the wherewithal to carry on for the 12 months.  The trouble in this country is that we have now piled up so much dead money&mdash;so much money that must go without bringing any return&mdash;that the burden has become too heavy on every producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount for the service of the national debt of this country has gone up from £4,000,000 in 1948 to £13,000,000 to-day&mdash;and that must be paid every year.  That represents an extra £9,000,000 which the Government must find.  Then they must get an extra £4,500,000 for the civil servants to-day compared with five years ago.  That represents £13,500,000 extra which the Government must find in the first instance.  I admit that a fair share of <Col N="241" /> it has been found.  I asked some questions here to-day and the answers I got are most enlightening as to where the wherewithal is coming from.  We have an increase in the revenue derived from petrol taxation, customs duties and motor vehicles duties.  In 1950-51 the revenue derived from petrol was £3,630,000; to-day it is £7,557,000, that is £4,000,000 straight away.</P>

      <P>I have heard a lot of tripe here this evening about income-tax on the farmers and it is just as well to get down to bedrock as quickly as we can.  I would like to say, in the first instance, that what Deputy Donegan said here is exactly true as regards rates.  While all this income for the Minister comes out of petrol, every gallon of that petrol is putting more rates on the farmers because it is tearing up the roads and the farmers must keep these roads fit for the motor cars by means of expenditure from the rates.  That is number one consideration.</P>
      <P>The second thing that we find here in connection with the farmers is that this Government has taken good care to collect a queer amount of income-tax from the farmers since it came into office.  It does not matter which hand you put into a man's pocket when you are bringing the hand out full, and the tax of £5 per ton or 12/6 a barrel on the farmers' wheat meant that a tax of £1,700,000 was paid by the farmers who grew wheat.</P>

We have to provide the money here, but if we cannot produce here the things that the people need, then money must be found to buy them and it is collected by income-tax.  The bulk of it, or apparently a large portion of it is to be collected in income-tax, and income-tax will have to be found now to pay for the 18,000 tons of wheat that have disappeared in 12 months and which those people had to bring in, and also to pay for the 24,000 tons of sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides for income-tax in the coming year.  I think I would be in order in suggesting that one of the points in the programme of the present Minister for Finance was that income-tax would be reduced and I think that was one of the arguments that helped to put him on the other side of the House.  I remember that in the 1952 Budget when income-tax was increased by the Fianna Fáil Government we had weeping and gnashing of teeth by those who compose the present Government and those who supported it.</P>
      <P>I believe that pledges were given at that time that if the electorate supported the members of the then Opposition&mdash;which unfortunately for the electorate since, they did&mdash;income-tax would be reduced.  I am asking the Minister for Finance when will the Government carry out that pledge to the income-tax payers?  It was pointed out at that time that the wage earners, the white collared workers and the salaried workers were carrying an unfair burden.  Yet, this is the second Budget of the present Minister and of the present Government and there is no sign whatever of that El Dorado that was promised to the income-tax payers.  The designate Minister for Finance, on the eve of the last general election, went on the radio and promised that if the people gave support to his Party and to the satellite Parties, he would guarantee them that £10,000,000 would be saved. Why is part of that £10,000,000 not now being devoted to relieving the burden of the income-tax payers?  On that occasion, Deputy McGilligan was like King Midas of old who was reputed to have been able to turn everything to gold.  According to the Taoiseach he was the principal financial genius of the Fine Gael Party; he was a Rothschild and a Reginald McKenna and all the other financial geniuses of the world in the past 100 years rolled into one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no relief given to income-tax payers.  The main argument <Col N="245" /> here this evening has been as to who should and who should not pay income-tax. The people who pay say the other fellow should pay, and <i>vice versa.</i>  Deputy Byrne, making his maiden speech, spoke of the immorality of the present Government because they do not make all the farmers pay income-tax.  I think the Minister for Finance would be able to tell Deputy Byrne that all those farmers are paying substantial income-tax, that, if they are not paying it directly as income-tax on land, they are paying it in many other ways.  Deputy Byrne is surely aware of that.</P>
    <P>Of course all this is good propaganda in the City of Dublin where not a single acre of land is owned by the electors.  It is fine propaganda in Deputy Byrne's constituency, or in any other city constituency, to say that farmers should be taxed, that the farmers are millionaires and should not be allowed to get away with it, while the poor slaves in the cities must pay for everything.  That is fine stuff and the more the latest recruit to the inter-Party Government makes use of it, the better from our point of view. We will make full use of it throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We will tell the people that, according to Deputy Byrne, they should be paying income-tax and that the white collar workers of the cities are slaves, that this immoral Government and the previous immoral Government taxed the wrong type of people. In the long run, that is the sort of stuff that does not go down in this country at all.  That is the sort of stuff advocated by people who know nothing about the farmers, how they live or what they pay in taxes, or what they pay to maintain a lot of drones who live in this country.</P>

      <P>They are the biggest employers in the country.  They are the biggest ratepayers and taxpayers in this community.  The sooner we stop talking about the millionaire farmers, the sooner we will make some progress.  It reminds me of a bit of a <Col N="246" /> poem I learned when I was a boy about the poor man counting his little store 20 times a day or more.  The Minister for Finance has promised an investigation as to whether the burden of taxation lies too heavily on one section or another.  I wish him luck with it.  If such an investigation does nothing more than disillusion the people who live in the cities and who know nothing about agriculture, it will be doing a lot of good.  The one farm singled out by Deputy Byrne and employing about 17 or 18 men is, I suppose, being run as a horticultural industry near the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has mixed farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the farms in the country were run on similar lines, the country would be much poorer.  We probably would not be able to find a market for all that horticultural produce.  We have not got the population in the country to consume the produce of 11,000,000 acres devoted to intensive horticulture with a very large capital investment.  That kind of business could not be called farming at all in the ordinary sense.</P>
      <P>On the general question of income-tax, both Deputy Byrne and the Minister know that the income-tax imposed is a burden on everybody in the community.  All taxes are burdens on everybody, whether they be income-tax, insurance, rates or anything else. The people who pay always say that the other fellow is better able to pay than they are.  We all think the same, and no blame to us.  There is nothing wrong in thinking that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we must continue to export tens of thousands of our people in order that the balance of us can maintain the standard we have at the present time.  It all boils down to that.  In spite of what has been said, we are not increasing our production in industry or from the land.  Still, the demands of the nonproductive sections of the community are growing year by year.  These demands have been growing progressively. This year, the Minister for Finance hopes to raise from taxation between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000&mdash;if <Col N="247" /> he counts the special taxes he put on some weeks ago&mdash;more than was provided for in the Budget he took over when he came into office.</P>

      <P>I want to suggest that, had the Minister and the Government carried out the promises they made to the people two years ago, income-tax would now be reduced to 5/- in the £, because of the fact that overall revenue is so much greater with £10,000,000 additional taxation coming into the Exchequer, as well as £4,000,000 from special taxation.  I hope that before this Bill is passed the Minister will mend his hand and bring in amendments to Section 1, even on Report Stage, providing for reduced taxation.  It will ease his mind and ease the minds of the other city Deputies and let them realise that the agricultural community are going to stand up and fight their corner, and that no pressure group in the city, with the newspapers behind it, will smash the agricultural community completely by its efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported yesterday, I was saying that, in order to discuss the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services satisfactorily, we should have a reasonably complete picture of the year's trading.  These figures are not likely to be available for some time and I asked the Minister to give us as much information as he could, not alone about the year's trading, but about the prospects for expansion for the coming year.  He has been kind enough to tell me that the total stock on hand of materials in respect of the rural industries side of Gaeltacht Services on 31st March, 1956, was £249,190; and of manufactured products £217,944, making a total of £467,134.</P>
      <P>I also asked the Minister, in reference to his statement about the provision of machinery and equipment for the Kilcar factory, whether he would let us know what the total capital expenditure had been during the past two years, and, whether or not, the necessary expenditure has now been provided so that the factory will be able to go ahead, in the knowledge that the maximum production is possible, and that there has been no hold back by reason of essential equipment not being provided.  The Estimates indicate that there has been an increase of £6,700 provided for tweed and nearly £13,000 for knitwear.  There are also increases, which seem to be substantial, in respect of advertisements and wages&mdash;an increase of over £6,000.  That may appear a relatively small figure, but, last year and the year before, the Minister reminded us that the wages bill had increased during both of the preceding years by £20,000.  It seems to be the case that, as far as the total expenditure on the rural industries is concerned, about one-third is spent on wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I deal with these costs is to try to secure from the Minister a statement as to whether the increased activities, increased output and increased sales of Gaeltacht Services, which we are all very happy to note, indicate a larger surplus for investment in the expansion of these industries or for reserves to meet depreciation and other needs.  The essential <Col N="249" /> question in these trading accounts is the relation which the total cost bears to the output.  Leaving aside, for the moment, the salaries, wages and allowances of the office, and anything that could not be said to be properly part of the actual administration of the rural industries themselves, one would like to know whether the cost per unit has been reduced by virtue of the increased output and also of the fact that, in respect of the products of these industries, the demand fortunately exceeds the supply.</P>
    <P>I trust that will continue, and I have no doubt that it will, in view of the boom conditions that exist outside.  At the same time, while these conditions exist, every opportunity ought to be taken to see that the greatest efficiency, and economy consistent with efficiency, is obtained.  The total receipts which the Minister estimates have gone up by £20,000.  Receipts from sales from the products of the rural industries, at £520,000, show an increase of £20,000 over last year. That is a very substantial figure, but having regard to the increase in costs, most of which, the Minister said, are unavoidable, the estimate is rather cautious in allowing only £20,000 for increased receipts.  I think that could not be described as entirely satisfactory, having regard to the increases under all the sub-heads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>What I am naturally anxious about is that the production and output should go ahead at the maximum possible rate, believing that thereby the burden of costs will be reduced; but we have to depend on the Minister to give us figures which will corroborate my hope that that is the situation and that it will obtain in an improving degree in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer, either, to market prices or conditions.  One knows that fluctuations and changes take place and in spite of the boom conditions to which I have referred continuing and being likely to continue for some time in the international market, which is becoming daily more competitive and where newer and stronger competitors are every day emerging, it stands to reason that we must be prepared, by having adequate <Col N="250" /> reserves and having the maximum possible amount of well-directed investment in these industries, for eventualities that may arise.  It is only once a year that members of the Dáil can voice their opinion in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>It was very welcome information that half the output of the tweed industry is exported and perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the position, which he says is better, so far as the United States market is concerned, has improved substantially. As a matter of information, I should also like to know whether Coras Tráchtála have been able to assist, or whether the Gaeltacht Services branch feel that they themselves are in a position to investigate the possibilities of the American market.  If there is an organisation representing Irish exporters generally, I suppose it would be only natural to expect that the tweed industry, of such importance in the Gaeltacht areas, should receive special care and attention.</P>
    <P>I was glad also to hear from the Minister that new designs are being introduced in the knitwear industry.  I have heard it stated that we are not always up-to-date with our designs and I wonder whether more could not be done to bring in modern designs and to provide special designers, even as consultants. I have no fault to find with the persons who are responsible for designs at the present time.  We have them in the central marketing depot; we have a knitwear designer and also a designer in the toys industry.  But as has been shown in the case of the Irish carpet industry in regard to securing a foothold in the United States, if articles of a luxury or semi-luxury character are being produced and if the choicest market is being sought, the question of design is of the greatest importance.  We see that in connection with the strides the French and the Italians are making and the enormous labour and expense to which they go to keep themselves in the forefront and in the headlines.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister last year whether a showroom could be provided in a more central place, I was told that the central marketing depot ought, <Col N="251" /> perhaps, to suffice.  However, if we are depending on selling our goods to visitors and if we expect those visitors to spread the light when they return to the United States, or wherever they come from, I think that, if it is not possible to provide a central showroom, the good offices of the leading shops ought to be sought to get them to give the products of this and other Irish industries a better show than often seems to be given.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that a new centre had been established for knitwear. He has not stated where, and I have always thought that more could be done to encourage cottage industries than is done at present.  I am not suggesting that it will be an easy matter&mdash;in fact, it is a very difficult one&mdash;but we know that in Switzerland and in Germany, they have machines suitable for these smaller industries. They have a longer tradition and, perhaps, a better tradition in some respects than we have, but I would be all in favour of sending some of those who are responsible for the industries to see what is going on in countries like Switzerland, with special reference to trying to provide machinery that would fit in with the development of rural electrification and its spread in the congested areas.  The Commission on Population and Emigration referred to this matter in paragraph 429.</P>
    <P>A great deal more will have to be done in the way of the education of the worker and in trying to pursue as far as possible the liaison between the vocational schools and the local industry, so that young workers will acquire not alone the most up-to-date skills but a knowledge of design and of the craft, with reference to the market point of view that might otherwise be denied to them.  In fact, the more these young workers feel themselves associated with and part of these industries, the better.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory also that there has been such an improvement in the sale of marine products.  In this Estimate, the purchase of carrageen stands at £15,000.  That would indicate that there is an improvement in respect of that commodity.  The seaweeds <Col N="252" /> come to £22,000.  These amounts may appear comparatively small, but they show what can be accomplished in these sea-girth areas where the people have very few opportunities, as the Commission on Emigration points out, to secure a full livelihood from agriculture.  To the extent that we can direct their attention to the riches of the sea and to the advantages of utilising these products, the better it will be for our economy as a whole. The total expenditure on marine products seems to be about £51,500.  The amount paid out is £49,000.  That indicates that practically the whole of the money goes to the people who harvest these products or who are working at the local centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to housing grants and I should be glad if he would tell us the total number of houses built so far under Gaeltacht housing grants.  It is satisfactory, and is, I hope, a sign of new life and activity and a recognition of modern requirements in relation to housing, that the Minister has been able to report the completion of 200 new houses and the improvement of a large number.  He has not told us what the areas concerned are.  In view of the importance of providing housing accommodation, not only for the people themselves, but for visitors to the Irish-speaking districts, who, I think, should get the best possible accommodation, comparable with that which they enjoy at home, or would get elsewhere on holiday, it would be interesting to know how these new houses and improvements to existing houses are divided as between the different Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>The general statement of the Minister indicates that very good progress has been made, but one has the feeling that, if the Gaeltacht industries were completely independent of, shall we say, any immediate connection with the Department of Finance and the direction that Department exercises, they might have more scope; those responsible for the conduct of these industries would then have more scope, I have not the slightest doubt, for displaying greater initiative, taking <Col N="253" /> greater advantage of their opportunities and embarking on the risks normally involved in ventures of this kind.</P>
    <P>We do not know whether this office will be taken over under the new Ministry, or what the position will be. At all times, there has been a feeling that Gaeltacht industries should be given the greatest latitude and that those responsible for administering them should be given the greatest freedom to take the necessary decisions.  After all, if they are to be run successfully, one must look ahead, not alone for two years, but for three years, or perhaps longer; one must plan one's capital requirements and the building of one's stocks of essential materials on that basis.  The industries do, of course, provide a certain amount of employment and provide much needed activities in the centres; but there are a great many areas even in the Gaeltacht itself, small and diminishing though the area may be, which have not the advantage of having centres.</P>
    <P>It is for the Government to state what their general policy is with regard to better provision for the people in the Gaeltacht areas, so that, if it is at all possible&mdash;as I have said, I know it is an extremely difficult problem to try to maintain our young people in employment at home, preferably in permanent employment and work of an industrial character, since that seems to be the kind of work that appeals to them&mdash;employment of a proper kind will be provided for them. If the Government realises its responsibility in that respect, it will have to do very much more than this Vote for Gaeltacht Services indicates.</P>
    <P>We have only to look at the figures for emigration issued recently to realise that these areas, particularly in the North and West, are the areas which have suffered most severely, the areas which have had the largest decline in employment.  That is borne out by the statement from the Central Statistics Office.  Side by side with that, we have the very grave situation in which the number of girls emigrating has almost reached the high level of male emigration.</P>
    <P>Speaking on another Vote in connection <Col N="254" /> with this matter with regard to the younger age groups approaching marriageable age, the members of which might be settling down and founding families in other circumstances or in other places, I said that the whole economic life of the country will be affected because of the high proportion of these age groups leaving the country.  We are becoming a more aged population.  If we want to make economic progress, we can only make that progress through our young people, with their capacity for work and their ability to acquire skill.  It is through them that the greatest effort will be made and the greatest results will be obtained.  They are the richest raw material we have.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, do not seem to realise the position.  They have made no effort to come forward and tell the House that they have any plan or policy in which all Parties and leaders throughout the country generally could participate&mdash;a policy behind which our young people could feel there is a plan, a policy which, while it might take a certain time to show results, would at least have the merit that we could all go out and do our utmost in an effort to make it both effective and successful.  If we cannot do more than is being done at present to revitalise these communities in the western and northern counties&mdash;I am taking these as an example because they seem to be the worst cases revealed by the census&mdash;then the outlook is very dismal indeed.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Emigration reported that a large scheme should be introduced, of a nature that would bring a substantial portion of the population in these areas into employment over the period of the year when they would be at home living on their own holdings.  They were actuated by the fact that migration to England has been a feature of the life of these communities for generations.  As the commission says, the unfortunate thing about the recent decline is that whole families are going, and where formerly the young persons or the fathers in the household went to England or Scotland for a season and came back, the danger now is that, with the full <Col N="255" /> employment that is in existence in Britain, if they are able to secure accommodation they will, as they have been doing, bring over their families, lock, stock and barrel.  That is an extremely serious situation.  If we are to continue to lose these young people for a further period at the rate we have been losing them during the past few years, we cannot say that there is much future for the western counties and for the people living in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Emigration, recommending that there should be a large scheme to provide employment for at least six months of the year, stated in paragraph 420 on page 165:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We think it unlikely that the State would undertake a project of such magnitude without first testing its efficacy by means of a pilot scheme sufficiently comprehensive to make it a realistic approach to the problem.  We recommend such a pilot scheme and consider that it should embrace areas comprising 5 to 10 per cent.  of the holdings of £4 valuation and under (which would represent 2,500 to 5,000 households) calling for a yearly wage bill of £250,000 to £500,000.  The men concerned could be profitably employed and the nation would benefit from their labour, as large-scale schemes of afforestation, reclamation of hill-land, farm improvements to permit the use of agricultural machinery and construction of tourist roads would become immediately practicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That and other recommendations are in the hands of the Government for a considerable time, but we have heard nothing from responsible Ministers as to whether any action is being taken in connection with them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I urge that, gratifying as the progress under the Gaeltacht Services may be and satisfactory as the employment and output may be&mdash; employment is given, I think, to about 1,500 persons and a great deal of it is full-time employment&mdash;it is not sufficient.  It is only a very small contribution towards this immense and <Col N="256" /> frightening problem that looms up in front of us.  I ask the Minister to take steps to see that something larger and more promising is done&mdash;something that would be a real effort on a national scale&mdash;and to try to get activity of a general character in connection with land improvement going in the congested areas, and to get the Government to take steps in that connection as quickly as ever they can. With organisation, with men of enthusiasm and men of vision and experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on the recommendations which I have just dwelt upon, the commission went on to say that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The commission considers that, while the Government must decide the scope of the pilot scheme and the tempo of its expansion, its direction and administration should be entrusted to a Government-nominated board having the fullest freedom of action in the conduct of its work.  The function of the Government should be confined to nominating the board and providing the necessary funds.  It is the opinion of the commission that an unpaid board, after the fashion of the former Congested Districts Board, would receive maximum co-operation from the people.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if an independent board <Col N="257" /> were able to achieve what the Gaeltacht Services branch or any such branch of the administration may accomplish, it would probably get more credit.  The public would have the feeling that such a body would not depend, to the extent that branches of Government Departments have to depend, upon the exigencies of political situations.  They would have more freedom to break new ground and they would approach the problems they were set up to tackle with a freedom that, perhaps, does not always belong to the trained civil servant, who is accustomed to look to precedent and to wait for directions from above.  Undoubtedly there are men in the Civil Service who, if given the opportunity, can acquit themselves as well as men selected from the higher ranks of industry and commerce outside; but they have not had that experience in the same way.  They have not had that familiarity, perhaps, with the problems in these areas that men who are familiar with them through their business connections have.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that it was the feeling of the commission that such a board would be free from any shackles or red tape, departmental or financial control, and that it could call to its aid independently &mdash; and plan accordingly&mdash;the best experts and best advisers to try to get something substantial and something of real value accomplished within the next few years in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Gratifying as it may be to see some improvement in relation to the activity of Gaeltacht Services, I revert again to part of the matters I raised with the Minister last year.  I dealt then with the question of the organisation and marketing of the Gaeltacht products.  Has any improvement been shown in this line? Can the Minister indicate to the House that they have succeeded in defeating the extraordinary system of supplying material from Dublin to be spun in the Gaeltacht and returned to Dublin for warehousing and sale?  What has been done in a realistic way to explore the market potential of Gaeltacht products?  The world to-day is turning <Col N="258" /> more and more to market research. For the particular type of goods produced in the Gaeltacht, there should be a widespread commercial and sentimental market available.  It seems rather ironic that there is more &ldquo;Donegal tweed&rdquo; sold throughout the world that is manufactured in Scotland than is manufactured in Ireland.</P>
      <P>These are features that cause substantial distress to persons interested in the preservation of the Gaeltacht and the enlargement of Gaeltacht industries of a practical nature, or in the expansion of some of the cottage industries in the Gaeltacht.  It is true &mdash;if the Minister doubts my word, he can get his officials to check&mdash;that one can get very extensive ranges of materials, even from Japan, that are styled &ldquo;Donegal tweed&rdquo;.  In other words, a name that is significant of quality has been abused, to the detriment of the home producers.</P>
      <P>I know, as I have said on other occasions in relation to the Gaeltacht, that the problem is a very large one, but I feel that there is a good deal of overlapping within the industries and a great degree of non-attention to an expansionist programme that would be practical.  I believe that, with improved efficiency and improved equipment, the people in the Gaeltacht, who have the tradition of weaving and spinning, can and will produce goods of a quality commensurate with the quality of goods produced in any part of the world.  The inherent desire of these people to work at home and to produce something of first-class quality can lead to an international market drive, if proper equipment and up-to-date machinery are made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaeltacht Services seem to confine their activity, as Deputy Derrig said, to western and northern areas.  I do not know whether Gaeltacht Services are allergic to the West Cork Gaeltacht areas, but these areas are conspicuously devoid of any signs of the energy and activity that might be expected to flow from the industries section of Gaeltacht Services.  When one thinks of the island of Cape Clear and the areas of Goleen, Ballyvourney, Ballingeary and Inchigeela, one can say emphatically that, however gratifying <Col N="259" /> the progress of Gaeltacht Services may be in parts of Galway and Donegal, we, in our part of the country, which contributed a very substantial part of the effort that gave us the right to have any Gaeltacht Services and the liberty of this country, have a tale of sad and woeful neglect.</P>
    <P>I feel that, possibly, the Minister is at a disadvantage inasmuch as this facet of public endeavour is tagged on to the Department of Lands.  One looks at the figure of £300,000 odd for Gaeltacht Services and one sighs because it is only a pinprick in the problem to be faced in relation to these areas.  I am sure Deputies from Donegal and Galway, though they may express satisfaction at the progress being made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is gratifying to see the improvement shown in the <Col N="260" /> Estimate under marine products but it straight away tempts one to express the belief that even in that particular facet of Gaeltacht industries, again the surface is only being scratched.  I believe that there is an extensive market available for a much wider selection of marine products and, again, I should like the Minister to let us know what export market research has been done and what development investigations have been carried out in relation to the possibility of expansion in this particular field.</P>
      <P>We all stand indicted to posterity by the appalling situation revealed in the recent census of population.  Remember this particular aspect impinges on a part of the country where the haemorrhage of emigration has flowed most freely and it is all the more distressing when we know that there is no person more anxious to cling to whatever holding he has in the barren fastnesses of this country than the Gaeltacht inhabitant is.</P>
      <P>I know there is a good deal of futility in public utterances in relation to various Votes and I want to warn the Minister and this section of his Department which deals with Gaeltacht Services that unless they can plan expansion, such limited resources as they have in the way of personnel to employ will become depleted because, whether we are going to face up to the problem or not, the people of the Gaeltacht are beginning to lose confidence in all types of Government in this country that their problem will be tackled and solved at all.</P>
      <P>If we look at the recent census of population in connection with the West Cork area, the Donegal area, the Galway area or other places on the western seaboard comprising the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht districts we will find that it is there the heaviest drain of population has occurred.  I am not suggesting that the Minister can perform miracles overnight but in connection with the industries that his Gaeltacht Department are successfully running I believe they can be made even more successful by adequate and effective market research. I believe that particularly in the branch of marine industry there could be substantial expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> We know from examination of the situation at the moment that there is room for a substantial expansion into Gaeltacht areas of dry seaweed plant. We know that this product in its dry, chopped condition has become a most valuable raw material in connection with some of the most valuable drug production in progress to-day.  What do we see done to make the effort, even if it is only going to put 20 or 30 people in a Gaeltacht parish into employment? Think of the steadying effect it will have in any area if there is proper research and proper planning in relation to what can be done.  I know that I always appear to be critical when it comes to dealing with the problems of the Gaeltacht but the situation in the Gaeltacht generally has become more than critical. Nationally, we profess a deep interest in the preservation and revival of the Irish language and while that profession is in evidence and while lip service is being paid to that belief, we can look at the current census report and see how many actual native speakers and how many Fíor-Ghaels of the Gaeltacht have left these shores.  I am quite sure that some of my colleagues in the West of Ireland know that they can go into some of the cities of England, particularly Birmingham and Manchester, and find more Irish spoken there than in many places at home.</P>
    <P>That shows there is something wrong and it shows, as I said at the outset, that with all the good intentions in the world the particular section the Minister has control of is only scratching the surface of a big problem. While we can commend what has been done&mdash;and we do commend what has been done by the section&mdash;we must realise how much more it could do.  There is more to be considered than the bare economics of industry that might be furthered in Gaeltacht areas.  This problem has to be viewed in the perspective of keeping people at home working in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The social aspect of it must be equated with whatever potential economic loss might appear on the face of a project.  I take this opportunity on this Vote of urging that the <Col N="262" /> section, whether it will be transferred to the control of the new Minister for the Gaeltacht or is left in the hands of the Minister for Lands, would get down to the problem of adequate investigation of market and expansion potential.  I am a great believer in using the far-flung connection that is ours, much of it springing, as it does, from emigrants who left the Gaeltacht areas and areas in the South and South-West.  That bond has been a feature of the new world.  I am a great believer in exploiting that sentiment to the commercial saving of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister and this section bend their mind and hands to the task of exploiting properly the market potential and of finding out what kind of goods can be produced for sale in the markets of the New World, they will be able to get a wealth of information that will be a possible guiding light in regard to the direction future development of industry in these areas might take.</P>

      <P>Without passing any criticism on anybody, it seems to me we discussed on this section rather a variety of subjects.  However, I do not propose to follow many of the Deputies down some of the tortuous paths they trod.  I said before, and I repeat now, that I will give the question of a more general commission on taxation attention immediately we have concluded our examination of the Industrial Taxation Committee's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in the House will accept, I think, that it is quite inevitable that the work of any such commission would involve a great strain for the technical personnel of the Revenue Commissioners.  It would be quite impossible for us to provide the facilities that would be required, and properly required, by the general commission, <Col N="263" /> simultaneous with the examination of the report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation.  It was for that reason that I made it clear long ago that I was not going to deal with the one until I had finished with the other. The type of commission best suited for that task is one upon which I have not yet come to a final conclusion.  I am inclined to disagree with the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass that members of this House should be included. I think it would be better that the members of this House should be free to give their views, completely unfettered, when the report comes to hand, and when a Finance Bill is, perhaps, introduced, based on some such report.  Undoubtedly, the task will be very heavy and onerous and will be of long duration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the fact that we are now in the 104th year of income-tax.  Notwithstanding the consolidation of the Income Tax Acts in 1918, there has been such a change in the modern structure of society that it is a task of enormous magnitude to consider how income-tax should be fitted in with modern requirements.  It will entail a great deal of work.  I agree completely with those who said that only a limited number of people are available to give the time and the energy and who have expert knowledge.  The question of &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo; is one of many problems in that regard.  In some circles, there is a desire for that system and, in other circles, there is a desire that it should not be introduced.  Like many other things, it is a problem of how to reconcile two opposing views.  The difficulty about &ldquo;Pay As You Earn&rdquo;, as it is operated on the other side, is the administrative machine that is built up because of the necessity to make variations on any change of earning conditions during the period&mdash;cessation of work, cessation of income and so forth &mdash;and the exact system that is suitable for an industrial country like theirs is not necessarily suitable for our country.</P>
    <P>I have a completely open mind about the type of commission that should be set up.  I am inclined to be against <Col N="264" /> the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that this is a need that has not arisen just now, but which arose many years ago.  Of course, each year, as it goes unfulfilled, the need for an examination of that sort becomes greater.  I do not think one should face that examination, however, on the lines on which many people are inclined to consider it.  I think Deputy Allen fairly and truthfully said there was a tendency to consider the revision of any taxation as meaning that the person speaking would pay less and somebody else would have to pay more.</P>
    <P>While I agree with Deputy Byrne in many of the things he said in his maiden speech, I cannot agree with him all the way.  He certainly put a good deal of time and research into collecting the material for that speech and, for that, he deserves to be complimented. He adumbrated a very city view&mdash;a view that did not take any account at all of the position of our primary producers.  Not very long ago, I had a very interesting personal experience in regard to the taxation of farmers here and across the water. It so happened that, in my professional business, I had the necessity to have before me for a period of four or five years the accounts of a 300 acre farm in this country and a 280 acre farm in Berkshire.  I found that by and large, year in and year out during that period, the payments made to authorities, central and local, were more or less the same in each country.  Here, the farmer paid rates on a heavier scale altogether and income-tax on a lighter scale; there, the farmer paid income-tax on a heavier scale and his land was de-rated.  In the end, it worked out more or less that what was lost on the swings was made up on the roundabouts.  It is not correct, therefore, for Deputy Byrne to take the view he took, that, in regard to taxation, central taxation alone is to be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the various Deputies down the paths they trod in relation to this section.  I will content myself with saying that I accept that the provisions of our income-tax code are complicated in the <Col N="265" /> extreme.  In an endeavour to make them equitable, I am not sure whether we shall be able to make them simpler. Very often, when you set out to try to simplify something that is complicated and, at the same time, to overcome certain anomalies, it works out in the end that you have a very much more complicated system than the system with which you started.  Some Deputy &mdash;I think it was, perhaps, Deputy Byrne&mdash;suggested that this was the last year, he hoped, that this section would be moved.  I think anybody who believes that a commission of the sort that is visualised by either side of this House would have produced results in one or even perhaps two years would be a super-optimist altogether.  It may be that such a commission may be able to give an interim report on certain limited aspects, but a general review of our income taxation is something that will take an immense amount of time, and the people who undertake it will be very public spirited indeed.</P>
    <P>So far as my views as Minister for Finance on income taxation or on taxation on expenditure are concerned, I have made them fairly clear, not merely by words but by deeds.  The Budget, which this Finance Bill implements, turned entirely on expenditure taxation to raise the additional sums that were necessary, and in so far as taxation on income is concerned, it gave certain relief for the purpose of getting more industrial efficiency, and, with that industrial efficiency, more employment, in addition to getting more savings; so that, so far as that aspect of the problem is concerned in this Bill, the trend is obviously away from taxation on income, towards taxation on expenditure.  At the same time, I must confess that I agree with my predecessor in office, Deputy MacEntee, that I do not see a practical method of carrying it as far as, say, Mr. Kaldor, of having everything dealt with without gathering a tax of that nature.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that members of the Dáil should be included in any committee that may be set up to examine the whole system of taxation. I indicated that, if it was intended to have members of the Dáil, <Col N="266" /> this Party would co-operate.  The Minister will, of course, have in mind the fact that, so far as the Committee on Industrial Taxation was concerned, one member of it succeeded in getting elected to the Dáil after he was appointed. The same could happen again.</P>

      <P>That was probably a handicap.  I do not think the Minister should start off with the assumption that this inquiry will necessarily take years.

      <P>I appreciate that the amount of interest he will receive from his investment in a commercial or a savings bank will be less than he will get by investing it elsewhere, but the inducement of tax free payment will, I think, be to encourage saving in this particular form to the detriment of savings in other forms.

      <P>The situation is that at present the person who has savings and deposits them in a trustee savings bank, the P.O.S.B., or a commercial bank, has to pay tax assessed under Schedule D in respect of that interest. In respect of money deposited with the building society, he does not have to <Col N="268" /> pay income-tax.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the same argument applies here.  It is true that, in the case of Government loans, there are very many big subscriptions in respect of which this concession would be of very little interest, but, again, it seems to me that, if you are going to use the principle of tax concession to encourage saving&mdash;the British Royal Commission came out very flatfooted against that principle&mdash;we should try to encourage savings of all kinds, or at least savings of any kind which will make funds available for State purposes. I do not know if the Minister can inform us as to the number of investors in the recent loan who subscribed £500 or less at 5 per cent. rate of interest.  This concession would be fully effective only in respect of those <Col N="269" /> who subscribed £500 or less; but various concessions have been offered in the past to induce subscriptions to public loans.  The most recent was the payment of the interest on those loans free of deduction of tax at source, and it seems to me that, having regard to recent experience, it might be an advantage to extend this concession to induce more extensive subscriptions to any future loans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I appreciate the Deputy's argument, but I believe the better method of dealing with it is that that type of small saving set by the limitation in question&mdash;£25&mdash;should go into the saving certificates rather than Government stocks.  As the Deputy knows the interest on saving certificates is free in any event.  The House I know would be glad to note the progress that has been made in the last issue of saving certificates which became available at the beginning of May.  That progress has been satisfactory and I hope it will be maintained, but it was because I thought saving certificates were better for that type of small saving than Government stocks that I did not include it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(&nbsp;)  The principal section is hereby amended by deleting in sub-section (1) thereof the following words &ldquo;claims and proves to the Special Commissioners that he &ldquo;and <Col N="270" /> by substituting the following paragraph for the existing paragraph (a) in that sub-section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the income-tax applicable to any dividend or interest received by him in respect of such stocks, shares or securities shall be the standard rate diminished by 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think amendments Nos. 3 and 4 might be taken together.  This is a point which I raised during the course of the Second Reading of the Bill.  It seems to me that the need is to divert the interest of investors to Irish as distinct from British investments and anything which may have that result is beneficial.  One of the purposes of Section 7 of the Act of 1932 was to bring that about&mdash;to increase the interest in, and possible investment in, shares issued on the public market by Irish manufacturing concerns.  It was only recently that I attempted to assess the effect of that section upon the Irish stock market and I found it was practically nil.  I consulted with accountants and stockbrokers who were familiar with the reaction of the public to the various issues that were offered to them and they all agreed with me that the effect of the section was nil and that, indeed, its existence was hardly known at all to the public.</P>
    <P>The reason for that, in my opinion, is that there is no process by which the availability of this relief is made known to the public.  The individual investor does not know about Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932, and he must, as an individual, make application for the relief.  It would be very much preferable if some arrangement could be made by which the actual liability to tax of the company which has issued the shares could be reduced by the 20 per cent. for which the 1932 Act provides and that the individual investor would get his dividend with the lesser deduction of tax indicated. I think that the effect would be that the advantages of investing in the publicly-issued shares of Irish companies would become a matter of discussion among investors and would become far more widely known.  That is why I would urge that the changes I am suggesting would be made.  I <Col N="271" /> appreciate that the amendments as drafted by me would not by themselves be sufficient to bring this about but I have brought them in as indications&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is not going to stand on the wording; it is the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Indeed some consequential provision would obviously have to be inserted if the limitations of the 1932 Act were to be maintained. The Minister is aware that the Act limited this relief to individuals who were resident in Ireland.  Why it was limited to those individuals I am not quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is somebody sitting very near to the Deputy who ought to be able to explain that better than I could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if his recollection goes back that far.  It seems to me there was no specific reason why corporate bodies should not be encouraged to invest in issues of Irish companies, just the same as individuals should be encouraged to invest in Irish issues.  There might be some problem in the case of interlocking companies, but the fact is that there is an increasing probability that the capital provided for Irish industry &mdash;as the recent commission report indicated&mdash;is coming from what they call institutional investors, insurance companies and other corporate organisations, which have funds available for investment.  Also, in the circumstances of to-day, particularly having regard to the policy of the Government as expressed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, there would seem to be a positive disadvantage in confining the relief to persons resident in Ireland. If it is the aim to encourage increased investment by people outside Ireland in shares in Irish companies, then that limitation should be removed and, indeed, there might even be a case made not to confine the concession to people coming within the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point I want to make is that the purpose of the 1932 Act, Section <Col N="272" /> 7, has been very largely defeated by public ignorance of its existence and that the best way of bringing to the notice of the public the fact that this relief in tax is available in investments in certain types of Irish companies, through shares issued on the stock market, is to provide for a reduction in the company's liability for tax in respect of the distribution of profits to the shareholders so that the shareholder will know when he gets the dividend direct that that relief is there.</P>
    <P>I will admit that the point about corporate investment invalidates calculations I made previously but it seems to me there is a substantial number of individual shareholders entitled to this relief who are not getting it either because the companies who issued the shares have not sought the certificate under this section or because they themselves are unaware that they are entitled to this concession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, every dividend counterfoil issued, in respect of which Section 7 applies, must bear on its face the statement that the 20 per cent. allowance can be claimed in respect of it.  If there is any further lack of knowledge by individual stockholders it is a lack which can be made good to a large extent by stockbrokers, solicitors and accountants and people like that who are dealing with the personal affairs of individual investors.</P>
      <P>I must say that my experience is the opposite of the Deputy's.  I have experience of cases where the relief was always eagerly looked to and where there was never any difficulty whatever in obtaining the offset.  I accept, of course, there were cases in which there was a direct assessment under Schedule D on other income of the people concerned, in addition to the dividend which they received taxed at source.  But the Deputy is wrong when he thinks that the administration of the Act requires personal application; in fact, it does not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It says so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Act so states, but the administrative method <Col N="273" /> of dealing with it, as I know to my own personal knowledge, is that one merely refers to the dividends in one's tax return.  Every taxpayer has to complete a return in order to get marriage allowances, children's allowances, dependent relatives' allowances or any other allowances.  He does not get any of those without completing a return, and if he inserts on that return that he has, shall we say, sugar company shares which were issued subject to Section 7 certificate, then he automatically gets an offset in respect of any interest which falls to be taxed by direct assessment under Schedule D.  It is only in the rarest cases&mdash; and again I have personal knowledge &mdash; that the inspector of taxes asks for the dividend counterfoils or for proof of ownership.  It is dealt with regularly, year after year, by inclusion on the return in the same way as marriage allowance is given automatically as soon as the name of the wife is included in the return.</P>

      <P>Before Section 8, but in Part I, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;)  When an individual pays a premium under an annuity contract, approved by the Revenue Commissioners as having for its main object the provision for the individual of a life annuity in old age, the amount of that premium shall be deducted from his relevant earnings for the year of assessment in which the premium is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is taken from a section in the British Finance Act of <Col N="274" /> this year.  The section in the British Act was based on a recommendation of the British Royal Commission upon the taxation of profits and income. The section in the British Act covered four pages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, it covered six-and-a-half pages.  I am glad the Deputy did not put down the whole of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the first part would be sufficient.  The purpose of that section and of this amendment is to attempt to deal with the special position of self-employed persons in making provision for their old age&mdash; making provision for retirement pensions when their earning lives have ceased.  The problem was, perhaps, debated more in Britain than it has been here, because of the operation of their whole national insurance scheme, under which everybody has to contribute and under which everybody who contributes becomes entitled to a retirement pension.  We have not got such a comprehensive system here, but the existence of that comprehensive scheme in Britain highlighted the particular problem of the self-employed person who was not covered in the ordinary way by a scheme which applied only to employed persons.  Here, as in Britain, we have the same proportion of persons who make their livelihoods by their own efforts in self-employment &mdash;people, not employed for wages, who follow various trades and occupations on their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, I think, every reason to assist and facilitate those people, in making provision during their early earning years, to provide for their old age.  The provisions contained in the British Act sought to exempt from income-tax the premiums which these people pay to purchase old age retirement pensions.  That is what I propose here.  There is a concession under the Income Tax Act, but it does not go as far as would be desirable in this regard.  Having regard to the points made by the Minister during the Second Reading, I believe the granting of this concession would stimulate a greater volume of savings.  I think this <Col N="275" /> provision would encourage people to set aside from their present earnings a certain sum for retirement pensions. On the whole, it seems a desirable provision and, while I cannot calculate what it might cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No question of cost arises.  The matter is extremely complicated in itself and is part of a very complicated field of interlocking questions. We have been examining these for some time, but I found, I regret, that the examination had not concluded in anything like sufficient time to be able to incorporate the result of our examination in this year's Finance Bill.  I can stress how complicated it is when I say the British section dealing with this matter covers six and a half pages.  We propose to proceed with our examination as expeditiously as possible.  I propose to examine the whole question in the light of certain representations being made to me on behalf of bodies of self-employed persons, such as the Incorporated Law Society.  The Bar of Ireland is another. I hesitate to mention the bodies on whose behalf representations were made.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 8, but in Part I, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(&nbsp;)  Where an assurance company, registered in the State carries on pension annuity business then exemption from income-tax shall be allowed in respect of income from investments and deposits of so much of the company's annuity fund as is referable to that business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> This is somewhat different in character. There is an element of urgency here.  Again, this amendment is based upon a provision in the British Finance Act of this year.  The effect of that provision in the British Finance Act upon Irish assurance companies could be fairly serious indeed, if a similar relief is not granted here.  The purpose of the amendment is to secure the exemption from income-tax of income from investments and deposits of so much of an insurance company's annuity fund as is referable to that business.  The House is aware that British life assurance companies can, under our law as it stands at present, carry on business here in competition with Irish companies.</P>
    <P>Some 20 years ago, we had legislation to limit the operation of British and foreign companies in other types of insurance business and, in effect, give some protection to Irish companies in that field.  However, because of the very complicated nature of the business, and because of the possible consequences of such legislation upon members of the public who had policies with the British companies, we did not attempt to operate similar legislation regarding life assurance business.  It is very important, indeed, that the Irish companies should continue to get a very substantial part of the available business.  Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, recognised that in 1953 by an alteration in the tax relief arrangements which were made in the Finance Act of that year.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Inquiry into Industrial Taxation have referred to the increasing importance of these Irish assurance companies as a source of capital for Irish industry.  They quote the opinion of Dr. J.P. Beddy that they are providing about 10 per cent. of the industrial capital in use at present. If British companies are free from income-tax on these funds, they can obviously improve the terms they can offer to persons seeking that type of cover; they can increase the amount of annuity that can be purchased, and the Irish companies could not hope to compete with them for business.  In fact, it might drive the Irish companies out of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> I notice the Minister shakes his head.  My information as to the possible effects of this on Irish insurance companies comes from a fairly reliable source.  They feel that the advantage which this remission of taxation gives to the British companies is to their disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They did so feel, until certain things were pointed out to them.  There are three different classes of this type of insurance company&mdash;those operating under the 1918 Act, those operating under the 1921 Act and those operating group employment schemes.  One Irish company does not operate the 1921 Act schemes and the other does practically nothing under that scheme.  In fact, it is only the 1921 Act schemes that the British companies operate.  They do not operate the first or third schemes which I have referred to here and which are the main categories operated here.</P>
      <P>In addition, the British, under Section 379, have to approve of the type of scheme and, in fact, they cannot approve of a scheme which affects employment outside Britain.  As far as we can see, this relief would not affect group employment here and therefore the British companies operating here would not have approval under Section 379 in respect of any group endowment affected here, unless the affected group endowment here was for employment in Britain, which is very unlikely.</P>
      <P>There was anxiety, as indicated, at an earlier date, but I think we have satisfied the parties concerned that they need not have any such anxiety because of the fact that their business arises under a different scheme from the British scheme and, also, because of the lack of approval under Section 379, for group schemes in respect of persons employed in Ireland.  I do not think there is much doubt about that, but if we found that the effect might be in any way substantial, I would have no difficulty in dealing with the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which increases the tax on tobacco.  I do not suppose there is any point in initiating a prolonged debate on the increase.  If increased taxation has to be imposed, tobacco is as good a source as any other from which to get it.  I am not questioning the wisdom of the Minister's decision to choose tobacco as a source of additional revenue.</P>
      <P>I suppose, in the matter of reminding Deputies opposite of their promises to reduce the tax on tobacco, and of their attacks upon the proposal to increase it in the 1952 Budget, it would be a waste of the time of this House.  If I thought there was any possibility of awakening in them the slightest interest in their election promises, or the slightest desire to fulfil them, I would do so, but they have apparently completely resigned themselves to the position that these promises are to be discarded in their entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one aspect of the tobacco position concerning which I am anxious to get information.  It arises out of the Budget statement. Part of the increase in the price of cigarettes and tobacco which has been decided upon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is going to the benefit of tobacco manufacturers and traders.  Last year, these manufacturers went to the Government for sanction to increase their prices.  The Government referred the matter to the <Col N="279" /> Prices Advisory Body and, on receiving their report, sanctioned an increase in price.  I assume that the increase in price which was sanctioned last year was the increase which the Prices Advisory Body recommended.  No statement to the contrary has ever been made.</P>
    <P>A further increase has been given this year.  I asked, during the Budget debates, if the need for the further increase was considered by the Prices Advisory Body before it was decided upon, and I got no reply.  I think the public should be told whether anybody investigated the necessity for giving another £500,000, or whatever the sum is, to the manufacturers and traders in tobacco, as well as the increased tax which the Minister has imposed for the purposes of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies will recollect that the same question arose in 1952.  In that year, the then Minister, Deputy MacEntee, found it necessary to propose an increase in the tax upon tobacco and, at the same time, an increase in the price of cigarettes was authorised which allowed additional margins to the manufacturers and traders in tobacco.  That increase was found to be necessary after an examination by the Prices Advisory Body.  They recommended that the increase should be given, having regard to the rise in costs.  On this occasion, nobody has yet said that there was any investigation by the Prices Advisory Body and the silence of Ministers on the matter suggests that there has not been.</P>
    <P>There are two possible explanations. One is that the Prices Advisory Body, last year, recommended a higher increase as being necessary than the Government considered to be necessary, and that the position is now being regulated, and the other is that the increase was decided upon without any reference to the Prices Advisory Body.  If that is so, I think that this pretence of the regulation of the price of cigarettes and tobacco by Government Order should be abandoned.  It is futile at the present time.  If it was abandoned, I doubt if any manufacturer in the country would want to <Col N="280" /> increase his prices or would succeed in doing so, if he attempted it.  There is a great deal to be said for getting the Government out of the position of having to control prices, if its control means nothing.  In relation to cigarettes and tobacco, its control means nothing at the present time and particularly so if the Government are prepared to give what is a considerable amount of money to the manufacturers and traders, even though it is a small amount to each of them, at a time when a very substantial increase in prices is caused by increased taxation.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister whether this additional increase in the price of cigarettes and tobacco, for the benefit of manufacturers and traders, was decided upon by the Government, with or without reference to the Prices Advisory Body.  If it was examined by the Prices Advisory Body, did they recommend it as necessary?  If it was not examined by the Prices Advisory Body, on what basis was the amount of the increase required by the manufacturers determined?</P>

      <P>In connection with this increase in the price of tobacco and cigarettes, will the Minister give an explanation about all the talk we heard in the 1952 Budget about the old age pensioners' tobacco?  I remember well all the wails we then heard from these benches from the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies about the increase in the cost of the old age pensioner's smoke.  Is there any special consideration being given now in this section of the Finance Bill to the old age pensioners, and has the Minister for Finance any excuse or any apology to offer to the House and the people for the <i>volte face</i> that has taken place since the 1952 Budget was discussed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked was there any concession.  I am saying <Col N="281" /> that it is there.  Deputy Lemass asked me about the margin.  The margin that is allowed in the difference between 4½d. duty and 5d. for the ordinary packet of cigarettes amounts to less than £10,000; and considerably less than even half that sum is the margin for the distributive trade and not for the manufacturers at all.  There is no increased margin for the manufacturers in that except the rounding figure. The margin for the distributive trade is based on the same percentage as has been carried on for some time but so far as the 5d. on the packet is concerned, as I indicated in my Budget statement, approximately 4½d. is duty on the packet and the remainder of the margin&mdash;the Deputy will understand I cannot disclose the exact confidential figure except to an extent less than £5,000&mdash;goes to the distributive trade apart from the manufacturers. The manufacturers only get that rounding figure.  I have also similar information in respect of the previous margins in 1952 to which the Deputy refers.  I will quote them if the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce does not control the price charged by manufacturers. He does not control the price charged by wholesalers.  The only price Order he makes relates to the retail price of cigarettes and tobacco.  In other words, there is no official effort to secure that the benefit of this margin will go entirely to the retailers.  Maybe the manufacturers have done it on their own but if they have, it is their act and not a decision of the Government. Just adverting for one moment to the 1952 debates, is the Imperial Tobacco Company making £32,000,000 profit?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister for Finance ought to give some more information to Deputy Ó Briain in relation to the question he asked.  He ought to be more informative than he is in regard to sub-section (6) of Section 8.  He ought to tell us what in fact the rebate amounts to.  My recollection is that it is 4d. per ounce, that is to say, it is relatively smaller than the rebate given in the 1952 Budget.  I have not unfortunately got the text of the Minister's speech by me.</P>

      <P>I think it is, and one wonders whether, in fact, the Minister, after all the parading we have had in this House about what was to be done to the old age pensioners, is not taking back in the form of pipe tobacco one of the pipe dreams which the Minister for Social Welfare wanted us to believe the old age pensioner was going to enjoy through the munificence of the Coalition this year.  I do not wish to go back on the old ground but it is consoling to those of us who remember how vocal the Minister for Social Welfare was in relation to the tax on tobacco in 1952, to see how silent he has been on the present position in the course of this debate.  One would have thought that at least he would have informed the House what were the cogent reasons which compelled him to change his views as to the taxability or otherwise of tobacco. My recollection is that in 1952 Deputy Corish, as he was then, the Minister <Col N="283" /> for Social Welfare as he is to-day, took the view that it was iniquitous to deprive the people of cheap tobacco even if the proceeds of the increase in the tax rate on tobacco were required in order to finance the social welfare schemes which the Minister for Social Welfare professes to have at heart.  I think, therefore, it is somewhat astonishing to see the Minister sitting here to-day without in any way endeavouring to justify himself for voting, as he will have to do in a few minutes, in support of an increase in the tax rate on tobacco.</P>

There certainly is a difference in the two Budgets, as the Minister for Social Welfare has said.  I should like to hear the Minister justify this sudden reversal of the attitude he took up in 1952.  Why was it wrong to tax tobacco then in order to provide social welfare benefits?  Why was it wrong to tax tobacco to provide the moneys to pay increased remuneration to civil servants and public officials?  And why is it right now to increase the rate of taxation on tobacco to-day for precisely the same purposes?  We should like to hear the Minister address himself to these questions.</P>

I am afraid you have not; but you now recognise that there was, I hope, good reason for the similar provision in the Act of 1952, even though you denounced it then as inspired by excessive concern for the Imperial Tobacco Company.</P>

I know, of course, that their backs are bleeding and raw and one would hesitate to rub salt into them, but there is an aspect of this sub-section which, I think, requires some consideration. We all know what they thought about the amendment I brought in to the 1952 Bill.  After all, that was merely to give the tobacco manufacturers and, in particular, the Irish tobacco manufacturers, six months in which they might meet this rather unexpected demand for excise duty.  Why has it become necessary to extend the six months to eight months?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I think the picture of the Fianna Fáil Party being flogged into the Division Lobby for the purpose of securing that the tobacco companies ... are to be given six months' grace wherein to pay...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister for Finance has misled the House, or whether I was going to mislead the House.  I thought Deputy Dillon was, for once, correct and I thought the <Col N="290" /> period which we had allowed them in 1952 was six months, but the Minister for Finance says it was nine months, and I am accepting that for the time being.</P>
    <P>What I want to know is: why is it necessary, having regard to the general prosperity which has been described to us in such glowing terms, in which Irish industry is operating at the moment, to allow this eight months' moratorium to the tobacco manufacturers? Surely we are entitled to have some information on that subject. There are other enterprises and other businesses which will be affected by other provisions of this Bill, but to none of them is granted the concession or the consideration which the Minister proposes to extend to the tobacco manufacturers under sub-section (5) That would appear to be a form of discrimination in favour of the tobacco industry, and I think that, before the House accepts the Minister's proposals, he ought to justify them to the House.  It would be regrettable if, by reason of the Minister's silence, we had to divide on this section and subject the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Social Welfare to another flagellation, in order to persuade them to vote on this occasion against their conscience, because I suppose this did represent their conscience in 1952.  I assume that, even if they have joined the Coalition, they have not become so debased as to have no qualms about what they are now doing under sub-section (5) of Section 9.  Therefore, I hope that, before the question is put, we will hear from the Minister for Finance something to justify this extraordinary concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it was members of the House at that time other than Ministers, who made the error of describing it as a six months' concession, or whether it was Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance who then misled the House by suggesting that it was a six months' concession but, in fact, the sub-section that is included in the Act of 1952 is drafted in exactly the same terms as <Col N="291" /> the present one, except that the Budget of that year, as the Deputy remembers, was on 2nd April, 1952.  Of course, it might have been a day earlier, but it was not.  It was 2nd April, 1952.  The section is in exactly the same terms, postponing, in certain circumstances, the payment of the duty to 1st January, 1953.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to indicate to the House any details in relation to the status or financial position of any company that may be involved in any such payment.  Deputy MacEntee is fully appreciative of the reasons why this sub-section is desirable, and, while I can appreciate his little joke, I do not think it would be right that we should turn the joke into something serious by indicating the circumstances in which the companies concerned, which we all hope will flourish, would be dragged individually into this arena.</P>
      <P>I do not think that was the Deputy's intention in any way.  I do not think he would wish that to happen.  The plain fact of the matter is that the duty imposed on these stocks is a substantial duty and in these days people do not necessarily have that amount of ready working capital available instanter.  They have the opportunity in this sub-section.  I gracefully acknowledge the precedent the Deputy created.  Under the Deputy's precedent, if they have not the working capital available they have that period of time to put it together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for Finance for the public retraction he has made on behalf of his colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Tánaiste of the irresponsible <Col N="292" /> statements which they made in the year 1952.  I quite agree that the Minister is fully justified in the circumstances in extending this consideration to one of our industries which has had a hard struggle.  I am glad that it is because he recognises their difficulties that he has embodied this sub-section in the section.  I am particularly glad because there are many members in this House who were not here in 1952 and who were not, therefore, as well informed as the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Agriculture and the Tánaiste ought to have been.</P>
      <P>There was not anything the Minister for Finance has just said that I did not say in this House in 1952 and which was not said by my colleague, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce. Now that the situation has been clarified, everybody knows that the section was not introduced in the special particular interest of any combine, certainly not in the interests of the Imperial Tobacco Company or, indeed, of any plutocrat.  It was introduced in the 1952 Bill in the general public interest because it was in the interests of the Irish people that it should be done.  Having elucidated that fact and the Minister having explained the position so admirably to the House, we are content now to let the section pass.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with mineral hydrocarbon light oil.  My recollection, again, is that there was a sort of war dance conducted by, among others, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture in 1952 as to the effects which an increase in the tax on mineral hydrocarbon light oil would have on industry and on the cost of living generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose everything that was said in 1952 in relation to the increase in this particular tax could be repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in 1956.  I think it could be repeated with even greater force because everybody knows what other <Col N="293" /> commodities have gone up.  We have seen what is happening to coal and gas.  We know what has already happened to tobacco and we may be certain that in due course when the inflationary trend which the Government initiated in November last has come to an end, there will be a very serious increase in the general price level.</P>
    <P>Therefore, everything which was said in 1952 in relation to this tax could be repeated to-day.  We are not going to do that since we feel that the public services will be carried on and that there will not be any serious attempt made to secure some reduction in expenditure.  It is better the country should pay as it goes rather than that it should do as it did in 1951 &mdash;borrow in order to balance its Budget.  For that reason, we are not going to vote against the section, merely on the grounds that we do not think this is the best way of dealing with the problem.  We prefer that it should be dealt with in this way rather than fail to take the responsibility for raising the revenue to meet the expenditure for which the Government is responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most definite reactions against the proposal in this section to increase the petrol tax came from the Dublin Taximen's Association.  I think most Deputies have received the representations of that association.  I must say that if the facts stated therein by them are clear, this tax will entail very serious consequences for them individually in a contraction of their net earnings.  I see that there may be difficulty in meeting the case they make on their own behalf by any system of rebate in their favour, but I should like to know if the Minister or the Government have considered the possibility of lessening the effect of the increased tax upon them in any way whatever, whether by modification of the vehicle duty or in some other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not be familiar with the case made by the taximen, but a document was circulated to Deputies.  The earnings from the operation of the taxis are very meagre <Col N="294" /> and the contraction of taximen's earnings in consequence of the increase in duty rates pushes them well below the level which other workers regard as a reasonable livelihood.  The Minister, when he was introducing this tax, as I mentioned before, talked about the unessential use of petrol.  He has given the remission of the tax to those who used it for agricultural purposes. There are other producers in the country who use petrol, to whom indeed expenditure on petrol involves a larger proportion of their total costs than it does in the case of the farmers, and they have to bear the full burden. Most of them can protect themselves by raising prices to the public but farmers cannot.  I presume that is the argument in favour of giving the concession to farmers.</P>
    <P>The case of the taxi owners is that they cannot hope to get people to hire them if they increase their price.  They must bear the whole of the increased tax on their personal incomes which, on the figures stated by them, are extremely low.  Do the Government propose to consider their position in any way or take any steps to alleviate their position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right when he says that it would not be practicable to deal with the taxi or hackney people as a separate class of the petrol-using community.  I am not aware that the position is as stated by him, that is, that there has been a refusal by the authorities to take into account any increase in their operating costs.  As I understand Deputy Lemass, he suggested there had been a refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said it had not happened, so far as I know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Deputy to say that there had been a refusal.  I take it that that is not so and that there has not been a change in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody will agree that, when it is necessary to impose additional taxation, it is better that one should focus one's attention on things that have to be imported.  There is a large amount of petrol utilisation for <Col N="295" /> non-essential purposes.  Taking the broad picture, undoubtedly some is used in the way Deputy Lemass has suggested.  Unfortunately, it is never possible to make an absolutely perfect law: all one can do is endeavour to deal with the matter in a broad general way that will have broad general results for the community as a whole. Bearing in mind the fact that petrol is utilised to a large extent for nonessential purposes, I think it is an import which should bear some of the burden of taxes that had to be imposed to meet essential services this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some very grave misapprehension on the part of many Deputies as to the relief being afforded to farmers under this famous relief of tax on petrol.  In the ordinary way, how much petrol does a farmer use?  Is he getting any relief on petrol that he will have to use to get his milk to the creamery or to get his milk to the city?  Will he not be charged more by the only transport that is now left to him to bring his manure to the farm from the city or town, namely, C.I.E.?  He will now be charged more by them, and by every lorry owner and haulier.</P>
      <P>The hardest hit section of the community under this tax are the unfortunate farmers who have had no increase and whose milk costings are tied up there for the past four years.  Governments have done fairly well out of these taxes.  I put the following question to the Minister to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each of the years 1950-51 to 1955-56 the revenue derived from (a) petrol taxation....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply, the Minister informed me that the revenue received by Governments in 1950-51 from petrol taxation was £3,630,972.  It went up to over £4,000,000 in 1951-52; it was more than £6,000,000 in 1952-53; and, in 1953-54, it was £6,820,292.  In 1954-55, it was £7,148,520, and, in 1955-56, it rose to £7,557,552.  That shows an increased revenue of something over £4,000,000 between 1951 and 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no idea yet of what the new petrol taxation will bring in. <Col N="296" /> However, despite the fact that he will have that revenue, the Minister went to the motor taxation fund, put in his hand and took out £500,000 which should have been devoted to roads which will deteriorate as a result of people using petrol on them.  The Minister has ignored that.</P>
    <P>With regard to motor taxation, about which I also asked the Minister to-day, there is an increase from £2,838,380 in 1950-51 to a provisional estimate of over £5,000,000 in 1955-56. The Government are doing pretty well out of that taxation.  They have got an extra £4,000,000 by way of petrol tax since 1950-51, and they must really be scraping the bottom of the pot when they have had to turn to that item again and increase still further the tax on it.</P>
    <P>This so-called relief to the agricultural community is not worth anything to the farmer.  The Minister is well aware that the modern tractor is not run on petrol.  How much will the relief given to the farmer in that line amount to in 12 months?  If the Minister wants to keep his bond to the agricultural community, is he going to give relief by a reduction in the petrol tax so far as lorries carrying agricultural produce are concerned?  People who do not understand the position stand up in this House and say that the agricultural community are getting something.  The agricultural community have nothing to expect from this House but whatever taxation can be piled on their back, and the sooner they realise that, the better.</P>

The Minister has found that there, too, the bottom of the pot has been scraped.  He knows that whatever Government tries to borrow in this country in future will get very little.  The happy period that existed for the Minister when he came in here in 1947 and had the Yanks and the Yankee money to borrow is ended.  He <Col N="297" /> now has to put an increased tax on petrol.  He is already getting more than £4,000,000 from petrol over what was got in 1950-51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would consider the position he has brought about as a result of the increase in the price of petrol, so far as it affects men making their living from the use of petrol.  I refer particularly to approximately 600 taximen in Dublin City.  I do not know whether or not the Minister understands or appreciates how some of these men work.  Apart from the man who owns his own car and hires himself and his car&mdash;plies it for hire&mdash;there is the type of employment in the Dublin taxi business, whereby a man is given a car on hire to himself, for which he pays so much per week.  What comes to him then over and above the petrol and oil is his wage.  I have spoken to the representatives of the taximen, who had hoped that a deputation of them would have been received by the Minister, in order that they could make clear to him how the impact of this increase would affect them, but the Minister thought it was unnecessary to receive them, and consequently they were not able to bring to his notice a number of details which, I think, might have persuaded him to reconsider their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At many times in the year, in the off season, their cars are not used any way extensively, and the period at which they do get what one might call full employment is at the height of the tourist season.  I am told that, if they take a passenger from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire to the boat, the consumption of petrol on the way back is not calculated in the profit margin regulated by the clock of the taxi.  I should have thought that the Minister might have considered, if it were impossible effectively to control the remission of tax on petrol to such persons, even reducing the registration fee which was increased on them not so long ago, and I had hoped that, if he had seen these people, he might have effected a compromise, not quite satisfactory to them and, maybe, not quite satisfactory to him, but at a very nominal cost, <Col N="298" /> and that he might have found a way out of bringing back their registration fee to £10 per year instead of the present fee they have to pay.</P>
    <P>I am making this appeal to the Minister, and I ask him: will he concede anything?  Some of these men who have to raise families under present circumstances have shown me figures which in many cases only bring to them, as a result of a week's work, a little less than £4 10s. a week.  There is the way out, I suggest, of reducing the registration fee.  I do not know whether the Minister realises the very heavy insurance premium which attaches to a vehicle of this kind used for public transport.  Everything these people use has increased, and the raw material from which they earn their daily bread is this petrol on which the Minister has put, in their case, an extra tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, as he has said, that the import of petrol has become a very heavy and serious drain on our own assets, and contributes very extensively to the adverse trade balance, but at least they cannot be placed in the category to which he referred, that generally people who use petrol are not using it on a productive side that brings in any benefit.  I cannot speak for other areas that I do not know, but there are hackney men in country districts and I am sure some rural Deputy from some other area of the country might be inclined to speak for them.  I can only speak for those of whom I have some knowledge.  I say this is putting on them a very grave hardship, and the Minister will have to give an indication that he will consider doing something to help.  I have said that I can see difficulties of control in the distribution of cheap petrol as against the full price, and that is why I have said on my own that it might be possible to consider a reduction in the registration fee for the car or taxi itself.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not satisfied that what I am saying is a true picture and that it is, indeed, a very serious situation for these people, I would ask him to change his mind about not receiving representatives of such a body.  After <Col N="299" /> all, they are citizens who contribute to the taxation in a very large way.  Their cars bear an import duty on the parts; the petrol they use, which must be very extensive, is paying a very heavy tax; and the registration fees they pay bring in a considerable amount of money to the Exchequer.  Consequently, though they are a small number of people in relation to the whole State, these 600 in the City of Dublin and whatever number there are in the whole country&mdash;which I cannot say&mdash; are indirect taxpayers of very big amounts of money, taking it from a point of view of average payment per head of the population.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether he would be prepared to give any concession to relieve the situation which has developed among these people who make their living from taxi work in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry has raised the question of vehicles using petrol and conveying agricultural produce. I want to refer the Minister to people who are very important from the point of view of service to the rural community.  They are the small traders in villages here and there through the country who go around weekly collecting eggs, poultry and so on from farmers and cottiers who have no market available.  Everybody knows that the marketing of agricultural produce, particularly for people like that, and the marketing of eggs while they are fresh, and so on, is an immense benefit to the rural community, and very important for the economic life of those people in scattered areas.  One man engaged in that business, who has only one lorry, working on the figures of his last year's experience, told me that it is going to cost him £168 extra this year to carry on the same work. How they are to be guarded against these extra costs and, at the same time, give service to the community, is a problem that is haunting them night and day.  They do not want to be put out of business, and certainly the marketing of these products is so vital that I think the Minister ought to reconsider the impost upon them.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether a division will be challenged <Col N="300" /> on this or not.  I am never notified of these things, and I have to act as my own Whip.  The only trouble is that, in doing so, I am quite liable to find myself in the painful situation described by Deputy MacEntee in which the Minister for Social Welfare, and the Minister for Agriculture, find themselves at the moment.  The difference, of course, lies in the fact that I am imposing it on myself, and they are in the happier position that the whipping is being done for their Parties, as far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>This imposition on petrol, as on tobacco, is to enable the day to day services of the State to be carried on and to keep the wheels of the machinery of State running.  As far as the Government are concerned, they are put to the pin of their collar to try to get sufficient funds from any source possible, in order to pay for the services, and I think we are coming near the end of the road, in so far as avenues of taxation are available to whatever Government is in power.  These two recent impositions, particularly the one in regard to petrol and the one previously mentioned, tobacco, have practically closed the last resort for whatever Government is in power to raise money from the ordinary sources to keep the State services functioning and from that point of view it will be a very serious position for the Minister for Finance next year if he finds that the balance of payments problem is as serious as at the present moment and if&mdash;what is still more serious&mdash;our output from agricultural and industrial sources does not increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal opinion is that if the Opposition were in power they would have to find the money for those services and I do not think it is unfair for me to suggest that whatever Minister for Finance would be charged by Fianna Fáil with the duty of raising the money, he would have no hesitation in &ldquo;having a go&rdquo; at the subsidies. I think if it is a choice between interfering with the subsidies, especially as far as bread is concerned, and imposing taxation on luxury consumer goods such as petrol, unpleasant as it may be, I prefer to face the <Col N="301" /> public criticism by voting for the increase on petrol.  My belief is that anything that is produced within the State and that comes from the work or the hands of Irishmen at home should be taxed in the lightest manner possible.  Consideration should be given to that particular aspect of the matter but when we come to imported goods I am afraid that the serious situation discloses no other avenue but to try to reduce the import into this country of petrol or other items.</P>
    <P>The impact of increased taxation on petrol will have an effect on local authorities in many ways.  If, on the one hand there is a reduction in the amount of petrol used, say, by people for pleasure purposes in rural areas and so forth, there will be less use made of the roads.  At the present moment, possibly the biggest item in the rates so far as any local authority is concerned, is the amount of money that goes on the upkeep of roads, and in recent years there has been a tremendous amount of traffic on all roads in the State.  To my mind we are neglecting our railways to a great extent and giving preference to the roads.  There is no end to the number of firms throughout the country who prefer to have vans and trucks to bring their products directly to their destinations without utilising the service of C.I.E.  Wherever possible I would prefer to see these people persuaded to go back to using C.I.E. services rather than having these fleets of vans on the roads thereby increasing the consumption of petrol on the one hand and contributing to the deterioration of the roads on the other.</P>
    <P>Petrol is only one aspect of the matter.  All the vehicles are imported; perhaps they are assembled here but I shall not go into that side of it, because outside the assembly work that is done, the sole benefit, one might say, to the State is the employment given in assembly work and it is very debatable whether the amount of money expended on assembly work here is justified under the circumstances. I know that many vehicles to-day could be imported assembled at far cheaper prices than they are sold <Col N="302" /> here at the present time.  That is because the assembling is done in Ireland.  If it was the case that the raw material was produced in Ireland and that the vehicles themselves were not just assembled but were produced here as well, then I would certainly object strenuously to any steps that would be taken by the Minister for Finance to harm what I would describe as a home industry.  But in so far as this particular item is concerned&mdash; petrol&mdash;I, personally with regret, find myself in the position that I intend to vote for the extra tax that is imposed here on petrol.</P>
    <P>It would have been a much easier proposition for me just to criticise the Government and to go into the Division Lobbies against them, but I am taking an unpopular stand on this from the point of view that I believe, if we are sincere about reducing the importation of luxury goods, it is the duty of every Deputy to show an example.  It is quite all right for the Opposition to belabour the present Government about its failure to fulfil its promises; they are fully entitled to do so.  I am not a member of the Opposition; I have no ties with any Party, but rather than just walk into the Division Lobbies to oppose any increase in taxation, I want to make it quite clear that the two items in the Budget on which I am supporting increases are petrol and tobacco.  Outside of those, I am not one bit convinced and I have no intention of supporting Government policy on other aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan's position is quite understandable.  He is in partial agreement, at any rate, with the Opposition in believing that a balanced Budget is better than an unbalanced Budget and that it is better to tax than to borrow to meet current expenditure.  We are in agreement on that, but the reason I have risen again is to protest against the suggestion which was first made by the Minister and which, I regret to say, has been to some extent repeated by Deputy McQuillan&mdash;that a tax on mineral hydrocarbon oils is a luxury tax.  It is not.  Of course, everybody knows private cars are used for private purposes, but just because a car happens <Col N="303" /> to be an ordinary saloon and is not a truck or a delivery van, does not at all prove that it is being used for luxury purposes.</P>
      <P>It is true that there is greatly increased traffic on the roads now as compared with other years but that is merely&mdash;I should hope&mdash;a reflection of increased business activity, of an increased desire, at any rate, to do business, because very little business is being done in recent months.  It is but a reflection of an increased desire to do business, to induce people to sell, to induce people to buy.  Many of those cars which we see on the roads are being used for business purposes, whether by commercial travellers, perhaps by veterinary surgeons, or used by doctors or others, and it is, I think, misleading the public to suggest that this is a tax on a luxury.</P>

      <P>This is a tax on an article which is at least 85 per cent. to 90 per cent. an absolutely essential material in the transport industry. Much more petrol is used for the transport of goods than for the transport of passengers, and when we increase the price of petrol to-day, as I assume we shall, let us not forget we are decreasing the competitive capacity of agriculture, our main industry, and of a great many manufacturing industries which we should be endeavouring to foster.  I understand Deputy McQuillan's position, which is very much like my own, in this matter. Since we are committed to expenditure&mdash;since the Government have committed us to expenditure&mdash;I would rather the Government would take the responsibility of imposing taxation to get the necessary expenditure than that they should refuse to take the steps necessary to balance the Budget. I say that, while making it quite clear that what we do in this section is to increase the burden on our agricultural industry, to increase the burden upon our manufacturing industry, to increase the burden upon all those who have engaged in the sale of merchandise. So long as we are fully aware of that, I suppose there is not anything <Col N="304" /> more to be said in criticism of this tax.</P>

      <P>I have a further objection to this tax&mdash;a very grave objection.  I object very definitely to this House being used for the fostering of a monopoly&mdash;a State subsidised monopoly&mdash; for the wiping out of the private haulier in this country.  That is what this tax does.  It is some years now since I made a visit to Roscommon, but in view of this I think I would like to take a few tourists there to see how they get along there at all.  I feel sure Deputy McQuillan will find that this tax will have the same serious repercussions in Roscommon as it will have in my constituency, where at least one, if not two, decent families in each parish make a livelihood out of a lorry used to draw goods for the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>That type of haulier has got knocks enough from all Governments through the fostering of a monopoly which has killed the transport industry of this country.  The Minister comes in now and gives that man a further knock. The Minister imposes this tax on petrol because he knows C.I.E. have gone over to the use of diesel oil. Knowing that, he comes along now to complete the job by putting this tax on the petrol lorry.  That is nothing but an endeavour to drive families depending on haulage out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people were performing a service for the agricultural community which was not performed by C.I.E. and never could be.  Those men are now to be driven out of existence.  I do not know whether Deputy McQuillan cares a hang if they are driven out of existence in Roscommon.  I certainly do not wish to see the farmers of my constituency deprived of a very essential service.  The Minister is no longer a child even though he might act like one occassionally.  Nobody but a child would come along with a joke like he has presented this year in the line of a financial policy.  The Minister is well aware that the duties he imposed on wheat constitute enough of a wallop without a further tax on the haulage of wheat to the mills.  That is what is being done through this petrol tax. <Col N="305" /> The Minister knows that the activities of the Minister for Agriculture drove 18,000 tons of beet out of the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into detail on agricultural policy.  I am just commenting that, having already deprived the farmer of revenue by reducing his income, and having to take the money abroad to buy the sugar the beet would produce at home, the Minister now comes along and taxes the lorry which will draw the beet to the factory.  The Minister comes along like one of those legal gentlemen and says: &ldquo;Look what I am doing for the farmer; I am taking the tax off his petrol,&rdquo; completely ignoring that nine-tenths of the petrol used by the farmer will be taxed under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he would look about him, if he is anxious to impose extra taxation, and find some means of taxing petrol being used as a luxury, if he is anxious to give the farmers relief from taxation. Take country lorries used practically wholly for the drawing of pigs to the market, in taking cattle to market, in drawing agricultural produce to markets and mills.  Surely there should be some means of relieving them? Perhaps the situation is that behind the mind of the Minister is the fact that those beggars have survived for the last 15 years in spite of everything that has been done to drive them out of existence.  They have survived only because the agricultural community want them.  The Minister now wants to drive them out by a very simple manoeuvre.  They must pay the extra tax on petrol while C.I.E. go free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should <Col N="306" /> wake up and tell us what he intends doing, should tell us if he has any intention of relieving the taxation on petrol used by the agricultural community. I consider it unfair and unjust to the agricultural community, now that they have their crops in the ground at a fixed price, to put a further tax on those crops in the shape of taxation on petrol.  The Minister is aware that every year the price of beet is fixed in November.  He comes along now, when that price is fixed, and very cutely has stopped any hope of the farmer getting anything extra to meet the extra cost being put on him.  He has prevented the Sugar Company from getting the increase that would meet the tax and now he comes along with a further tax on petrol.  There are, as I have stated, about 600,000 tons of beet to be drawn. Does the Minister intend allowing the farmer anything extra for the haulage of that beet, and, if he does, how is he going to allow it?</P>
    <P>One would think that there was nobody to be considered but the people of Dublin and the taxi drivers. I am more concerned with the unfortunate chap who is trying to rear a family in a labourer's cottage, whose only means of livehood is his lorry. Out of that, out of the profits which he makes in the use of that lorry, he has to support a wife and children on the side of the road.  The Minister is going to wipe that man out and put him into the category that was so ably named here by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Donovan, and our dearly beloved colleague, the Minister for Foolish Affairs, or Agriculture, Deputy James Dillon, when they came here and told us that emigration is the safety valve of the nation.  Owing to these proposals, many more people will be going through that safety valve.  It will be used now to drive the lorry drivers out of this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got enough.  He has got something over £4,000,000 a year of an increase in revenue out of the tax on petrol.  That should be enough for him.  Out of that, he should be prepared to do something to take away this extra burden, the last straw that breaks the camel's back, <Col N="307" /> which he is imposing on the agricultural community under this section.</P>

      <P>In addition to the farming community, to whom the previous speaker has referred, and the taxi people to whom other people have also referred, there are also the hackney people, commercial travellers, those who run delivery vans, transporters of farm produce, licensed hauliers and private hauliers, vets, doctors, clergymen, and other professional people who have work to do that is essential to the community.  All these people are being regarded, under this section of the present Budget, as being nonessential. The use of petrol by them is regarded as a luxury.  I should like to ask the people in Government to-day, particularly the Labour Party, who, in 1952, had the gallery of this House packed to capacity with the taxi drivers and hackney people from around Dublin, if they now agree to this imposition.  They have not gathered those people up to-night nor do they seem to be inclined to talk very much on this section of the Finance Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position we seem to have arrived at now is that this petrol tax is being further increased, a tax that, four years ago, was being condemned all round by the people now forming the Government.  It was then considered unjust and unnecessary. It is now considered an essential and something that we cannot do without, in order to salvage what is left of this country.  It is a luxury for taxi drivers, commercial travellers, clergymen, doctors, nurses and vets. to use petrol.  In addition to that, there are also the delivery vans of the various business houses throughout the country who have been giving a service to the people.  These people are now in the luxury class, or are burning petrol for the love of burning it.  The workers throughout the country, who have to travel from their homes to their employment are also people who are using petrol as a luxury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to assume that 80 per cent. of the entire consumption of petrol in this country is not in the luxury class. It is an essential commodity to the people who are using it.  Despite that, the 20 per cent. or even 10 per cent. who may be in the luxury class are being used in this House as the reason why the other 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. must carry this burden.  At the same time you have hauliers holding licences from the Department of Industry and Commerce who are being driven out of business for one reason or another, possibly for the reason already suggested, in order to boost up the subsidised monopoly of C.I.E., which cannot and never will give the service which these people throughout the remoter parts of Ireland are giving to-day.  But they are being costed out <Col N="309" /> of the business due to this increase in petrol, and when they seek to change over to a diesel machine which carries a smaller tax and which has not been hit in the same way, they find, when they go to the present Minister in the Department of Industry and Commerce, they will not be given a new licence in respect of the new vehicle for the reason that, as everybody knows, in order to get a carrying capacity in a diesel vehicle equal to that of a petrol machine you must buy a machine that weighs up to 10 cwt. more.</P>
    <P>A term of the licence is that the unladen weight of the machine has to be a certain figure.  Very often if that figure is 2 tons 10 cwt. or 3 tons or 3½ tons, the present Minister refuses to give a new licence to replace that petrol driven machine which weighed, say, 3 tons by a 3½ tons diesel driven machine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be but I put it to you with all due respect that this is part and parcel of the hardship brought about on the licensed hauliers of this country by virtue of the increase in the petrol tax.  We must remember that the very people who are now increasing this tax, who are now defending the increase, are the very same people who said in 1952 that this increase was not justified, that it was going to leave the wives and families of taxi men in this State starving and that it would put hackney men out of business and cause emigration.  What has since taken place to change the whole picture? What has occurred to make this tax so desirable to the self-same people who then opposed it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was listening to one Deputy here a while ago, Deputy McQuillan, who apparently wants to have it both ways. He says that he will vote for the increase in these taxes on petrol and on tobacco because they are luxuries or semi-luxuries, because the Government have been placed in the position to-day that money must be found, and <Col N="310" /> that if we were in office we would do the same thing.  What I want to point out is that if we were in office the big difference would be that the present position would not have arisen and these taxes would not be necessary. It is all very well for the Minister for Finance to laugh.  The Minister for Finance will recall that in 1954, the last term in which we presented a Budget in this House, we were then in the position that we could give some small reliefs which were sneered at by the Minister and his colleagues.  We were even accused then of bringing in a Budget much heavier than was necessary and which would show a surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, but I want to conclude on this note, that this story which is being put across&mdash;apparently Deputy McQuillan believes it &mdash; that this side of the House would be taking similar action to that of the present Government if they were in office to-day is entirely false and is based on false assumptions.  As I already stated, the position in 1954 was much sounder and the present adverse balance of payments, which is a serious crisis for this country, amounting to a figure of £35,000,000 under this Government, rose to that figure from a mere figure of £5,000,000 under Fianna Fáil when the 1954 Budget was brought before this House.  The fundamental difference between our policy and the lack of policy of this present Government has brought about the present position which was created by mishandling, maladministration and the reckless promises made that cannot be kept by those people that gave them in order to get into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this extra tax on petrol, we know from some figures given by the Minister for Finance to-day that in 1951 the revenue from taxation on petrol was £4,400,000, and that it is £7,500,000 to-day.  The present Government thought the extra taxation imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1952 was a desperate burden on the community, yet the <Col N="311" /> Minister for Finance to-day is getting more than £3,000,000 extra from petrol than was obtained in 1951-52.  This Minister is the Minister for Finance in a Government which is solemnly pledged to reduce taxation, and they are taking almost £4,000,000 on this one item alone.  The income of the community was greater in 1951-52 than it is to-day and according to the then Opposition the people were not able to bear any increased taxation.</P>
      <P>It is useless to say that this will not further increase the cost of living.  The Minister well knows that it will.  The Minister sitting beside him knows quite well that in his own constituency it will increase the cost of house building, a very important item.  It will increase rents, the price of food and the cost of living generally, because 90 per cent. of the goods transported in this country is carried on the roads to-day.  The railways could be closed down to-morrow morning and they would not affect the issue at all. The railways exist merely for carrying a few passengers and most of the goods being transported are carried by lorries and vans.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Blaney is a very important one.  Petrol-driven engines for heavy lorries are not being manufactured any more; it is only diesel lorries that are being manufactured. People cannot buy a new lorry unless the Minister for Industry and Commerce will increase the unladen weight.  Two people came to me this morning in connection with the same matter.  Their petrol lorry is worn out. There are no new lorries with petrol engines available and they will be put out of business.  I hope it is not the policy of the Government to wipe out completely that section of the community. I hope the Government will repent at this late stage for all the crimes they have committed against this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises because there would not have been any need for this increased taxation on petrol now had the Government carried out the promises they made to the electorate. Even if they had kept taxation as it was, instead of increasing it by £25,000,000, the position might not be so bad, but it is costing £15,000,000 more to run this broody hen Government, more than it cost two years ago. That is the sum that is being taken out of the pockets of the people.  The increased tax on petrol will not lie lightly on the people.  The full impact of this will only be appreciated as the year goes on when the question of transporting our millions of pounds worth of agricultural produce arises. That will have some effect on the balance of payments and the Minister may have to come in with another Budget inside a few months and further tax some of our imports. Otherwise, the balance of payments position will worsen as time goes on. This will be a very serious year for all our people.  Unfortunately that will not affect the Government, but the whole community will be affected by the lunatic economic policy of the present Government.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this to see if he can do without the increased <Col N="313" /> revenue he hopes to derive from the increased petrol tax.</P>

      <P>One hundred and thirty gallons per week is a lot of petrol to consume in that sort of work.  The plain fact of the matter is that the revenue has to be found.  I do not suggest this is a luxury tax.  I said it was a tax on a less essential commodity and putting a tax on a less essential commodity is not the same thing as taxing a luxury. One can do without it, by cutting out, for example, the additional £971,000 incorporated in the Estimates, this year for the health services.  If that sum were not in those Estimates, this tax would not appear in the Budget at all.  If the additional 2/6 for the old age pensioners in last year's Budget had not got to be paid for in this year's Estimates, this tax would not be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the figure of £1,116,000 for social assistance had not been included, this tax would not be necessary now.  The plain fact of the matter is that services have to be paid for and, when the services have to be paid for, this is a fair way of obtaining the moneys necessary, particularly in our present circumstances.</P>
