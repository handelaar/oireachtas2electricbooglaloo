      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the s.s. <i>Dún Aengus</i> is to be withdrawn from service on 18th February for an indefinite period, and that it is recommended that live stock intended for sale be forwarded not later than that date; and, if so, if he will ask C.I.E. to arrange for future shipments in the event of a prolonged absence of the <i>Dún Aengus</i> from service so as to obviate premature sales of live stock; further, if he will cause inquiries to be made as to the least inconvenient time to send the <i>Dún Aengus</i> for future surveys, with particular reference to the period immediately following on the autumn fairs.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the s.s. <i>Dún Aengus</i> is to be withdrawn from service shortly for survey in connection with the renewal of the vessel's passenger and load line certificates and that C.I.E. have asked Aran islanders to forward live stock intended for sale before the vessel is due to be withdrawn from service.  The operation of the Galway-Aran service is the responsibility of C.I.E. and I have no doubt that C.I.E. will do everything possible to minimise the inconvenience to the islanders while the vessel is withdrawn from the service.  C.I.E. are arranging to replace the s.s. <i>Dún Aengus</i><Col N="195" /> in due course by a new vessel, and in this connection the suggestion made as to the most suitable time for the withdrawal of the vessel for survey will be conveyed to C.I.E.  I might also mention for the Deputy's information that I have since been informed that the <i>Dún Aengus</i> will be available for the February fair and will be brought back into service as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1955 the Tralee <Col N="197" /> Urban District Council indicated to the Department of Industry and Commerce that they wished to acquire land on the Tralee/Dingle branch railway line for a housing scheme.  In reply to their inquiry about the abandonment of the railway they were informed that under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, C.I.E. were empowered to make abandonment orders in respect of railway lines in which transport services had been permanently discontinued.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. were authorised in June, 1953, by an order of the transport tribunal, to discontinue permanently train services on the Tralee/Dingle line. Accordingly, the question of the abandonment of this line is now a matter for decision by C.I.E.  Any inquiries should be addressed direct to the board.</P>

      <P>It can be read in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>As regards cattle the total number and value of exports, alive and as carcase beef, can be said to have fallen in the latter part of 1955 only by comparison with the exceptionally high exports in the latter part of 1954 and the early months of 1955.  Exports of canned beef were higher both in volume and value in 1955 than in 1954.  The total number of cattle in the country on the 1st June, 1955, was the second highest ever recorded and was only slightly less than the record figure of 1954.  The reduction in the number of cattle in the older age groups resulting from the exceptionally heavy exports in 1954-55 was largely offset by increases in the number of cattle between one and two years old and under one year old, both of which figures on the 1st June, 1955, were the highest ever recorded for these age groups.  This increase in the numbers of young cattle is most encouraging as regards future exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards sheep, the number in the country has been steadily increasing in <Col N="202" /> recent years and the number on the 1st June, 1955, was the highest recorded for over 20 years past.</P>
    <P>The increase in cattle and sheep production in recent years has, of course, been a direct consequence of the link established under the 1948 Trade Agreement with Britain between the prices for our cattle and sheep and the guaranteed prices for British home-bred cattle and sheep.  As announced by me early in December, very satisfactory arrangements, to apply as from the 28th March, 1956, were then made with the British authorities in regard to price links between our store cattle, sheep and lambs fattened in Britain and British home-bred fat stock, no changes being visualised in those arrangements for a period of at least three years unless there should be a substantial alteration in conditions such as a fundamental change in the British system of their fat stock guarantees.</P>
    <P>Because of the high level of cattle and sheep numbers recorded in June last, and as exports in the latter part of 1955 were not as heavy as in the previous year, it would seem reasonable to expect some increases in the volume of cattle and sheep exports during the coming year.  While the prices for our store cattle and store sheep fattened in Britain will of course be affected by prevailing market conditions, it is important to remember that they will have the sure foundation of the British guarantees to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As regards pig meat, there has also been a link under the Pigs and Bacon Agreement of 1951 with Britain between the prices for our exports and the guaranteed prices for British home-produced pigs.  Reductions in the latter prices from 1954 onwards have been reflected in the prices of our exports of pork and bacon which have consequently fallen in volume and value. The prices paid for these exports under the agreement are, of course, still substantially higher than the prices paid for Britain's imports from other countries. With a view to encouraging pig production as much as possible, I recently announced that I propose, when the agreement terminates on the 30th April, 1956, to provide an assured <Col N="203" /> export price for Grade A bacon.  Since pig production is very sensitive to market prices at home (where the bulk of the production is consumed) as well as export prices I cannot very well forecast at this stage what exports may be during the coming year, but I would hope that they may not be less than during the past year.</P>
    <P>As to dairy produce, the main reduction was in chocolate crumb exports, the value of which fell by 15 per cent. and the volume by under 12 per cent. This is accounted for not only by increased domestic production in Britain but also by a fall in the consumer demand on that market for finished chocolate due to the unusually warm summer in 1955.  The value of butter exports fell by over £700,000 but in any comparison of exports for the two years account must be taken of the fact that our consumption of butter was 33,000 cwt. higher in 1955 than in 1954.  That quantity would have realised about £650,000 on the export market. The variations in the total value of exports of other items of dairy produce were relatively insignificant in 1955 as compared with 1954, the value of exports of cheese and infant foods being down while exports of cream, condensed and dried milk were up.</P>
    <P>As to the prospects for 1956, there is every indication that there will be an increase in milk production with consequently a rising trend in the level of exports of dairy products.  The return which we may receive on such exports will, of course, depend on the competition which our produce will meet on the export market.</P>
    <P>The egg export position is unfortunately not encouraging.  The bulk of our surplus of output is exported to Britain but owing to the producer subsidy system in operation there which encourages high production, especially at the time of year when our export surplus is greatest, exports of eggs from here have fallen both in volume and value.  An important improvement could be effected if our production could be increased in the second half of the year when the British market can absorb more exported eggs at reasonably good prices.  We are, of <Col N="204" /> course, losing no opportunity in attempting to develop other outlets for eggs in addition to the British market.</P>
    <P>The value of dead poultry exported in 1955 was slightly above that of 1954. This was due mainly to an increase of approximately 9 per cent. in the numbers of turkeys exported and to an increase in the unit value figure.  There was also an increase of nearly 50 per cent. in the numbers of chickens exported in 1955.  It is not unreasonable to expect a further improvement in these exports in 1956.</P>
    <P>I feel no pessimism as to the future of our agricultural exports, provided we make ever increasing use of the best technical means which are now at the disposal of every farmer.</P>

      <P>As in other parts of the country, the returns from the potato crop last year in Aran were below average, but I am advised that the yield, together with the substantially increased quantity of seed potatoes allocated there under my Department's seed distribution scheme, should provide adequate seed for the coming season.  The object of this scheme is to provide a change of seed and thereby to keep the potato crop healthy.  I am satisfied that two cwt. of new seed for each eligible smallholder are sufficient for this purpose.</P>

      <P>You are getting very pedantic in the Fianna Fáil Party in <Col N="206" /> your old age.  This is meant to provide a change of seed.  They already have their own seed potatoes from their own stock and this would be supplementary to it.  I feel the Deputy cannot but know that we inquired into these conditions&mdash;particularly in places like the Aran Islands and Connemara &mdash;with scrupulous care.  I am quite convinced that the provision made here is adequate and sufficient for the purpose of the scheme.  While I am reluctant to say to the Deputy, when he asks me to make further and better inquiries, that I will not do so, the only reason I am obliged to say that is because I have made the most careful inquiries.  The best advice I can get is that the provision of two cwt. of potatoes for every farmer on the islands is a fair and adequate provision for the purpose of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that the Minister has been informed that the quantities of native seed are as great this year as formerly and that, on the basis of that information, he has again fixed the amount at two cwt.?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making better and larger provision this year than last year.  I am doing that in the light of the fact that in common with every other part of the country, the yield in potatoes last year was lower than is customary owing to the excessively dry wheather.  I can assure the Deputy that, in our considered judgement, this provision should be ample.  However, if there comes to the Deputy's personal attention some case of personal hardship, and he indicates the circumstances to me, I feel sure we would be able to do something to meet such a case.  I think he should rest assured that the general provision which has been made is ample.  However, as I say, if an individual case of hardship is brought to my attention I will look into it and take any steps that may be necessary to remedy the particular case.</P>

One of the conditions attaching to the grants made available for the improvement of county roads is that the width of finished carriageways should be 16 feet.  The improvement of these roads is being carried out in accordance with the county road improvement plans drawn up by each county council for execution in order of priority.  I am advised that a width of 16 feet is the minimum that could reasonably be specified for the more important country roads.

In so far as road maintenance is concerned, we have nothing to do with it and if the Deputy wishes to make representations to the local county engineer to have these pot-holes filled, so that he will not, as he said, have to zig-zag round them, I am sure the county engineer will endeavour to give every facility.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a tender for erecting 73 rural cottages which was accepted by the Kerry County Council in July, 1955, and which the contractor withdrew in November last.  The council have since accepted alternative tenders for 29 of the cottages and have recently obtained fresh tenders for the remaining 44 cottages.  I think it is desirable that I should await the submission of proposals from the county council arising out of their consideration of these latter tenders.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, it might appear from the discussion on this Bill that the House gave very little consideration to it, but I am well aware that is not so and I would like to pay a tribute to Deputies on all sides of the House who have consulted me since the Bill was first introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> I have gone over the Bill in detail with small committees of all Parties and I must thank them for the most helpful advice which I have received from them.  I would like particularly to refer to the Labour Party Deputies. They did not contribute at any great length to the discussion on the Bill, but I can assure the House that they did give me considerable help in discussing the very many sections with which they were concerned.  I should like to pay particular tribute also to the Deputies from Cork City.  I received deputations from Deputies of all sides from Cork City and they were most helpful and made some very useful suggestions, all of which will be considered by me between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch yesterday referred to the hardship which might be caused to men who took part in the struggle for national independence and who were debarred from entering into the local authority service as a result of their activities.</P>
    <P>Certainly I have a lot of sympathy with the men who took part in the national struggle, but I do not think it is my duty to provide pensions for them.  That is a matter for the Minister for Defence.  I think that successive Governments have already&mdash; I will not say liberally&mdash;done their best to compensate them for any losses they may have sustained for any services they gave.  It should not be any part of a Superannuation Bill to intervene in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also referred to what is solely a Cork problem&mdash;the refund of contributions paid by the servants of the Cork Corporation.  He set out in detail the circumstances under which these contributions were paid.  I, for the first time, under this Bill propose refunding to these contributors the amount they contributed, but I also endeavoured to cushion the impact of this refund on the ratepayers of Cork. The amount involved will be somewhere between £23,000 and £30,000 and were the refund to be made immediately on this Bill becoming an Act, I understand that the impact on the <Col N="220" /> rates would be 2/6 in the £.  It was to prevent that impact on the ratepayers that I suggested the refund should be deferred until these workers retired from the service of the corporation when the refund would be spread over a number of years and would not have the same impact on the ratepayers. However, these are matters which we can discuss in more detail on the Committee Stage of the Bill and I would welcome any suggestions which Deputies might wish to make on the matter.</P>
    <P>I had a chance of discussing with Cork Deputies last night various matters which they raised&mdash;added years for national service for legal assistants and exemptions from contributions in certain cases.  I have given an undertaking that I will go into these matters between now and the Committee Stage and that undertaking I will certainly keep.</P>
    <P>The Cork Deputies also raised the matter to which I have already referred&mdash;the refund of the contributions paid by the servants of the Cork Corporation.  We can discuss that matter in greater detail on the Committee Stage and I would welcome suggestions from the Cork Deputies, particularly, if we can get those representing the servants and those representing the ratepayers, when it might be possible to strike a happy medium in the matter.  I also received several deputations on the question of admission to the contribution free categories of various servants.  There is one principle which I must bear in mind, that is, the principle in the 1948 Act.  It is one from which I should not like to depart.  It is that free pensions cannot be entertained after a certain date and that date is 1st April, 1948.  The exemptions given prior to that were intended only to apply to those who had been appointed as pensionable officers before the benefits of the 1948 Act applied.  The deputation pointed out that certain hardships might be incurred and I am prepared to look into that matter between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also referred to another category which sought exemption, the vocational teachers That is <Col N="221" /> also a matter into which I will look between now and the Committee Stage.  He also referred to the retired pensioners and asked me to make some provision for the increase to which they are allegedly entitled.  I purposely referred to that in my opening speech on the Second Reading, and I refer the Deputy to what I said on that occasion. A number of my colleagues are concerned in this matter and I could not possibly undertake to introduce in a Local Government Superannuation Bill principles which might govern my colleagues in the other Departments, but I did say in my Second Reading speech that the Minister for Finance had promised to look into this matter and make a statement thereon in his Budget speech this year.  Further than that I am afraid I cannot go.</P>
    <P>At the outset, Deputy Jack Lynch, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, said that this Bill was a technical Bill &mdash;merely a Committee Stage Bill.  I am in full agreement with that and on that account I do not wish to speak at too great a length, but I must crave the co-operation of the House.  If I am to have this Bill enacted by the 1st April next, I will require to get all the stages next week to enable me to bring the Bill into the Seanad before 1st March and so give the Seanad the month of March for consideration of the Bill.  Unless the Bill becomes law on or before 1st April, the provisions will be postponed for 12 months and I am sure that no side of the House would wish to see that occur.  I thank the House for the co-operation I received and I crave their indulgence in regard to the remaining stages of the Bill.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) (Temporary Relief from Taxation) Bill, 1955, until it has received and approved the Government's full proposals for the commercial development of the mineral resources at Avoca, County Wicklow.&mdash;(Deputy Lemass.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not happen to be in the House last night, but I heard that Deputy McGilligan, in order to try to prove that Fianna Fáil had been lax in the investigation of mineral deposits in this country, quoted a statement I made in 1948, quoted that statement in part only and without giving the complete context.  Apparently he quite deliberately wanted to give the impression to the House that the former Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, had in some way given up hope that there were mineral deposits to be exploited.  That was very typical of Deputy McGilligan.  He enjoys misquoting people; he enjoys quoting extracts from debates in order to prove a point.</P>
      <P>Now, although it is of no very great importance to this debate, I think I should explain that in 1948, there was a discussion on the reduction of the grant for the exploration of the Avoca deposits.  At some stage prior to that debate, the Government had been criticised because certain explorations of minerals had failed.  One of the explorations that had proved there was no point in any further commercial exploitation was that undertaken in connection with Arigna iron ore.  There was a time when a number of people here, including mineralogists, making their own private inquiries, were under the impression that it was possible that the British geological survey deliberately understated the position for quasi-political or purely political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was discovered by the Fianna <Col N="225" /> Fáil Government that, in fact, the geological surveys were on the whole reasonably accurate and at one time the former Taoiseach mentioned these surveys in the course of debates; we were being criticised because we had failed to exploit some of the ores in relation to which explorations had been conducted and results proved negative.  One good example was the cost of the iron ore in Arigna where the percentage of iron was found to be insufficient for exploitation; the amount elsewhere in the world was sufficient in quantity and the price sufficiently low to prohibit our going ahead with that project.</P>
    <P>In that debate, having referred to the statement by the former Taoiseach, I went on to say at column 2037 of Volume 110:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time, I am well aware that a number of new processes in regard to mineralogical development have taken place since the war.  There are new and simplified processes of extracting minerals by means of electricity and centrifugal separation, and so on.  Before we take an extremely pessimistic view, that, although we have practically every mineral in this country in small lots in the soil, we must abandon all major mineralogical development, we should make at least one final examination using the new processes evolved during the war for extracting metal from low-grade ores.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement makes it perfectly clear that I, speaking as a member of this Party, advocated our going straight ahead and conducting as many examinations as seemed desirable because of the new processes and also because, since the war, the price of many metals had increased as a result of technological development, the production of high-grade ores and, in the case of copper, as a result of the enormous use of copper for electronic purposes.  Deputy McGilligan can have his little point if he wants it, but it will not get him very far; he fails to quote the remainder of the speech and gives a false idea to the House as to what our views were in regard to mineralogical development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> In relation to the Bill we are now discussing, I recognise that it would be difficult for any Government to make the necessary decisions about Irish participation in this new venture, the nature of the company or the nature of the lease of any company undertaking the extraction of copper, or the nature of the lease with the Government of the day.  Copper mining is, in spite of the high price of copper, still a very speculative project.  I believe that only one out of every 100 ventures goes beyond the prospector stage and only one out of ten mines, after production starts, continues profitably for a number of years, indicating that, although the price of copper is high, copper mining is a very speculative business.</P>
    <P>In contrast to that, as the Minister knows, the price of copper, nickel, lead and zinc has been constantly rising and the development of electronic equipment and atomic energy have stimulated the demand for these metals all over the world.  I understand that the ore at Avoca is 1.2 per cent. and the American Government has spent several billion dollars subsidising private copper mines for the sake of providing a sufficient stockpile of copper for armament purposes, where the percentage is only .9.  Here there is a narrow margin between what is regarded as highly profitable copper mining and mining that requires subsidies. I understand that when the percentage rises from 1.5 to 2 per cent., there is little doubt that it becomes a highly profitable venture and, in the case of the proposition now before us, the profitability of extraction depends on whether the company engaged in the work assumes they must base their estimate on the price of copper for the past three or four years, namely, some 33 to 35 cents per lb., or whether they can gamble on the price of copper remaining at its present very high level of anything from 45 to 48 cents per lb.  There, again, I think it is extremely difficult for the layman to judge what should be the attitude of the House in discussing the terms of the lease.  As the Minister probably knows, aluminium is not as good a conductor as copper, but it definitely <Col N="227" /> enters into the picture when copper rises above a certain price.  As I understand also, aluminium production in the world has not reached its zenith.  In spite of the opening of an enormous plant in Canada, there is still a colossal demand for aluminium metal, even though the ore itself is one of the commonest in the world, unlike copper.</P>
    <P>Again, the probability of the Avoca mines, considering these two price limits, the present price of 46 cents and the average price during the last three years, depends upon a number of factors which it is very difficult to prejudge in this House.  It depends on the extent of stockpiling by Governments for certain purposes; it depends also on how much continued labour unrest exists in various mining centres in the world, the unrest having actually affected the price of copper in recent months.  It depends also on what other sources of copper are likely to be discovered in various parts of the world and to be exploited.  I understand, for example, that there are enormous deposits of copper of a fairly high grade in South America, but the difficulty there is an almost complete absence of transport.  If the transport bottleneck could be overcome, there would be a large source of production available there, and I believe there are similar bottlenecks elsewhere of labour, capital, and so on, the elimination of which could bring a very considerable increase in copper production and changes in the price.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, of course, there is the question of the actual copper market itself and of the price determination by copper interests.  As the Minister probably knows, copper at the moment is sold in the world market on two different bases.  One group of companies have a certain principle in regard to fixing the price and another group have a different principle, and there has been considerable argument in the mining journals in regard to the establishment of these two principles. That again must affect to some degree the question of the lease and the position here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Deputy Lemass suggested various alternative methods by which the Irish capital market could have a part in this venture.  He made it clear himself that it would be very difficult to determine exactly what should be done about it.  For my own part, speaking personally, I feel, having made a very amateur study of this question, and naturally it must be amateur, that on the whole a professional mining company is the one we need and that to have a group of people, without not only professional mining knowledge but intimate contacts with the copper market all over the world, might be very risky.  The fact that, in the world of copper mining, there are copper mining interests who are interlinked as between Africa, Canada and the South American Continent is a very important point in the whole of the discussion on this question.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration not only their international contacts but their technical knowledge, and also the ability of the professional mining company to take tremendous decisions in the direction of capital expenditure planned over a period of one or two years, decisions which will frequently frighten the minds of those who are engaged in an ordinary company who might employ a consulting engineer for this purpose and attune their minds to the copper world. They might find it very difficult to do so because of the necessity of taking advance decisions and engaging in long-term financial commitments.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I would like to repeat what has been suggested and to ask the Minister whether there could not have been some participation between the Canadian interests and Irish interests, if only on a financial basis?  The Minister may have a very reasonable reply to make, but it is surely reasonable on our part to ask this.  We would like to enter into the world mining interests and to get the flavour of the mining world.  There is a number of alternative ways by which, even though this Canadian company were to be the principal partner in the venture, some definite Irish interests could also participate. It might have been possible for some <Col N="229" /> of the share capital to have been made available on the Dublin Exchange in sterling at the time when the prospectus was issued.  It might have been possible for an Irish holding company to have formed a holding company with some financial link with the Canadian company for the purpose of holding some of the shares and having an interest in the venture, or even for the purpose of having some part in the sale of the ore when the ore was extracted. It might have been possible to have a joint company consisting of Irish directors and Canadian directors in which the Canadian section of the company would have some very definite powers in regard to the expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the difficulties in any joint company of this kind is that no professional Canadian mining engineer with long experience of success at this business will act without very great delegation of powers being given to him.  In most of these mining ventures, the principal engineer is given an enormous delegation of authority, is allowed to go ahead with his plans and commit his company to very large expenditure without interference, and most of this kind of men will not act, unless they are given that authority.  Nevertheless, within the ambit of the various suggestions I have made, I should like to ask the Minister if it would not have been possible to have some sort of Irish participation, so that we could have appointed a certain number of persons with executive ability who would acquire a knowledge of mining which might be very useful to us in the future?</P>
    <P>May I also ask the Minister whether any plans have been made in regard to the other ores in Avoca?  Will he tell us whether there is any plan for the disposal of barytes or if there is any other Irish company which would take part of the barytes which would be extracted at the same time as the copper?  I would further like to ask the Minister whether anything can be done with the iron which will become available at the same time?</P>
    <P>Then, we have the question of the further process of smelting the copper. <Col N="230" /> Is it not only reasonable for us to ask whether the Minister is aware of the arrangements that could be made in the future to smelt the copper ore? Would it be possible to have a smelting plant here and would he state whether the lease applies to smelting or whether it is confined purely to extraction, and whether possibly there might be a second company formed in which there would be an Irish group associated or an all-Irish company for smelting ore, or whether we are committed in advance to export the ore before smelting?</P>
    <P>Smelting would give further employment, involving technical processes which would be of great value to this country.  It would bring us in more foreign exchange because the material would be sold at a point where it would receive further processing.  I think it is important for us to know how far the Minister is committed in regard to smelting and what may happen in regard to that matter in the future.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill itself is concerned and the facilities it gives to the mining company, I would like to suggest to the Minister that a great deal of the taxation in relation to industrial development needs revision.  It is rather a pity in a way to see this Bill, which is obviously meant to apply to a very narrow field of activity, when what is needed very badly is a complete revision of taxation to encourage capital development and, in particular, to encourage export development.  In the face of our present balance of payments and with due regard to whatever regulations may exist in regard to the liberalisation of trade under O.E.E.C., it surely is necessary for us to reconsider the taxation as applied to future export industries, industries that will export materials other than ores, if we are to expand our national effort and to overcome this problem of the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Many representations have been made to the Minister by the industrial interests in this country in regard to depreciation allowances and in regard to taxation reductions when new companies are going into business.  A committee was established to report on this matter, but we have had no report <Col N="231" /> from that committee.  It was initiated by this side of the House before we left office and there was a demand that there should be a speedy report from that committee.  There should still be a speedy report from the committee and still speedier action by the Minister for Finance.  Something very bold and emphatic must be done if we are to establish national exports.  Countries such as Germany and other countries in Europe have all sorts of methods by which exports can be established.</P>
    <P>Well worth while schemes can be considered and although ultimately the O.E.E.C. agreement to which we subscribe prohibits exports fostered by tax concessions, a great deal can be done in the initial phases.  The cost of exploring markets and of ascertaining designs required for the foreign market, even the travelling expenses and the advertising campaign necessary in the initial stages, can be very expensive and some method should be designed to give relief from these expenses.  I am sure the Minister can get a wealth of information on these matters.</P>
    <P>There are many other forms of potential production in which the initial costs are great and where the risks, even before such an industry gets into production, are very extensive.  There are the risks of changes in currency values and the prices of competitive products which may have to be met at any time, even just after the venture is in operation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the fact that this Bill has emerged in its present limited form does not mean that the Minister is unaware of these difficulties and that he will reconsider this matter and realise that the principle may have to be extended over a very wide field, if we are to give more employment in this country and build up our national resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In my short time in this House, I have found that, when anything of importance is up for discussion here, it is usually channelled into a political debate, with the apparent object on one side of sabotaging any effort there is being made to <Col N="232" /> get things done.  From the very start, the Opposition launched a vicious attack on this Bill with the obvious intention of not alone preventing the present development in Avoca, but also with the object of discouraging any other people who might be interested in coming into this country with the intention of developing our mineral resources.  It seems to be the view of quite a number of people on the Opposition Benches that, when something like this occurs, there should be a special place kept for people who want to get in on the ground floor and who want to get their share, and more than their share, of what is going.</P>
      <P>I am one who believes very much in the investment of Irish capital at home, but if we cannot get Irish capital invested at home and if, because of that, the mineral resources of the country are left lying, as they have been left lying for the past 30 years, surely something out of the ordinary must be done to have them developed.  I think the suggestion that there should be a special type of protection for vested interests is something which should be treated with the contempt it deserves.</P>
      <P>I know quite well that many people who spoke on the Bill had the idea that this is an attempt to create an industry which will give very big employment in the rural areas.  A number of people on the opposite benches did have that view, but the suggestion that the whole thing will be a failure and that whatever Irish capital is invested in it will go down the drain, is not one that will encourage other people to come in.  I believe that this effort in Avoca is the beginning of a very big attempt to develop Irish minerals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know of the fellows who, in the past 20 years, went around the country where minerals were supposed to be, and looked wise, and then said that there were no minerals there.  We know that the result of that has been that people have been going around saying that there are no minerals worth developing in Ireland.  Now that the contrary has been proved and that people have been found who are prepared to put money into the development <Col N="233" /> of Irish industry, I think it is a shame that anybody should attempt, as the Opposition has attempted, to prevent that development.  I think that every possible encouragement should be given to anybody who is prepared to make a genuine attempt to develop Irish minerals.  I have no doubt that we have plenty of minerals and that before long a general development will be on foot which will provide employment for our people and industries in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which we are discussing here is of fundamental national importance.  That is the root matter we are discussing&mdash;the development of such mineral resources as we possess.  As one of the oldest members in the House, I may say that I remember when, over 50 years ago, it was put forward as fundamental in national policy that the natural resources of this country should be developed in the interests of the Irish people.  A statement of mine, requoted, or mentioned, last night, was that at one stage I expressed disappointment that some of the hopes that were held some 40 years ago had not apparently been realised, that we did not in fact seem to have the mineral resources in the country that at that time we had been led to expect.  We wanted to find out, however, and it was for that reason that we, in 1941, established a company which was to try to find out as exactly as possible what our mineral resources were and to exploit these in the national interest in the best possible way.</P>
      <P>I had at one time the idea, for instance, that in the County of Leitrim there were in close proximity quantities of coal and iron.  Investigation proved that the quantities were relatively small and the hopes that I and others like me had that that area, which is not rich in some of the resources that other counties have, might be developed as an industrial area, were not realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, it was only by exploration and thorough examination that we could know exactly what the mineral resources are and we set up the company to investigate the possibilities. One of the places where the investigation <Col N="234" /> went on particularly was the Avoca area.  There, as a result of State money, made available to the extent of something like £500,000, it was proved that there was material which, under modern conditions, modern methods of working, could be exploited, could be mined, smelted and made commercially profitable at the existing prices.  Immediately that that was determined the risks which otherwise would have to be taken by companies coming in were considerably reduced and the only risks that had to be faced were those that would occur in practically any mining operation of the kind.</P>
    <P>The question then naturally arose: How we were to exploit those resources which, on account of the tunnelling and the drilling, etc., that had taken place, we now knew to exist and knew the under limit of the amount that was available?  I think there is nobody in this House who would not agree that if our minerals, our country's natural resources, can be exploited by Irish labour, Irish skill, Irish work, and Irish capital, it is in the national interest that it should be so done.  I do not think anybody here will disagree with that statement. Therefore, we have, so to speak, to satisfy ourselves, if we depart from that ideal of exploiting our natural resources with our own capital, our own skill and our own labour, that we justify every step we take in departing from it.</P>
    <P>The opposite ideal would be to alienate these natural resources, hand them over to some other people, some other nation, some other companies, to outsiders, to develop.  That is the very opposite to the first ideal and it is quite clear that to do that means to a certain extent giving away that which is ours and making the least possible use of it.  We do not want to put ourselves&mdash;no nation would want to put itself&mdash;in pawn in that particular way.</P>
    <P>Undeveloped areas in the world have been developed by outside capital and by outside companies and we know what has happened in the case of some of these countries.  They have had to have revolutionary action; they have had to face the risk of economic and <Col N="235" /> other wars in these countries to get rid of the outside interests and the outside influences which are established by methods of that sort.</P>
    <P>Hence, I say&mdash;again I think I would get general agreement here&mdash;that to hand over the minerals of our country to be exploited completely by an outside body is something which we should only contemplate when any intermediate arrangements between the first ideal that I have suggested and the latter have been thoroughly examined and found to fail.</P>
    <P>Our resources are limited.  The quantity even of copper in Avoca is limited and, in the development of it, certainly, if an Irish company were developing it, we would like in the national interest to try to secure that it was not a question of a feast and a famine, that it was not a question of having large employment for one year and then idleness afterwards. Obviously, in working our minerals in that way we ought to try, from a social point of view, to provide employment, over a reasonably long period.  There must of course be a balance.  If there is need, as there is here at the present time&mdash;urgent need of employment, in order to keep our people at home, we will have to sacrifice some of our long term ideas for that but I think most people in the House again will agree with me, because I think there is a great deal of common ground in this House in regard to matters of this sort, or there should be and I am sure there is, that it would be better, for instance, to have a prospect of 250 people employed in an enterprise over, say, 20 years than to have 500 employed for half that period or a shorter period. We have examples of that where we have had capital development, such as, for instance, the development of our water power.  For instance, at Ballyshannon and neighbourhood, there was considerable development.  Large numbers of people were brought there. There was a great deal of employment there for a short time but then there was immediately the problem of what was going to happen those workers when the work was completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> We ought to approach a problem of this sort from the widest possible point of view, from the social point of view and generally from the national point of view.  It is not a question of one side against another.  Each one of us in this House is a trustee, and should regard himself as such, of the national interest.  It is true that the Government of the day have to do a great deal of the preliminary work, the negotiations and so on, but, ultimately, when they have done that and the proposition is completed and the decision has to be made, it is this House that has to be responsible for the decision and, before this House can take a decision on matters of this sort, every member should be in a position to satisfy himself on this particular point: are we keeping as near as possible to the ideal that the utmost effort should be made to get this thing done by Irish capital and by Irish skill and by Irish labour, or have we gone unnecessarily away from that ideal?  That is the only question at issue.  If we were in government we would have had to do the negotiating and we would have to consider what steps we might take.  I have not considered exactly what particular steps would be taken, but I certainly think that if our Government had anything to do with it we should in the first instance&mdash;and I for one would have to say this to myself&mdash;see that the utmost effort was made by those responsible for the negotiations to bring about a position in which as much of the work as possible should be done in Irish interests, by Irish capital, by Irish skill and so on.</P>
    <P>Now that being the case, we, in respect of this Bill, took occasion to put down the amendment so that we might get the details or some of them, indicating the reasons why this particular line was taken.  This work, mining of this sort, is a specialised operation.  We have no mines of any magnitude developed in this country and we are at a very early stage now I myself have not examined the field and I am not able of my own knowledge to say, but it is possible&mdash;and if the Minister said so I am inclined to accept his statement on the matter &mdash;that an effort was made to see if there were any Irish experts who <Col N="237" /> could advise on this matter.  We should, at first, have tried if there were people of our own blood who would be capable of giving us at least advice and I think undoubtedly there are. There was in America a mine developed by the brothers Ryan.  I was down that mine in Butte, Montana, and at Anaconda where the smelting was done.  Some of our people interested in this particular matter, in copper mining, should have been brought into the country and into consultation with regard to the development of Avoca.  We may take it for granted, and I think we will all agree on this, that no foreigners will come in to operate in this country unless they expect to make money out of it, no foreign people will come in here to operate just for love of us.</P>
    <P>They will come in here satisfied that the project is one out of which they will make substantial financial profits. If they expect to make substantial financial profits that means the enterprise is one that, in its nature, if properly worked, can be made profitable. I have said that, of course, we may not have the skill here and that we might not be able to work it in the same profitable way as a foreign expert company could do it, but at any rate we have the sort of fundamental assurance that there is a profitable enterprise here when foreigners are prepared to come in and exploit it. We should then agree in the first instance to try and find out if there are people of our race abroad if not at home who would have some interest in our country in addition to a financial one.</P>
    <P>Back in 1920 I met in America quite a large number of our people, people interested in and chief executives of all sorts of enterprises&mdash;coal mining, copper mining, large steel production enterprises and so on in America but even these people, while they have a sentimental interest in this country, would not be prepared to invest capital here unless they were able to find it profitable.  But there is this to be said about them, that they would have something more than a purely financial interest in this country.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I think we could get <Col N="238" /> advice on these matters from people of that particular sort.  Of course it is possible that the Government and the Ministry have tried to get that information and advice and have tried to interest these people in the matter. The first point is: Can we get the skill?  The next is that we want skill, engineering skill and to a certain extent we want those who have knowledge of the markets since we want to be able to exploit them commercially. Next we want money, capital.  Can we not get capital?  If the enterprise is sound, if it is clear that the conduct of the enterprise is in capable hands is it not possible to get Irish capital? I do not know.  It is possible that capital is shy, that our people who would be expected to put money into Irish enterprise might be slow in coming forward.  We, in Fianna Fáil, while like members of other Parties we believe in private enterprise, would, I think, prefer if we had the choice to have a semi-State company here to do the work rather than a purely foreign company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get his exact words but the Minister can read them himself.  The point is that while, if we had a choice between the two&mdash;to develop by private enterprise or by State enterprise&mdash;we would prefer private enterprise but in the case of some projects that it was not the most suitable. The question is, however, if something is unsuitable should you turn to something less suitable?  In view of statements made I should like to say that I am not against the development or the utilisation of foreign experts or even foreign capital provided I am satisfied that we are not <Col N="239" /> paying too much for their whistle.  The point is are we keeping as near to the real ideal as possible, to the old Sinn Féin ideal?  It is for the Minister to show that he is and that he has not departed more than was absolutely necessary from that ideal.  It is true that Deputy Lemass did say that in his opinion exploitation of resources of this sort by State enterprise is not the best and I absolutely agree with him. But he did not say anywhere, nor would I agree he suggested anywhere, that if you had a choice between the exploitation by a State company here, everything else being equal, and a foreign what shall I call it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not be sidetracked by the Minister who will have a chance of replying later.  I am saying that any Government of which I was the head, if it came down to brass tacks and if it had to choose between the two, assuming that everything else was equal, would choose the home State company rather than the foreign combine.  I would choose the other, of course, if there were cases where it was proved that the foreign combine was able to do things that would satisfy the national interest better: that is all.  It is a question of detailed examination to see what ultimately best serves our national interest.  The question is this: Have we exhausted or did the Minister, before he took these final steps, exhaust all the possibilities that are there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say again that I believe that if the necessary inducements were there we could possibly get Irish capital.  I am not saying any of these things of a certainty.  I do not know.  I, for one, as one of the trustees in the national interest here&mdash;we are now content to <Col N="240" /> alienate this national property&mdash;would like to see that the alternatives had been fully examined.  That is all that is really at issue.</P>
    <P>Attempts by anybody on any side to make Party capital of this matter is quite beside the point.  There is a by-election on.  I suppose we will have people who will try to misrepresent every attempt that is made in this House to try and examine things in an objective way and on a proper basis.  Such attempts will be misrepresented. I saw in the papers that we were opposed to the development of the Avoca mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks can be taken impartially as covering anybody who makes use of this House purely for Party propaganda purposes.  We are discussing a matter of fundamental national importance.  It is a question of how we may develop whatever resources we may have.  Remember, there might even be a consideration why, in the long run, one should keep some of our mineral resources&mdash;I do not say these ones&mdash;in reserve to meet <Col N="241" /> occasions such as we have had to meet in the last war, when alternative supplies from outside could not be got.  I do not know to what extent considerations of that sort should be taken into account in dealing with the present matter but it is a matter in general that should be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the whole fundamental question, our attitude is simply that we regard it as the taking of an important step.  We only want to see that everything that it is possible to do to serve the national interest will be done.  We are not opposing anything. All we are doing is endeavouring to satisfy ourselves that the propositions that have been put before us are the best in the national interest.</P>
      <P>Later on, we will probably have an occasion for dealing with this particular project.  Am I right in my assumption that we will have an opportunity of dealing specifically with the Avoca proposition?  Will the House have an opportunity of dealing with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really the question.  I can see why it would be very difficult to have that.  You cannot get to a certain point sometimes without having to enter into irrevocable commitments.  That is a very good reason, then, why we should try to have all the details of this project <Col N="242" /> which is the first and may be regarded, perhaps, as a precedent.  The whole of this is closely associated with another question and that is the use of foreign capital in the industries of our country. Again, I think the same considerations should apply.  We ought, before doing that, be satisfied that the home capital is not available and that the home skill is not available.  If foreign capital comes here, the conditions under which it comes here ought to be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to get foreign skill. We are anxious to get the enterprise which has been shown abroad, and the experience, into this country.  However, in most of these cases the position would be very different from the position, for instance, of the Huguenots and others who came to this country. There you had people coming to this country with skill and settling here and becoming part of the nation.  In the other case, what happens is this. Take Avoca as an example.  What will happen is that you will have this skill brought in.  Our people will be employed for a certain period.  Once the national asset is exhausted, those people go away.  Therefore, whilst we should be anxious, we should remember that it is not quite the case of getting people who bring in traditional skills and live in the country and afterwards become part of the nation and are of continuing value.  Neither is it such a thing as happened when the Shannon scheme was introduced.  There, you simply had the initial development of something which was going to continue. The water would continue to flow when the original engineers and the others had departed.  However, it will not be like that in the case of mines.  When the deposit is exhausted, that is the end of the enterprise.  So much, then, for the fundamental question in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the immediate Bill.  I think the Minister will not deny that what brought the Bill to a head and before the House was the need to make concessions in regard to this Canadian company.  Naturally, it is expressed in wider terms.  It does not refer to any particular company.  The question arises: Are the concessions <Col N="243" /> that are there the ones which are best in our interests and, at the same time, such as to induce either Irish capital or capital from abroad to be interested?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made certain criticisms of the Bill in his speech and I hope that his remarks will be considered carefully by the Minister for Finance.  Two points arise: First, why should bedded minerals be excluded, seeing that coal in particular is one deposit which we should be most anxious to develop?  I have not found out how long it is expected that our bogs will last when the peak or target of production set at present will be reached, but in a few years when that target is reached, how long will our present bog deposits last?  Again, the answer is very different from what we heard some 40 or 50 years ago when we were told they could be operated for some hundreds of years at a stage of production sufficient to meet our needs and still not be exhausted.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the present position.  I think exhaustion will come perhaps, within a generation, or even in a shorter period.  Therefore, we should consider what native fuel we would have instead.  I do not know to what extent it is possible to use more modern methods in regard to our coal mines, so as to utilise these narrow seams.  I remember seeing where such narrow seams were used in other countries by being gasified, but at any rate it is obvious that capital for the exploitation of bedded minerals should be attracted just as much as in the exploitation of non-bedded minerals.</P>
    <P>That is point number one.  The other point is whether the method of allowing for what is the equivalent of depreciation&mdash;Deputy Lemass used a special word for it, in connection with the fact that, as you continue working, the available material is diminishing and at the end of the time, there is no asset for the company involved to exploit as the raw material on which it has been working is completely exhausted&mdash;is justified.  Some tax concession in accordance with the rate at which the material was used up was accorded in Canada, as Deputy Lemass <Col N="244" /> pointed to the Canadian method, and, at first sight, it would seem a better method than the method indicated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Our attitude is that this is the only occasion on which we can get a full discussion on this matter and we want all the facts in connection with it&mdash; what was done by the Minister to get other means of exploitation and why he was forced to adopt this particular method.  We want to have all that explained.  We also want to know as far as possible the terms on which the lease was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deering</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by speeches of yesterday and to-day, one would think we should not go ahead with this matter.  I think the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be complimented for taking this very desirable step and taking advantage of the fact that the mining experts from Canada are prepared to put down £200,000 for exploration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass gave his own reports, and, if these reports had been adopted, the mines would have been abandoned by now.  Everything is in favour of going ahead and there is no point in adopting a dog-in-the-manger policy. We do not know when the atom bomb will blast the whole thing away and we might as well have a go, while we are still over ground&mdash;even though the miners may have to go underground.  It is worth while developing Avoca, even if it is only for the employment content. I have just left a deputation which is trying to complete arrangements for a development of the harbour in Wicklow in connection with taking away ore for smelting.  They will also have to get facilities from the Minister for Lands to get rid of the chaff or tailings of these mines which will probably add to the value of the land down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> There is a good deal more to be found in the Avoca mines besides copper.  I believe there are quite a lot of byproducts that would probably solve some of the difficulties of the Minister for Agriculture in regard to potash and many other minerals.  Anybody who tries to put a spoke in the wheel, or put a damper on these developments, will come very badly out of this business. I think we should all give it the O.K. and, as I said before, the responsible Ministers are to be very much complimented.  It is very well worth while for its employment content.  We are all worried about unemployment and emigration and this may provide a solution for County Wicklow, and adjacent counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Wicklow we are naturally all very anxious about the development of Avoca and I might say that, as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, we are happy that the day has arrived when Avoca can be developed on a commercial basis because I am fully convinced that, were it not for the Fianna Fáil Party, we would not have reached this stage.</P>
      <P>I think it is very wrong for any members of the Government Parties to get up here and suggest that the Fianna Fáil Party is against the development of Avoca.  It has been suggested by members of all Parties on the Government side that Fianna Fáil is opposed to this development.  It is suggested we are sabotaging the development. That brings me back a few years because I remember in 1948 going to Avoca&mdash;not as a public representative &mdash;to a public meeting called as a result of a statement that had been made by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McGilligan, in the Dáil, when he was making his Budget statement.  He had said that the moneys included in the Estimates of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;a sum of £85,000&mdash; for development work would not be devoted to that purpose.  Following that statement, the people of Avoca became very anxious and called this protest meeting which was attended by members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and by upwards of 100 local residents and people actually employed in exploration work at Avoca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> If I remember rightly, it was suggested that a deputation should be sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce to put our case before the Minister, with a view to getting the Government to change its policy regarding Avoca.  I understand that deputation was formed and met the Minister for Industry and Commerce. All this happened within a couple of weeks.  The protest meeting was held within one week of the Budget statement and the deputation was sent, I think, the following week. The deputation was accompanied by a member of the Government at the time, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and I think, by a member of the Seanad, Senator Sweetman.  The net result was that the Government changed its mind.  They decided that they would proceed with the exploration work.  Unfortunately, it took them a long time to do so, because it was not until 1949 that that work was proceeded with on the same scale as had been intended by Deputy Lemass when he was preparing his Estimate for 1948.</P>

He made certain references to other industries, and one of them was the milling industry. Deputy McGilligan is the last man in this House who should stand up and talk about flour milling, because in that very area we had two flour milling industries which were closed down when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to see this developing into a dog-in-the-manger fight as to which side was responsible for the development of the Avoca mine.  All we want to know is when the mines are going to be put working and when men will begin the job and money will be spent on these minerals.  This is an important Bill. We are satisfied that there is not very much mineral wealth in this country, but what we have we should exploit to the utmost and find out, once and for all, the value of those minerals.  We ought to be glad of every opening up <Col N="248" /> and down the country.  I have been for 25 years listening to talk of what is in Wicklow.  First, we started with gold mines.  Some members did very important work with gold mines in Wicklow and they turned out to be white elephants.  I hope that the present mine will not turn out to be a white elephant.</P>
      <P>I come from a county where there was great poverty and distress, around the Kingscourt area in Meath, and in Cavan.  Fortunately for those two counties, a very important mineral wealth was found, gypsum, and it has transformed the whole picture of that countryside.  Men were reared for export for years and now they are getting good wages for work in their own area.  Let us hope that there will be a parallel to that in the exploitation of mineral wealth in Wicklow, and that Wicklow can be transformed like the Kingscourt area.  We ought all to be very glad if we will have people working peacefully and prosperously there.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time that foreign capital came in.  For the past 25 or 30 years, we have been trying to start industries of all types, and every one of us knows that for ten years at the start of the industrial life of this country, we were exploited to the utmost by Jews and Gentiles from the ends of the earth, whose names we could not pronounce.  They opened up tinpot factories of all types and got the swag. In some cases, they burned them out and in others, they cleared out with a good deal of Irish money.  I hope that we will not see the like of it happening in our life again.  Foreign capital, we see, is necessary because for 30 years we have been trying to get Irish capital to do this work and it has not come forward.  Now a Canadian company is prepared to explore this wealth.  What is wrong with that?  I am quite satisfied that it is above board.  If they were Jews from Palestine coming over, I could understand our being cautious about it, but the Canadians are as good a type of people as ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am, because it is all to the good of the whole lot of us, whether a Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government, to explore and develop what little resources we have. I hope that we will get away from the narrow and bitter spirit.  Deputy Lemass is an important ex-Minister of this House, a man of brains and abilities. If he had led off this discussion on a manly and honest kind of note and did not bring in all the cuts and twists he did yesterday, we might have had a very useful development in this debate over a few days, and it would be all to the good for Ireland.  I hope that in future the ex-Taoiseach and his Minister will behave in a better way and not be looking across the House as if they were looking at anti-Irish traitors, knaves and slaves.  They ought to realise that we are proud we were born in this country, and are as good as they are and as anxious to develop the natural resources of Ireland as they are.  Do not think all the nationalism stands on one side of the House.  I believe that the people in the Fianna Fáil Party are just as good as we are.  All this narrow, mean politics of the last 30 years killed a whole lot of things.  In cases like this, there should be no politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be grand to see the mineral wealth of Wicklow developed and hundreds and probably thousands of pounds paid in good wages, and our ships steaming across the water with the products of our own land.  But it would be twice as grand if the big men on both sides came together for ten or 20 years and gave us peace, progress and prosperity.  Forget all the dirty little bickerings of the last 30 years. These are things that we of the old Republican Army would love to see happen.  We want to see an end of this bickering and working at cross-purposes. <Col N="250" /> There is grand, great work to be done by big men on both sides, who can do that by burying their petty prides and jealousies and getting down to solid work.</P>
    <P>The nation is crying out for action, and action is needed to stem the tide of unemployment and emigration.  A change of government means very little in this country, unless we change our own minds and put first things first. We are glad here to have responsible people exploiting something.  The people are crying out for more from us.  In the name of heaven, let us remember that we came here trying to exploit the hills of Wicklow and other mineral development in our country, and we must not be at cross-purposes about it.  It is high time to get things going, instead of listening to the talk that we have had here for the past three or four years.  The people want to see work going on there to open up the minerals of Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Is it not a grand thing to have an inter-Party Government who are determined to develop to the utmost extent the mineral resources of our country? Look at what happened in Kingscourt which was one of the most poverty-stricken areas in Ireland.  Wicklow is fairly poverty-stricken and wants development and the resources there should be developed.  Fianna Fáil should try to help in connection with that development, instead of endeavouring to score political points by asking who opened this or who closed that.  We do not care two hoots.  We want to see men employed in the mines.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing about the minerals in County Wicklow for the past 30 years.  Let us see if they are there, and now that we have an enterprising company coming from Canada, why should we kill it before it starts operating?  That is what we are trying to do because we are too narrow and mean.  We almost killed the Shannon scheme in the same way&mdash;that scheme which has brought new life to the country.  The working of the E.S.B will transform the life of every one of us by eliminating drudgery.</P>

If they did that, we would not have to look for foreign capital, but they want greater security and they stay behind a tariff wall.  Let them come out from behind the tariff wall and invest their money in Irish undertakings and give the country a chance of developing its own resources.</P>
      <P>When they are not prepared to come forward, we must get capital somewhere else, and I am proud that a Canadian company can come in and exploit our resources, since our Irish industrialists will not.  I would not be ashamed of an English or an American company doing the same thing, because we want money to develop our resources and give wages to our people.  We ought to cut out this bickering, narrowness and smallness in Irish political life.  We are long enough at it.  Our young people are longing for the day when they can get work at home.  We ought to stem the tide of emigration.</P>

      <P>The amendment before the House simply states that the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to this Bill until such time as the terms of the contract between the Government and this Canadian company is made available for us to see what is in it.  Unless that contract is made available so that people can see what is in it and what it implies, we can only base our opinions on assumptions and calculations.  I subscribed many years ago to the idea that for the development of our mineral resources which would have a very heavy labour content, <Col N="252" /> it might be advisable to consider the employment of people for the winning of minerals from these mines of ours, and, having in mind the ups and downs of world prices in relation to these ores, that you would have, at first, a difficulty of some years working at huge losses and possibly other years working at very large profits.</P>
      <P>When I first gave this matter some thought and consideration, lead was somewhere about £10 per ton.  To-day, the price of lead is away above that. Taking lead as one of the items, it appeared at the time that, having regard to the then ruling wages, something between £50 and £60 would have to be spent to get a return of one ton, the equivalent of £40, which meant that we would have a loss and the loss would become bigger as you employed more people and produced more, but then there would possibly have been some way of subsidising the loss for the sake of giving employment, and, when world prices rose, you would have a means of repaying that, or building up a reserve.  However, that is a particular approach.</P>
      <P>Whatever the copper resources are in extent and amount, there is a final limit to what can be taken out and, at some time, depending upon the rate of development, we will entirely exhaust our resources in copper. Deputy de Valera, when speaking this afternoon, touched on this point.  It is quite reasonable to understand and agree with.  If we ourselves, not to speak of a foreign company, were to develop those mines and exhaust their resources in a matter of five to seven years, we would leave ourselves, after that period, entirely dependent on outside sources for our own copper requirements.</P>
      <P>One has only to throw one's mind back to the last war to remember the difficulties that existed in this country in securing a sufficiency of copper for our own domestic requirements. Obviously, some of us feel that in that agreement some consideration should be given to the speed at which they are going to operate and the time limit, as far as the exhaustion of those resources is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass yesterday drew his conclusions from the financial calculations <Col N="253" /> apparently announced in the prospectus of that company when they were seeking the capital to work this concession.  As far as one can understand those figures&mdash;I think the House must agree with the conclusions drawn by Deputy Lemass&mdash;it would appear that these people are going to exploit those resources at the quickest possible speed and they will operate them on the basis of amortising their capital, not in a period of 20 years, but in a period of four to five years.</P>
    <P>Is the Government able to say that, so far as that aspect is concerned, adequate safeguards have been included in the agreement?  If they are prepared to say that, why not show the agreement?  Is it not obvious that, in an agreement of this kind, the more secrecy there is, the more suspicion will arise and it will be no use in time to come to say: &ldquo;We told you so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles, in his consideration of this aspect, has apparently certain objections to certain individuals doing this work, but he has less objection to others.  I think he almost went as far as saying that he would be willing to welcome the British back to do this work.</P>

      <P>What security is there for the nation that our resources will not just be exploited for sale at the present high price of copper in order to cash in quickly on the market?  When Fianna Fáil was first starting the industrial development of this country, we used hear talk from this side of the House that we were merely inducing fly-by-nights to come into the country. If what is suspected as being the method of operation here is, in fact, the method of operation with regard to the financial investment and the profits envisaged, surely this venture can be described as something which, as far as this nation is concerned, is a fly-by-night adventure.  That is one serious <Col N="254" /> aspect of this matter.  If the agreement has no provision to protect the country we may easily find ourselves in a short period of time with disappointed people who will lose their employment and a disappointed nation which will be dependent upon, as I said before, whatever price is demanded for shipment to us of this essential commodity.</P>
      <P>We all want to see our mineral resources developed, first of all, in order to give employment and, secondly, in order to save the expenditure of money on bringing in from abroad what we can produce here ourselves, thereby narrowing our adverse trade balance.  These operations are desirable and essential but they must be related to the general welfare and safety of the nation as a whole, not for a period of just a few years, but over a long period of years.  I do not know why this agreement should not be laid upon the Table of the House. What other clauses are in it that it should be withheld?  If this country enters into an agreement with another country, then that agreement is adopted by this House.  Here we have a Department of State entering into a contract, or giving a concession on the basis of a contract, to persons outside this country.</P>
      <P>Now, I am not so worried about the tax concessions.  I think the time has come, indeed I think the time has passed, when Governments should consider tax concessions to people engaged in industry, particularly in an industry such as this.  As Deputy de Valera said, why not extend these concessions also to those who are taking steps to develop our coal resources?  I do not know how the Minister can controvert the conclusions drawn by Deputy Lemass on the financial aspect of the prospectus of this Canadian company. Remember, the project must be a very attractive one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw in a paper a reference to the fact that these people sought money to the extent of their estimated requirements on the basis of their agreement and it appeared such an attractive proposition that their financial requirements were over-subscribed.  From a business point of view it must, therefore, <Col N="255" /> be a very attractive proposition. What more attractive proposition could there be than that people should be able to say: &ldquo;We estimate there such and such a tonnage of ore, containing this and this percentage of copper; if we operate at this and this speed, not only will we finish the job in four or five years but you will get back both your invested capital and something like three or four times the amount you originally invested?&rdquo;  That is the approach one must make to this on the basis of examination from the other point of view.  Consequently, I join unhesitatingly with those who framed this amendment.  I support the amendment <i>in toto.</i>  Unless the Minister is prepared to put this document in full before the House we have no right whatsoever to assent in the dark to an agreement which, in time, may show itself to be more dangerous to the nation than our making no effort of any kind to work these mines at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because I feel that it will have the effect, first of all, of focussing attention on the fact that we have some minerals in this country.  Possibly this development will, at a later stage, lead to further development in other parts of the country, a development that is very, very sorely needed indeed.  That is borne out by the fact that there are so many people flying from the land. One of the reasons for that migration is that we have not enough mineral development in this country.  I agree we may not have minerals in abundance, but at the same time I doubt very much if successive Governments have done all they could have done to find out exactly what we have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be appreciated that a considerable amount of money is involved in any such development.  There is also, as the Minister pointed out, a good deal of risk involved.  A hard-headed businessman, who intends to sink a few hundred thousand pounds in something under the earth, naturally worries about his prospects of success; our people in particular seem to be very worried about investing money in such ventures.  I believe that is one of the <Col N="256" /> reasons why the present Minister for Finance and the present Government, reluctantly no doubt, were forced to go to the four corners of the earth seeking people prepared to come in here and invest their money in our mineral deposits.  There are many wealthy people in the country; we can see that when national loans are floated.  They are subscribed to very satisfactorily; and that is commendable.  But national loans are, after all, gilt-edge securities. When it comes to taking a risk, our people are very, very shy; they are afraid to take a risk in their own country.  The odd thing is that they are not a bit hesitant in sending their money across the water to have it invested there.</P>
    <P>We, in turn, are obliged to enlist the aid of the foreigner in order to encourage development in this country.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that and I have no doubt that the present Minister, like his predecessor, Deputy Lemass, will take all the precautions necessary to ensure, as far as lies within his power, that no undesirables will come in here.  From that point of view, I think there is nothing wrong in allowing these Canadians to come in here.  Nobody will ever convince me that we are all saints in this country and those who live elsewhere are all crooks.  There are good and bad in every country in the world.  It has been suggested that because these people are Canadians we should not welcome them here.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Avoca mines down in Wicklow do not directly concern me. But I do not grudge development in that part of the country, a development from which the people in the area may benefit.  It has been suggested by Deputy Lemass that at some stage these prospective promoters may pull out suddenly and disappear, having employed 400 or 500 people, and that that may create a certain problem for some future Government.  As I have already pointed out, there is always a certain amount of risk involved in a venture of this kind, but we should be prepared to take that risk.  If our own people are not prepared to take it and others come along who are prepared to take it we should welcome them and wish <Col N="257" /> them well, giving them whatever assistance we can.  The fact that 400 or 500 people would be unemployed in that area if the resources of that mine became exhausted would not be a problem of the type that any Government could not surmount.  We have often had that type of upheaval in other industries and I am sure, if such a situation arises at a later date, although I sincerely hope it does not, that the Government of the day will be able to cope with it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if we discover as a result of our experiment on this occasion in having this Canadian company develop the mines, that there is something wrong with the agreement&mdash;that is what this House is for, to put these things right&mdash;the Ministers can come in at a later date with some amending legislation to deal with any irregularities that arise. It does seem strange to me on the subject of developing the mines that the first thing we should start worrying about is that we should exhaust the resources right away.  It is foolish to start discussing that at this stage before we find out what is the extent of the resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because it is an attempt on the part of the present Government to have employment provided for our own people in our own land and I only hope that that type of venture will be spread to different parts of the country and particularly to the congested areas.  When people say that we have not very large mineral resources in this country&mdash;and I hold that view myself&mdash;in the main I think we can say we have done much to find out exactly what we have.</P>
    <P>We are not under native Government for such a long time, but nevertheless I think the present Government should tackle the problem of having further surveys and further experimental work carried out in various parts of the country, particularly in Connaught and in my own County of Mayo, where you have a considerable area of poor quality land and the most emigration.  I would ask the present Minister, therefore, to direct his attention to the neglected areas of the West and, if possible, to <Col N="258" /> have further surveys carried out there to see what we have in the way of minerals in the Ox Mountains and other mountains there.  If we do that we will be doing a good day's work.  Even if we must go to faraway places to get these experts and to get people with money to do the work, we should not be afraid to do it and we should not stand up in this House to blame any Minister who is doing his best to further such projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole purpose of this amendment is a very simple one. It is to secure publication of the agreement which has been made for the exploitation of the Avoca deposits.  It seems to me that that is just ordinary common sense.  There is no question of denying to the Government or anyone else whatever credit may attach to the fact that, after 15 years of exploration work and investment of £500,000 in this mine, we have proven that there are deposits which are commercially workable.</P>
      <P>I have said that the purpose of the amendment is to secure publication of the agreement.  I think the Irish people are entitled to that and the members of this House are entitled to it.  There would have been much less confusion running through this debate, many fewer unfounded statements made, if the document had been tabled for both Houses of the Oireachtas and were available for consultation in the Library and for reference purposes here during the course of this debate.  We would not have heard, for instance, Deputy Giles talking about these people being brought in to explore the body of ore which exists in Avoca.  That exploration was begun very many years ago and it was financed largely by the Fianna Fáil Government as it existed from 1941 until 1954.  The development was continuous in face of very great difficulties, difficulties in securing plant, difficulties in de-watering the old deposits, difficulties above all in securing the requisite technical personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work which we were doing and the efforts we were making did not meet with universal approbation in this House and when there was a change of Government in 1948, as you <Col N="259" /> have heard, one of the first things done was to suspend the operations which were then in progress in Avoca.  I will not say that that was done in any malevolent way.  Naturally, a mining venture is a highly speculative venture and if the Minister for Finance of the time wanted to take stock of the situation and see what was involved, I think that, as Minister for Finance, he was entitled to do that.  But nobody is entitled to come here and denigrate the Party and the Government which were responsible for initiating this project, which resumed operations after they had been interrupted and pressed them through until their judgment had been vindicated and there was a proposition which could be offered to mining experts anywhere in the world with the certitude that it would be accepted.</P>
    <P>What we are really concerned about now, at least those of us on this side of the House who have been associated in any way with this project, is that, having, as I have said, put 15 years' hard work into the project in the face of great discouragement, having invested over £500,000 in it when the exploitation of the mine&mdash;as distinct from the exploration&mdash;is about to begin, the Irish people will derive the greatest possible profit they can out of the investment which they have already made.  I think that is a simple matter of business.  When we ask, therefore, that we should see with our own eyes the details of the agreement which will regulate the future development of this mine, let nobody challenge us and say that we are opposed to this development.  We are not opposed to it.  If we have one regret, perhaps it is that the same opportunities as were made available to foreign mining companies were not made available to our own people and that our own people did not have an opportunity to invest their savings in this venture.  They might not have availed of it, but surely they were entitled to have a chance at it as well as the people in Canada or the United States.  That is all that is involved in this debate and some of the speeches I have listened to from the opposite side of the House were quite unreasonable.  The speech that <Col N="260" /> Deputy Giles made just now was not as unreasonable as that made by Deputy O'Leary to-day or by Deputy Desmond and the present Attorney-General yesterday.</P>
    <P>We are not approaching this Bill in any quibbling or crabbed way.  We are glad that the speculation which we made, that the operation which we initiated, has at long last, after the passage of a great number of years, and the expenditure of a great deal of public money, been fully justified. For that we are not going to claim too much credit.  If we had not succeeded we would have been blamed and we would have heard people talking about the extravagant capital programme of Fianna Fáil.  We would have been told that we had spent £500,000 as we were told, when we made an investment in the National Stud, that we had spent £250,000 unreasonably.  We should have had to bear the burden.  Thank goodness, our speculation has been justified and we will be very happy, when the mines are going, to know that it was this progressive and enterprising Party that initiated the whole matter.</P>

      <P>All my life I have advocated that something should be done in Avoca to provide employment for the people there and I never opposed Deputy Lemass or Fianna Fáil in any efforts they may have made to provide that employment.  I am glad that after all these years our work is going to be justified despite the fact that Deputy Lemass and his organisation put out a letter under the name of Deputy Brennan immediately after a speech I made at the Chamber of Commerce knowing that my lips were tied and that I could not reply to it.  Deputy Lemass knew that there was no lease for the mines and Deputy Lemass had no scheme to prepare any such lease.  We could not <Col N="261" /> develop these mines if there was no lease but, while we were negotiating with the landlord for the lease, we got pumps from America so that when the men, in their operations, came along to the level of the river they would not be compelled to leave the shaft empty and go to sink another shaft.</P>
      <P>We provided these pumps while we were negotiating with the landlord to get the lease so that we would have some rights to the place in which we were spending the money of the Irish people.  If we had had no lease do you think the Canadians would have signed that agreement?</P>
      <P>I do not dispute Deputy Lemass's statement that this Company was over-subscribed in Canada.  A party of journalists was over here and I informed them of the development that could take place in this country if we had the money.  I have since had a letter from one of them boosting up Avoca and pointing out that there is plenty of money in Canada to develop the mines of Ireland.  I think the Opposition should congratulate us on our enterprise and that they should try to make a success of the job and help us to prove to other people that they can invest money in the mines of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass at one time was very much in favour of private enterprise, as he is reported in column 112 of the 1947 Debates.  Here is a private enterprise and why is there objection to it? Deputy Lemass himself did everything he could to try and get Irish people to invest their money in the development of certain industries and what success did he have?  I have heard statements made here to-day about people going to America.  When Deputy Lemass went there I was delighted and I hoped that he would succeed in arousing interest and enthusiasm for this country in America.  I must say it is a very small thing to try to take advantage of any Minister when he is doing his best in the interests of his country. No matter what Deputy Brennan may say the people of County Wicklow and of Avoca will realise that the Opposition have endeavoured to prevent 500 men from being employed in Avoca.</P>

We have heard enough about who started it and who is and who is not responsible.  As I said, I do not condemn Deputy Lemass or the Opposition, who were then the Government.  Money was provided to try to create employment in the development work.  I am glad that, as a result of the expenditure of that money, employment can be provided. I hope that not alone will Avoca be a success but that there will be many other ventures in other parts of the country.  My sincere wish is that the people who invest their money in this way will get some return and that that will encourage others to engage in this work so that so many men will not be forced to cross to other countries to work for the very foreigner that people object to coming in here with his money.  It is better that our people should work in their own country than that they should go to other countries and work for foreigners.  I welcome the Bill.  I regret that the Opposition have put down an amendment to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House.  This matter has been discussed at length.  This Bill tends to attract foreigners to this country with a view to developing our mineral resources.  I am particularly interested in this measure because I come from a constituency which has more mineral resources than possibly any other in this country.  When we <Col N="263" /> were governed by foreigners, mass employment was given in the development of those mineral resources.  In my immediate neighbourhood hundreds of people were employed up to the outbreak of the first World War in the production of barytes, copper and so on.  Unfortunately, since native Government took over the affairs of this country, no such employment has been given, despite the many appeals of the people and their representatives to successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The consensus of opinion is that out of our own resources we cannot undertake that work.  It is said, and possibly with some reason, that we are incapable of undertaking that work.  Let us face up to the facts.  We have these resources.  We are not able to develop them.  If we can get outside people, Canadians or others, to develop them for us and give us the technical advice and employ Irish people, we should welcome them.  I would very much like to welcome them in West Cork.  I hope this measure is a national one and is not confined to Avoca.  While there are, undoubtedly, mineral resources in County Wicklow, there are also mineral resources in other parts of the State and it is the duty of every member of the House to do his best to attract people to this country in order to give employment in developing its resources.</P>
      <P>It is very narrow-minded on the part of Fianna Fáil to oppose a measure which they know cannot but do good for the people.  What harm can come from this measure?  Fianna Fáil were in office for 20 years.  They never did anything about developing these mines.</P>

      <P>During my lifetime, I have not seen any man employed in the mines in West Cork. I have gone into this question fully with a number of people, particularly the elderly people, who formerly worked in these mines and earned what where then regarded as very reasonable incomes.  The position is that we have failed to develop these resources.  We must face up to that fact.  I welcome the initiative of the <Col N="264" /> present Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, in trying to interest foreigners in the development of our mineral resources.  I feel sure that every impartial member of the House and every broad-minded Irishman and every man who has the country's interest at heart welcome Deputy Norton's visit to America with a view to getting Irish people there interested in affairs at home and with a view to getting their help, financial and otherwise, for these projects.</P>
      <P>I do hope that when these concessions are granted this Bill will be implemented on a national basis and that the Government and every future Government, conscious of their responsibility to the Irish people, will have surveys made of all those areas that for the past 30 years have been listed for survey and about which nothing has so far been done.</P>
      <P>With the present world prices of minerals that we have in such abundant measure here, nothing but good can come from this measure.  I believe it will help the national economy and will help to create employment for people who formerly had to go over to John Bull to earn a livelihood.  I wish the Minister every success with this measure which, I believe, will have national advantages.</P>

      <P>This debate, which has extended over yesterday and to-day, has roamed not merely far away from the Bill but even far away from the amendment.  The matters that were discussed were not all by any means relevant to mining or mining enterprises, but I propose in my reply largely to confine myself to remarks that were made in regard to mining and mining enterprises rather than to enter any wider sphere.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, in opening the debate, turned, in the first instance, to the Bill itself.  In respect of the Bill he made two comments, two criticisms. In the first place, he suggested that it was entirely wrong in any way to draw a distinction between bedded and non-bedded minerals.  He suggested that there was equal risk, equal difficulty in the mining of bedded minerals to the risk in the mining of non-bedded ore deposits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass was there for 19 years and, during the whole of that period, did he ever do anything to provide incentives, by way of tax concessions or otherwise, for bedded deposits?  He could make the case, and I freely give him this point, that in respect of non-bedded deposits he was, perhaps, waiting for the results of the Mianraí exploration to go a certain distance before he considered the non-bedded question.  But he, and Deputy MacEntee, as his Minister for Finance, during a long part of their period of office were perfectly capable, with all the information that is available to them to-day, to deal with bedded deposits if they were so minded, and for Deputy Lemass to come in now and suggest that there was a crying need for legislation of this kind in regard to bedded deposits is to show nothing but what I might rather crudely describe as sour grapes.</P>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the Fianna Fáil Party were not prepared to consider this type of incentive for the mining of bedded or non-bedded ores.  Deputy Lemass has tried to pretend that there was no distinction between the bedded and the non-bedded deposits and the difficulties involved in their mining.  The position is perfectly clear.  We had some discussions yesterday, for example, about the cost involved in the erection of the concentrator&mdash;a very substantial cost with which I shall deal later.  In regard to coal there is no such cost; when coal is mined it has not got to be treated in the same way as non-bedded ores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that in relation to <Col N="266" /> bedded deposits there is an entirely different method of manufacturing required once you get down under the ground.  In regard to the bedded minerals you have not got to invest the same type of very heavy capital that is necessary for the non-bedded ores.  The Deputy told me yesterday that I was talking from a text book when I suggested there was a fair case in respect of the different breaks in the veins of non-bedded deposits.  Frankly, I would prefer to accept the views of the geological experts on that and the geological advice that I have obtained is quite clear and quite categorical on the distinction between bedded and non-bedded ores.  The same expenditure is not involved at all in the mining of the bedded ores as is necessary for the non-bedded minerals.</P>
      <P>I am not a geologist and neither is the Deputy but what I have given is the best expert opinion that can be obtained in this country and I prefer to accept that rather than the <i>ex-parte</i> statement of Deputy Lemass yesterday that I was wrong when I suggested bedded deposits did not peter out in the same way as non-bedded minerals. The facts in relation to our bedded deposits are simple: they do not require the same capital expenditure and particularly do not involve the erection of the same early plant as the deposits for which this Bill caters. In addition, there is nothing known to-day in respect of our bedded deposits that was not known during the period in which Deputy Lemass was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  Our coal deposits have never been properly exploited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I said there is nothing known to-day that was not known when Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee were on this side of the House and when they had the opportunity of dealing with the matter in this way if they were so minded.  It is nonsensical for Deputy Lemass to say that he is now minded to do something which he was not minded to do during his period of office.  Deputy Lemass suggested in relation to the proposals <Col N="267" /> in this Bill for the measure of tax concessions that a more appropriate method would be to accept the Canadian system.  I do not know whether the report I have seen of the Deputy's speech yesterday contains an inaccuracy or not but he is reported as saying that the Canadian people were estimating on the basis of 30,000,000 tons.</P>

      <P>I take it that is a misprint, but without any question, taking either figure, the amounts that the company which has taken the lease of Avoca would have to pay would be substantially less than Deputy Lemass's proposal.  He is at the one moment suggesting that we should not give this lease to the Canadian interests and at the same time suggesting that we should give tax concessions that would be more favourable to them than the proposals included in this Bill.  The Deputy can take it as certain that I have worked out the figures, not to-day or yesterday, but at the time that I was considering the proposals with the intention of producing this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy certainly did not do that.  He did the exact reverse of doing that.  As a tax measure in respect of non-bedded ores I feel that the thing that is necessary is to provide that we will get people interested in the very heavy initial capital expenditure that is necessary to deal with these minerals.  I think the best way of doing that and the clearest way of doing that is the way provided <Col N="268" /> in this Bill.  Deputy Lemass said yesterday that he did not approve of the method we have adopted here and that he would prefer the Canadian method, but he did not give the Canadian method accurately.  The Canadian method is not to give three free years but three and a half years free and in addition to three and a half years free to give in perpetuity an exemption of one-third from taxable profits.  That has not in any way got anything to do with depreciation of the assets.  It is a grant in perpetuity for mineral workings of a discriminatory rate of tax of two-thirds of the tax that would otherwise be chargeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  It is, in fact, a discriminatory rate of tax for mining enterprises by which they are taxed at only two-thirds of the rate payable by other industries and that rate is granted in perpetuity.  I do not think that is what we want here. I think what we want here is something that will induce people to examine the possibilities of such Irish mineral resources as there may be, not on a concession in perpetuity but on something that will urge them to go into this business.  That is why the Bill has expressed in the first instance that it must be within a period of three years from April 6th next and that the work must be started.  I want to ensure that there will be a method of getting the initial very heavy capital expenditure in the manner that is provided in this Bill. I have not any doubt whatever that the method that is provided here is a better method for our circumstances than the Canadian method to which Deputy Lemass referred yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the only two criticisms of the Bill itself that were made by any Deputy in the House during the course of this debate.  The rest of the debate centred on the amendment that <Col N="269" /> was put down in the name of Deputy Lemass.  I must confess I was rather amused to find the Fianna Fáil Front Bench contradicting itself so often in the course of the last couple of days. Deputy Lemass opened the debate and said that he did not think Mianraí Teoranta should do this work.  Deputy Aiken dithered as to whether they should or not.  Deputy Derrig came along and said Mianraí Teoranta should do the work.  Deputy Childers came along to-day and went as near as he dared to suggesting that this was a good Bill and that the amendment was a bad one.  Deputy de Valera, after many platitudes, suggested that the amendment was for the sole purpose of seeking information as to what had happened.  Deputy MacEntee came along and became even more <i>pianissimo</i>&mdash;in fact so <i>pianissimo</i> that those of us who know Deputy MacEntee in this House were rather at a loss to recognise the Deputy MacEntee we knew.</P>
    <P>The members of the Opposition to-day have been trying to get themselves out of the jam into which they got themselves yesterday.  At any rate, it is a good thing that they realise where they were travelling yesterday. I gave yesterday to this House all the details that were in any way relevant, as far as I could see, to the discussion &mdash;or, to be more strictly accurate, to the amendment.</P>

Is the Deputy not capable of drafting an amendment to mean what he intends it to mean&mdash;or did he want to have it both ways and be able to say afterwards that the amendment said something else?</P>

Deputy de Valera himself&mdash;from what he said to-day&mdash;did not, I think, recollect <Col N="270" /> what they had done, what they had said, when they were in power and when they were in charge of these matters.  The position was laid down quite clearly in the Minerals Development Act, 1940, as to what should be done.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy's amendment says is &ldquo;... until it has received and approved....&rdquo;  It did not ask for the agreement to be tabled.  It asked for something entirely different.  The intention of Deputy Lemass, when he was starting off this debate yesterday, was not to take the line that was taken to-day&mdash; the line that merely the terms of the agreement were desirable.  There were plenty of other ways to get that.  The fact is perfectly clear, however, that the record of the statutes shows what was intended that the Government should do in relation to these commercial propositions.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday and I repeat&mdash;and, to be fair to Deputy de Valera, I think that in his speech to-day he acknowledged that it was so&mdash;that it would be quite impossible for any Government to carry on commercial negotiations if these negotiations had to be carried on in the full glare of publicity and that the appropriate thing to be done was what was provided in the Act&mdash;that a return should be made of the various leases made under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing whatever to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody had any doubt about that, in case there was any question of anybody wondering whether the return should be yet on the Table or not, I quite specifically and quite deliberately gave yesterday not merely the information <Col N="271" /> that was visualised in the preparation of that statutory return but, in addition, any other information I thought might be of the slightest use to any Deputy on either side of the House in considering this matter.</P>
      <P>People talk as if this lease that was made in respect of Avoca came out of the sky.  Everybody knew, particularly everybody in this House, that it was intended to make commercial arrangements in respect of Avoca and that Mianraí Teoranta were endeavouring to get commercial interest to come into this mining enterprise.  It was stated this time last year&mdash;I shall deal with the method used in a moment&mdash;but, in case there should be any doubt that there was any secrecy about the matter may I quote what the Tánaiste said on the 23rd March, 1955, as reported at column 516 of Volume 149 of the Official Report?  He was dealing with the Supplementary Estimate and, in the course of his remarks, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For some years past Mianraí Teoranta have been conducting a scheme of exploration on mineral deposits at Avoca, County Wicklow. The aim of the scheme was to establish the existence at Avoca of sufficient quantities of copper ore of a grade suitable for commercial development.  This aim has now been achieved and negotiations are at present going on with a number of mining concerns to see whether they will be interested in undertaking the development of the deposits. It is too soon to say, at this stage, whether satisfactory arrangements can be made for development by a commercial concern but preliminary proposals have been received from one company of international repute.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  I suggested to Deputy Lemass and the Opposition that, if they were in any way sincere in the suggestions they made in this House yesterday, that was the time when they should have made their view clear to the House. That was the time when a responsible <Col N="272" /> Opposition which did not merely wish to cause trouble and difficulties in regard to commercial exploration would have made it clear that they had a view.  That was the time when as an Opposition&mdash;as they would have been perfectly entitled to do&mdash;that view should have been put in public. That was the way in which&mdash;and I repeat the words in spite of the amusement of Deputy de Valera&mdash;a responsible Opposition would have approached the problem rather than in the irresponsible way in which they approached it, saying different things at different times yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said a few seconds ago, we heard here yesterday various comments from different members of the Opposition as to the manner in which this development should be carried through.  Deputy Lemass, fairly enough, stood up yesterday to his previous utterances.  In reply to a question by me, he answered that he did not approve of Mianraí Teoranta undertaking this work.  That is clearly not merely the view of Deputy Lemass but was the view of the Fianna Fáil Government, and it is on the record beyond any question again and again and, as I told the Leader of the Opposition when he was speaking earlier to-day, he cannot now at this stage take up the position that he did not understand what his responsible Minister was stating as the view of the Government in previous times.  I do not know whether Deputy Lemass would like me to quote statements he made in 1947&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy, particularly in the case of Deputy Lemass, was the real archangel of collective responsibility.  Does he now renege on his own Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce? I do not know whether Deputy Lemass wishes me to go back on those statements, or whether he will accept that those statements which he made in 1947 made it perfectly clear when he <Col N="273" /> was speaking as the representative of the then Government that when exploration work had gone to a certain stage Mianraí Teoranta should get out of the job and further development should be dealt with by private enterprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;or&rdquo;. If Deputy Lemass does not accept that he said this was his view, I will read the quotation.  I think he does accept that this was his view, and I think he will also remember that, in 1947, when there was a question of coming to this House for money for Mianraí Teoranta, he went to particular pains to explain how international enterprise was able to operate over a series of workings and had not got, so to speak, all its eggs in one basket, and that that was one of the reasons why it was impossible to visualise the commercial development of Avoca as a single entity.  If the Deputy wants the reference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Lemass wishes to make that point, I am perfectly prepared to meet it, but I want to know what is the view of the Opposition as a responsible Opposition, because I hear one view from Deputy Lemass, a different view from Deputy de Valera and a different view again from Deputy Derrig.  It is perfectly clear to me that they are all putting different views on the records of this House in regard to this matter, because they cannot agree among themselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass gave me many quotations yesterday of figures based entirely on present-day prices.  He mentioned, I think, the British Metal Corporation at one stage.  I have here more quotations which show that the people in the metal business themselves are not prepared to estimate what the price is likely to be for a period any distance ahead.  It is quite nonsensical, stupid and misleading to suggest that one can start to plan a commercial enterprise dealing with copper on the basis of present prices when it must be on the basis of long-term prices that the enterprise will show a profit or will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be higher; they may be very much lower. If Deputy Lemass was paying any attention to it at the time, copper took a big drop last autumn at one stage, because I think at that time people thought there was about to be more production.  The fact is that no matter where you go, you cannot get <Col N="275" /> anyone with any knowledge&mdash;I do not mean somebody who is merely prepared to chance his arm&mdash;to give a firm opinion of where copper prices are likely to be in a couple of years' time.  All the figures the Deputy quoted yesterday were based on the present prices of copper.  If I may just take one, the <i>Metal Bulletin</i> of the 7th of this month:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To take the obvious case to-day, is it not at least as reasonable to look on the current high price of copper as foreshadowing the indispensable part copper may play in the expanding world of to-morrow, as to regard it as a temporarily inflated level which will be corrected in due course by growing supply?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The two views put in contrast to each other are there and I am not prepared to say which of those views is the correct one.  What I am not prepared to say is that the enterprise is the cast-iron certainty that Deputy Lemass suggested when he was discussing the matter here yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about Toronto.  I do, however, know this: from the very day that it was made known that Mianraí Teoranta was anxious to seek out commercial people who would interest themselves in this venture, this was the only proposition that had any real national advantage, and I know that nobody, no group of Irish people, unfortunately, interested themselves in this enterprise in the slightest.  Neither, so far as I am aware, has any group of Irish people interested themselves since last September in any mineral deposit that was not being operated before that.  The plain fact of the matter is that this is not a type of business to which our people are accustomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee a few minutes ago &mdash;Deputy Lemass put me off the track when I was going to correct him&mdash; chided a Deputy for referring to exploration and said exploration was finished with.  If Deputy MacEntee <Col N="276" /> were here yesterday, he would have heard me refer to the fact that it is not finished and that this company is to spend £180,000 at least, and perhaps £450,000, of its own money on further exploration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take away from the value of their work.  Mianraí Teoranta has proved 13,000,000 tons, but any company that was going to induce the commercial interests concerned would have to do a good deal more exploration work before they could certainly bring it to commercial development.  That, I think, is an obvious and self-evident fact.</P>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the terms which I made clear yesterday and had been given some months ago by the Tánaiste to the newspapers and that were published in the December <i>Trade Journal,</i> if the Deputies opposite wished to look at them there, are clearly terms that in respect of this speculative and risky enterprise are to the national advantage. All of us are quite clear that if we could get Irish people to deal with industry here, it would be preferable to getting foreign capital to do it, but all of us on this side of the House are equally clear that if Irish people have not got into a particular Irish industry and will not show any interest in going into that industry it is preferable that we should get people with foreign capital and foreign know-how to come in and do that work rather than that the work should not be done.</P>

      <P>Everybody knew in <Col N="277" /> this country that these deposits were available for private commercial exploitation. Mianraí, in pursuance of a direction given, advertised in the trade journals appropriate for this type of work, the results of their probing exploration.  Mianraí, as agents of the Government, got from those advertisements various inquiries.  Some of those inquiries were from firms of international repute.  Some of them were from firms of repute merely in the country where they operate.  Unfortunately, no such inquiry at all came from any interest in this country. I think in any event that the reason for that fact, that we got no result or no answer or no interest here, is the extent of the capital that it was going to be necessary to risk in a highly speculative venture.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  The fact is that no interest was shown here.  The fact is that even if interest had been shown, the people concerned would have had to get some of the technical assistance from abroad.  They possibly felt that the real way to get the best out of that technical assistance was not that those people would be utilised, if I may say so, as hirelings, but that they would be the people putting their own risk capital into it, assisted, of course, if they wished, by flotations in any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming on to that now.  I want to stress, and must stress to this House, that there is still a large stage of exploration work to <Col N="278" /> be done, and that that exploration work is certainly going to cost £180,000 and may go up to cost up to £450,000.  It is only when that work is completed and concluded that we can then say with certainty that commercial development is going to be a proposition for anybody.  The effect of that is that you are going to need to expend on that perhaps up to £450,000, that, on the erection of the concentrator, it will cost £1,500,000, and the question of plant and so forth at the mines will cost another £750,000.  That is £2,250,000 that way, plus the additional £180,000 certain, in the first instance, perhaps £450,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>They are quite definitely the same figures.  The position is perfectly clear, and is, as I said yesterday, that they are bound to invest £180,000 on exploration work. The Tánaiste and I have satisfied ourselves beyond question&mdash;if the House wants to know, by bank certificate&mdash; that that money is available for the Irish company in the bank and, in addition, if it is necessary to go on with further exploration up to £450,000, again we have satisfied ourselves that that money will be there. And it is after that, and only after that exploration is completed, that the obligation comes to invest an additional £1,500,000 in the concentrator and £750,000 in the plant necessary to go with the mines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained that yesterday and thought that the Deputy <Col N="279" /> understood me.  What I said yesterday was quite clear.  The company are bound to spend £180,000 in further exploration work.  They may have to spend up to £450,000 in that work. When that exploration work is completed, then if the commercial development is warranted&mdash;and in respect of whether it is warranted or not there is a clause for independent arbitration&mdash; the erection of the concentrator and the installation of the plant operates. If commercial development is not warranted, then there is the right to surrender the lease.  I made that quite clear yesterday.</P>

      <P>That is exactly the point.  There are no mining concerns in Ireland and this is a job that needs the experience of a mining concern. The only alternatives available to this Government were to do what Deputy Lemass has agreed is not the right thing to do, namely, to get it done by State enterprise with all the risks and all the loss that would involve or do the sensible thing and advertise publicly and get the best offer that was available in the national interest and accept that offer.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might contain himself.  If what is wrong with the Deputy is that he is bursting with annoyance that he has not got some savings invested in this <Col N="282" /> concern and if he wants to invest in it I will ask the promoters, but he will have to take the risk.  The situation is quite clear.  There was no other alternative open to the Government except leave the minerals in the ground or get somebody who knew their business, who knew how to run a mine of this sort, who knew the risks, who knew how those risks could be overcome, who knew exactly the type of concentrator, who knew the type of boring that would be required, who had the reputation behind them which would enable them to get the funds necessary for this business and who would be able adequately to assess what the additional exploration required would be and who would be enabled in this way to get for us something that we could not get out of the ground ourselves.</P>
      <P>There was not any other possible alternative open to the Government. Under the terms of the lease which I disclosed yesterday the lessees pay us back, if it comes into commercial development, all the money that the State expended on the exploration&mdash; £542,000.  That is the amount assessed and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as being the correct figure.  Under this lease the company are bound to pay us royalties graded on profits.  Incidentally, I might add that we are rather lucky to get those royalties.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot get that to wash.  The plain fact of the matter is he knows that during his time there was a bad slip-up, a slip-up which was corrected during the previous inter-Party régime.  This company is bound, as I was saying, to pay royalties to us on a percentage of gross profit when it goes into commercial development.  On that basis I think that this is a proposition in which we &mdash;and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I say it in the sense of all the Irish people&mdash;will not have to put up any more money for further exploration, or take the risk of putting up money to build a concentrator, or pay £750,000 for additional plant, and so forth.  Here is a proposition from which we will be able to get a royalty, if everything goes well, and in which we do not lose if things go wrong.  I think this is a good bargain for the Irish people.  I think it is a bargain of which the Tánaiste has every reason to be proud.</P>
      <P>The debate widened from this slightly to the extent of a petty gibe by Deputy Aiken at the Tánaiste.

He did not merely want to see the details. Some of them had been published already.  The remainder I gave yesterday. He was anxious to muddy the water because he was disturbed and sorry that he was not over here to make as good a bargain in relation to the extraction of these minerals, the extraction of which will give good employment, if it is a commercial proposition, and will at the same time ensure that we will be able to get back the finished and refined product, should we require it, to the extent of 50 per cent. and will most certainly assist in easing our balance of payments problem.  But it will do something else, which I believe is equally important: it will set a headline and show that there may be some prospect in Irish minerals which will quicken and stir interest in these minerals, not merely here but elsewhere. If it does that it will be well worth while.</P>

      <P>There is not really very much to this. Sub-section (1) (b) of the section reads that the Minister shall appoint:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;six persons, each of whom is an optician and at least one of them is also a pharmaceutical chemist or dispensing chemist and druggist.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When I put down this amendment, the situation was somewhat different. There was only one register of opticians in this country, that is, ophthalmic opticians who existed as a body and were a sort of company more than anything else.  I put down this amendment for the purpose of including an optician.  My intention was to ensure that you would not have a board of 11 with six ophthalmic opticians, four medical men and one outside person, because I felt that would be giving overall powers to the ophthalmic opticians, as against the ordinary chemists or dispensing opticians.</P>
      <P>Since then, many things have happened. What I am asking in this amendment is that one of the appointees will be a dispensing optician.  By that, I mean an optician who is dispensing only and is not an ophthalmic optician as well.  This amendment is really gathered up into another amendment which is coming later on.  It is not giving very much and perhaps the Minister would accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of any amendment that I put down has been to ensure that the opticians would get as fair a chance as the ophthalmic opticians.  I do not wish the board to be controlled entirely by opticians. When the Bill was introduced, we had a register of ophthalmic opticians which was really a company. They were issuing licences to their members to practise or to prescribe glasses, but in most cases they were people who were confined to prescribing glasses alone.  In a great many cases, they were chemists and there were also chemists who were ophthalmic opticians.  You might have a board appointed which would consist entirely of ophthalmic opticians and it is to avoid that that I have put down these two amendments.  I want to ensure that in these two registers they would be mostly exclusive to both sides; that you could not have a member of the ophthalmic opticians who is a member of the opticians' register as well.  Under the Bill as it was introduced, I envisaged the fact that the board might consist of people who were confined entirely to the ophthalmic opticians, to the exclusion of the opticians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the Minister has put down two amendments including amendment No. 13, which more or less means much the same as my own amendments.  They more or less cover the same question, but, instead of <Col N="292" /> making the provisions statutory, they simply provide for rules made for the purpose.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that there are three angles to the ophthalmic treatment of people.  You have the ophthalmic opticians and then you have a society known as the Dispensing Opticians of Ireland.  I am informed that, while they have not yet obtained international recognition, they will shortly do so.  As well as those, there are the ophthalmic surgeons.  I should like to see an equal distribution of seats on the board between these three bodies. By doing so, there will be a safe guarantee that the eyes of the people will be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Minister some figures with regard to these three bodies.  The Dispensing Opticians of Ireland have a strength of 178.  There are 220 of these people altogether, but of these 178 belong to the Dispensing Opticians.  There are 149 ophthalmic opticians and there are 133 ophthalmic surgeons.  I ask that two of the members of the proposed board should be dispensing opticians and that four of them should be medical practitioners who are outside the confines of the Custom House.  The remainder can be ophthalmic opticians.  That is all I am asking the Minister for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's amendment, because the danger we are trying to guard against is that one group or the other will get the upper hand and if one group got the upper hand, it could make rules to exclude the others.  It should be statutory that both of them should get representation and that is why I am in favour of giving equal representations to the dispensing opticians and to the ophthalmic opticians.  Unless there are some very good reasons to the contrary, I would very strongly press for an amendment of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other amendment I have put down is rather contrary to that put down by Dr. Esmonde.  He favours putting five medical practitioners on the board, instead of four, and my amendment is to the effect that there should be at least four.  A time might well come, when this board begins to work smoothly, when it would be a good idea to let the ophthalmic <Col N="293" /> opticians and the dispensing opticians look after the business themselves and it would not be necessary to have any medical representation.  I do not mind whether the House agrees with that suggestion or not.  The one amendment I am really pressing is that we should make it statutory to give representation to the two interests and not leave the matter to rules to be made by the board itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down an amendment to try to effect a necessary balance between the two groups who appear to have somewhat divergent interests.  The form of my amendment is not anything sacred, because, as long as the principle is carried one way or another, I would be inclined to make it an elastic provision.  I can see the wisdom of what Deputy Dr. Ryan has said with regard to having definite mandatory statutory requirements.  I can also see the desirability of leaving it so that, without further legislation, with changed circumstances, the board could, in all fairness, give fair representation having regard to the number in each section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I do see is that any of these amendments will not be of any effectiveness to maintain a balance unless you couple with them &mdash; and this is the only part of my own amendment to which I have any real devotion &mdash; a requirement that the representatives of each section be elected by that section only.  As I read the Act at present, and leaving out an amendment which Deputy Dr. Esmonde has to a later section with regard to dividing the register, the position is that the board shall be elected by the entire combined register consisting of the register of ophthalmic opticians and the register of dispensing opticians.  If that happens &mdash; it does not matter what statutory requirements there may be with regard to actual representation on the board &mdash; if one group greatly outnumbers the other, on the whole picture the position will be that persons who nominally are, say, ophthalmic opticians but, in fact, do not really represent their interests or are not active in representing their interests, will be elected.  If the dispensing opticians are in control numerically, <i>vice versa</i>, <Col N="294" /> the other situation arises.  In other words, if you are going to put in any amendment &mdash; I think the Minister's is probably good in as far as it is elastic &mdash;providing for a fixed number of each class of optician on the board, it is absolutely essential to tag on to that a provision that each class of optician be elected by his own members, in other words, by the persons who are in the same occupation as himself.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would not be so concerned about the form of amendment. I think any of those suggested would probably meet the case as long as there is tied on to that this provision that dispensing opticians will be elected out of the panel of dispensing opticians only and ophthalmic opticians will be elected out of the panel of ophthalmic opticians only.  If that is not tied on to whatever amendments are put in, I do not think the amendments will be effective to keep the balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not agree with Deputy Finlay.  There are two amendments &mdash; Nos. 11 and 12.  One of them is Deputy Dr. Ryan's and the other is my own.  Amendment No. 11 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 11, before &lsquo;shall&rsquo; to insert &lsquo;and at least two of whom are registered dispensing opticians, one of the latter to be also a pharmaceutical chemist or dispensing chemist and druggist&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 11, before &lsquo;shall&rsquo; to insert &lsquo;at least two of whom shall be ophthalmic opticians and at least two of whom shall be dispensing opticians.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That confines it to &ldquo;at least&rdquo;.  Therefore, you are perfectly safe on that.  If there is a majority of dispensing opticians over the ophthalmic opticians, is it unlawful or wrong for them to have greater representation?  I do not think so.  It is the law of average, the law of democracy.  Minorities are safeguarded by the words &ldquo;at least&rdquo;.  It is a great safeguard that we can introduce in this House.  I agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment seems to me to meet the <Col N="295" /> case but it ought to be statutory.  Rules may be played about with.  If we are introducing, legislation for a definite purpose, let us have it statutory and have done with it rather than have rules.  If the Minister does that we will all be in full agreement here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was getting a bit cold about my own amendment and I am finding support for it now.  I am conscious, as I think most Deputies are conscious now, that there are divergent and, perhaps, conflicting interests in the subject-matter of this Bill.  There has been a view expressed that the board might be used by one particular interest to the exclusion of others.  I do not know what value to attach to the suggestion but there are certain things which impress me.</P>
      <P>First of all, I am impressed by the fact that this legislation, which did not originate when I became Minister for Health, but which was in principle the subject of a decision taken by Deputy Dr. Ryan, as Minister, I think it is fair to say, represents the efforts over a great number of years of the ophthalmic opticians.  It was they who were seeking some form of legislation which would deal with what they felt to be abuses in relation to sight-testing, the sale of spectacles and a variety of matters of that kind.  Therefore, the first fact that impresses me is that this was intended to be a Bill to deal with a case put forward by the ophthalmic opticians and to that extent I feel that, if there is to be any preference given on the board to non-medical interests, such preference should be given to the ophthalmic opticians because it is the Bill which they got as a result of their continued representation over a number of years. I only mention that generally as a matter which impresses me.</P>
      <P>I am impressed by the danger that a board completely dominated by ophthalmic opticians might, although the matter could then be dealt with. be tempted to use the legislation and the board to the detriment of other interests, and I think that that should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Generally, my concern is to ensure that the board will be fairly representative of all sections but that any one section will not be able to use it for its own purposes.  I have felt that the best way of doing that was, in relation to the election rules, to make it obligatory on the board to provide in their rules for representation for each interest amongst the opticians.  I put down an amendment to that effect &mdash;amendment No. 13 &mdash; and if the Committee Stage had taken place prior to Christmas I probably would have moved that amendment formally but, turning the matter over in my mind since and listening to what has been urged here by Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Dr. Esmonde, I feel that there is some merit in the suggestion that whatever provision should be made should be written into the statute itself.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I make the suggestion to the House, in relation to the different amendments, that perhaps the best way of dealing with the problem &mdash; feeling, as I do, that preference should be given to the ophthalmic opticians, but at the same time that steps should be taken to ensure that they do not control the board &mdash; is that an amendment could be moved on Report Stage, providing that, of the six optician members on the board, at least one must be a dispensing optician.  I should also provide in such an amendment that power would be given to the Minister to vary by Order the respective members of subsequent boards.</P>
    <P>My reason for suggesting this matter of varying by order, which involves a certain amount of ministerial control, which frankly I think is undesirable, is to endeavour to have the board set up properly at the beginning, and operating normally later, and I think if such a power is given to the Minister to watch the development of elections to subsequent boards and if, in fact, there is a ganging-up taking place which would destroy the effect of the board proposed, then it will be an easy matter to alter the legislation to redress that.  I suggest to the Deputies who put down these amendments to agree with this course, that is that an amendment on the lines I have suggested <Col N="297" /> should be introduced on the Report Stage.  The amendment would provide that, of the six optician members of the board, at least one must be a dispensing optician, and I would reserve to the Minister for Health the power by Order to vary the respective members, as he feels proper.</P>
    <P>With regard to the medical representation on the board, my view on that is that it is absolutely essential, if this board is to function properly &mdash; if it is to lay down adequate standards and if it is to deal with the abuses with which the Bill seeks to deal &mdash; that there should be available to it proper qualified medical advice, and I think a board without such advice and without the membership of medical practitioners would cease to be in any way effective.</P>
    <P>In the first amendment he moved, Deputy Esmonde asked for a guarantee from me that medical practitioners whom I would appoint or who might be appointed at subsequent elections would be from outside the Custom House.  I was rather surprised he asked me for such a guarantee.  I could not give it because I had been told in discussions with the I.M.A. that they felt it would be doubtful if they would agree to act on this board.  This is a free country; everybody is entitled to act within the law according to his opinion, and I do not blame the members of the I.M.A., if they wish to adopt that attitude.  I am concerned to see that this board will have available to it medical advice.  It might be regrettable that the I.M.A. considers it doubtful that they would co-operate and accordingly it may become necessary to appoint to the board doctors available to my Department.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will agree with my suggestion regarding the proposed amendment for the Report Stage.  The proposal would be then that there would be four medical practitioners, five ophthalmic opticians, one dispensing optician and the eleventh member of the board would be appointed by the Minister.  If that does not work out, it will then be open to the Minister, under the reservation in the section, to alter the proportion of the membership.  I think it is unlikely that in a board so constituted any particular <Col N="298" /> interest would have a dominating influence.  Perhaps the three interests concerned would agree to work the legislation in the common interest of setting up proper standards and dealing with well-known abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In my amendments, I seek two dispensing opticians and I think it is a fair request, in view of the figures I have given the Minister. There are 178 in the organisation consisting of dispensing opticians in Ireland and there are 149 ophthalmic opticians.  Would the Minister bear in mind that dispensing opticians do not suggest for a moment that they can prescribe spectacles?  They are purely concerned with the dispensing and sale of the spectacles.  The ophthalmic optician prescribes spectacles but he is also in the same category as the other inasmuch as he is dispensing and selling spectacles as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing all that the ophthalmic opticians have sought out of this Bill, <Col N="300" /> I think they would be getting a very fair deal if they were getting four.  If the amendment is accepted for at least two, could not the Minister accept that?</P>

      <P>I am pressing for this. This board starts as an established board.  Whether it is an established board or an elected board, I want it on the statute that there will be a minimum of two opticians.  It is obvious that to have that in the Act is a safeguard for the ophthalmic opticians.  If it is open for ordinary election afterwards, it is very likely that there will be more opticians than ophthalmic opticians, and the ophthalmic opticians themselves will suffer.  I think it is in their interests to have this legislation.  It is in the interest of the ophthalmic opticians and of the opticians as well.  It would be a fair balance of power.  You will then have four doctors, four ophthalmic opticians, two opticians and one outside person on the board.  I do not see what could be fairer than that.</P>

The only thing I feel that should be said is that it might be undesirable to include in an Order of the nature referred to the reason for the removal of the person. For example, it might arise that a member of the board was found to be incapable of carrying out his duties because of mental illness or some other matter of that kind.  I feel that to make it a statutory obligation to place an Order containing these reasons, without any discretion, before the House might be undesirable. To meet the Deputy's point, I suggest that I would accept an amendment <Col N="303" /> designed to ensure that an Order removing a member would have to be placed before the House.  Then, if it were questioned, it would be open to the Minister to give his reason or to let it be known in other ways, if it were not desirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The board, as soon as may be after making any rules, shall cause notice to that effect to be published in two or more daily newspapers circulating in the State and shall make a copy of the rules available at a reasonable price to any person who requests one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill gives the board power to make rules subject to the approval of the Minister.  There is provision in the Bill for the requirement of ministerial approval to rules generally or of a particular class to be rescinded by Order of the Government. The rules which the board will make will cover a great variety of matters and will include rules in relation to registering, removal from the register, election of members to the board, provision of courses of training and examination, prescribing and dispensing of spectacles and the control of advertising.  These rules will intimately affect all those persons who are at present engaged in prescribing and dispensing spectacles and in other <Col N="304" /> ways in which they are at present unrestricted.  It is desirable that these people should have an opportunity of considering these rules before they become law.  This object, I hope, will be achieved by this amendment.</P>
    <P>When the rules have been made, the board must publish notice to that effect in the daily newspapers.  The rules will not, in accordance with sub-section (2) of Section 18, have effect until they are approved by the Minister, and this time-lag will give an opportunity to examine any representations regarding rules which may be made by persons affected.  I think on those grounds the amendment is desirable, to make sure that those likely to be affected will have notice that will enable them to make any representations they may wish to make concerning the proposed rules.</P>

      <P>I can understand the purpose of the amendment, but there are a few things I should like to suggest. While it is true that a person could be on both registers, in effect, it means that an ophthalmic optician could be on both registers, on his own register as an ophthalmic optician and on the dispensing opticians' register as a dispensing optician, while the dispensing optician could be on only one register.  If amendment No. 17 were passed, difficulty number one would be that a dispensing optician could never become an ophthalmic optician because he could not be registered, even assuming he got whatever additional or other qualifications might be needed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps if I put it this way &mdash; if in the composition or election of the board, if the register, as Deputy Finlay proposed, elected the appropriate membership to the board, one could understand an ophthalmic optician entitled to be registered on his own register also registering on the register of dispensing opticians, but that is an &ldquo;if&rdquo; and that is the only &ldquo;if&rdquo; in it.  If that &ldquo;if&rdquo; does not exist, and it does not as at present proposed, there is no purpose in an ophthalmic optician also registering on the register of dispensing opticians, because, apart from anything else, he has to pay two fees, if he does so.  He has to pay a fee for registering on the dispensing opticians' register, as well as on his own.  Frankly, while I can understand the purpose of the amendment, I do not see what it is supposed to achieve.  A person on the ophthalmic opticians' register is entitled, because of his registration, to prescribe and dispense and he has no added advantage in going on to the dispensing register, except if, by doing so, or by being on that register, he was entitled to vote for representation on that register alone.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 32 on Section 34 deals with a similar matter.  The purpose behind the suggestion to increase the statutory period from seven years to ten is to satisfy the fear in the minds of <i>bona fide</i> opticians.  We had an infiltration from across the Channel some years ago when similar legislation was mooted there, and the period suggested in the Bill would not be a sufficient span to eliminate those quacks infiltrating here to avoid similar legislation across the Channel.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The position about this is &mdash; dealing with Deputy Brennan's amendment first &mdash; that the ophthalmic opticians in their discussions with my Department felt that the period of practice for persons to be registered in the ophthalmic opticians' register should be a minimum of ten years.  It was felt that that was unduly long, and eventually they agreed that the period might be reduced to seven years, and seven years is in the Bill. On the Second Stage a number of Deputies felt that it was far too long, and there was an amendment, not <Col N="309" /> moved, by Deputy Maguire that the period should be reduced to a year.  It is very hard, as Deputies will appreciate, to arrive at any fair period in a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I was extremely concerned lest legislation similar to this legislation should be passed before this through the British Parliament, because I felt that, if that took place, we would have an influx of quite undesirable persons dealing in matters of this kind.  In fact, we are ahead of the British legislation, although I understand such legislation will be introduced, and we provided under sub-section (2) two safeguards.  First of all, a person must be a citizen of the country. To be registered at all, he must be a citizen, and therefore in relation to the period, you are only considering, then, the practice by citizens, which, I think, removes one of Deputy Brennan's fears.  You are not considering at all a person who comes in from outside, who is a non-citizen and has not been engaged in a <i>bona fide</i> practice here in this country.  Considering the citizen who is able to show that his principal means of livelihood during the particular period has been the carrying on of business as an ophthalmic optician, the question is, then, whether seven years is or is not a fairly reasonable period.  Frankly, I think it is.  It is not as long as the ophthalmic opticians wanted.  It is not so short as to dispose of the possibility of experience giving standing, and I think it is a fair in-between period. I would ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>

      <P>I am sure the citizenship safeguard would meet the point which was held to be one requiring a safeguard, but I can also visualise the position where a registered company might obviate the Minister's proposals in cases where the majority of the members might be citizens.  That might not be likely to arise, but there is a possibility that it could.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an amendment further down in connection with this particular clause.  I must say that I do not like the way this clause runs. A person can be removed from the register of ophthalmic opticians.  The same applies in this Bill in connection with the register of dispensary opticians.  A person can be removed for contravening Section 45 of this Bill, &ldquo;excluding a contravention in respect <Col N="312" /> of which prosecution proceedings are instituted but are dismissed&rdquo;, but if proceedings were not taken, the person could be removed.  That appears to me to be rather unfair.  If proceedings are not taken, the person's name can be removed from the register and that is the end of it.  I thought that was unfair and I put down an amendment which I am quite sure would not pass the draftsman, but I wanted to show in the amendment that I thought it was only fair that a contravention of Section 45 should be proved in court before the person's name could be removed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, first of all, in defence of the sub-section, that, under the sub-section, as proposed, a person can be removed for either a conviction under Section 45 or even where proceedings to convict do not take place?  What that was intended to cover were facts which are not unusual in this country, where a person may have committed a flagrant breach of Section 45 and may have taken the mail boat, an Aer Lingus plane, to England or a train to the North, and it was not possible to proceed against him to conviction, when it was clearly established that he has committed a flagrant breach of the section and it is undesirable to have his name on the register.  That is one class of case where there would not be a conviction, but where it is perfectly right and desirable that his name should be removed.</P>
      <P>There may also be other circumstances on other grounds.  It might be felt, perhaps, unfair or undesirable to proceed under Section 45 for a conviction, but that, nevertheless, the facts would bring about a conviction, if they were investigated in court. Again, it would be desirable to remove the person's name from the register. Those are the two reasons that occur to me in relation to the section why it would be unwise to tie it down merely to a conviction, because it may not be possible to prosecute or it may not be desirable to prosecute.  In addition, of course, under the amendment, as proposed by Deputy Dr. Ryan, a conviction would have to be obtained at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> In fact, the next amendment, which is an amendment of mine to the sub-section, deals with the case where proceedings are, in fact, taken, but, by reason of some technicality, are dismissed because of that technicality&mdash; not dismissed on the merits, but dismissed because of lack of proof or something of that kind &mdash; but nevertheless, to all persons interested in the matter, it may be clearly established that an offence has been committed. Again, I think, that in those circumstances, if the register is to have the standard we should all like to see it have, it should be open to the board to remove from the register a person in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the amendment and the Minister's own amendment which he has discussed himself, I should like very strongly to reconsider the form of the section as a general matter of principle.  What you are doing, in fact, is creating, under Section 45, a number of offences that are contraventions of that section.  You are providing by the Bill two separate forms of penalty for them.  One is the ordinary penalty and the other, obviously the more powerful and significant penalty, is the removal of the man from the register.</P>
      <P>If the section, as it stood, was passed, then the position would be that, in effect, a man would stand the possibility of being charged twice with the one offence.  That is what it comes to.  If the section, with the Minister's amendment, went in, then the position would be that the man could be charged in the courts with an offence under Section 45.  The House should try and think of the position of a person defending him.  He has a good technical point which is a good point in a criminal case, and good merits, but good merits are only as good as the district justice thinks they are. What is he to do?  Is he to face a trial the next month before the board or throw away his technical point which he may have as a matter of criminal law?  He may have a good defence in general law.  Is he to throw that away in order to get a dismissal on the merits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> I think this would be a very dangerous precedent.  I can see the Minister's point about the person who skips and whose name must be taken off the register, but that can be met by an amendment.  In any case, provided the board has, after reasonable efforts, failed to serve the man with a summons under Section 45 within, say, three months, they may proceed against him for a contravention of that section.  I would, however, ask the Minister to consider very strongly the desirability, where you create a criminal offence and where you make the commission of that offence a ground for the removal of a man from a register, of saying that the only way in which you can proceed to removal is by conviction in the open courts.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, very difficult to envisage any circumstances which would justify the section as it stands, except one, namely, that the standard of proof before the board was less strict than the standard of proof required in court.  The only possible reason which could justify sub-section (3) is if, in fact, it was easier for the board to convict than it would be for the court. If one examines it in that light, it becomes immediately apparent that this provision is an infringement of the ordinary right of a man charged with a criminal offence.  I can see the Minister's difficulty with regard to people who have gone away.  I think that can be met by a special section or by an addition to this sub-section.  I cannot honestly envisage circumstances under which it would not be possible for the board to secure conviction in the courts, but it is possible for them to be satisfied, with sufficient proof, on their own deliberation that an offence has been committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister in this case.  Section 28 really ties in with Section 45. The difference between the Minister and Deputy Dr. Ryan is that the Minister permits the board, for contravention of the regulations under Section 45, to remove from office or to remove from the register.  Deputy Finlay holds that the position should be met by trial in the court.  Now Section 45 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" />&ldquo;(1)  A registered optician shall not...</P>
    <P>(a)  treat any disease of the eye, or</P>
    <P>(b)  prescribe or administer any drug for the purpose of paralysing ...the eye.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the House to consider this argument: supposing an optician is treating a patient and doing that patient definite harm, are we to wait to remove that person from the register until he possibly blinds the patient or has his case tried in the courts? The case may not come off in court for two or three months.</P>

I would much prefer to see prosecutions being brought under this Act by the Department rather than the board.  That would leave the position that the board's hands would not be tied one way or the other by the result of the court proceedings.  I think Deputy Finlay's remarks are cogent from the point of view of ordinary practice in the law courts.  I would suggest the section should be re-examined with a view to seeing if it would not be better to leave out all references to the proceedings taken in the courts as a defence or a bar to proceedings taken by the board in relation to the register.  I think that could be achieved; it obviously cannot be achieved if prosecutions have to be brought in court at the instance of the board.  It might be achieved if responsibility for instituting proceedings for infringements under Section 45 were taken by the Minister rather than by the board.</P>

      <P>I think the effect of this section is not clearly understood. Section 28 is that section which is the most essential part of any legislation of this kind.  It is the section which provides for the supervision and control of registered members by their board.  It is the section, which, if properly used by a good board, will establish standards and a code of conduct for registered opticians, be they ophthalmic opticians or dispensing opticians.</P>
      <P>Under Section 28 provision is made that the rules, by which and under which and in accordance with which the board may remove from the register any member, shall specify the causes for which such member will be removed.  He might be removed for advertising.  He might be removed for a variety of causes.  The section says that the board shall, in addition to specifying a whole number of causes, also specify in particular that he should be removed for a contravention of Section 45.  I think Deputy M. J. O'Higgins is under a misapprehension in this connection.  The board does not prosecute.  This is a criminal offence and prosecutions will be taken in the ordinary way by the proper authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.  In any event, the purpose of Section 28, in relation to the establishment of a code of conduct, is to make quite deliberately the commission of an offence not an essential reason or an essential purpose for the board to strike a person off the register.  They could do it for advertising or any other just cause they may specify in their approved rules. But they must do it if the member offends under Section 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to contravention of Section 45, it seems to me that if the board, which is set up to establish and maintain standards, is in the position that they must have proof before them <Col N="317" /> of a conviction by a court for an offence under Section 45, then their powers may be very illusory.  Anyone who has any experience of courts knows that many a hardened sinner, through good advocacy, may leave the court with a halo round his head.  That does not mean he is any less a sinner; it just means that he happened to be fortunate in having his cause seasoned with a gracious voice.  If you were to insist on proof of a conviction or proceedings to convict in a section of this kind, you might tie the hands of the board completely.  I think it is much better to leave it wide open, provided that the board can be satisfied in accordance with the rules that contravention of the section has taken place.  They are immediately debarred, if it is established that proceedings in relation to an alleged contravention of Section 45 have been taken and have been dismissed.  I believe the dismissal should be a dismissal on the merits. Section 28 is not being tied down only to Section 45.  It deals generally with conduct unbecoming a person on the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to reconsider this.  I appreciate the position in regard to the person who goes away and cannot be served with a summons.  I must confess, however, I am quite at a loss to see the circumstances which would be sufficiently general or sufficiently probable to justify this sort of section under which the board could have before it evidence which would satisfy the board that contravention of Section 45 took place, and yet the same board would not be in a position to put that evidence into a court of law.  I cannot see what harm it would do the board to require them to prove it in a court of law.  I admit, in one case out of a dozen or two dozen, there might be a dismissal on a technical point and I think that is the sort of thing you should not legislate against because going to court might cause a certain amount of mischief.  But in so far as you are providing that the condition of a criminal offence in contravention of a section of the Act is a cause for removing a man's licence to practise and providing, at the same time, that <Col N="318" /> the board may prosecute for that, I cannot see any circumstances in which a case could be proved against a member and at the same time the evidence could not be produced in a court of law.  I ask the Minister to consider that before the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite willing to concede that the board should have the right to suspend for a limited period anybody awaiting conviction. That would be quite a reasonable provision, if it would solve the Minister's difficulty.  The board should be entitled, contemporaneously with the issue of a summons for an offence against Section 45, to suspend that person, without prejudice, until that summons was heard.  If that would meet the difficulty, there would be no objection, but I do not think you will find any precedent for a provision in an Act that, where there is evidence of an offence and where there is power to prosecute, if the body concerned do not want to prosecute, the same body can try the case themselves and impose a penalty.</P>

While I know that, under the Act setting up the Pharmaceutical Society, the board there prosecutes, I think, for offences under the Pharmacy Act and also deals with pharmaceutical chemists, personally, if it is possible, I think it would be far more desirable if the Attorney-General brought the prosecutions in the ordinary way and I will consider that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> I can see the case made by the Minister. It might be almost impossible to have this Act drawn in such a way that a person must be convicted of an offence before the High Court before his name could be removed from the register.  I think that is true, but where a person's name is removed without the case going to the High Court, if he then has an appeal to the High Court against that removal, it is the same thing practically.  I do not like the provision in this Act whereby the person is allowed to appeal either to the High Court or to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that a person will find it very hard to make up his mind.  He may be afraid, if you like, politically that it would be dangerous in his case to appeal to the Minister.  Therefore, he would go to the High Court, which would be more costly.  Another person might say: &ldquo;I am not afraid to go to the Minister because I think he is a fair-minded man and does not differ from me in politics&rdquo;, and so on. From that point of view, it would be much better in every way if there was an appeal to one or the other.  I do not like the choice.  If it had been the Minister alone, I would not have the same objection.  The person may appeal to the Minister and nobody else. However, I would much rather if the appeal to the Minister was removed and that we had the appeal to the High Court only.  If that is not acceptable to the Minister, then I would say the second best thing is an appeal to the Minister only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I take rather a different view from that of Dr. Ryan in this case.  It seems to be everybody's constitutional right to appeal to the High Court, if he can afford to do so, but there are certain people who might not have the where withal to appeal to the High Court. Therefore, they should have the right to appeal to the Minister, which would cost them nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde has stated what I would have stated in regard to the section as proposed.  The idea is to enable a person to exercise a choice &mdash; to go to the Minister, if he so wishes, and, if he feels like undertaking the risk of heavy costs, to go <Col N="321" /> to the High Court.  That is his right, too.  In framing this section, certain precedents were kept in mind.  These went in two ways.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act of 1927 and the Dentists Act of 1928, the appeal against removal was to the High Court.  Under the Midwives Act of 1944 and the Nurses Act of 1950, the appeal is either to the High Court or the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that, if the appeal was to the Minister alone, it might happen that a person who had a difference of opinion, even with the Department, not to say the Minister, might feel that his case would get a prejudiced hearing.  Accordingly, if the section were to say &ldquo;may appeal to the Minister&rdquo;, there might be found to be a body of opinion which would say that that was unfair.  That depends upon the personality of the Minister, or on the person's relations with the Minister's Department.  If we follow Deputy Ryan's suggestion, we are still going to give only one source of appeal and we make it to the High Court.  That means that we put on a person the prospect of very expensive litigation, if he is to pursue his ordinary right to appeal against the board's decision.  I think the best thing is to leave the matter as it is and allow him to go either to the High Court or the Minister, but not to both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where an appeal under this section to the High Court is successful&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the court may award costs against the board,</P>
      <P>(b)  the board shall give notice of the result of the appeal to the Minister,</P>
      <P>(c)  the board shall restore the name of the appellant to the Register of Ophthalmic Opticians,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) the court may, if satisfied that the board acted in an unreasonable manner in removing the <Col N="322" /> appellant's name from the Register of Ophthalmic Opticians, direct the board to pay such sum as the court considers reasonable compensation for any loss of practice sustained by the appellant between the decision of the board and the determination of the appeal and the board shall pay any such sum to the appellant.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an appeal under this section to the Minister is successful&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the board shall restore the name of the appellant to the Register of Ophthalmic Opticians, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the board may, if they so think fit, pay to the appellant such sum as they consider reasonable compensation for any loss of practice sustained by the appellant between the decision of the board and the determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Under the sub-section as drafted, provision is made that where an appeal to the High Court against the removal of a person's name is successful and the name is restored to the register, the board may pay compensation to the person concerned.  I considered that sub-section as it was originally in the Bill and I felt that there was a certain illogicality in it.  The person whose name had been wrongly removed from the register appeals to the High Court and gets it established that the board had acted wrongly in relation to him.  The question of compensation for loss of practice would then be left to the discretion of the board which had treated him wrongly.  I felt that such a person might not look forward to the exercise of that discretion in his favour.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this amendment to enable the High Court, in its order restoring such a person to the register, to make an order imposing on the board the obligation to compensate him for the wrong done to him as he was unable to carry on his business. Neither in the original sub-section, nor in the proposed amendment, is it proposed to give any such power to the Minister, in the event of appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea which the Minister has with regard to the original section, but I think he ought to consider extending it to both types of appeal.  There is a premium at present on appeal to the High Court, he can get compensation from that court.  With the same set of facts, if he goes to the Minister, only the board can give him compensation. Would the Minister consider adding to the section the words: &ldquo;The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, direct the board to pay compensation to the appellant&rdquo;.  The present position would be that, with any given set of facts, a man being advised as to whether to go to the Minister or the High Court would decide that he would have a much better chance of getting compensation from the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Finlay, I think that, if this power were to be extended to the Minister, the form of machinery to be set up should be a direction from the Minister which would enable the compensation, if any, to be assessed by the board, rather than that the Minister should be put in the position of assessing it.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, I do not like the idea of putting in this provision for compensation at all.  I think that any board, established like this one is and set up to control a profession, must act as a responsible body of individuals who are going to do their job seriously in the interests of their profession and who will not act frivolously or maliciously in regard to any member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board is faced with the threat of compensation award being given against it, if their decision is upset in the High Court, it is going to impose a very strict régime of caution on the board&mdash;more than there should be.  I am not making the case that the board should approach any case of suspension in any manner other than one in which the matter would be dealt with thoroughly and deliberately.  I do think that, if they are faced with the provision that has been suggested, there will be something more than caution entering into the matter and the board might be inclined to back-pedal <Col N="324" /> in cases where they should come to a decision to suspend.  That is a point of view, in any event, which could well be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that possibility was considered and that is why, in sub-section (d), it is proposed that it is only where the court is satisfied that the board acted in an unreasonable manner in removing the appellant's name the question of paying compensation arises.  I was very conscious of the possibility that, in relation to the liability to pay compensation, it was possible that it might have quite an unintended effect on the board and that they might not remove anybody from the register for fear they might have to pay compensation later; but a court, whose function it is to hear evidence and which is presided over by a person trained for the purpose, will be in a better position to decide what, in fact, is an unreasonable manner than a Minister or a Department considering a matter of that kind.  I have no very strong views.  If it is the feeling of the House that, in relation to the appeal to the Minister, something similar to sub-section (d) of the proposed new sub-section be added, I will certainly consider that between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The board shall, in accordance with rules, register in the register of dispensing opticians a person whose principal occupation is that of pharmaceutical chemist or druggist or jeweller and who applies for such registration and who satisfies the conditions that prior to the establishment date he was a member of the panel recognised by the Department of Social Welfare for the supply of spectacles on the prescriptions of ophthalmic opticians or medical practitioners and that at the time of his application, he continues to be a member of such panel.</P>
    <P>Many people in the category mentioned in the amendment have been accepted already by the Department of Social Welfare and it is for their benefit and safeguard that the amendment is proposed.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment which really means that we are asking that those who are already on the register and recognised by the Department of Social Welfare should be accepted.  It seems a reasonable argument that, if one Department accepts these people on the register and there has been no complaint against them, the Department of Health should accept them as well.  I should be glad if the Minister would accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I also should like to support the amendment.  May I be permitted to indicate that I have an alternative form of the amendment down? There is not a great deal of difference between the two.  I think it is really an alternative; it is an addition to one of the later sub-sections, the idea being that, in addition to all the other qualifications, a person whose main business was not that of optician, but who was carrying on the business of optician, and was at the same time, a registered pharmaceutical chemist, should be accepted.  As I understand the position, there is practically nobody coming within the ambit of the <Col N="326" /> proposed amendment No. 33 who would not be within the ambit of Deputy Palmer's amendment.  Therefore, I should like to support his amendment in substitution for my own, because I understand it takes in some jewellers and so on, who should also be provided for in the same way as I was trying to provide for chemists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I might shorten the discussion on this by saying that I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment, but I do not think the terms are quite satisfactory.  The panel maintained by the Department of Social Welfare contains the names of 487 persons who are regarded by the Department as qualified to dispense the prescriptions of ophthalmic surgeons for spectacles.  The procedure followed by the Department in placing names on the panel is, first of all, where a person possesses a recognised optical qualification, issued either in this country or in Great Britain, to place the person on the register without further question.  If he has a recognised optical qualification, he is put on the register and there is no further inquiry.  If the person possesses no recognised qualification, the Department of Social Welfare requires him to produce for them a letter from an ophthalmic surgeon to the effect that the applicant has satisfactorily dispensed glasses for the surgeon.  On receipt of such letter, the name of the applicant is placed on the approved panel without further question.</P>
      <P>I am a bit concerned at the scope of the Department of Social Welfare panel at the moment.  It embraces a large number of people and, of course, it may not be completely up to date. It may be quite an old list of names. If the Deputies would withdraw the amendment, on my assurance that the principle will be accepted, I will endeavour to draft a suitable amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), before &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, line 27, to insert &ldquo;who is not a registered medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the section stands at the moment a registered optician who was also a medical practitioner would be debarred from giving treatment for the eyes.  That was an oversight and the object of the amendment is to ensure that a registered optician who is also a medical practitioner may treat diseases of the eye.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (c), line 34, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in relation to the diagnosis of eye diseases or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I move this amendment is because of the wording of the section. Refractions of the eye do not involve diagnosis and I want to ensure that ophthalmic opticians will not be legalised to treat diseases of the eyes in any shape or form.  This is simply a technical point in order to safeguard the public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:</P>
      <P>(3)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a registered ophthalmic optician from providing, in accordance with rules, orthoptic treatment for any person on the written direction of a registered medical practitioner who has examined that person, or from suggesting that he has provided or is capable of providing as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the right to ophthalmic opticians to engage in orthoptics.  I understand at the moment that a certain amount of orthoptic treatment is in fact carried out by ophthalmic opticians. I also understand that orthoptic treatment is in fact the physiotherapy of the eye; it is, in fact, a form of treatment to deal with squint and other such conditions and is applied to the eye in the same way as physio-therapy is applied to the body, which is not necessarily carried out by a medical practitioner.  The case has been made, and I agree with it, that this treatment which is part of the services provided by ophthalmic opticians, should be considered to be so part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to oppose the section in order to bring to the notice of the House certain objections I made to this Bill on the Second Stage.  I <Col N="330" /> would draw the attention of the House again to the fact that we are going further in this Bill than we have gone in previous Bills.  For instance, in the Medical Practitioners Bill we provided that a person could not describe himself as a practitioner unless he was actually a medical practitioner.  That provision does not prevent anybody from giving medical advice and from getting paid for the advice so given. But that person is not on the register. In the same way, under the Veterinary Surgeons Bill, a person can treat an animal for a farmer and get paid for it but he must not describe himself as a veterinary surgeon.  It is the same with the dentists.</P>
      <P>So far in this Bill we have laid it down that a person must not describe himself as an ophthalmic or dispensing optician unless he is actually on the register.  To my mind, if we were to leave this section out, we would be putting this Bill on a level with the Medical Practitioners Bill, the Veterinary Surgeons Bill and other such measures and we would not be going so far as preventing a person from selling glasses, provided he is not permitted to describe himself as an optician in any shape or form.  My opposition to this section is aimed at bringing that point of view before the House.  I do not know the reason why we should propose to go further here than we went in other similar measures and I think we should consider the position very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned, as far as I recall his Second Reading speech, that this is a matter of approach to the problem being dealt with under this Bill.  I have information available to me which came from police reports sent on by the Minister for Justice of cases in which useless pieces of glass were sold to credulous persons by dealers in spectacles &mdash; people who asked for and received quite large amounts of money for completely useless articles.  I feel that, once this House sets about dealing with practices of the kind dealt with generally by the Bill, it would be a mistake if we were not to prevent that kind of fraudulent sale of spectacles. I can see no better way of <Col N="331" /> doing that than to establish a register and a board which would procure standards and a code of conduct and which would have sufficient powers to see that these are observed throughout the country.  That is the reason for this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that the same practice goes on in other instances.  There are people setting themselves up as being able to cure rheumatism and other diseases, who give medicine and get paid for it.  The other day I heard of a person who had a cure for goitre which, he said, was a fasting spit.  You have things like that going on and if people want to avail themselves of that type of treatment or advice in medicine, dentistry or anything else, I see no reason why we should not let them have it, so long as the people concerned are not allowed to describe themselves as being qualified.  I admit the Minister makes a strong case&mdash; that somebody comes along and offers glasses that are absolutely useless.  On the other hand, I am afraid that when this Bill is passed people will be accusing us here of passing this legislation and of removing the opportunity they hitherto had of getting cheap glasses.  I think we should let them have their cheap glasses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would be accused of that because, when this legislation goes through, I am afraid that certain sources for the supply of glasses will be removed.  Perhaps, if I were the Minister I would say: &ldquo;And rightly so&rdquo;, but we will be accused by certain people of removing the sources of cheap glasses.  I think the best thing for such people is to let them have their cheap glasses, even if they are no use at all.</P>

      <P>Maybe the section is restricting the activity of people but glasses are prescribed by unqualified persons and sold <i>ad libitum</i> and do incalculable harm to the eyes.  Having been in practice at some time or another, Deputy Dr. Ryan will know that very often when attending a <Col N="332" /> patient you look at the glasses which have been taken off and in many cases you find that they are nothing else but window glass.  In other cases you have people who were given glasses that may have a convex lens when, in actual fact, they required a concave lens.  It may be a restriction of the personal liberty of the individual to a certain extent but the eyes are very important to people and this Bill is for the purpose of safeguarding people.  I think that this section should stand.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) line 19, to delete &ldquo;registered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section is designed to protect the title of registered ophthalmic optician, registered dispensing optician, and registered optician and to restrict their use to persons who are registered in the registers set up under the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to protect, in addition, the titles &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo; and &ldquo;dispensing optician.&rdquo;  If the amendment is passed it will be an offence to use either of these titles unless the person using them is registered in the appropriate register.  The word &ldquo;registered&rdquo; is not being deleted from sub-section (3), the reason being that many opticians do a fairly extensive business in instruments such as binoculars, opera glasses, and so forth, and it has been represented that to prevent them calling themselves &ldquo;optician&rdquo;<i>simpliciter</i> would damage that end of their business.  As sub-section (3) stands, of course, no one may call himself &ldquo;registered optician&rdquo; unless he is on one or other of the registers.  As the section is drafted at present, it might be possible for a person to suggest that he was capable of prescribing glasses, dispensing prescriptions, or selling glasses by using some title, such as spectacle supplier or spectacle seller which is not specifically prohibited by the section.  The two new sub-sections which the amendment proposes to insert will make it illegal to take action of this natu</P>
