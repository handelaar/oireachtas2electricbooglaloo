      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is acceptable, I propose to adopt that course with your approval.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make available, as suggested by the Deputy, all the correspondence and papers dealing with the proposed sale of Panaslipper by the Irish National Stud Company, Limited, would be an unusual step and would create a precedent in regard to the relations between Dáil Éireann, the Government <Col N="792" /> and State-sponsored bodies which would be capable of having undesirable consequences in the future.  It would, moreover, involve the interests of another party&mdash;the gentleman to whom the horse was proposed to be sold&mdash; who would have to be consulted; and even though there is no reason to anticipate that he would see any objection to the publication of the documents the effect of such action on the conduct of the business of State-sponsored bodies generally would also have to be very carefully considered from this point of view.</P>
    <P>Having regard, however, to the public interest which has, undoubtedly, been aroused by this matter, I have decided to reply to the Deputy's question by making a full statement of the circumstances and of the progress of events in the matter, amplifying the information already given in the public statement issued, on behalf of the Government, on the 9th April, 1956.</P>
    <P>I should explain to the House that the particulars which I am about to furnish as to the decisions and actions of the Stud Company in regard to the proposal for the sale of Panaslipper were procured by me in accordance with Section 25 (5) of the National Stud Act, 1945, which provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company shall furnish to the Minister for Agriculture such information, in relation to the policy, activities and decision of the company, as the said Minister may from time to time require.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 8th June, 1955, the board of the company conveyed to my Department, by telephone, an intimation, which they confirmed by letter on the following day, that they desired to purchase Panaslipper for stud purposes. This proposal, if it were to be approved, would require additional capital to be provided for the company, by the taking up by the Minister for Finance of further shares, by subscription. The Minister for Finance has power under the National Stud Acts to take up shares in the company, the necessary funds being advanced out of the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>I gave careful thought to the proposal of the Stud Company to purchase <Col N="793" /> Panaslipper, in the light of the considerations that a strain derived from that horse could be expected to be a valuable contribution to Irish bloodstock and that, if the horse were not bought by the company, there was an assured prospect of his being sold abroad.</P>
    <P>On the grounds which I have indicated, I came to the conclusion that the proposal was a proper one to recommend to the Minister for Finance.  I discussed it, accordingly, with that Minister and had an official recommendation addressed to his Department. On the 30th June, 1955, my Department was informed that the Minister for Finance had authorised the issue of additional shares, up to a maximum of £50,000, to enable the Stud Company to purchase Panaslipper. The sum in fact found to be required was £45,000; additional shares to this amount were subscribed for by the Minister for Finance; and the horse was purchased by the Stud Company.</P>
    <P>The House will observe that the company's proposal to purchase Panaslipper was put forward on the basis that the horse would, in due course, be sent to stud in this country and that it was on this basis that the proposal was considered and approved and that the additional capital required was made available by the Minister for Finance out of the Central Fund.  It is because of these facts that the subsequent proceedings of the board in regard to the horse have been found by my colleagues and myself particularly difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the board of the company held on the 5th March, 1956, it was decided to sell Panaslipper, although the horse had not yet (and still has not) been used for the stud purposes for which he was purchased. Neither I nor the Minister for Finance nor any other member of the Government was consulted in advance of this decision or subsequently informed of it by the company.</P>
    <P>On the following day, the 6th March, 1956, the manager of the Stud addressed to Mr. Neil McCarthy, of Los Angeles, a telegram and a confirmatory <Col N="794" /> letter.  In the letter, having referred to the board's decision, he offered Mr. McCarthy first preference for the purchase of the horse, stated that the price was £80,000 and requested an intimation, before the 13th March, as to whether Mr. McCarthy was interested in buying the horse.  The letter included, in addition, certain ill-advised observations, which were subsequently repudiated by the board when they became aware of them.  The nature of these observations is not material to the main question of the sale of Panaslipper.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that on the same day on which the manager addressed his two communications to Mr. Neil McCarthy, that is, on the 6th March, the manager also addressed a letter to me concerning certain other proceedings which took place at the meeting of the board held on the 5th March, but that, in his letter to me, no mention whatever was made of any proposal, let alone any decision, to sell Panaslipper. In fact, neither I nor any other member of the Government had any reason to apprehend that the sale of Panaslipper was contemplated by the board, until the 15th March, when I learned of the matter, not from the board or from the manager, but from the Press.</P>
    <P>In view of the circumstances in which, and the purpose for which, Panaslipper had been bought by the Stud Company, my colleagues and I took the view that it was not proper or desirable that the horse should be sold without having ever been put to stud.  We also considered that, in the circumstances, the board's decision involved an important question of policy, transcending the ordinary day-to-day administration of the business of the stud&mdash;in which we would not consider it appropriate for a Minister to intervene.  We felt, and still feel, that such a decision should not have been taken, and certainly should not have been communicated to any other party, without prior consultation with me, as the Minister in whom the National Stud Farm is vested by statute, and with the Minister for Finance, who holds the share capital of the company and who had provided <Col N="795" /> additional capital for the specific purpose of enabling Panaslipper to be purchased for stud purposes.  Such consultation had taken place before the sale of Tulyar and, clearly, was no less demanded in the case of Panaslipper.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, informed the chairman of the Stud Company, on the 15th March, 1956&mdash;the day on which I first heard of the matter&mdash;that Panaslipper should not be sold without my concurrence. Acting in my absence, on my behalf and at my request, the Minister for Finance, on the 16th March, requested the chairman to arrange for the manager of the stud to attend in the Department of Agriculture to give such information as was required in the matter.  On the 17th March, the Minister for Finance had a request conveyed, in more specific terms, that the manager should attend in the Department of Agriculture on the 19th March for the purpose of furnishing a general statement concerning the negotiations about the proposed sale of Panaslipper and of producing the relevant documents.</P>
    <P>From information furnished by the chairman of the company and the manager on the 19th March, it appeared that, since the issue of the manager's telegram and letter of the 6th March to Mr. Neil McCarthy, Mr. McCarthy had made it clear, by telegram and letter, that he was prepared to purchase Panaslipper for £80,000 subject to veterinary examination.  The board, on their part, had, on the 15th March, instructed the manager to write to Mr. McCarthy accepting his offer of £80,000 on certain specified conditions, but this letter had not been issued in view of what I had said to the chairman on the 15th March.</P>
    <P>The question then arose whether or not a binding contract for the sale and purchase of Panaslipper had already been entered into between the Stud Company and Mr. McCarthy.  This is a question on which different legal views might be taken.  In fact, the company's legal advisers, when apprised of all the facts, expressed an opinion to the effect that a contract had not been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> The whole matter was discussed at length at a meeting which the Minister for Finance and I had, on the 28th March, with the board of the Stud Company, all the directors being present except Captain Charles Moore, who wrote expressing his regret that he was unable to attend.  We did not receive from the board any explanation that appeared satisfactory to us of the circumstances in which it had been decided to sell Panaslipper without consultation with us.  We made it clear that the Government did not desire the horse to be sold, but, irrespective of the legal position, would most carefully consider Mr. McCarthy's own wishes after he had been made aware of all the circumstances. It was arranged that the board would have a draft letter to Mr. McCarthy prepared for consideration, subject to the understanding that the matter would be explained to that gentleman orally, rather than in writing, if he visited Ireland within a short period, as was thought possible and as in fact occurred.</P>
    <P>It is scarcely necessary to remark that it would have been open to Mr. McCarthy, if he so desired, to contest the view that there was no legal contract for the sale of the horse to him. But neither my colleagues and myself, on the one hand, nor Mr. McCarthy, on the other hand, wished to deal with the matter on the basis of legal rights or obligations.  The Minister for Finance and I discussed the position with Mr. McCarthy, who came to Ireland to ascertain the cause of the delay in completing the proposed transaction. We informed him that we fully appreciated his position and would not wish to oppose his desire to purchase Panaslipper on any legal or technical grounds.  We informed him of what had occured and of the Government's view that it was desirable to keep the horse in Ireland for the stud purposes for which he was bought.</P>
    <P>Mr. McCarthy made it clear that, in his view, he had bought the horse and that he was anxious to have him. Having considered the matter, he conveyed to us that, in view of our attitude in not disputing his claim on legal grounds and his own feeling that, in <Col N="797" /> the circumstances, it would be better that Panaslipper should remain in Ireland, he had decided to waive his claim.  I am sure that the House will appreciate, as my colleagues and I do, the spirit of goodwill and friendliness towards this country in which Mr. McCarthy acted in this whole matter.</P>

      <P>In no case does the instrument appointing a director of the Irish National Stud Company specify a term of office, but the Articles of Association of the company require that one of the directors, as determined by the Articles, shall retire from office at the ordinary general meeting every year.  A director so retiring is eligible for reappointment.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the board of the company held 20 meetings since 1st January, 1955.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to <Col N="798" /> take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I regret to state that the Committee on Milk Production Costs has not yet finished its work and as will be seen from the following communication dated 14th April received by my Department from the technical director, the latter is unable to give a definite date as to when he expects to submit his report to the committee:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ldquo;Flat A,</P>
      <P Just="Right">81 Merrion Road,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Dublin.</P>
      <P Just="Right">14th April, 1956.</P>
      <P>Dear Secretary,</P>
      <P>In regard to the position of the Milk Cost Inquiry there is little to add to my last letter to you.</P>
      <P>The first part of the report giving results for the liquid milk areas is being prepared for circulation to be considered by the committee and should be available for circulation in a couple of weeks' time.</P>
      <P>Apart from any attention required by this part of the report work is henceforth being concentrated on the preparation of the report for the creamery areas.</P>
      <P>I regret that I cannot give a definite date for its submission lest I should mislead.</P>
      <P>The inquiry throughout has been found to be more tedious than was expected and its completion involves concrete work that cannot be shortcut or rushed.</P>
      <P>It is proceeding as quickly as is possible and can only be allowed to take its course; there will not be any avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>Any embarrassment that has been caused the Minister of Agriculture by my optimism for the earlier submission of the results is much regretted.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P Just="Right">(Sgd.) T.A. Smiddy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not received a request from the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association to receive a deputation but I understand such a request was received by An Taoiseach.  Of the token sum of £100 provided in the current <Col N="799" /> year's Vote for my Department to cover the cost of the committee, £88 12s. 6d. was expended up to and including 21st April.  In view of the uncertainty as to when the committee will complete its work it will be appreciated that I am not in a position to say what further expenditure will be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the delay in carrying through the proposed tomato growing scheme in the Ballinskelligs and Caherciveen districts, and, if so, whether he is now in a position to issue a decision in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the delay. As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question on the 27th April, 1955, I am prepared to proceed with the proposed scheme if a sufficient number of suitable Irish-speaking participants is forthcoming to make the plan economically sound.  So far it has proved impossible to obtain that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="800" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared, if he fails to obtain the required number of 100 which would be the ideal from the outset, to consider the possibility of proceeding with the scheme even though the number was less than the 100 which was originally agreed on?  If the Minister obtains 60 or 70 people who would be suitable according to the Department, could the Minister see his way to proceed with the scheme and eventually allow applicants from areas outside Ballinskelligs as well as from Ballinskelligs to apply, so that the scheme in its entirety would be economic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware this scheme was first formulated about 1953 and it was then decided it should be confined to Irish-speaking families.  The problem is that in order to make a unit of this kind approximate to viability, you must have a certain minimal number of growers associated with the central packing and handling premises and you must have a reasonable proximity of the growers to the central handling and packing station.  I am advised&mdash;as I think my predecessor was advised&mdash; that the very minimum is 100.  Otherwise, individual growers may be burdened with overheads which would deny them any prospect of profit at any stage.</P>
      <P>If we extend it over too wide an area, we make it uneconomic again with the result that individual participants are deprived of the prospect of any profit from the undertaking.  Quite frankly, I have been unable to devise any means to find a way out of that dilemma and I still find myself in the difficulty that, if I cannot get at least 100 qualified families, the unit will not work.  I shall be very glad to consider the suggestion made by the Deputy, but I am sorry I cannot honestly hold out any prospect of the unit being instituted on the basis of less than 100 participants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that serving soldiers applying for pensions have often been turned down by the medical board because of illnesses contracted while in the service, and that the board ruled in a number of cases that the illnesses from which the applicants were suffering did not result from their Army service although they were admitted to the service medically fit; and, if so, whether, in view of the grave hardship caused by such rulings to soldiers with long service, he will have the system reviewed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that <Col N="810" /> certain applications under the Army Pensions Acts for disability pensions have been refused as it had not been established that the disabilities claimed for were attributable to service in the forces during the emergency period. These Acts make no provision for the consideration of claims in respect of disease contracted in the course of Army service subsequent to that period. No proposals which would alter this position are contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is a grave injustice on serving soldiers?  If a soldier is certified as medically fit when he is beginning his service in the Army, it seems very strange that after a lapse of five, ten, 15 and, in this case which I have in mind, 19 years, he should be told that the disease from which he is suffering is not due to Army service. If that principle were applied to every other Department of State or to the local authorities, nobody at all would get a pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that, in the course of his reply to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Defence last year, he gave a specific undertaking that this matter would be reviewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter&mdash;I am replying now to Deputy McQuillan's supplementary question&mdash;has been examined very, very often.  It was examined in 1937, 1952, 1953 and again since last year.  There are no provisions in the Garda Síochána regulations in respect of disease contracted by members&mdash;nor in the Civil Service, either.  In peacetime, the view is that the duties of members of the Defence Forces are no more arduous or exacting than those of the duties of many other sections of the community.  Therefore, it is not considered that it would be reasonable to make any other provision than that already made under the various Social Welfare Acts for the <Col N="811" /> serving soldier.  I must say that, under the Social Welfare Act, a soldier, N.C.O. or man, while in the Army, is insured under that Act and any disease that arises is covered in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question I put to him.  I will go to my grave trying to understand why it is that if a medical board or a medical officer passes a man as physically fit to enter the service, then anything that may happen to him afterwards is not the responsibility of the employer, if the position is a pensionable one.  I am not aware of any other employees being treated in the manner in which Army personnel are being treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether, in view of the increasing importance of Ballysaggart, Lismore, County Waterford, and the fact that the nearest post office is six miles away, he will have a sub-post office established there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The very limited volume of business likely to be transacted would not warrant the establishment of a sub-post office at Ballysaggart. Because of the heavy deficit on which the postal service is operating, it is <Col N="812" /> necessary to avoid incurring additional expenditure on new facilities except where clearly justified by the volume of traffic offering.</P>

      <P>The answers to the Deputy's questions are as follows:&mdash;(i) The estimated number affected was 5,450. (ii) In Dublin, the local authority has arranged for the issue of each week's vouchers through the post offices on the Friday of the preceding week.  In Cork the vouchers are issued through the post offices on Fridays and are exchangeable for fuel in the same week.  Unfortunately, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, when instructing the Dublin post offices to cease the issue of vouchers after the issue on the 24th March, 1956, that is, those exchangeable for fuel in the week ended 31st March, 1956, inadvertently gave the same instructions to Cork.  (iii) Arrangements were made with the local authority for a special issue of fuel to the pensioner classes concerned during the week commencing on the 16th April, 1956.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if the local rate has not, in fact, been paid for years to such employees on the Corrib and in the Galway City area?  Is the Minister aware that the present rate being paid to employees on arterial drainage all over the country is as much as 26/- per week less than the local rate being paid to employees of local authorities in the same area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present rate for labourers employed on drainage schemes, except for labourers employed on the Corrib-Clare schemes in Galway borough, is two shillings an hour, that is, 96/- a week for a 48-hour week.  The question of an increase in that rate is at present under consideration.  One difficulty involved in paying drainage labourers the local county council road labourers' rate is that many drainage schemes extend over a number of counties and the position would arise of men being employed side by side on the same work at different rates, or perhaps even being employed in one county one day and in another county on the next, with resulting confusion and trouble.</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that this same trouble arises in many State and semi-State employments and that there is no difficulty or confusion whatever, if an arrangement can be made either with the trade union concerned or, if no trade union is operating, with the men concerned, to pay a decent rate?  That is all they are looking for.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 to 44 together.</P>
      <P>The rate of interest on instalments of any loan issued from the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts is the rate current at the date of such issue.  This applies to all local authorities, including Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>In a circular letter issued in October, 1952, local authorities were advised to make it clear to borrowers that the rate of interest would be governed by that at which the amount of each advance was issued from the fund.  It is not proposed to make any issues from the fund at a rate of interest lower than the rate current at the date of drawing from the fund.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;All local authorities who borrow from the Local Loans Fund have been informed that money at the rate of interest prevailing before the 6th October, 1952, will be made available to them from the fund to enable them to consider the making of advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts in the following types of cases:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister inform me whether he would be prepared to give to the applicants now the same concessions which were given on the 12th November, 1952, under similar circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy but <Col N="821" /> the circumstances are entirely different because, at that time, there was no regulation governing the rate of interest which would be payable by the borrower.  The Minister of the day, in 1952, took care that all future advances would be governed by the rate of interest at which money was borrowed from the Local Loans Fund.  For that purpose, the circular of 1952 was issued.  The increase in 1952 involved an increase of 2 per cent., that is from 3¼ per cent. to 5¼ per cent. in the Local Loans Fund lending rate on the average loan of £1,200 approximately made to the local authorities borrowing from the fund.  That would mean an increase of about £18 per year to the borrowers' repayments of £62 per year.  The present increase would raise the average repayments of £73 a year by only £7 a year.</P>
      <P>There were special circumstances in 1952.  Between 1932 and 1952 the Local Loans Fund rate had been increased twice, on the 13th September, 1939, from 4¾ per cent. to 5¾ per cent. and on the 6th May, 1948, from 2½ per cent. to 3¼ per cent.  On neither of these occasions was money issued at the old rate of interest for S.D. borrowers. The 1952 concession was a special arrangement to meet the special circumstances applying at that particular time.  Since the 1952 concession was granted, the rate of interest on advances from the fund was increased from 3¼ per cent. to 5¼ per cent.</P>
      <P>The rates of interest dropped to 4¾ per cent. on the 1st January, 1954 and to 4½ per cent. on the 1st December, 1954.  Since the 10th March, 1956, it has been back again to the 1952 figure, that is 5¼ per cent.  This is no more than normal fluctuations.  The position of borrowers now is exactly as it was in October, 1952.  In the circumstances and in view of the letter issued by my predecessor in 1952, I see no reason for giving any further concession.</P>

      <P>The resolution referred to by the Deputy, suggesting a revision of the scheme for the improvement of the road between Moyglass bridge and Moville to include the section of road through Gulluduff, rather than the lower road as originally proposed, has been received in the Department. The matter has been fully examined and a reply has been issued to the council on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This road improvement scheme is being financed out of the Tourist Roads Grant.  The primary object of that grant is to secure the development of a road system which will give the maximum benefit from the point of view of tourism.  Under this scheme of grants, therefore, priority must be given to the most important tourist routes in each area.  The route suggested by the council would serve a purely local purpose and would not obviate the demand for the improvement of the route as originally proposed.  It <Col N="824" /> is open to the council to consider arranging for the improvement of the road through Gulluduff by means of the annual county road improvement grant available to them.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last week I was suggesting to the Minister what I consider a better control of the advisory services now sponsored by Muintir na Tíre and controlled by the Department of Agriculture. We live in an agricultural country where it now seems that the fountain pen is regarded as a force mightier than the plough.  We have two groups <Col N="829" /> of agriculturists or farmers, first those who till the soil and produce the nation's wealth, and then we have the academic group, the scribbler at the desk and the hot air merchant or the geyser on the rostrum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The more silent section seems to be the worker on the headland. He seems to have very little to say; at least he is a silent worker and it is to him, to that section, we must look if we are to increase production and to improve the living standards, not alone of the agricultural community, but of the non-agricultural community as well.  I am informed that recently the Taoiseach was the guest of the Southern Law Society at a dinner in Cork and he had to administer a sharp rap to the lawyers at that dinner who, in farming, now seem to be the force and to be the most vocal section in the community.  If we could get rid of the hot air and encourage the people whose job it is to produce and to increase production, we would be much nearer a solution of the serious problem which we now face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us can get away from the fact that we face, or maybe are in the throes of, a very serious national emergency. If we are to solve that problem and to obviate that emergency, then the only section of the community to which we must turn for a solution is the agricultural section.  That solution can be found only when we get our farmers to increase production substantially. Then every section of the community will be assured of a higher standard of living and we might get rid of this irritable purchase tax.  I would like to remind the non-agricultural sections of the community that the purchase tax had to be introduced because we failed in the last six months of last year to maintain a scale of production which would pay for the flow of imports, mostly of semi-luxury goods; perhaps I should not say that, but mostly of goods which are considered now by the non-agricultural sections of the community as attributes or accessories <Col N="830" /> to modern living.  We can get rid of that impost only if our farmers increase production substantially.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking last week I was drawing a distinction between a rural organisation and a producer organisation and I was urging on the Minister that the best way we can achieve increased production is to tap the organised resources which are now available to the Minister.  The Minister is in a very favourable position in comparison, say, with a Minister for Agriculture as head of the agricultural section, ten years ago.  He now has organised farming, a latent force which, with co-operation, he can call upon to help him solve this very pressing problem.</P>
    <P>I was suggesting a certain build-up. When I was speaking I suggested a local controlling committee for the local adviser, not a committee of representatives mainly of non-active agricultural sections of the community, but of those producer organisations whose job it is to do the work and to give us the increased production which we need.  I suggested that the adviser should work in co-operation with a local controlling committee.  Read my speech.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to what the build-up of a local controlling committee should be.  I put it now to the Minister that such interests as co-operative societies cannot possibly be excluded from a local controlling <Col N="831" /> committee.  I suggested that the C.A.O. should be the liaison between the county committees of agriculture and the Department of Agriculture, working in co-operation with the representatives I have suggested from local producing bodies in the area.</P>
      <P>I submit that the representatives of the co-operative societies cannot be excluded because it is logical to assume that agriculture cannot be developed without increased capital expenditure on the part of those who want to increase production and agriculture cannot be expanded without availability of credit facilities.  Therefore, the creamery manager and the representatives of the co-operative store cannot be excluded, because, on them, will fall the responsibility for providing the short term credit required to increase production.  Again, if those farmers who are called upon to increase production want to gain the full benefit from that increased production, they must safeguard themselves against the swarm of parasitic middlemen who may descend upon them.  For that reason, again, the responsibility for marketing the increased produce must rest on the co-operative societies.  I submit that the co-operative societies are very deeply committed in this matter, inasmuch as they will be called upon to provide the capital by way of increased credit and to market the increased produce.  This will naturally entail a considerable expansion of their marketing organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have given is one of the reasons why the creamery manager or the co-operative store manager cannot be excluded.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the mechanics of production.  We must have a starting line.  We must know in what direction we are going and where we start.  A preliminary to the advent of an agricultural adviser or parish agent in an area is the computation of the production output in the area before his advent.  That is a rather complex job and one which I fear most of our agricultural advisers are not qualified to do.  Here, the economics section of the university could be called in to help. As far as I am aware, there is in Cork University already a service which, if expanded and financed, could do the work.  Having got the figures, we could then start from a base line, knowing what the position is in reference to any phase of the production in an intensive area and what the position was before the area became intensive.</P>
      <P>Our existing advisory services employed by the county committees of agriculture are, in the main, extensive and when we increase the number of instructors, say, on the basis of one to every three parishes, or one to every three branch creamery areas&mdash;I would not confine myself strictly to the parish as a basis&mdash;we will have to adjust the thing.  We will have to have a goal in that area, an objective and a plan, and we will have to know exactly where we are going or what we want.  That can be done only by starting on the right foot.  We have in our agricultural set-up a rather unique situation in so far as some areas are the producers of primary products and those primary products are in many instances exported from the producing area to finish the basic article which, in most cases, will have to be sold competitively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me demonstrate exactly what I am trying to get at as far as production of barley is concerned.  Let us take my constituency of East Cork as an example.  East Cork is a very substantial grain-producing area but it produces a surplus.  It is not a very <Col N="833" /> intensive pig producing area but the adjoining constituency of West Cork is. West Cork is, however, not a barley-producing area so that you have an export of a primary product from one constituency to produce in another a finished article which must be sold competitively.</P>
    <P>Nobody probably has had more headaches than Ministers for Agriculture in trying to arrive at a fair and equitable price for primary products. I submit that in the organisations I mentioned earlier in this debate, and to which I may not now advert, there are specialised committees, working with the advice of experts on the production of grain and pigs and I think a very easy way to resolve the row would be to commit those organisations, as I have suggested we should, to get together and suggest a reasonable price for the primary product.  The Minister should say: &ldquo;Let your grain committee and your pig-producing committee get together and suggest to me a reasonable price for barley for the producers and make sure you will give barley to the pig producer at a price that will assure him of a reasonable profit and that will assure him that he will sell his fat pig in the competitive markets across the Channel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the direction in which my mind is travelling and I think that if the Minister would only get going in that direction he would find his job much more pleasant and much easier. He would not be praised by one section when the breeze blew in their favour and assailed by another.  That is one of the reasons why I want to commit those organisations, not alone to the control of, but to participation in everything we should do in the development of advisory services.  I can go a point further.  I have given you the build-up from the parish agent to the controlling body.</P>
    <P>Now, let us get up to university level. In each of the different zones of production we have a university college. One would expect in Cork, for instance, that if we had a multiple research and specialised advisory service it would be directly applicable to the zone served by the Cork University. Here we have the link-up.  Then in <Col N="834" /> the West of Ireland we could have the multiple research and specialised advisory services suitable to the Galway hinterland served by the university there.  Here in Dublin we have two universities which could serve the huge perimeter around the city.  I am not suggesting that there should be more borders and more boundaries, but these three areas are three natural zones each doing a specialised type of farming and in these different zones we could utilise the universities to do the multiple research and the specialised advisory service suitable to each zone.</P>
    <P>The Minister will see in what direction my mind is travelling.  If I have taken a stand against his plan I have not failed to produce an alternative plan and let me emphasise that I think the plan I have submitted is getting much nearer the establishment of the Agricultural Research Institute because, if we can develop the service on the build-up I have suggested, we have then the nucleus of the Agricultural Research Institute.  While I am on the subject, I can tell the House that many a storm will blow over the Minister's head before he will have satisfied all the sections now clamouring for the control of the Agricultural Research Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me.  I have been associated with my colleague, Deputy R. Barry, in the Cork County Council and the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.  We became members of both bodies at the same time.  Every fellow, of course, blows his own bugle, and I can say that in Cork we have as good a county committee of agriculture as anywhere in Ireland but, when I want to speak of county committees of agriculture in relation to the suggestions which I have made, I am quite prepared to say that the whole structure and the whole <Col N="835" /> basis of the county committees of agriculture require revision.</P>
      <P>It would be illogical for me to name an instance of the producing organisations in Cork who should participate in the control of the advisory services or in the control of production without suggesting a revision or an amendment of the Act under which county committees of agriculture are set up and my suggestion, for what it is worth, ignorant and all as I am, is that the 1931 Act, on which the present county committees of agriculture have their statutory foundation, should be revised so that in addition to the elected representatives on the county committees there should be mandatory provision made for the inclusion of representatives of organised agriculture in the counties.  It might not be a very popular thing, from the political angle, for somebody to suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why suggest mandatory? At the moment it is optional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that county committees of agriculture are representative of elected groups in the counties and that any decisions arrived at will be from a majority of the committee.  If the majority decide not to give representation to agricultural producing bodies, then they are out.  I think, following the line I have suggested and the build-up I have outlined, that it would be illogical for me not to suggest that the Act should be revised so that there would be a mandatory provision to give representation to the nominees, at county level, of producing bodies in the county, and, in particular, to the producing bodies participating in the local committees, controlling the advisory services.  Those are my suggestions in relation to the revision of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want here more than anything else, and what we have failed to get, is the co-operation of farmers not only in my county but in the country generally.  Lectures, education and all this talk are all very well, but if we can convince the farmers as a body and as an organised group that it is in their own interest to co-operate and increase production, then we will have <Col N="836" /> found a solution to this almost insoluble problem.  When I was associated with the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society, one of the achievements of which I felt extremely proud and what I regarded as one of the best day's work ever done was to make available to every farmer's son attending the secondary school in that area an agricultural science graduate.  Any farmer's son attending that school can take agricultural science as a subject right up to his Leaving Certificate.  If that course were followed by every secondary school with a purely rural hinterland, we would have gone a long way on the road to educating, if not this generation, then at least the coming generation of young farmers. So far as I know&mdash;and I am ashamed to say it&mdash;there are only two such schools in the country which have such teachers attached to their staffs.  One is in Mitchelstown and the other is in Tipperary town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the agricultural colleges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the ordinary Christian Brothers' day schools&mdash;the schools which the Minister is aware are serving the biggest section of the farming community.  Not all our farmers are in a position to send their sons to boarding colleges. Not all our future farmers will have the opportunity of having the advantage of being students in boarding colleges with a farm attached.</P>
      <P>Not all of them can go to those colleges&mdash;I do not want to name them&mdash; that specialise in teaching farmers' sons agricultural science.  I know that education in that field is under the control of another Minister, but I would suggest to him that, in co-operation with the Minister for Education, he should do all he possibly can to get agricultural science graduates into our secondary schools and to make sure that, when our young students leave the secondary school, they will have a first class agricultural education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in those schools and by that method that we can get over this prejudice that, unless you have a white collar job, you are inferior to the man <Col N="837" /> who goes out, puts on a set of overalls and mounts a tractor.  I have said over and over again&mdash;and I think it is to some extent true&mdash;that, as an agricultural community, we have lost our love for the land.  It is an extraordinary thing that not even a percentage of all the thousands of people who emigrate from this country ever look for work on the land.  You will find them crowded into big industrial cities.  We can go back even further to the days of the mass emigration immediately after the Famine.  We know that in those days the majority of our Irish emigrants went out to the areas cleared of virgin forest and built their little farms.  But the industrial revolution came in America and, in 100 years, they were uprooted and migrated back to the towns.  I remember reading in an economic history of America that the movement was so vast during that period of the industrial revolution in America that some of the priests who went out to minister to those emigrants found that they had to learn a new language&mdash;mainly German&mdash;because the little farms which those people had developed were mostly taken over by Germans.</P>
    <P>I had no intention of speaking on this question of advisory services for as long as I have done, but I was prodded into so doing by the Minister himself.  I have given an alternative. I have given the build-up and it is, as the Minister would say, &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo;.  I have not gone into a detailed study of the snags which might be found in it, but I have given the outline. I submit to the Minister and to this House that it is a better starting ground than the action the Minister has now taken, and I want to appeal to him to stop now and think before he crosses the line of no return.  We know how we have failed in our control of Irish agriculture to reach that degree of production which our competitors have reached.  It is an admission of failure.  It is the yardstick by which we can measure the failure of control in Irish agriculture up to now.</P>
    <P>I want to say that there is a growing cynicism by farmers and organised farming in this country with the Civil Service direction, and there is also a <Col N="838" /> growing cynicism by organised farming of politicians.  Everywhere, at every meeting and gathering, you have speakers in those organised groups getting up and having a &ldquo;clatter&rdquo; off us politicians and where we fail.  The suggestion which I have made is aimed at killing that kind of thing.  It is aimed at getting these people to do their own business, to solve their own problems and to solve the nation's problems. It is no use for me or for anybody else to get up here and keep on talking. There has been a whole lot of talk down through the years.  There have been speeches and lectures by people who never damped their feet in the morning dew&mdash;people on the rostrum telling the farmers where they failed and what they should do.</P>
    <P>The backwash of this growing cynicism by organised farming and intelligent individual farmers is that they regard every politician as a weeping Arab at the Wailing Wall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I purposely used the phrase.  It is a polite way of saying that they regard us as hypocrites. I have now got to suggest, and I appeal to the Minister, that he reconsider this whole thing.  It takes a very big man to alter a major decision and it takes a wise captain to alter course when he is warned of dangerous seas ahead.  That is all I want to say on the advisory service.  I submit that the proposals I have made to the Minister and to the House are worthy of an examination as an alternative to the plan which he has developed and is sponsoring.  I say that if the Minister can commit every group concerned with agriculture in the country to do their own job, it will help to solve the serious problem which we have facing us as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In going on to the other aspects of the Minister's policy, I want to say that, for the past ten years in this country, we have had a prices boom. There is no getting away from the fact that the going has been easy.  It has <Col N="839" /> been easy for the farmers, as can be seen if you make an objective examination of the position.  We were told by the commission that was set up to inquire into emigration that something like 20,000 people leave the land every year.  There is a constant migration from the land, so it can reasonably be assumed that, with boom prices and more money for a smaller number of people, the logical conclusion is that incomes are higher, as far as the individual is concerned.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, however, we would be fools not to face up to the situation which is there before us&mdash; that the physical volume of Irish agricultural production has remained practically static.  The Minister has said that there was a 24 per cent. increase, but you can always look for a base to that year when production was lowest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael since this debate started, but if the Minister wishes to introduce politics into the matter, I can change front.  The fact we cannot get away from is that our agricultural production has remained static in relation to our expenditure, in relation to what we are called upon by other sections of the community to produce.  The major part of our imports of no matter what kind of goods you name will have to be paid for by increased agricultural production and I ask the Minister can he say, or can anybody in this House say, that our agricultural production and the amount of produce we have been able to export has been capable of bearing the enormous demands made by way of imports.  Otherwise, you would not have had this enormous adverse trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak relatively.  When we make comparisons, we must make comparisons <Col N="840" /> in relation to the amount of exportable produce we have to pay for our imports and one of the things we have to admit is that our imports have outstepped the value of what we have been able to export by way of agricultural produce.  That cannot be avoided. Our position, relatively, has remained static.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the dangerous position of not being able to produce enough agricultural produce to pay for all the demands being made on us by all the people who want luxury goods. No wonder they crib and no wonder the gentlemen on the rostrum shout: &ldquo;You are failing to do the job.&rdquo;  Now we feel the pinch of the purchase tax which the Minister for Finance had to impose to stem the inflow of imported goods.  Is that not the whole situation as to the way we have failed?  The non-agricultural sections of the community say that we have deprived them of their needs because of our failure to increase production.  Is that not the charge against us?</P>
      <P>On the other side of the picture, we, as a nation, under God's providence, were fortunate enough to have escaped the ravages of a world war.  We were fortunate in so far as, unlike our competitors, we did not have our economy smashed to the dust as they had.  They shook themselves from the ruins in 1955, and now where are they?  Many of them have increased their volume of output by 50 per cent. since 1945.  That is the yardstick by which you can measure where they are going and where we have broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of boom prices has been built, for the non-agricultural sections of the community, our whole social structure, not on increased volume of production, but on boom prices.  If there were a collapse of prices to-morrow, all our present commitments, as the Minister knows full well and as every Deputy is aware, would weigh very heavily on the agricultural sections of the community. The only way we can protect ourselves and all the other sections of the community, and the only way in which we <Col N="841" /> can give them what we have assured them of by legislation, is by a substantial increase in our agricultural output.</P>
    <P>We have here the Minister for Agriculture as the person responsible to this House and the country as the arch director of our basic industry, agriculture.  There is no other form of industry from which we could build up and get the potential increase that we can get from agriculture, if we can break this barrier that is before us, and get our Irish farmers to do the job.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, quite recently, &ldquo;skiting&rdquo; to America and chasing a mirage for phantom industrialists, while here at home we have our basic industry in a stagnant position.  We have in agriculture an industry with an enormous potential which we can develop, and I submit to the Minister that agriculture is the one industry we have in which we have a real source of development.</P>
    <P>Again, I am never afraid to say of that pattern of industrial expansion that everyone is glad that we all now accept the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil, in so far as industry should be aimed at providing decent employment for our surplus population from the town and from the land, but I am afraid that many of the suggestions made in this House might have repercussions, too, on agriculture.  We have reached a stage in industrial development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have said that, and I know that the Minister will say the same thing and agree with me.  He has spoken at fair day meetings where he hammered loud and long the manure manufacturers of this country, but he is utterly powerless now to do anything about it.  He has not done it.</P>

I remember the days when they roared &ldquo;hairshirt&rdquo; and &ldquo;calico shift&rdquo; at us when we sat at that side of the House, when we said &ldquo;you can have all those things and more, if you produce the wherewithal to pay for them&rdquo;.  Then the &ldquo;hairshirt&rdquo; and the &ldquo;calico shift&rdquo; was the howl that went up from Fine Gael, the spate of propaganda which was the incentive and impelling force in landing us where we are now.

That was the political manna of Clann na Poblachta.  Then we come to the big slogan: &ldquo;Fine Gael for better times&rdquo;.  That slogan has been dropped now.  Nobody now shouts: &ldquo;Fine Gael for better times&rdquo;.  Were those not the incentives and the driving force behind the Fine Gael version of better times, which means bigger and bigger motor cars for the non-agricultural section of the community, and brighter, bigger and more expensive television sets?  Yes, press button services in every home is the manner in which we can consider and interpret that slogan.  Now we have reached the tragic position that the Minister is forced into the position of saying: &ldquo;You cannot have those things.  If you will have them you will pay a purchase tax varying from 15 to 35 per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the Minister seriously to examine even the percentage increase in the Friesian breed in this country.  I should like to have the figures from him when he is replying. When I visited the Departmental farm at Clonakilty last fall an experiment was being conducted by the manager of that farm as between commercial Friesians and Shorthorn bull calf breeds.  It was amazing.  I did not ask for the live weight gain per day, but one amazing thing was the obvious difference between the Friesian bullock and the Shorthorn bullock.  This is, I think, the first experiment carried out by the Irish Department of Agriculture and I will give the Minister all the credit where it is due, that it is being conducted under Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  It was, to my mind, even at the stage when I saw it, a most revealing experiment, and I feel sure that the House will be glad, when the experiment is concluded, if the Minister will give us the final figures.  In speaking on previous Estimates, I used to make reference to investigations carried out by investigating bodies outside this country, and I would be glad at any time to have the figures of an independent investigating body on the same lines in this country.</P>
      <P>I also gave figures for beef tests and, as far as I know, there is a new series of tests out.  I think I have it here, but I shall not refer to it because I have already given comparative figures, and they are on record, on a previous Estimate.  To-day we hear very little about poultry.  Poultry is something that it not mentioned any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Are turkeys not poultry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of poultry generally.  I remember how the Minister and I at fair day meetings in East Cork gave the agricultural audience their fourpence worth in the speeches we made against one another on poultry production.  Those were the days of the poultry parlours.  Those were the days when the present Minister <Col N="845" /> promised that there was a fur coat around the corner for every farmer's wife who increased her poultry flocks. We have seen the poultry parlours that were put up all over the country at that time, but the fur coats did not materialise.  I warned some of the people then to be very careful about the amount of capital they put into poultry because, if they were not careful, they might never recoup it; and I believe that, in the main, that is what happened.  The subsidy to the home producer in England finished poultry here, and since that time&mdash;I do not know how many years ago it is now&mdash;a quill has not been disturbed in the old moulter.  But the Minister used to say at that time that the hen was worth more than the Fianna Fáil calf ever was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Which was quite true&mdash; the women were getting more for the hen than the men were getting for the calf under Fianna Fáil.  Was that not true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want now to come back to pigs.  Pigs at the moment are a very serious bone of contention because the farmers and the agricultural community generally do not know exactly where they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may shout at me across the floor of the House: &ldquo;For the first time ever, I have given the farmer a guaranteed minimum price.&rdquo;  Now, in relation to pigs, there is the possibility of a big development in the future.  We should not lag behind in the use of artificial insemination in relation to pigs.  At the moment considerable work along these lines is being done at Cambridge.  Some work has been done by the Mitchelstown Co-operative Society on artificial insemination in pigs and I think there is an enormous potential to be developed here.  At the outset, we may have some trouble until techniques are developed, but I think the importance of artificial insemination in relation to pigs is a development to which we can look forward in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, a difference of <Col N="846" /> opinion as between the large white versus the landrace.  When I was speaking in this debate last year, I informed the Minister at that time that there were landrace pigs thriving within the Republic.  If one looks at to-day's paper, one will see there a statement by a clergyman in which he not alone refers to the fact that these pigs are thriving within the Republic, but that they are there by the thousand.  Now, I think that represents a very serious situation.  It is again, mark you, a case of the farmers repudiating the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>This time two years ago on this Estimate, we listened to the Minister go into a verbal tailspin as to the dangers of myxomatosis.  The Minister warned us of the danger of introducing a new virus disease into this country.  But that disease was brought in contrary to the advice of the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture and contrary to the advice of the Minister.  To-day, we can say without exaggeration that rabbits are, if not completely eliminated, at least capable of being controlled.  They are no longer a threat.  All that happened in two years.  Two years ago, he was advising on the danger of introducing a new virus disease.  He warned this House of that danger, despite the fact that at that time myxomatosis was ravaging the County Kilkenny.  To-day, two years later, one cannot keep a pet rabbit without a licence issued by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You know that is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an exaggeration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are only restricted in regard to what are called wild rabbits.  Domestic rabbits like chinchillas are not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>One can keep those. Now in regard to landrace pigs, we have been warned by the Minister, on the advice of his Department, that atrophic rhinitis is endemic in the landrace.  Some of us who have studied the tests and studied the mortality rate in Denmark are not inclined to agree with that belief.  We are not <Col N="847" /> inclined to agree because, if the landrace pig is as ridden with atrophic rhinitis as has been suggested, how could the mortality rate where those enormous tests have been carried out be so low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The mortality rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The mortality rate between weaning and finishing in the fattening tests.  One of the things that strike one on looking through those tests is the exceptionally low mortality rate during the test period and before the killing stage.  If the breed is so ridden, as has been suggested, with atrophic rhinitis, how could that be?  It is certainly a pointer indicating that the whole subject requires further examination.  But what I am concerned about is that, despite the advice given by the Department of Agriculture and despite the warnings issued by the Minister, landrace pigs have been introduced into the Republic.  We have here a land boundary.  Landrace pigs were introduced into the Six Counties.  They are being developed there.  With a land border, we could not hope to prevent the introduction of landrace pigs into the Republic and we are now informed that landrace pigs by the thousand are thriving in the Republic.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that, when that situation exists, he should seriously consider a complete revision of the whole attitude of the Department of Agriculture to landrace pigs. The situation only becomes farcical when the Department advises farmers not to touch these pigs and they are being brought over the Border and distributed all over the country, at the same time.  I am sure the Minister will agree that our whole approach as to what we should do in relation to these landrace pigs should now be revised and re-examined in the light of circumstances which represent a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things we do know, and one of the things the Minister knows, is that the biggest pig-producing unit, possibly, in what used to be the British Isles, is the McGuckin Foundation Farm at Masserene in Antrim.  We know that the McGuckin Foundation <Col N="848" /> up there have introduced landrace pigs and are crossing them with large whites and are getting dramatic and spectacular results.  We are again on the doorstep of development here and I would suggest to the Minister that, before we waste money and energy, we should examine all the data available to us, because I maintain that, if we do not, we will be travelling over a considerable amount of the ground that has been travelled over by other people who carried out research work in this field.  Let us start somewhere.  Let us not repeat and prove what has already been proved.  We know that Professor Cooper, who used to be in Kent and who is now, I believe, either in Durham or Nottingham University, did a considerable amount of research on pigs and one of the conclusions he came to was that there was nothing in the large white breed which could show a comparison with the landrace.  That was a general summing up by Professor Cooper, who has done a considerable amount of work and research in that area.</P>
    <P>I am not the person to decry what has been done, or to say that, because a thing is foreign, it is better than anything we have at home.  That would be a ridiculous assumption, but all the figures we have tend to point in the one direction.  Here is something that might interest the Minister and the farming Deputies in this House.  The Comtel Reuter Trade Report published on 14th April, 1956, gives a very interesting sidelight on the bacon market across Channel, a sidelight on prices of sides or as they were given in a recent trade report on bacon prices. They quote Danish sides at 326/&mdash;that was Grade 1 or Grade A; Home (English), at 320/-; Northern Ireland, 318/-; Dutch, 316/-; Republic of Ireland, 310/-; Polish, 304/-.  Is that not a very disturbing&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you the original report.  It is a quotation from a trade reporting organisation&mdash;Comtel Reuter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not talk about <Col N="849" /> the quantity.  Are we not in the position that, out of quotations from six producers, we are second lowest on that list for Grade A?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you the report later.  Danish Grade 2 on the British market fetched 6/- more than we got for our Grade A.  Is that not something we cannot run away from?  In other words, as far as the British retailer is concerned, he regards Danish Grade 2 as a better selling proposition to the retailers than our Grade 1.  I warn the Minister and every farming Deputy in this House that we should concern ourselves about where our pig industry will be, if we start to develop the large white&mdash;how long will it take us?  Conservative estimates given to me in regard to getting into a competitive position indicate that it will take us 15 years.  That has come from people who have the information.  Where will our pig industry, our pig producing industry, be in 15 years?  What are the prospects of building up a permanent pig industry here if we do not do something, and do it rapidly?  We must do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will get away from pigs and get back again to bulls.  Here is a report of a recent progeny test in England. First, let me say in relation to bulls and to the purchasing of bulls, I am not a bit happy.  Our Department officials go to England to purchase bulls every year and they bring those bulls in here.  First of all, let me say that to purchase a bull from a catalogue is a form of madness and, if you want to do the job as it should be done, if you fancy a certain bull in the catalogue, the simplest thing to do is to get back to the farm of production and try to get some line on the economics of the feeding on that farm and, if possible, see the bull's dam.  These are all factors in the purchase of dairy bulls.  So far as I know and so far as I have been informed by people at the other side, our Departmental officials have never been given that opportunity. As far as I know, within a few days of the live-stock sale, the official is sent across to the sale when <Col N="850" /> he should be there a month or five weeks before.  In fact, it would pay us if we had a permanent or semipermanent official at the other side, engaged in assembling data or investigating bulls which might appear on the catalogue at any sale.  It is a most dangerous business to go into a sale and buy a bull from the catalogue. You must see the bull's dam and find out something about the economics of feeding on the farm on which that bull was produced.  I would urge on the Minister to accommodate the live-stock section of the Department in every way he can and give them every opportunity of getting that information before sales.  It is a well-known fact that we have bulls in our artificial insemination stations here of all dairy breeds&mdash;I am not singling out any breed&mdash;sired by bulls which are now rejected in England as depressing yields over there.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious position.  I am told&mdash;I have no reliatble figures but I do notice on this report&mdash;that the sires of some of the bulls that are now in use in artificial insemination stations in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We know that the nearest we can go towards getting a proven bull is to get the son of a proven bull from a high milk-yielding dam.  That is as near as we can go when we cannot buy proven bulls.  These are two factors we have to watch out for and, again, there is the economy of feeding on the farm from which the bull is purchased and the yield of the dam.</P>
      <P>Dairying is of vital importance to this country despite the fact that some people say nobody wants an exportable surplus of dairy produce.  That outlook is begotten by defeatism. That outlook is begotten by the fact that we have failed to keep our place as competitors in the British market for dairy produce.  We will always have that trouble until we have dairy cows that will give us a yield of milk that will bring us back as competitors on the butter market or on the dairy produce markets in England.  We shall never have a substantial increase in our cow population until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot get away from the fact that the whole foundation of our agricultural <Col N="852" /> production is centred on dairying. Even our beef industry is based on dairying.  There cannot be any worthwhile expansion of our beef industry until we have an expansion of our dairy cows.  The fount is there. Beef is a tributary of the dairying industry.  When it comes to agricultural production, anything else is just a mere trickle.  The two supporting props of our whole agricultural economy are dairying and the production of store cattle for beef.  Those are the two major items in our agricultural economy and, no matter what the Minister says, we cannot substantially expand our beef industry until we have a considerable expansion in the number of our cows.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently been going round the country preaching a certain doctrine in relation to the suckling calf.  If he talks about a suckling calf he should talk about a &ldquo;sucker cow&rdquo; because, as far as the small farmer is concerned, that it what that cow would be.  She would suck the life blood out of the small farmer's agricultural economy.  We know that you cannot have a beef industry based on small farms.  You cannot have a beef industry unless you have the broad acres, because it is one of the lowest forms of agricultural production: it gives the lowest output.</P>
    <P>I will try to give some indication of the fallacy of the Minister's argument in advocating the suckling calf and the &ldquo;sucker cow.&rdquo;  Let us examine, for instance, just a few rough figures which I worked out here.  I come from one of the biggest dairying areas in the South of Ireland.  There is a creamery there which has ten branches extending into three counties.  When a survey was made a number of years ago it was estimated that the average size of the farm, measured by its cow-carrying capacity, was a nine-cow farm.  We know that, even on fairly good dairying land, it would take four statute acres to carry a cow and her follower and produce some feeding and hay for the winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister <Col N="853" /> should not look over his glasses at me.  If you study our dairying generally, you will find that it is not as high as that figure at all on those farms that are purely dairying farms.  They do not carry a cow and a follower to every four acres.  I know, from my association with the small farmers in the area, that it is tillage grazing and that it is not God's grass.  They are people who farm on rotation and who have fairly better than average grazing.</P>

      <P>We should examine the difficulties.  I am sorry if I have surprised the Minister.  However, when the Minister was advocating a &ldquo;sucker cow&rdquo; he did not think for a minute of what the impact of the &ldquo;sucker cow&rdquo; and her following would be on a small farming economy.  Even some concentrates would have to be procured at the end of the year to finish and winter the calf.</P>

      <P>An acre of barley converted into pig meal would give a figure of about £50 per acre.  Deputy Donegan can contradict me if I am wrong.  A fair return for an acre of barley converted into pig meal would give you about £50.  We will get back even to the Pekinese&mdash;the Jersey cow. There are Jersey cows in the South which give a return of between £50 and £60 an acre.  They would be a much sounder proposition than the sucker cow suggested by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh will give us an idea of what you might expect in regard to an acre of beet.  He knows more about beet than I do.  In my field the farmer would certainly be doing much better with his acre of ground than he would <Col N="855" /> with the Minister's sucker cow.  I will leave it at that.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to produce figures which will give the honest to God small dairy man in the South something in the region of what he would get from an acre of barley.  If the Minister produces that he will be taking something out of the hat.</P>
    <P>I did not mention depreciation in the cow at all.  We have figures to show that the lactation life of a cow is something like three years.  These figures have been given.  Let the Minister contradict me if he likes.  I am not a statistician, but I cannot avoid noticing that the lactation life of a cow is given as three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If they take the Minister's advice on the small holdings in the South a lot of them will go to Grangegorman, fully certified at that. Can the Minister prove to me that a little dairy farmer on the Galtee foothills, keeping that sucker cow, will do better than he would if he grew an acre of barley and fed it to pigs or if he grew an acre of beet or an acre of wheat?  The life-blood of the smallholder is his income.  The Minister now suggests to have him turn to that form of agriculture which assures him <Col N="856" /> of the lowest possible income per acre.</P>
      <P>There is a very serious situation facing the dairying industry in this country.  The chocolate crumb industry at the moment is in a very untenable position.  We know that if they go back into the British market for chocolate crumb, they will go back as competitors.  The previous agreement ended last year.  We also know that, for 1955, the British had a surplus over their liquid requirements of milk for industrial purposes amounting to 334,000,000 gallons.</P>
      <P>That huge surplus is there to be converted into a milk product which is a most profitable one.  From what we know and as far as we are aware, chocolate crumb will take a considerable proportion of that milk for manufacturing. The position of our chocolate crumb industry as competitors in the British market is a rather untenable one.  We know that, as a dairying country, if we fail as competitors in the British market for one milk product, we will ultimately be out as competitors for the whole lot.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the pattern that has evolved here, there has been an enormous waste of capital attached to our dairying industry.  Our dairying industry developed on the basis that dairying should be a satellite subsidiary of the beef industry.  That left us in the position that we have not the gallonage that would permit us to go back as competitors.  Any time we have gone back to the British market we went back to supply a <i>pro tem</i> need in cheese and milk powder.  When competition came and normal imports were resumed, we were hurled out. We could not compete.  Then we went in for chocolate crumb for as long as we had the protection of an agreement. When we lost that, we were out again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That all adds up to one thing.  There has been a considerable waste of capital and energy in our dairying industry.  In regard to the chocolate crumb industry, hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on the erection of buildings and on the importation of modern machinery and technicians. Now, they find themselves in the position that the whole thing goes for scrap.  It was in use for a few years. <Col N="857" /> Is that not an enormous waste of capital?</P>
    <P>Now the creamery managers are in a dilemma.  They do not know in what direction to go.  Some of them think there might be a few years in milk powder.  The chocolate crumb machinery is now hurled out into the scrap heap and a new set of machinery for the manufacture of milk powder is required.  Is that not very much the position of the dairying industry from the point of view of going into the competitive market?  There are many creamery managers who say that casein is something that would last. But in relation to this whole matter, regardless of what Minister is in power and regardless of what kind of propaganda speeches are made, we know that unless we develop a certain type of cow, unless we reach a national average comparable to that of our competitors, then we are out, once we have to face a competitive market.  We have only one alternative, to look for a subsidy for the exportable surplus of our dairy produce.</P>
    <P>We must face the problem of the enormous waste of energy and capital in relation to the dairying industry, not being able to remain in any particular milk product in a particular market, switching from one milk product to another and ending up by being pushed out of the market for all milk products.  That situation was begotten by those who thought that we could produce beef here and at the same time produce from our dual purpose Shorthorns a cow that would give a milk yield, competitive with that of our opponents in the British market.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in this House on a previous occasion, I gave facts and figures and a considerable amount of data in regard to the various milk breeds.  I argued and produced facts and figures which were not refuted and they were to the effect that if we developed the right type of Friesian here we could get a quicker and higher milk potential than we could hope to get from Shorthorns, that we could get a first class store, a store capable of being finished under a good grazing economy here at two years or slightly over.  We do know also that on the <Col N="858" /> English market Friesian beef is very acceptable, in so far as it is lean beef. Nobody now wants fat of any kind and I think we should seriously review our position in regard to dairying.</P>
    <P>We talked here a few years ago as if the market in England for beef was going to be a lasting one and that there was a huge demand there for all the beef we could produce.  Are we so sure now as we were two years ago? At that time Peron was in power. Peron's row with the British had cut off the Argentine beef supply.  But here are some recent figures.  Until next July, the Argentine has contracted to export into the British market 20,000 tons of chilled beef a month.  That is equivalent to 65,000 cattle a month.  My friends over there, people who are on the administrative side, tell me that that beef is first quality, and in a recent letter one particular man said to me that there were queues outside local butchers' shops trying to purchase that first quality Argentine beef which was being sold at from 1/10 to 2/2 per lb.</P>
    <P>Despite all the nonsense about newspaper reports depressing cattle and beef prices, we know that when there are increased imports to England of first-class Argentine beef, those huge imports are bound to impact themselves on the dead meat trade with England and we can naturally expect a drop in beef prices if those imports are to be continued.  These are facts which we must examine and all the talk about a certain newspaper taking the bottom out of the beef market is just nonsense; the reports in question had very little if anything to do with the beef market.  Of course, those facts will not be stated when somebody from that side of the House wants to make a propaganda speech. There is too much political nonsense talked here instead of the facts being made known to those people concerned in the production of beef in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to our farm buildings scheme, a considerable amount of money has been expended in the erection of farm buildings, and a considerable amount of money will be spent within the next five or six years for <Col N="859" /> that purpose.  That will be accentuated as we develop the scheduled areas for the eradication of bovine T.B. I do not know whether other Deputies are of the same opinion, but if you travel through the country, amongst the small farming area in the South, one of the things that will strike you is how little has been done for the small farmer in the way of replacing the rambling shacks you will see in the small farmer's yard.  I give as the main reason for that the fact that if the farmer is entitled to a £60 grant, say, for the erection of a cow house, to qualify for that, he must be in a position to raise £300 capital.  The strange thing is that the people who have made the most use of farm grants are the people with the strongest bank accounts.  The little man who has no bank account, or no spare money, will have to look across the fence if his neighbour has a large farm and see this man availing of every grant because he has capital to invest.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider revising the whole grant system in respect of farm buildings and to have the grant system on a sliding scale; in other words, to have a much higher grant for the little fellow with the low valuation and to grade it down for the man with the high valuation, thus giving the small man the advantage.  He has no capital; he will have difficulty in getting capital and for that reason he will have difficulty in utilising the grant.  If the grants could be operated in that way, I think we would have a swing about and the little man could benefit by this scheme. Under the present system, the whole thing is being snapped up by the man with the strong bank account while the smaller man must look on.</P>
    <P>Again in connection with farm buildings and with any other scheme for the future, when we have all this money to expend by way of grants and when we have decided to spend this money, is it not about time we had some planning authority?  Is it not about time that we would have somebody trained to go to the farmer if he decides to build a new cow-house, and say: &ldquo;Would you erect it there <Col N="860" /> because it will mean, as far as you are concerned, economy of labour?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no one to give advice in that direction and we have seen some of the new houses erected in the most disadvantageous positions in relation to the man's residence.  There should be some planning authority, somebody who would be able to give advice on the erection of farm buildings in relation to economy of labour.  All these things impact on farm production.</P>
    <P>On the bovine T.B. scheme, we know that one of the most potent sources of T.B. infection is unpasteurised skim milk.  Every vet. in the country will tell you that it is utterly nonsensical for a farmer to tuberculin-test his cattle and try to eliminate reactors if the local creamery has not installed a pasteurising plant.  I would urge on the Minister, as a preliminary to the eradication of bovine T.B. in those areas outside the scheduled areas, that he should make available to every creamery manager a grant for the installation of a pasteurising plant.  That is an important preliminary as far as the eradication of bovine T.B. is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of bovine T.B. eradication which must agitate the mind of everybody who has anything to do with livestock.  I shall refer to it in a minute.  We know that there has been most extraordinary and rapid progress made in the eradication of bovine T.B. in England.  When I was in England last September, a person who was in a position to know told me that in five years, if they could get sufficient vets., they would completely clear the whole country of bovine T.B.  That statement was extremely disturbing because it meant that, as each area was attested and as each area was declared free, there was a <i>cordon sanataire</i> set up around the area, and our non-attested store cattle would be excluded from that area.</P>
    <P>I will give some indication of what the situation was at that particular time.  I have told the House that it was the belief of this particular administrative official that, if they could get an increased number of veterinary surgeons from the veterinary <Col N="861" /> colleges, they would have the whole country clear of bovine T.B. in five years.  It will give some indication of the progress they have made and of the ever-reducing area into which Irish store cattle can be exported, when I say that all Wales is now an attested area or a free testing area.  Anglesea, Carnarvon and Denbighshire are free testing areas; the remainder are attested.  In Scotland, the only outstanding areas are small areas comprising the counties of Aberdeen and Angus, Kincardine and part of the county of Perth.  One can realise the huge area that is being done in Wales and Scotland.  In England the counties Cumberland and Westmorland are now declared to be completely attested areas.  Free testing areas are Berkshire, Hampshire, Yorkshire, Kent, East Sussex, Wiltshire, Devon, part of North and West Riding, Yorkshire, and parts of Oxford and Buckinghamshire. Practically all areas south of the Thames are now well on the road to attestation.</P>
    <P>Is that not a serious situation in view of the little progress which we have been able to make in the eradication of bovine T.B.?  Is it not a serious situation, when we realise that the main producing areas of store cattle are the dairying areas in the South, that we cannot declare that any fraction or part of that main dairying area is free of bovine T.B.?  We are lagging behind in the race.  We came into it too late.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Milk Costings Commission, I want to say very little. I did refer here to Parkinson's Law earlier in the debate.  Parkinson's Law produced a mathematical formula for the growth of the Civil Service, but we had to wait for the Milk Costings Commission to get a unit of measure by which we could measure their output. That was the first time we got a yardstick <Col N="862" /> by which we could measure the output of a Civil Service group.  Consider the position in which the Minister has been placed.  They have virtually told the Minister and the farmer to go to Hades, that they will give the report when they like and when it suits them, despite the fact that over £30,000 of the taxpayers' money has been expended. That is all I shall say on the Milk Costings Commission.</P>
    <P>I have on a previous occasion referred to our agricultural economy. One of the things that we do know is that the small farmer is being crushed out.  The Land Commission publish reports showing the number of holdings which they create every year, but that is only one side of the picture.  Twice that number are being liquidated.  The small man is disappearing from the face of rural Ireland and he is disappearing for one reason only, that there is the same economy for the smallholder as for the man with the broad acres.  We have no small farm economy.  The small farmer can only survive on a specialised economy.  That is why I am so interested.  The small farmer is not concerned about the production of store cattle.  He is concerned about the provision for him of that cow that will assure him of the highest income, that pig which will give him the biggest margin of profit. That is why all this business of the right cow in the right place and the right pig is so vital.  The proper cow and the proper pig to the smallholder assures him of the title deeds to survival.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why he is disappearing and any Deputy who is travelling throughout the country will see the ruins.  It is a continuous process and I am always inclined to think of a certain ballad when I contemplate the situation.  The ballad says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There's where the children played games on the heather,</P>
    <P>There's where they sailed their wee boats on the burn;</P>
    <P>Where are they now; some are dead, some deserted,</P>
    <P>No more to their homes shall those children return.</P>
    <P>Is it not all very much the story of the small man in rural Ireland?  Does not <Col N="863" /> that summarise the position of this country of ours as far as the small man is concerned?  There is all this depopulation because our economy never provided for the small man the title deeds to survival.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on this Estimate and I am getting a bit hoarse. Still there are many things to which I should like to refer, but I am afraid I have subjected the House to an endurance test.  One of the things I, as somebody who has his roots in the soil of this country, would not like to see is that any Minister for Agriculture, no matter who he was, would become the &ldquo;Sir Echo&rdquo; of any particular Government. Anything I have said in this House has not been of a political nature.  I have tried in the main to offer constructive suggestions.</P>

      <P>Now, now, Deputy Giles. I have said some things but as far as I am concerned my major contributions to debates in this House have been on the Minister's Estimates.  This is in fact the third debate to which I have contributed.  I am not afraid to say unpopular things.  If there are forces at work which might blast me out of Dáil Éireann I shall be glad to resume where I left off.  I never want to be an old lag, to fade out as the glowworm of a political twilight.  I do not want to go that way.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy Moher, I do not propose to delay the House by a very long contribution on this Estimate.  I was very interested in quite a number of the things Deputy Moher said.  Perhaps in the heat of the moment he may have made one or two slips which he would not have made had he considered the matters more fully.  I personally would not be prepared to accept his figure of a 334,000,000 gallons surplus in England. I think there is something wrong there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moher made a reference to the Milk Costings Commission.  Coming from a rural district I would like to see the farmers getting a fair return for their labour, a fair price for their milk.  I would, however, make the suggestion that if some of the big guns of the association, who are kicking up such a row about the price of milk, took the trouble of checking the wages they are paying to some of their employees, not alone in the production of milk but in the production of other things, they would blush with shame, rather than march at the head of 16,000 men marching in O'Connell Street.  Perhaps that has nothing to do with the Estimate but I should like to make the remark in passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention the fact that I think, as well as giving the farmers a decent price, the farm <Col N="865" /> workers should get a decent wage.  I think the present wage fixing machinery &mdash;the Agricultural Wages Board&mdash;is outmoded.  We find that the members are prejudiced one way or the other. There is no appeal from their decision. I think the time has come to change that machinery.  Perhaps when the board was set up, the Government who established it did a good day's work; perhaps order was made out of chaos. Now, however, we have reached the stage where we are slipping further and further behind and, if the £ is losing its value for everybody else, it also loses its value for the worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Your advice is not needed.  Keep that for the kindergarten. The whole question of farm workers' wages was something which was to be overhauled by the present Government.  I would appeal to the Minister now to see that is done without any further delay.  It is useless talking about the flight from the land so long as we have farm workers with a family, or without a family, still trying to exist on less than any other <Col N="866" /> type of worker in this or any other country.  The minimum rate of £4 9s. a week, which will be increased to £4 16s. for many parts of the country, is not a wage but a disgrace.  It is no answer at all to say that farmers can pay more.  The fact is that the Agricultural Wages Board set up by the previous Government fixes a minimum rate of wages which is recognised as the standard rate.  It is not the standard rate, but it is recognised as such.  We want to see something done to have that changed, and changed quickly.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, who, I know, is a reasonable man.  I know it is not his wish, no more than is it the wish of anybody else in this House, to see people attempting to live after a hard week's work on such a miserly pittance as that being paid to the agricultural worker in this country at the present time.  I have heard it said by people down in the Minister's own constituency of Monaghan that, if you leave nationalism out of it, it was a pity they came across the Border at all because, in Northern Ireland, they could get almost £7 per week for a shorter working week than that for which they are paid £4 9s. in Monaghan.  I think it is about time that position is changed, and it can only be changed by changing our machinery for fixing wages.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about changing the Agricultural Wages Board as soon as he possibly can to give a fair deal to those men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted by everybody here that the small farmers of this country seem to be getting a pretty raw deal; but some of the blame must lie with those same small farmers themselves, who are inclined to take advice from politicians who advise them to change from one crop to another and from one agricultural economy to another.  Then, if that does not produce the results which they hoped it would produce they can say: &ldquo;The Government is to blame.  Why did the Government not do this and why did the Government not do that?&rdquo;  The small farmers in my own constituency are finding it pretty hard to live at the present time. Over the years, they have been trying to live on uneconomic farms.  I know <Col N="867" /> it has nothing to do with this Estimate, but I think an awful lot of the fault lies with those people who will not make their farms economic when the question of free allocation of land arises.  I think that the one solution to this whole problem is to provide economic farms for as many as possible first, before more uneconomic farms are created in any area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is, but I just wanted to get it in.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that at last a decision has been taken to improve facilities for the men working on some of the State farms.  I made a point last year, and the year before, that it was rather a pity, while money was being spent on stabling and everything else around those farms&mdash;very necessary expenditure, I admit&mdash;that we had groups of 20 or 30 men with no cooking or other facilities around the place they were working.  I am glad that has been taken care of in this Estimate.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, as I did last year, that every possible help should be given to fruit growers, particularly those in the areas where soft fruit is grown.  For a number of years, those people have been put in a very awkward position, because certain groups of manufacturers have created a ring and waited until the last minute to offer less than the fruit was worth and put the people in the position that they had to sell it at a price which was not economic.  The result is that many of them have given up growing fruit altogether.  I would suggest that, if the Minister can in any way assist in the fixing of a fair price for fruit, that should be done early in the season and so prevent this ring from taking advantage of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is so, because, two years ago, I introduced an outsider who was prepared to buy fruit from these people at 2½d. per lb. more than the ring were offering.  Immediately the ring found that they were not going to get the fruit, they jumped their price to the same figure.  That proved to me that the only answer was to have some kind of alternative market.  If the <Col N="868" /> Minister can be of any assistance in that way, I think he should be, particularly in view of the fact that over the past two years quite a lot of fruit was imported at very high prices from the Channel Islands and other places. A lot of that could have been grown here, if the people had been given a guaranteed price in time, so that they would know they were going to get the price and not have to wait until the fruit was on their hands and ready to be sold.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest again that something should be done with regard to the apple crop in this country.  I do not know about the South but, in the northern end of the country, we have the same difficulty year after year. Apparently the crop cannot be preserved and we find that, from just immediately after Christmas right until the next apple season, we are buying apples which are imported from all over the world&mdash;and that in an area where the best apples that can be found are grown.  Apparently, because of the fact that they are not being preserved&mdash;there is no way in which they can be preserved&mdash;they are not available when they are needed.  I saw myself people down in the Duleek area selling apples at less than a penny each and later on in the season buying apples which were certainly only as good and not much better for 6d., 7d. or 8d.  It does not make sense.  If the Department can assist in this matter in any way, they should.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the matter I mentioned here last year and which the Minister treated with contempt.  I would ask him to have second thoughts on it.  It is the matter of tobacco growing in this country.  I think his remark last year was: &ldquo;I grew it; I cured it and, God help me, I smoked it.&rdquo;  I did not grow it; I did not cure it and, God help me, I did not smoke it.  But I have some documents, which I would be glad to make available to the Minister, from experts from some of the tobacco growing countries.  They state that the tobacco, which was grown in this country before, if it received the correct treatment, is equal to the finest Virginia tobacco.  If that is so&mdash;and they are prepared to pledge their reputation that it is so&mdash;I think there <Col N="869" /> is no reason why we should not do something about it.  Even if it is not so, I think the Department might assist even in a small way by making available loans of, say, £100, which would enable those people to set up their tobacco growing business again. I know it might interfere with the Exchequer, but, at the same time, I think those people should be given the chance to prove, as they say they can, that not alone can it be smoked here, but that it can be exported, and so provide them with a livelihood, even though it might not be the finest in the world.</P>

      <P>When I, the last of the three Deputies for East Cork, rise to speak here this evening, I think you, Sir, and all the Deputies in the House might well be pardoned for posing the question: &ldquo;Is there anything left for an East Cork man to say?&rdquo;  We listened to Deputy Corry here for an hour last week.  We listened on two days and again to-day&mdash;altogether four and a half hours&mdash;to Deputy Moher talking on agriculture. While, if I had not listened to them, my remarks might have been directed in a different way, I want now to state here to-day categorically that it is my belief, no matter what Deputy Moher says, that he opposed the parish plan here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to prove by his own statements&mdash;I have here Volume 156, No. 5 column 676, of the Dáil Debates of last week&mdash;showing that the first thing Deputy Moher did, when he got the circular from the Department of Agriculture, saying that a parish agent was appointed to two Cork parishes and one Waterford parish, namely, Conna, Ballynoe and Ballyduff, was to make five carbon copies of that circular and send them to (1) the Secretary of the N.F.A. movement; (2) the Secretary of the Mitchelstown Co-operative Creamery; (3) the Secretary of the Castlelyons Co-operative Creamery; (4) the Secretary of Macra na Feirme. I think he said he sent out five, but he sent out only four.  I am suggesting that Deputy Moher, when he got out that circular, thought that the best way to organise opposition to the <Col N="870" /> parish plan was to set all these people talking.  I must say here, Sir, that I have nothing but the greatest confidence in all those bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher also remarked that he thought that the Cork County Committee was one of the best county committees of agriculture in the country. That circular was to come before the Cork County Committee on a Tuesday, but Deputy Moher decided that the representatives of the different bodies I have mentioned here should have it also, with the result that, before the Cork County Committee could discuss the matter, the gallery of the courthouse was filled by the representatives of those organisations.  I think that Deputy Moher would have been much wiser to let the Cork County Committee discuss that document in a cool, calm atmosphere first, and then, if those people thought they had something to say to it, the Cork people would have given them an opportunity of saying it another day.  When Deputy Moher states that he did not make any opposition to the parish plan in Cork, those statements which I have quoted must put the lie to that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, when I quote a little further from Deputy Moher's speech, we will see why he thought that representatives of these bodies should be present on the day this circular was being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moher apparently had some very strong objections to a body for <Col N="871" /> which I have the greatest regard, that is, Muintir na Tíre.  I quote from the same Volume&mdash;column 681, Deputy Moher said, when asked by the Minister to give the cross-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will give you the brains trust and then the ballast.  You have the local parish priest, unless he is too senile, and then he is usually represented by the local curate as chairman. You have the dispensary doctor and the local solicitor, the Civic Guard sergeant, the local grave digger, the water curator, the sewerage caretaker and the local maternity nurse.  They are the people who constitute the brains trust of any normal guild of Muintir na Tíre, with a few old doddering farmers thrown in to nod.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the end of the quotation, but I notice that he did say later on that he was reminded that he had forgotten to mention the school teacher and the home assistance officer.  I happen, at the moment, to be the senior Deputy for East Cork and I want, at this, the first opportunity I have had, to stand up here on behalf of the people of East Cork and on behalf of the guilds of Muintir na Tíre and say that most decent-thinking people would not stand behind that statement for one minute.</P>
    <P>I think, having said that, that it is only right that I should say what I think of Muintir na Tíre.  While we can say nothing bad about the other organisations mentioned, Muintir na Tíre was founded long before any of them.  As a rural organisation, it has done a great deal of good work. Deputy Moher pointed out that Muintir na Tíre was a rural organisation but not an agricultural organisation.  It is hard to see the difference.  It would take someone like Deputy Moher to say that.  Here we are with the rural organisation which is a voluntary organisation.  It is an organisation that has, at least, done work by voluntary contribution, without asking for Government aid and if we had much more of that kind of work and organisation in this country, and much more local work being done by local people on a voluntary basis, we would be doing the right thing, rather than <Col N="872" /> always putting out our hands for State help.  It is a sad thing when we have a man like Deputy Moher, under the protection of this House, making such an attack on an organisation which is purely rural and voluntary and which has done immense good in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher went on to say, and I could not but agree with the Minister when he interrupted to say that he heard this three or four times before, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You cannot effectively operate a service in an area when you have organised oppositions as was evidenced when this matter was being discussed in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Volume 156, No. 6.  The only opposition to the parish plan in County Cork was some kind of bias that some people had against Muintir na Tíre. When the parish agent went there some six or seven weeks ago, there were several meetings called in the three parishes.  All farmers of different political views attended those meetings, and they were told what would happen if they co-operated with that parish agent.  I am glad to tell the Minister now that if an army of inspectors came down there now to try to put that parish agent out, he would not be let out of that parish.  It will be a long time before he is let go from those three parishes, no matter what kind of opposition there may be to having him there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter referred to pilot farms and advocated setting them up.  Personally, I have no use for pilot farms. They must be financed by the Department of Agriculture and that means that, when they are short of money, they can send for £5 or for £100 to the Department.  What the average farmer wants to know is what he can do with the resources at his disposal and not with those at the disposal of the Department.  That is the reason I believe that the parish agent is an ideal solution for the problem of spreading the advisory service.  I think it is the best and only way that the research work done by the Department can be applied to the farmers' farms.</P>
    <P>It is not usual for me to stand up in <Col N="873" /> this House and to speak in the way I have spoken and to name a Deputy so much as I have done to-day, but I was, unfortunately, put in that position by the statements that were made.  I want to assure you, Sir, that, while I have mentioned Deputy Moher's name, it was in no spirit of antagonism to him personally, but just because he had made statements which were not actually in accordance with facts and I should take the first opportunity of trying to contradict them.</P>
    <P>There was one point that I wanted to bring to the Minister's notice, and it may be awkward in one way.  I have noticed around the country that, if there was anything that did great good for the farmers, it was the land rehabilitation scheme, or the land project. That is admitted on all sides of the House.  The difficulty I find in the working of it&mdash;we must, maybe, put the blame on another Department&mdash;is that where you have acres of land which farmers are anxious to drain and lime they are prevented from doing so by the county councils not first draining the streams into which these lands might drain.</P>
    <P>There should be some liaison between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government in that direction.  I know personally large tracts of land which are being held up from being drained owing to that snag.  I suggest that the Minister should consult with the Minister for Local Government to see if these difficulties can be got over.</P>
    <P>One thing which has surprised me is that I have not found any mention during this debate by any Deputy last week or to-day of the disease we had in wheat last year, which was a cause of severe loss to many farmers in East Cork and Cork generally.  I refer, of course, to the disease known as rust.  There were experiments conducted subsequent to the harvest as to how this disease might be controlled or eradicated, but we have not heard anything from the Department since as to the success or failure of those experiments. Can we say to the farmers that they will not have the same losses this year?  If the Minister has any <Col N="874" /> information on that, it might be a help and some consolation to the farmers to know that, whatever they may have, they would not have this disease that they had last year.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that a resolution, which I sponsored at the Cork Committee of Agriculture with regard to the grading and price of pigs, got so much support here.  I know that the problem is difficult, but I do believe one thing&mdash;and I say this as a retailer of bacon&mdash;that if the bacon curers grade their pigs A, B and C, and pay a certain price for the bacon in proportion to the grade, they should, when selling that bacon to the retailer, have those sides marked A, B or C, and adjust the prices accordingly, so that the retailer can pass that on to the consumer.  Mind you, it is not hard to satisfy people, and the farmers themselves would be satisfied if they knew the reduction they were getting in the pig grading was passed on to the consumer. Knowing what the Minister has done with regard to grading, I still feel that he should do something about that snag which still remains, and take more effective steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any Deputy in this House can talk on all the different aspects of agriculture with any kind of certain knowledge and authority, so I have referred to pigs, and wheat, and the parish plan and my belief in its working.  With that I can only wish the Minister, in his drive for increased production, the best of success in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are any defects in our agriculture they are due to lack of education.  I am glad to see that the Minister is looking at it in that perspective, and is doing his utmost, through his officers, to give a wider pattern of education to the agricultural community of this country. Our agricultural education should start much earlier than it does.  It should start at a very early age, not when the primary school education finishes.  It would be a good idea if there could be some arrangement between the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education on agricultural matters so that we could start our agricultural <Col N="875" /> education much earlier than we do now. By that I mean that even our textbooks and all our books in primary schools should have an agricultural bias.  I remember in my young days going to the primary school, and our textbooks and readers contained much interesting matter relating to agriculture.  It appears that this system has been departed from.  That is a mistake. What you want to do with the young people, farmers' sons, is to bring them up in an agricultural environment, and to do that you must start in the primary school.  The very day they go to school, if they are in a position to read, some subject should be put into their hands to read which relates to agriculture. Then they will grow up in that environment, and show as they go along an aptitude for agriculture.  I know that the Minister and his Department are making sound, good, practical efforts to educate the farmers, but generally we should give an education with a markedly agricultural bias.</P>
      <P>The parish plan has been mentioned by nearly every speaker in this debate. I think it was an exceptionally good move.  It is right for the Minister to make available for the farmers an agricultural agent who would advise them.  The scheme deserves an immense amount of support and credit from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to see throughout this debate, as far as I have heard or read it, that in my opinion it has taken on a new look.  The people on the Opposition side of the House have approached this debate in many cases in a very reasonable way.  I was very much impressed by one rather lengthy speech I heard, by Deputy Childers. His speech was a masterpiece, as far as agriculture was concerned.  He put up something very constructive and did not attack the Minister or his policy.  He was helpful and constructive in his criticism and advice to the Minister.  That is the right approach to agriculture.  On all sides of the House there should be some kind of agreement and constructive proposals should be put up on which the Minister and his Department could act.  I am glad that that change has taken place <Col N="876" /> in the House, and that we have departed from the aggressive attitude which used to be adopted on this Estimate in previous years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his ambition to educate the farmers, has proposed to establish an agricultural institute. With certain reservations I am entirely in favour of that.  My reservations are these, that he may propose to erect the institute, perhaps, in or about Dublin. I am not quite sure but that it may be, perhaps, for convenience sake that it will be centred in Dublin&mdash;for the convenience of the teachers, the professors and the instructors.  I have not the slightest objection to that, but I would advise the Minister, if he does decide to centre it in Dublin, to have some other institutions established throughout the country in each of the provinces, because, in each of the provinces, a different type of agricultural economy is practised.  For instance, in the West, you have mixed farming; in the South, you have dairy farming and in the Midlands, you have the beef and cattle industry.  For that reason, I think there should be subsidiary institutions established which could forward advice to the central institute established in or around Dublin.  I think that would be very essential and very necessary, because our ideas come into conflict so often.</P>
    <P>People in the South of Ireland who go in for dairy farming, whose economy is principally milk and whose stock is generally cows do not quite understand what our problems in the West are. Now, our problems in the West are more concerned with grass and the production and the raising of store cattle, plus pigs and poultry.  In the Midlands, as I have said, they concentrate more on the production of beef. For that reason, I would say that there should be some kind of subsidiary institutes established in each of these areas &mdash;in Connacht, in Munster and in Leinster and that part of Ulster which is under our control.</P>
    <P>I was rather astonished by one Deputy here making what I call a vicious attack on some of the organisations that have been established for the improvement and betterment of rural Ireland and, in particular, the agricultural industry.  One Deputy <Col N="877" /> from Cork, Deputy Moher, made an uncalled for attack.  I hold he is a very intelligent man and I was more than surprised at him, because of the uncalled for attack he made on one organisation in particular, an organisation which I hold in the highest esteem, namely, Muintir na Tíre.  That is an organisation which cannot be attacked and which cannot be criticised.  That organisation has done more than anything else in rural Ireland to unite the people and give them an opportunity of exchanging views as between different sections of the community.  It is an organisation which, regrettably, started rather late in this country.  It is one of the organisations that can truly voice the feelings of the people in rural Ireland and I was astonished and shocked that any Deputy should attack that organisation.  In my opinion, it has come to stay.  It will expand and it will increase in numbers every day.  I wish it every success.</P>
    <P>There are other organisations associated with Muintir na Tíre.  There is Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association.  I hold that all these organisations or associations are good from an advisory point of view, and should be supported and encouraged. I think it is the intention of the Minister and the Department not to support merely by lip-service, but rather in a practical way.  It has been proved already that the Minister has done something in a practical way to encourage these organisations and associations to carry on the work they have initiated and it is regrettable that any Deputy here, irrespective of what Party he belongs to, should try in any way to belittle the services these organisations are giving the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>The land project, conceived by the Minister and implemented by him, is one of the finest schemes ever started in this country.  An immense amount of good work has been done under it already and I hope that good work will continue.  I refer to the good work of bringing lands that were waste and derelict back into production.  It is the aim of all of us to make the land produce more.  That was the purpose for which the land project was initiated <Col N="878" /> and I think it was one of the finest measures ever passed in this House.</P>
    <P>As in all other human concepts, there are certain difficulties which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I do not know whether I am right in saying this, but it is my opinion that the biggest mistake ever made in this country or by a native Government was made at the time it was decided that the Government machinery would be sold.  I think that was a calamity.  It was a grave mistake. Nowadays, people are more or less at the mercy of contractors.  While those contractors are doing very good work and giving their services very freely in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country which are being neglected.  Now it is quite natural to expect that any man who purchases heavy machinery, costly and expensive machinery, will try to recoup himself for the cost of such machinery at the earliest possible date. Naturally enough, such a man is tempted to embark on big schemes, with the result that the smaller schemes are left untouched.  I know that principle applies in certain instances.  First of all, the machinery these contractors have is too heavy to go in on some fields.  The farmer who wishes to have reclamation done with the aid of the Department is not in a position to provide the labour; and the small farmer in Mayo who wants to reclaim five, six or seven acres has neither the labour nor the time.  He looks to the Government to send in a contractor.</P>
    <P>I know that in many cases the contractors are refusing these jobs, with the result that this poor man is left lagging behind; he cannot get anyone to do the job.  I would suggest that some light machinery should be made available through the Department to these people.  I think that would be a good idea, because, after all, the small man, the man with the £20 and £30 valuation&mdash;and there are more of them than there are farmers with higher valuations&mdash;should receive every support and every encouragement and, not being in a position to do the work himself, should be assisted to the full by the Government and by the Department.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the land project, <Col N="879" /> there is the ground limestone scheme.  That scheme is being availed of to a considerable extent in my part of the country and the results are quite obvious.  Looking at land which has been dressed in the past two or three years, no one needs proof of what lime has meant to the land in this country.  Some of our lands have taken on a new look as a result of the ground limestone scheme, and any farmer who does not avail of that scheme&mdash;remember, he can have lime delivered to his door at 16/- per ton&mdash; is not, I am afraid, doing his duty to himself, to his land or to his country.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word or two about fertilisers.  Fertilisers would be more freely used by the farmers, if the price were more attractive.  I know that people have got to become fertiliser-minded in many parts of the country, but the price at which fertilisers are now selling is altogether staggering and people are unable to purchase them.  Even though the Government, the Minister and his Department have been generous as far as grants and subsidies are concerned, I would recommend to the Minister that he should further consider the granting of a subsidy for the purchase of fertilisers. If we continue in the present desultory fashion, it will take too long to bring our land back to fertility.  If we give all the encouragement that should be given, we will in our lifetime see many more acres in production than are in production at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should be much happier standing up here to-day and speaking on this Estimate if the cost of the Department of Agriculture was twice what it is to-day. Some people may say that that is very ambitious; that we want all for agriculture and nothing for anything else.  But we must all be alive to the fact that agriculture is the predominant industry in this country and, where you have a failing and declining agricultural industry, all other industries must go by the board.  I would not be one bit afraid to make this statement in any place in Ireland: I would much rather be here to-day supporting this Estimate, if the Estimate were millions of pounds more <Col N="880" /> than it is to-day, because it means putting money into something that is worth while and which will give a return for the money invested during our lifetime at least.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, as a matter of interest, and as a matter which affects my constituency, as the Minister knows well, something about the future prospects of the cattle trade.  I do not want the Minister to be a prophet and tell me what is going to happen this day 12 months, but I know he must have an interest in the cattle trade, just as I have myself.  We in Roscommon are engaged in the production of stores for the British market.  That market has been despised by some sections here in the past and when we were told that it was gone and gone forever, it was a sad thing.  However, it has come to life again, but when the Fianna Fáil Party were the Government of the day&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;I always felt they had a prejudice against the cattle trade.  I always felt that was the case, although I could not, for the life of me, see why there should be such a prejudice.</P>
    <P>After all, it is a business that has stood on its own feet without subsidy, grant or anything else.  The stores trade has been carried on through good and bad days, through the economic war and the times that came after that.  I think it is one of the industries that is a credit to us and it should be catered for and looked after. I should like to know if the Minister has any idea&mdash;because the farmers are interested, naturally, in prices&mdash;of what may happen to the cattle trade in the future.  My own personal opinion is that, if we produce the right animal, we will always have a market for it, but I will say that the day of the heavy beast of 12 or 14 cwt. is nearly finished.  I suggest that what we should aim to supply in the years ahead are the lighter weights of beef cattle and I would say that what we should cater for in the years to come would be the Aberdeen Angus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.  A Shorthorn heifer may be very valuable, but a Shorthorn bullock of a certain class is not so valuable.  If a farmer is lucky enough to have a heifer calf, I would advise the farmer to keep it, but that does not happen always.</P>

I would recommend to the Minister, if this is possible, that he should devise some scheme to subsidise Shorthorn calves. That is a tall order, perhaps, but I think it would be a step in the right direction.  I am even inclined to go a little further and say that the farmer who took his cow to a Shorthorn bull and had a heifer calf should not be permitted to export heifer calves of that class to England for some time, because there is a growing scarcity of heifer calves in the West of Ireland.</P>

However, that is a suggestion I wish to make to the Minister, in the hope that it might be worth adopting to encourage the breeding of heifer calves, which should be stimulated, I think, by something in the nature of a subsidy.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, I spoke here on the rates on agricultural land.  The Ceann Comhairle may say that may not be relevant, but I now want to suggest to the Minister that he should have a conversation with the Minister for Local Government and impress upon him the necessity for increasing the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  That is not a function of the Minister, but I would ask him to use his good offices to try to get that grant increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to do that now.  On the whole, the progress made in agricultural matters for the past 12 or 15 months is encouraging and I think that, with a little time, the present Minister will be able to have his ambitions realised.  He is certainly an ambitious man, and I am glad we have such a man in office to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to where I started, I am also glad to note that the speeches from the opposite side&mdash;with the exception of a few speakers&mdash;have been made in a dispassionate manner and <Col N="883" /> that the people on the other side of the House are displaying a better and keener interest in the agricultural industry. Without making any harsh criticism, I think that is a good sign that we are travelling in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Quite recently, an interesting thing happened in my county with regard to bonuses to agricultural employees of agricultural committees.  I understood the Minister made an Order authorising the payment of those bonuses.  I am not quite sure of that, but I would like to know if the Minister has made such an Order, because it would clear the air very much.  There is a little bit of conflict between our county committee of agriculture and our county council on that matter.  The Minister for Local Government has not, it appears, made a similar Order, and if he had, it would make things very much smoother in Roscommon.  Quite recently, in Roscommon, our officials made an application for this increase and we adopted a different scale from that recommended by the Department, a sliding scale, somewhat more moderate than was recommended by the Department.  A very short time afterwards, we had a meeting of the agricultural committee and we were told it was mandatory on us to adopt the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not mandatory&mdash;I think I am wrong there.  I shall deal with it when I am concluding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cause of confusion in our county.  On behalf of my constituency, and on my own behalf, I hope the present agricultural policy will be continued.  If that policy is pursued for the remaining years of our term of office, and if we get the co-operation of the Opposition&mdash;we have had a certain amount of it during this debate&mdash;the agricultural industry in this country will progress still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate on a very important Estimate and it is more important still when we bear in mind the warning we have received that, unless we increase production, we are doomed.  I fear the Minister himself <Col N="884" /> will have to shoulder some of the blame for the present position of our balance of payments.  The reduction in the price of wheat has been responsible for a big gap in our balance of payments.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to ask farmers to increase production, but how can they do so when production costs are rising and when prices are not rising in accordance with these increased production costs?  I think it was Deputy Tully who said that if some of the leaders of the farmers who paraded in the milk dispute would pay a decent wages to their workers they would be doing a better day's work.  I do not know what wages they were paying, but surely Deputy Tully must agree that, when farmers' prices are coming down and when farmers' costs are rising, they will find it impossible to increase production.</P>
      <P>Consider the position in the industrial sphere.  If the workers demand an increase in their wages and if the increase is granted, then the impact of that increase is borne by an increase in the cost of the manufactured article. When, however, the farmer looks for an increase in the price of his produce, in order to compensate him for the increases that have taken place in his costs, he is told to double his output. Why is that not the attitude towards industry and everything else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to hear Deputy Deering criticise the growing of wheat. He said that we do not export wheat and his outlook seemed to be that, as we do not export it, we should not grow it at all.  He also compared the amount of labour given in County Kilkenny with the amount of labour given in County Cavan.  I live very near County Kilkenny.  Take an average farmer who might grow 20 or 30 acres of wheat and follow that up with perhaps ten or 12 acres of beet.  Then, again, there are other root crops, too. That is good farming.  It is obvious that we cannot save those crops without increased labour.  I am surprised by the speech made by Deputy Deering. He said we were not exporting wheat, but I would point out to him that we are exporting human beings.  One of the biggest mistakes the present Minister for Agriculture ever made was to <Col N="885" /> offer an increase of 2/6 a barrel for wheat to meet increased costs.  The National Farmers' Association and farmers in general are not satisfied that an increase of 2/6 per barrel will meet the increase in their costs.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the education of our farmers.  It is suggested that more agricultural instructors and agricultural advisers, and so forth, are required.  In my opinion, that type of thing can be carried too far.  Our farmers to-day are not illiterate and, what is more, they know how to work their land to the best advantage.  It would be much better for all concerned if some of the money which, it is boasted, is spent on giving education to our farmers were devoted, instead, to helping the farmer to produce more.  At present, the small farmer cannot increase his production, because the costs are too high.  There was a time when he could make a livelihood for himself and his family by the growing of wheat and through the pig industry.  Everybody knows that for the past few years the pig industry has been on the decline. If you buy a bonham at the market to-day, you will pay £6 or £7 for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk about expecting increased production. I want to relate that to the position of small farmers.  I have proof that lack of credit facilities for small farmers is having a severely adverse effect on their economy.  I have seen <Col N="886" /> clear instances of it myself.  I visited an institution to which a farm of about 300 acres is attached.  There have been improvements there in the line of houses and fertilisers.  That institution can carry out such improvements, but the reason is that the State and the ratepayers are helping them to carry on.  Sometimes you hear talk to the effect that such and such a man can double his output while another man cannot.</P>
      <P>There was one scheme of credit for farmers which was operated through the Department of Agriculture, but which was transferred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am sure every Deputy knows it is not easy for a small farmer to get a loan.  I know a small farmer who sought a loan of only £100. He had three or four small cattle which he wanted to keep as they would be worth twice their value at that time in another few months.  That man was refused the loan.  We are told that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is there to help the farmer.  It is not.</P>

      <P>I heard a lot of talk about grants.  There may be certain grants which will not help production, grants in connection with the building of piers or the cutting of bushes.  The drainage of rivers would do more to help to increase production.  I know of some cases where farmers cannot avail of the land reclamation scheme. There is not enough money spent on the drainage of the main rivers and if the amount spent on the roads were spent on the drainage of rivers you would have better results.  This would give the same amount of employment.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Walsh was speaking, I heard Deputy Fagan say that he preferred to see the cattle going out on the hoof.  I should not like to support Deputy Fagan's statement and I am sure there are other Deputies here who would not support it.  We have a good meat factory in Roscrea but, if we are going to ship cattle on the hoof, it will be a great drawback to that factory which is closed for some months in the year.  It is closed at present.  If we close the factory altogether, what will happen?  I do not agree with that policy.</P>
      <P>As regards grants in respect of improvements and water supplies to houses, complaints were made to me in regard to a farmer who some time ago filled the usual form.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a reduction in the acreage of potatoes last year. I wonder would the Minister start a scheme in regard to the production of certified seed potatoes on bog land? The scheme could be something like that which we have in regard to the sugar company on Bohoola Bog.  If some of these bogs could be utilised, it would be of great help in the growing of certified seed potatoes.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister made one of his biggest mistakes with regard to increased production by reducing the price for wheat.  At a meeting last Monday in the Leix-Offaly area, the Minister said that if the farmers had not the money they would not have bought tractors but the tractors were either got from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or on hire purchase.  It may look bad that the farmers had to do that.  The reduction in the price of wheat hit these people very hard and some of the machines will have to be thrown on the wayside.  A lot of them will have to be sold second-hand at scrap prices.  One of the biggest strokes of hard luck to befall the agricultural community was the reduction in the price of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear quite a lot about the money spent on agriculture but the amount spent on agriculture is very small in comparison with that spent on research in industry.  We are inviting gentlemen from other countries to speculate. I am not against the establishment of industry but more money is spent on industry than on agriculture.  The price of fertilisers is very high and Deputy Beirne wanted subsidies for them.  Did he think of voting for subsidies?  He did not help when he went into the Lobby and voted for the reduced price of 12/6 per barrel for wheat.  Farmers, <Col N="889" /> on the average, lost between £200 and £300 each.  With that money they could have purchased fertilisers.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper, the Minister suggested the acquisition of land for the growing of certain cereal crops and for demonstration plots.  I see thousands of acres in the Curragh whose appearance is no different in winter or summer.  The same amount of grass is there all the time.  There you have good land growing furze.  If that land were taken over, it would be very suitable for a pilot farm.  Indeed, it could be divided up but that is not a matter for the Minister.  We are asking other people to increase production and put their land in good heart.  But here you have thousands of acres.</P>

      <P>The fact that this Estimate has been discussed for five different days proves the wide interest taken in it.  That is only natural when you reflect on the fact that agriculture is our basic industry and that on our exportable surpluses from agriculture we have to depend for raw materials to keep agriculture itself and other industries going.  Of agriculture, our live stock is the most important side and of live stock our cattle industry must take pride of place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years our cattle trade was the one thing that sustained our people.  It would be an unpardonable crime for anybody, here or outside, to say or do anything that would jeopardise <Col N="890" /> that great industry which is so vital to the interests of the Irish nation.  If our cattle trade were to collapse in the morning, I see nothing but doom for this country, so dependent are we on it as the main industry to sustain our people.  The most significant thing emerging in recent months was the decision of the Minister.</P>

There were two years' experience before that that his predecessor had; his office has had the three years' experience, and I think one further year of experience would be quite sufficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister's case is that he should go on trying the system.  To go on trying the system, in which there are admitted faults, for six years is asking a bit too much, and I should like to suggest to him that he should seriously consider changing the period mentioned in Section 1 and making it shorter, that, instead of making the Act run for a further three years, he should cut the period down.

      <P>I am merely suggesting that the Minister should not close his mind at the end of the Second Reading debate.  He still has three stages of the Bill before him.  It is quite possible for him to change his mind.  I was hoping by my eloquence to persuade him, that, having regard to his knowledge and experience, a further year is sufficient.  I do not think he needs three more years' experience in which to make up his mind about any necessary change.  I think he should indicate that now by limiting the period for which the new measure would run to one year, rather than to three years.  I know that, at the end of a year, it will be possible for the Minister to bring in an amending Bill, ignoring this one, but I think it would satisfy the House more&mdash;there have been criticisms from both sides of the House&mdash;if they knew that an amending Bill would have to be brought in in a year's time.  The Minister should take cognisance of the arguments made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Chair has ruled that one cannot discuss the details of the administration of the principal Act, or how it worked, or what difficulties one found in it, or what objection one has to it.  That is for Second Reading. The Second Reading debate is there in black and white, and objections and suggestions were made, and I think the Minister, in view of those and in view of the fact that the agricultural community is disturbed about this, should indicate to the House and to the agricultural community that he is prepared to change the dates that are mentioned <Col N="898" /> in Section 1 and limit the period of the Bill to one year, instead of three years.</P>

      <P>I entirely support what Deputy Sheldon has put forward, because it has been pointed out, not alone to the House but to the public at large, that there was to be a testing period of three years for this.  If the Minister wants 12 months to go into it, take 12 months, as the Deputy has suggested, and carry on then, but I would like to hear from the Minister if he has any knowledge, or has got any information from his Department, as to the effect of this Act as far as local authorities are concerned.  In reply to me, the Minister stated that there is a saving to the State of £100,000 the first year.  I want to know what the saving would be for the second and the third year.  I think we are entitled to that information when the Bill is being renewed for three years.  We have not got it.  I want to know whether this statement made by the Minister for Defence that the State would get £300,000 every year is correct.</P>

      <P>Section 1 says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953 (No. 36 of 1953), shall have effect in relation to the local financial years ending on the <Col N="899" /> 31st day of March, 1957, the 31st day of March, 1958, and the 31st day of March, 1959.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am submitting that, before giving that lengthy period of three years, we should have a knowledge of the effect of the changes that were made in this Bill&mdash;the effect which the continuance for another three years of the 1953 Act would have.  We know, according to a reply to a question of mine a fortnight ago, that it has the effect in the first year of a State gain of £100,000.  What would the State gain in the second year?  What would the State gain in the third year?  We are entitled to that information.  I want to know whether the Minister for Defence was right in his statement in 1953.  I want to know if the Minister for Finance was right and whether Deputy Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, was right.  I want to know whether the present Minister for Local Government is now being turned out and used as a doormat by the Executive Council, as Deputy Dillon stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is the continuation section.  Under it the Act of 1953 is continued for a further three years. I gave the reasons why it should not be continued for three further years and why the House and the agricultural community should know immediately the effects such a continuation of the Act would have.  I endeavoured to relieve the Minister of that trouble by putting down a question, but the officials of his Department were so busy that they were not able to make up figures, although we were assured by a previous Minister that the whole effect would be put before us after the first three-year period.  That information has not been given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister assured me that the knowledge was not in his Department a fortnight ago.  That is the reason why we are very loth to give a further <Col N="900" /> three-year period to this.  We require an assurance from the Minister that the period will be for only 12 months. If he gives us that assurance, he will have no further trouble in getting the Bill through.  We do not want to hear the financial geniuses on the opposite benches standing up and saying that, as the years go by, the farmers will get less out of it and the State gain more.</P>
    <P>It was alleged here that the farmers were gaining £500,000.  I am under the impression that the farmers should have got £1,000,000 out of this.  We are pressing the Minister for the information I have mentioned.  I want to know if the farmers of the country are being done out of as much money as was alleged by the present Minister for Defence, by the Minister for Finance, by the Minister for Local Government and by the Minister for Lands, when they sat on these benches. They got up here then, one after the other, and stated the Bill was brought in specially to rob the farmers and the local authorities for the benefit of the State.</P>

      <P>I have given my reasons why I want this information.  If the present Minister for Finance knows anything whatever about financial figures, surely there was some basis for the argument he put up here against this continuation in 1953? Rates have gone up by 5/2 in the £ in my county this year.  They may go up another 5/- next year and we want to know by how much the farmers will benefit and how much the farmers will lose as the Act goes into its second and third years.  I think the Minister should have had this information at his fingertips before he brought the Bill in.  Can he give the figures now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has given certain criticisms of this section. He is merely parrot-like, repeating the <Col N="901" /> views given from this side of the House when we were in Opposition. Despite those views, the Deputy was one of the first into the Lobby to vote for the Act of 1953.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with Deputy Smith, when he introduced the Bill, that this measure was entitled to be given a trial.  Deputy Corry says now that the Act of 1953 has proved what we stated it would be and that we should end it.  I say, as I said in 1953, that Deputy Smith was entitled to have his Act experimented with, so that its benefits and its disadvantages could be considered.  I am in full agreement with Deputy Smith that his measure should be given a trial. Deputy Corry now says it has got a trial and that it is a failure.  In fairness to the Opposition and to my predecessor who introduced the Bill, I want to say it has not got a fair trial. It must get a fair trial in order that we may consider whether it should be amended or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I said in my Second Reading speech of 22nd March:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The employment allowance may be claimed only in respect of a man at work during the whole of the calendar year preceding the relevant financial year.  The 1953 Act which applied to the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55, and 1955-56 did not become law until the 23rd December, 1953.  Hence the Act could not have affected the number of employees until, at the earliest, the calendar year 1954 and claims in respect of those employees did not arise until 1955-56.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us give the Act a trial.  Deputy Sheldon made a fair suggestion that if, after one, two or three years, the continuation of the Bill is not a success, it is quite simple to introduce an amending measure.  I think, in fairness to my predecessor, the Bill should be given a fair trial.  It has not had that.  We have not had a full experience of the benefits, if any, which may be expected from this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the duration of the Bill which is governed by Section I.  It is on that particular section that Deputy Corry spoke.  If we find out that three years is too long a period it is quite simple to amend Section 1 by bringing in an amending Bill.  In deference to what was said by Deputy Corry and his Party and particularly by the Minister of the day, we must give it a fair trial.  Deputy Corry now says the Bill is a failure. That is not fair to my predecessor.</P>

He will not get a chance of dealing with it in that manner in the House.  My statement was that we were entitled here to get the results of the three years from the Minister and his Department.  We have not got them.  We want to know whether the statements are true or not.  I have not said they are true.  I realise that, when a Bill is put through this House for three years, it is very difficult to amend it during those three years. Deputy Smith, as Minister for Local Government, asked for a three years' trial.  The Bill has got the three years' trial.</P>

      <P>I am embarrassed when the Minister says it in that disarming way.  There may have been bouquets, but not quite the particular set of flowers as is in this one.  The Minister has shortened the period of the Act to be amended by talking about the date on which it passed the House.  Everyone knew for some time before the Act passed what the provisions were to be, so that to say there has not been three years' experience already is just nonsense.  The Department has three years' experience of the provisions of the Principal Act. The Minister very kindly said something about my having suggested that we could amend it to one, two or three years, but I want to limit it to one year.  I think four years' experience is more than enough.</P>

Even if the Minister had said he would give serious consideration to the <Col N="905" /> objections made, we would feel happier, but so far his line has been merely that all the Opposition are now shrieking about is something they have passed themselves.

In spite of what some of the Deputies behind the Minister said about Deputy Corry being the first man to vote, the principal Bill went through without a division. Let us be quite clear on that. No one is disagreeing with the principle at all.  I am suggesting that a sufficient case was made on the Second Reading for the Minister to take serious notice of it.  If he is not prepared to amend the Bill, will he even say that he will give immediate consideration to it and that there will be active consideration given to bringing in an amending Bill within the next year, and that he will not just let it rest at this and look for a six years' trial for Deputy Smith's original thought?

      <P>I should like to see the Minister for Agriculture stay here and see his colleague become a doormat for him, but he has gone.  I am not satisfied with the three-year period. It was pointed out from all sides of this House in 1953 that this Bill and this section needed amendment at that time.  It was pointed out by Deputy O'Sullivan, the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Bill should be amended then by putting in the 12-month period.  Other Deputies pointed out the same thing.  That section has continued as it was since that time and now we are asked to continue it for three years more.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Minister that 12 months is quite sufficient for him to get his Department to wake up and give him some information about this Bill and its effects, this Bill for which he is asking a further three-year period.  I should like to know from the Minister whether he intends amending Section 10 to provide for only one year instead of three.  I do not think we are looking for too much. It would give us an opportunity, in the next 12 months, of endeavouring to get together all the complaints that have been made as to the working of this employment section throughout the country; it would also give us an opportunity of endeavouring to improve on it.  Surely we are not asking too much of the Minister in asking him to limit the Bill to 12 months instead of three years, so as to give us an opportunity of examining the Bill, seeing that his Department has gone to sleep since he went into it and has not got the information we require.</P>

      <P>I can see no reason why the Minister should not agree with the suggestion put up by Deputy Sheldon that the Bill be continued for only 12 months, and in the meantime let the Minister take the matter up with his Department.  I suggest that the Minister, before he brought in this Bill in its present form, should have had for the Deputies of this House the information to which they are entitled and which they have not got.  That is the effect of this Bill, as compared with the previous Bill, as far as the ratepayers of the country are concerned. He has failed in his duty in not giving us that information.  I am endeavouring to save him from the effects of his foolishness.  If he wants to save himself from the effects of his foolishness as regards the period of operation of the Bill, he will make it 12 months, instead of three years, and then he will have those 12 months in which to consider the matter.  Surely <Col N="909" /> 12 months is sufficient for the Minister to get the information with which his Department did not supply him, and give it to this House.  I am again asking the Minister whether he is prepared to help to have the Bill for 12 months, instead of three years.  Are we going to get an answer to that question?</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will now give the information he wishes to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to that question, I replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is assumed that the Deputy wishes to be informed as to what amount of agricultural grant would have been paid to the Cork County Council and to local authorities generally if the system of distribution provided for under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, had applied to the financial years 1953-54 to 1956-57.  This information is not available and to obtain it would necessitate its being calculated by each local authority concerned. An estimate prepared in my Department in respect of the year 1955-56 would indicate that in that year the new system of distribution of the Agricultural Grant resulted in a saving of approximately £100,000 to the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On my Second Reading speech, I said, and I have already quoted this on the section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The employment allowance may be claimed only in respect of a man at work during the whole of the calendar year preceding the relevant <Col N="913" /> financial year.  The 1953 Act, which applied to the financial years 1953-54 1954-55 and 1955-56, did not become law until 23rd December, 1953.  Hence the Act could not have affected the number of employees until, at the earliest, the calendar year 1954, and claims in respect of those employees did not arise until 1955-56.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the Deputy will appreciate that we have had only one year's experience, namely, claims which have arisen in the financial year 1955-56.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving the facts.  I think Deputy Smith asked a very sensible question when he asked me why I was not able to give the information.  I have explained now why I am not able to give it; and the only reason why I am asking for an extension of the Act for another three years is to enable us to study the position and see if the Act should be amended, as we suggested it should when we were in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a further question?  When the original Bill was introduced, I remember the discussion that took place.  I remember that, as a result of the attitude of this House, amendments had to be proposed to that original Bill.  I am not able to say whether or not what the Minister claims now is completely accurate, but it was then possible for me in a very short period to find out from local authorities&mdash;as a matter of fact, not only was I able to do it but Deputies were able to find out in a week or two &mdash;the effect these proposals would have on local bodies.  That being the case, I am surprised now that the Minister finds it so difficult&mdash;in fact, he claims it is impossible&mdash;to procure figures, the procurement of which, I think, should be a very simple matter indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember that the Deputy's original circular of May, 1953, was amended.  That circular proposed a £13 allowance, and then there was a rough-and-ready estimate made of that.  For reasons I need not go into at this stage, that was eventually amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was calculated from the rate at that time.  I can assure Deputies, if this information was available, I would make it available to the House.  I have no reason for cloaking anything.  The Act is not mine; it is Deputy Smith's Act of 1953.  It was an Act I criticised, and if I could find any information that I could give the House to fortify my criticisms, I would be only too pleased to do so, but I am not able to procure that information.  I have given the House all the information that is available to me and further than that I cannot go.  That is the only reason that I ask for an extension of this time.  If the Act is not the success which Deputy Smith suggested it would be, then let us amend it, but let us give it a fair trial and put democracy to work and see what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What fair trial does the Minister want?  It was passed by this House in 1953.  It operated for the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55, 1955-56, that is, for three years.  The Minister was able to give me figures for one year.  Surely if local authorities were able to give members of the Opposition figures to show what the gain or loss in each case would be, and were able to give those figures in the course of a month to both the Minister and members of the House, the Department itself should be able to know what the loss was to the local authorities in 1954-55 and in 1955-56.  Those are the figures we are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that any question of amending the measure does not now arise, as we are now on the last stage, and that is that.  There is a good deal of talk about losses or gains to local authorities.  I suppose no local authority, as such, either gains or loses.  The ratepayers may gain or lose, but a local authority, as such, neither gains nor loses.  The amount of money passed in this House for the relief of rates does not affect the income of the local authority; it merely affects the source from which it gets its income, so that any talk about gains or losses is purely beside the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to come in again after we have had the discussion, but I think the Minister is exaggerating when he speaks about the experience needed.  A change in agricultural wage rates would knock the whole thing out, and, if we had 20 years' experience, it would be of no use to us.  The only thing we can gain is a knowledge of the relationship between the employment grant and agricultural wages&mdash;does the employment grant increase agricultural employment or does it not?  As I say, we are fixing it now for three years.  The Minister talks about gaining experience, but with the first change in agricultural wages, all the experience is gone for nothing and the figures must be gone into again.  Clearly no experience is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>But I am talking about the ratepayers.  Every ratepayer knew in six months what the effect would be. Those whose valuation was high lost because it would be quite impossible for them to employ enough men to <Col N="916" /> qualify for the supplementary grant. Nobody with a big valuation could possibly employ sufficient men and consequently everybody knew those with big valuations were bound to lose.  I cannot see that experience could tell any more.  I am sure the Minister is perfectly honest, but I do not know what he is talking about when he is looking for years ahead to find out what will happen.  The whole thing is: how much is the State prepared to give to subsidise rates on agricultural land? That is merely a matter of the generosity of the State or of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to say to the Minister there is no reason why the passage of this measure should be held up at all, so far as I am concerned. Apart from the point made by Deputy Sheldon, of which we can all see the force, I suppose I must accept the Minister's assurance that these figures that I would have expected would be given were not available.</P>
      <P>I must say that I am hesitant about accepting the assurance that the Minister has given, and it was because of that fact and because of his hesitancy and because of his refusal to give the information that Deputy Corry sought, that I really thought it was no harm to have a division on the matter.  There was no enthusiasm for this measure when it was being considered in 1953, and, when there was a request that its lifetime should be limited to a further year, there was some argument to be made having regard to the coolness of the reception the Minister gave the Bill then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should remember the purpose of this Bill.  The main purpose behind it is to encourage farmers to give full-time employment to the farm labourers.  In talking about experience, I am talking about the experience which has been gained under the Act and I am referring to employment experience.  We will not <Col N="917" /> have the 1955 figure until October next and that should be realised.  May I point out that it was not until December, 1953, that this Act was passed by the Oireachtas and employment is calculated for the calendar year, so that therefore we got the first experience of the Bill for the year, 1954 in 1955 and for the year 1955 in 1956.  But the grant as distinct from employment relates to the financial year and we, therefore, have given the House the information for the only financial year that has been experienced, that is 1954-55.  I can give the figures for employment under the Act, and there has been very little change, but Deputy Corry and the rest of us, when discussing this matter, should remember that the main purpose behind the Bill is to encourage farmers to give full-time employment all the year round to their employees.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say any more than that about it.  Deputy Corry gives an explanation and he talks about lawyers.  Well, it was a lawyer's explanation he gave me about full-time employment of labourers down in County Cork.  But Deputy Moher did let the cat out of the bag.  There have been methods of driving a coach and four through Acts of Parliament and Deputy Moher has given the farmers of Cork a very good method of doing it. Then he does the ordinary country attorney and says: &ldquo;I know nothing, but I am saying this.&rdquo;  That is what he did.</P>

I gave the only information I had when he and Deputy Corry put down the question on 10th April.  We must remember that the employment problem is the serious problem and that it was the reason why this Act was introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Smith.  We have only one year's experience and we are trying to give the Act the benefit of a fair run.  That is the only reason why I am asking the House to continue it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say, when progress was reported at 7 o'clock, that the most important decision given here in recent months by the Minister was the decision to reestablish the export trade in live pigs. I think that decision is welcomed by the country.  It should give a great stimulus to the bacon industry here and it should help to stabilise bacon prices&mdash;prices that have been fluctuating so much in recent months.  It may not give all the help we anticipate it will, but at least the Minister must be congratulated on his efforts to restore our export trade in live pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grading system has been criticised very considerably here.  I have no doubt that much of the criticism is justified, but the Minister has provided for the producers an officer in each bacon factory to supervise the grading of bacon pigs.  He was co-operative to that extent.  If it has not given the <Col N="919" /> desired result, at least he made an effort to give the producers what they wanted.  I think it is not so much the type of pig that is at fault as the actual feeding.  The change-over to different cereals and rations in recent years has been such that some people have not become fully accustomed to it.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the Department should, in a series of advertisements, publish alternative rations for the production of lean bacon.  The fatty bacon is not the fault of the producers.  The fault lies in their want of knowledge and experience in the handling of rations to which they were not accustomed.</P>
    <P>The National Farmers' Association has been mentioned.  It is well that, at last, the farmers have been organised into a vocational body empowered and competent to speak for their own vocation, just as all other vocations in this country are organised.  It is gratifying that the Minister has been willing to meet and consult with them already on matters of vital importance affecting farming.  I hope he will persevere in that attitude and that there will be mutual confidence between the executive of the National Farmers' Association and the Minister and his Department on matters that are very vital to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes spoke about wheat. I agree with him that the gap in bushel weight and price in the present system is too great&mdash;that the prices should be regulated on a pound basis each way up or down.  I assume, from what I have heard, that the Minister has recently had talks with the National Farmers' Association and that something will eventuate from the talks.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say we should produce our own requirements of feeding barley.  The present Minister for Agriculture must get credit for having introduced feeding barley into this country.  Apart from its value as a cash crop, if we turned over to the production of feeding barley toi meet our requirements it would save us considerable dollar expenditure and reduce our balance of payments.  There is no reason why we <Col N="920" /> should not produce our full requirements of cereals and coarse grains in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to seeds for export.  Again, the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated in that matter.  If we have seeds which are being sought abroad it is a very good sign that our management and harvesting conditions are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to ground limestone.  It is a very important factor in the production of cereal crops and particularly in the production of feeding barley and malting barley. However, I must concur in what Deputy Corry said.  I cannot understand why C.I.E. rake off a certain percentage on every load of lime hauled from the limestone quarries. It is enough to kill initiative and competition.</P>
    <P>Credits have been mentioned.  Our production is low for the want of capital. For generations, the average farmer has had to struggle for existence. He never seems to be able to reach the point that would make him independent of fluctuations, the point that would give him so much independence that he could afford to put a part, or a great part, of his capital into increased production.  In a country where agriculture is the predominant industry, I see no reason why there should not be some system of credits to aid people who find the capital system difficult.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up, but ordinary people will get better terms from the commercial banks than from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, where the conditions are very exacting and the rate of interest very high. In an agricultural country, there should be at least cheap credits to aid the basic industry.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of production in this debate.  I agree with the Minister that our only hope of increased production lies in cattle, sheep and pigs.  I am afraid, however, the factor that will most adversely affect our production in the coming year and in the years that lie ahead will be the high rates on agricultural land.  Our farmers have to compete with their confrères over the Border, where they have derating of agricultural land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> They have to compete with farmers in Great Britain, where agricultural land is derated.  I know the Minister has no responsibility for this.  I think there should be collective Cabinet responsibility. The fact that we have had Rate Relief Bills passed in this House shows that rates on agricultural land are unjustifiably high and that some effort has been made to give relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree: I was pointing out how the rates would adversely affect production.  The Agricultural Institute has been discussed.  Here, again, the report from both the National Farmers' Association and Macra na Feirme is comprehensive, detailed and constructive and is well worth study.  This came at a very opportune time and I hope the maximum use possible will be made of it.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister and his Department will not embark on the erection of buildings here to house that institute.  I think we have enough of that already.  I see no reason why our universities would not handle the institute.  They have the personnel, or at least the greater part of the personnel. All they would need are a few experts.  They could divide the work of research between the different colleges of our National University, even with Trinity College.  That would obviate the need for any great extensions or construction in the way of buildings.</P>
      <P>It would enable the Minister and the Department to get the maximum use out of the money now available for this agricultural institute.  I think myself that the institute should be controlled by an autonomous body having liaison with the Department of Agriculture. In this way initiative would be encouraged and research would be embarked upon in the different spheres of agricultural activity in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few words to say to the Minister on this Estimate. I should like to revert to the evening the Minister came in, all in a flutter to introduce his Estimate.  We assume, anyway, that he was in a tearing mood, <Col N="922" /> as we say down the country.  He worked himself up into a white heat over the <i>Irish Press,</i> a reputable organ of news and information for the people of this country.  Not having anything good to report in the way of more agricultural production, more tillage of any kind, more cattle or more exports or, indeed, anything else, he had to have some diversion and he attacked an organ of the Press for reporting what were the facts&mdash;what were facts for probably four or five weeks before the <i>Irish Press</i> adverted to them. Other organs of the Press in this country like the <i>Independent</i> or the <i>Farmers' Weekly</i> referred to them. Even the <i>English Farmers' Journal</i> which circulates fairly extensively in this country had been reporting from early December the rapid fall in cattle prices on the English markets.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this country and across the water seems to be aware of that except the Minister for Agriculture. Everybody else seems to be aware of the fact that cattle prices had fallen as compared with last spring and early summer except the Minister.  In October, November and December they were down somewhat on what they were in the early part of the year.  It was difficult to get £7 a cwt. in October, and the price went down to £6. The Minister should have been aware of that.</P>
      <P>I notice in this Estimate that the Minister has made provision, apart from veterinary and other research, for 700 officers in his Department.  A good number of them are outdoor but I suppose the big majority of them are indoor.  For whatever reason, there are no officers attached to the Department of Agriculture engaged purely in market research in other countries as far as I can see from this Estimate.  I should like the Minister, when he is finishing the debate, to advert to that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister should, week by week and month by month, advise the farmers of the trend of the markets in other countries.  In addition to that, many of his staff should be engaged in finding better markets than are known at the moment to the farmers of this country.  The same <Col N="923" /> should be done in respect of traders or whoever they may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in describing them as alternative markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Alternative, if the Minister wishes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Or any other market.  The Minister should employ a good number of staff in External Affairs or Agriculture in Great Britain, continental countries, America and other countries to help Irish agriculture in regard to the trend of markets.  The information should be made available to people in the cattle trade in this country.</P>
      <P>After the harvest last year, two things affected the price of cattle.  The first of these was a certain scarcity of fodder in England.  More important still, there were huge shipments of Argentine chilled meat landed in Britain.  The shipments of meat towards the end of last year were three times and four times what they were in any previous year for a great number of years.  They were bound to affect the position.  If the Minister or his Department had that information, it should have been made available to the people of this country.  I think the Minister should be censured because of that.</P>
      <P>Everything in connection with agriculture last year was depressed.  Tillage was depressed.  There were thousands and thousands fewer acres of tillage last year.  That may be good enough for the Minister.  He is opposed to tillage and has always been opposed to tillage crops in this country.  He did his best, and the Government did its best, to prevent farmers growing wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>While every other possible type of products except farmers' products increased in price, and all types of wages and salaries increased, the Minister for Agriculture sat in a Government that set out deliberately&mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;<Col N="924" /> with due consideration&mdash;to depress and lower the farmer's income.  It was lowered in many ways.</P>
      <P>It was lowered because of the price fixed for wheat.  It was lowered because of the price fixed for feeding barley as compared with what was paid by the Minister's predecessor.  The Minister abolished the scheme which created a pool, whereby barley was bought on behalf of the Department of Agriculture at 24/- which was the minimum paid when Deputy Walsh was Minister for Agriculture.  The present Minister immediately reduced that to £1.</P>
      <P>Every possible effort was made to reduce the price of pigs with the result that farmers suffered a reduction of 20 per cent. in one 15 months in the number of pigs the Minister took over, as Minister for Agriculture, in May or June, 1954.  He had his colleagues fixing the price of bacon every second week.  The bacon factories, every time the price of bacon was fixed, either up or down, reduced the price of pigs.  The farmers were not such fools as to remain in production.  Economic circumstances drove them out of it.  Side by side with that, the Government were not satisfied to give offals of wheat, ground in this country, at the cost of production.  They put at least £6 a ton on to that.  In other words they gave the farmers the pig feeding at £6 a ton more than it was costing when Deputy Walsh was Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knew quite well at that time that the farmers could not produce pigs at the price they were getting; there was a 20 per cent. reduction in one year.  It is no wonder the Minister came in here attacking the <i>Irish Press</i> because cattle prices had fallen.  We, on this side of the House, did not blame the Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure if he had been over here and cattle prices had fallen as steeply as they did, over the latter six months of last year or the early months of this year, <Col N="925" /> he would have attacked Fianna Fáil because of that fall in cattle prices. We do not say the Minister could have done anything about it but he could have advised the farmers in the latter six months of last year that the indications were that the price that cattle had reached in May or June of last year would not be maintained.  If anyone was responsible for the non-publicity of facts, it was the Minister for Agriculture and there would not have been the great losses which farmers did suffer on account of bringing in their cattle in the early part of the grass season last year and having to sell them off at £2 to £3 a cwt. less. I think the most ridiculous public statement the Minister ever made in this House or anywhere else was advising the farmers on the 1st January to hold their cattle until April or May and he would guarantee they would go up to £6 a cwt.</P>

      <P>There was never a more childish statement.  If the Minister were dealing in stocks and shares and got advice from his broker to hold those shares, that would be all right; they were costing him nothing to hold.  But the farmer's produce is not dealt in like stocks and shares or on the advice of a broker.  When a farmer has fat cattle fit to sell, or store cattle that he must sell in January, February or any other month, he must bring them out to sell them.</P>

      <P>The Minister talks at the other side of his mouth about the farmers keeping pigs until they are too fat and unfit for use and people will not buy them.  The cattle which were fat in January would be bad news in the farmers' stalls on the 15th April. As some of the Minister's once most vigorous supporters said to me: &ldquo;I wonder will Mr. Dillon take over our cattle when we have them fat in the middle of January or will he give us £6 a cwt. for them?&rdquo;  The people were disgusted with him for making such a childish, foolish statement.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a spleen against some section of the Press in this country.  He attacks the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> one day and the <i>Irish Press</i> the next day.  He attacked the <i>Irish Times</i> in this House.  I think every journal that was ever printed is bad news to the Minister.  He just cannot take it.  His skin is too thin. Tillage fell; pig production and wheat production fell.  The number of cattle and the value of cattle exported fell, but the value of the cereals imported increased.  In the greatest crisis year since this State was established, what did the Minister for Agriculture do to help in that crisis?  He did everything in his power, as far as his Department was concerned, to make the crisis worse.  He did nothing at all to help agricultural production.  He imported £15,000,000 worth of cereals in that crisis of last year, when his colleague, the Minister for Finance, was almost demented because of the balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not export the same quantity of agricultural products.  Why did we not export as many pigs or as much bacon?  Why did the Minister do nothing to help the marketing of our chocolate crumb in Britain or help the export of agricultural produce that was there?  We would all like to see an increased production but the main thing that is in the minds of farmers every time you meet them at the fair or <Col N="927" /> market is this: &ldquo;If we increase agricultural production we are certain to have depressed prices.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting on record what has been said to me a thousand and one times by farmers and producers. They have no confidence whatever that the Minister for Agriculture or the Department of Agriculture are capable of marketing more agricultural produce if it is made available, whether it is butter or any other product you can mention.  That has been pointed out time and again and the sooner the Minister gets the majority of his 700 officers and applies them to the task of considering how better we can market increased agricultural production, the better it will be.  Nothing worth while will be achieved until that is done, until the farmers and the producers are confident that it will be marketed and you will not have the Minister coming in here roaring and bawling, as he did two years ago, about all the wheat that was produced when Deputy Walsh was in office, saying that it was a bad news crop because the farmers grew in the year 1954 so many hundred thousand acres of wheat.  It was a bad news crop for his colleagues, the Labour Party, and it was taken up by the organs of the Press supporting the Minister at the time that this must come to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the very same thing with pig production.  Farmers were doing too well when Deputy Walsh was in office. There was too much profit in pigs at that time and the number of pigs was increasing at a great rate, as also was the number of sows.  But within one six months, owing to the Minister's action in allowing his colleagues to increase the price of pig feeding by £6 a ton and to depress the price, by fixing bacon prices, which farmers or producers were getting, serious damage was done to that line of agricultural production.  There is no doubt that towards the end of the year in which the Minister took office, 1954, because of the steep fall from June to <Col N="928" /> November in the price paid for pigs, pig feeders lost tens of thosuands of pounds.  The Minister should have been informed and advised by his Department whose function it is to advise the Minister if any other Department of State does anything that is detrimental to the agricultural interest.</P>
    <P>There is a sum of £2,691,000 provided for the land reclamation scheme.  A question was put down to the Minister recently to ask him if he would state in respect of 1955 the total acreage of land reclaimed under Sections A and B respectively of the land project. Section A is the part of the scheme that was introduced by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Agriculture in the early '30s to give grants for the reclamation of land.  The same principle is still in operation although the grants may have been increased somewhat.  Section B was introduced in order that some of the American Counterpart Fund might be spent by the Minister for Agriculture and under that portion of the scheme the Department of Agriculture undertake to get the work done.</P>

The farmers did five times the amount that was done by the efforts of the Minister's officers who are responsible for the scheme.  That shows that Section B is not a success.  I would like the Minister to look into that and see if he could not give more encouragement to the individual farmers.  There may be some very big schemes for which machinery could be made available to the individual farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reduction of 3,000 acres under the B scheme.  I do not think that is very good.  We are supposed to have reached the peak by now.  Is it that there is no more land to be done under the B scheme?  As far as I know, under the A scheme there was a maximum of £30 an acre or two-thirds of the cost allowed to the individual farmer and, of that £30, £5 must be spent on manures.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in any of this.  Under the B scheme, as <Col N="930" /> originated by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, the farmer paid £12 and the Department of Agriculture paid the balance irrespective of the cost.  When Deputy Walsh was Minister he changed that and imposed a limit.  There was no limit on the original scheme under Section B. Deputy Walsh imposed a limit of £30 from the Department.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister in his reply has something to say about what steps he proposes to take on the matter of prevention of rust and white spot, two enemies of cereal growers.  If investigations are being carried out in that field, I hope the Minister will be able to tell us what progress, if any, has been made, as a result of these investigations.  We are told that the barberry bush is responsible and would the Minister consider having that bush compulsorily eliminated in this country?  I have heard it has been eliminated compulsorily by Governments in other countries.  I think the Minister should have the opinion of scientists as to whether the barberry bush is responsible for these diseases. If so, he should take steps to have it eliminated compulsorily.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the grading of pigs.  I feel sure the Minister is aware of the effect which grading has had on production. Roughly 50 per cent. have been graded A and a top price is available for them.  The other grades are unprofitable and I feel sure everybody will agree that the introduction of grading did damage to pig production. Perhaps in the long run grading is the best system, but the Minister might have taken other steps before introducing grading.  Take a batch of about ten pigs.  Five or six may be Grade A, but the balance, all of which have been fed with the others, will be relegated to other grades.  The other grades will realise smaller prices and, on the whole batch the farmer will make small or no profit.  That will affect his production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is producing grade C or X pigs, he would do much better to go out of production because he will lose money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows, from tests carried out and from the <Col N="934" /> report he gave the House, that 73 per cent. of a batch of pigs graded A and the others were graded B and C.  The Minister had the best possible expert advice and I feel quite sure the batches of pigs chosen for that test were most carefully selected.  Anybody could pick a batch of bonhams at a fair and be sure of getting a reasonable chance of getting 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the batch to grade A.</P>

The problem is a serious one, because roughly 47 per cent. of all the pigs returned to factories grade other than A.  These were the figures given to me quite recently by the Minister. I think 54 per cent. graded A.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>And what is the difference in price between A and B? It might mean the difference between a profit and a loss.  I have no doubt about that.  I suggest that the Minister is premature in introducing the grading of bacon.  I suggest that he should have taken other steps first to help the farmers.  He might have provided <Col N="935" /> advice for farmers, through the agricultural officers, as to the type of sows which should be kept for the production of bacon pigs&mdash;the light-shouldered sow and all the rest. Recently the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture made a suggestion to the Minister that he should hold an intensive course for all the agricultural officers, both in the bacon factories and on the farms of the Department.  A short intensive course of a week or a fortnight would do. They would come back with more knowledge than they have at present of the type of sow which should be kept and they could advise the farmers anywhere their advice is sought.  That is the only hope I see because the full operation and effectiveness of pig testing will take ten years.</P>
      <P>The other suggestion I gave to the Minister may help.  Many of the boars selected by the Department officers are not up to the standard suitable for producing grade A pigs.  Many of them are thick and heavy-shouldered and there ought to be a greater tightening-up in that direction.  It is only on those lines that the Minister can hope for any immediate increase or any increase within the next year in the number of grade A pigs going into the factories.  Further, all these officers should be turned out to lecture farmers on feeding.  I think that is important, if there is to be a new system of feeding for the last six or eight weeks.  The farmers should be told that.  They should be told it is wrong to feed pigs any more on potatoes.  Is that what the Minister believes?  In order to get the stream-lined pig, that an effort is now being made to get, they cannot be fed on potatoes or on maize meal of which the Minister imported millions of tons.  They must be fed like a racehorse on skim milk and barley.  In order to get the right type of barley something will need to be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is there any hope of introducing a scheme whereby farmers in the non-scheduled counties, would have their cows replaced if a large proportion of them went down in the tests?  If the scheme is to make progress, I would suggest to the Minister that he should give a lot of his attention to that.  If the moneys are available from the American fund, they would be wisely spent in that direction because it would help to reduce the incidence of T.B. generally all over the country.  If we do not have some scheme to eliminate the cows found to go down on tests, it is nearly useless to carry on in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> I should just like to advert to something I mentioned before, namely that, in order to increase production, you must improve marketing.  As a long term policy, the Minister will have to turn one-third of his 700 officers to marketing research and investigation and marketing advice.  That is all-important.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the storage for grain.  If the farmers are to grow more barley, they must be assured that that barley is taken off them when it is threshed, either with a combine or in any other way, just as wheat is taken off them at the moment, at a fair price and not at a depressed price.  A price of £1 per cwt. is a depressed price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They seem to be growing a lot of barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Barley which was taken off them at £1 per cwt. last November is now almost worth £2 per cwt.  It is most unfair and it is most discouraging to the farmers.  The Department should be capable of organising some scheme to ensure that the farmers who produce the barley get a fair and economic price and that there is no big profit between when it is produced and when it is sold back.  If they can buy it at £1 per cwt., it should be sold back at a reasonable price after taking delivery and storage cost into consideration. It should not go up by 100 per cent.  That is damaging production in this country and damaging it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not make any more wild and ridiculous statements about the price of cattle or anything else.  We need more tillage in this country.  The Minister is anti-tillage. Everybody in this country is aware that the Minister started off his public career with an anti-tillage policy and they cannot get that out of their minds.  I am sure his Department, too, will carry out whatever policy suits the particular Minister in office.  When the present Minister took over the Department, they went stone cold about the production of tillage crops in this country.  I do not blame them; that is their duty.  Whatever is the viewpoint <Col N="938" /> or the policy of the Minister, it is their duty faithfully to carry out that.  The result was, that in the previous three years when the Minister was in office tillage crops fell by many thousands of acres.  We have about 12,000,000 acres of arable land and less than 2,000,000 of that is under tillage crops.  The Minister talked about grass being a valuable crop.  Nobody denies that good grass is a valuable crop but we have 10,000,000 acres of it; and I suggest that we have 2,000,000 acres too many.  We should have at least 2,000,000 acres more under tillage crops.</P>
    <P>We will not get in this country, as a long-term policy, an increase in agricultural production until we produce all the cereals that will feed our people and our live stock over the whole 12 months rather than sending £15,000,000 to £18,000,000 a year to Canada, America, Australia and other countries for cereals which we can produce ourselves if we have the proper organisation.  That will help to solve the balance of payments problem about which we are so concerned, our sterling balances, etc.  It would appear that the Minister is now a worshipper of the golden calf of sterling.  Since that golden calf of sterling was mated to the Coalition bull, we have nothing but deficits in the balance of payments.  Let him go pro-tillage.  It is too late this year. This year it was a surprising thing that there was not a £5 note spent by the Minister or his Department in encouraging more tillage.  Formerly, under other Ministers in the spring of the year, encouragement was given to grow more wheat, barley, potatoes or some other crop, but this year not a £5 note was spent.  Not a single officer down the country or belonging to the Department advised the farmers to till more or guaranteed that, if they did till more, those tillage crops would be taken off their hands at a fair price.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the farmers should keep more cows.  I believe that another 1,000,000 cows are required in this country.  How are we to get them?  What section of the farmers will get them?  Are the farmers in the huge area of the Midlands to keep more cows and more stock?  He <Col N="939" /> suggests that the farmer who has ten cows should put in two more, and the man with 20 should put in five more.</P>

If the Minister wants a go slow policy, they will go slow.  We are all long enough here to know that. I do suggest that the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for the fact that that commission has not reported before now and has not brought its findings to him.  The decent, honest thing to do would be for the Minister to come out, in closing this debate, and say that he never believed in it and that, whatever its findings are, pro or con, he is not going to accept them, but is going to dissolve the commission and deal direct with the farmers on the question of the price of milk.</P>

      <P>That would be the straight, honest thing to do.  He told us here a few months ago that he believed that it had reported, but he was damned if he could get the report out of the commission, that he had heard a rumour.  In my time in this House, I never saw a Minister reduced to a position in which such an indignity was heaped on him.  Ought any <Col N="941" /> Minister of any Government have to come in and say that a commission of his own, attached to his Department, would not give him a report, and that he had to come in with a rumour to Dáil Eireann?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission is not entirely independent of the Department. We would have had a report 18 months ago if the Minister wanted a report, but the Minister did not want it.  The Minister should tell the dairy farmers that he will negotiate directly with them, or that he will not negotiate with them at all, or that they are getting too much.  He could ask them, as he did before, if they would take a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; a gallon.  Why not be honest and frank with them?  They will then know where they are and everybody else will know where he is.  That would be a far more honest thing to do and a far more honest way of doing it.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not be codding the dairy farmers and humbugging them any longer.  If the Minister wanted that report from that commission 18 months ago, he could have had it.  That is not helping production in this country, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will admit that, so far, most of the speakers in this debate have been from southern counties and they have put forward the case of the farmers in the southern areas.  Our picture, up North, is somewhat different from that painted by the various Deputies from the South.  While they have been airing their grievances in the South, I would point out that they have the advantage of guaranteed prices for beet, for milk and for other commodities.  In my county, we are unfortunate in this respect, that the agricultural economy there provides for the growing of potatoes and oats.  As far as Donegal is concerned, those are the two main crops.  I must say that we grow them well, but the unfortunate part is that neither of them carries a guaranteed price.  We have price fluctuation very <Col N="942" /> often from year to year and during different parts of the season.</P>
      <P>The position is that the farmers cannot say that they have a guaranteed price for anything.  That is a great drawback to these people.  Whereas potatoes have been doing fairly well in the export and home markets for the past few years, there is always that uncertainty about that crop.  I notice that the Minister has now prohibited the export of ware potatoes.  That is not going to help the situation at all. Some Minister has said here recently that there is no danger of a potato famine in this country, but we are told that the export of potatoes has been banned, except for the export of some small quantities to meet contracts already entered into.  I think that is a rather drastic step when there is no danger of a potato famine.  The Minister for Agriculture should be very slow to ban the export of potatoes. Such export does tend to allow the farmers to get a decent return for their enterprise and their work.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see whether this ban is really necessary.  Such a ban will militate against the price of potatoes.</P>
      <P>In that respect, I want to congratulate the Potato Marketing Company on what they have done towards the development of a potato export for this country.  I think Donegal produces the greatest part of our potato exports and the amount of money and energy put into the export industry by the Potato Marketing Company deserves credit.  They have worked very hard to create a market for seed and ware potatoes and to make sure that any seed potaotes exported from this country are of the very highest quality.  The result of that is that, even after the ending of the war in Europe, when outside countries were able to go into the seed potato trade, we did not lose our foothold in the European seed potato market.  I think that is due to the very good work done by the Potato Marketing Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do admit that farmers did find themselves up against strict rules and regulations and that it took them some time to get used to these rules and conditions. The effort put into that work <Col N="943" /> at that time is bearing fruit now.  I think it would be a pity now, when we have a chance, through a shortage of ware potatoes in the Six Counties and in Britain, if the Minister, at this early stage, stepped in and prohibited the Donegal farmers from exporting their potatoes to this lucrative market.</P>
    <P>While on the question of potatoes, I would advise the Minister to take control of his Department, or, at least, not to allow any outside Department to interfere in the working of his Department. It has been the keynote, running through many debates, that other Departments are butting in.  We had the Táiniste lamenting the vast amount of money, by way of grants, being poured into Irish agriculture without any return.  That goes to show the mentality in such Departments. It would be well for the Minister to fight against any pressure of that kind.  Another Deputy, Deputy Declan Costello, said that, instead of giving these grants to farmers to do certain jobs, they should be given after the job was done and that they should be dangled in front of the farmer, just like a carrot, to entice him on.  He stated that on the debate on the Vote of Account.  That, coupled with the Tánaiste's moaning about the amount of money by way of grants being poured into Irish agriculture without return, should make the farmers sit up and take notice, and keep a careful eye on the activities of the present Government, on the Parties that support the Government and on the Ministers of that Government.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong when these views are expressed in relation to agriculture by responsible Deputies on the Government Benches and by responsible Ministers.  Nobody can say that too much money is going into agriculture. We know that agriculture is starved for capital.  Like any other industry, it requires a good deal of money to run a farm, even a small farm, at the present time.  Lack of production is caused mainly by lack of money.  Many farmers could, and would produce more of the crops which have a ready market, if they had the means of doing so.</P>

      <P>Whatever the differences of opinion amongst the Government Parties in relation to Irish agriculture, I wish the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture would make up their minds to cease quarrelling about Dutch potatoes and the growing of Dutch potatoes in Donegal.  The position seems to be that one Department is for and the other is against.  I want to point out to the Minister that the very elementary experiments carried out in the cultivation of Dutch potatoes for the starch factory in Donegal have proved very successful from the point of view of the farmers, and that is what really matters.</P>
      <P>Last year, these potatoes were grown in the Inishowen peninsula and the returns were so good that the farmers in other areas in the county have asked this year that they be allowed to grow potatoes for the starch factory.  Last year, some of the farmers got as much as £8 15s. per ton for ungraded Dutch potatoes delivered at the factory; that price compares very well indeed with the price received for certified seed potatoes which have to be graded and stored and so forth.  The Minister, or his Department, may be afraid that the introduction of Dutch potatoes might mitigate against the growing of certified seed.  I do not think there is any danger of that, but, in case there should be in any year, or years, a drop in the price of exported seed potatoes, it would be a good thing to have the growing of Dutch potatoes on a firm basis so that the farmers would have something in the same line to fall back on.</P>
      <P>I would suggest, too, that it is ridiculous to have potatoes grown in the Lagan Valley and other areas in Donegal sent into the factory at Labbadish, converted into starch there and then hawked away to Mayo for further processing into glucose.  When the potatoes are grown on the farms in Donegal, partly processed in the factory there, it would be more economic, I think, to have the process completed in Donegal.  In that way, the whole process would be centred in the one area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be desirable to keep the <Col N="946" /> factory&mdash;I am sure it is&mdash;in County Mayo going and I would suggest that some other alternative use could be found for that factory, even if it means a reversion to the production of industrial alcohol.  In the case of Labbadish, where the major part of the processing is done, the job should be completed there, both in the interests of economy and in the interests of the workers. Remember, the workers there have made every effort to keep the factory supplied.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister is aware that the Department has quite a number of potato inspectors in Donegal.  They go around the farms looking after the certified seed potatoes from the time of planting to the time of export.  It is a tough job, which has been well done, as is evidenced by the way in which our seed potatoes can compete against very keen competition in the continental markets.  Until recently, I was not aware that these men are employed on a temporary basis and are not entitled to pensions.  Some of them have given very long service to the Department and I think it is not right that, after a man has given 25 or 30 years' service to the Department, going around in all kinds of weather, he should be thrown out when he reaches pensionable age without a pension.  I appeal to the Minister to have that position remedied, and to have it remedied very soon, because I know a few of these men are just about to retire.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister did give export permits last year in the case of oats.  It helped to prevent the price dropping further than it had dropped at that time, and, although the export market was not good, it helped to clear the glut which existed in oats in Donegal and helped to steady the price.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister does not find some way of keeping an even balance in regard to oat prices.  I think the oat crop in this country, and especially in my county, is just as important as the barley crop in other counties.  It is a pity there could not be a minimum price, because it would save some farmers, especially the poorer ones, who find they have to sell <Col N="947" /> oats in the beginning of the year for as little as 1/6 a stone and then find, perhaps, towards the early part of the spring that oats is fetching 3/ &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a crop that should receive some attention and should not be at the mercy of fluctuations and variations in the market.</P>
      <P>Another thing the Donegal farmers are interested in is the pig industry. We have a very good industry there and it is praiseworthy to note that grade A pigs are to have a guaranteed price.  As the Minister knows, however, there are several other grades as well as grade A, and I am afraid the situation in the other grades will be as bad as it was before.  It is true to say that the exports of live bacon may help; that will depend on the export market.  It may help a bit.  Only a limited quantity of bacon will find its way into grade A, and therefore qualify for grade A prices.  The farmer, I am afraid, will, as heretofore, be at the mercy of the factories as regards other grades.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister interject during the discussion here earlier to-night that anyone who produced grade X or grade C should not keep pigs, but the peculiar thing about it, as the Minister well knows is: where does the grade A go when the bacon finds its way into the retail shops?  I would like to know what price is put on the grade X or other lower grades of bacon?  I am afraid, in the country anyhow, there is just one price for bacon, whether it is grade A or grade X.  That is something that is not for the Minister to remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been tinkering with bacon prices up and down for quite some time and has not made a good job of it.  As far as the consumer is concerned, the price he still pays for bacon, whether grade A or grade X, is too high compared with the price the farmer receives for his pigs.  Although this matter is not in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, he should take a very active interest in it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the 4/7 levy which will be paid to subsidise export of bacon, I am sure the Minister is not going to produce a fund out of thin air to pay this 4/7.  I believe it is the pig producers who will have to fork out the 4/7&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;and there is not much point in guaranteeing, or giving the pig producer a guaranteed price of 255/-, with one hand, and, with the other, imposing a 4/7 levy which he must fork out.  Again, if a fund is accumulated as a result of this levy, will it eventually go back to benefit the pig producers?  I should like to get more detailed information about this levy.  I do not think it is covered too well in this White Paper which I think the Minister said Deputy Allen did not read.</P>
    <P>Donegal is a county which exports quite a lot of cattle to Scotland, and as the Minister knows, Scotland has become a T.B. free territory, with the result that when Scotland is declared a 100 per cent. T.B. free area the producers of cattle in Donegal will be very badly handicapped.  Seeing that the scheme has worked out very well in Sligo, where I think there were only 600 reactors and as there is a possibility that in the next year or so Sligo will be declared a T.B. free area, I would advise the Minister, even before then, to include Donegal in the scheme, because it will help us.</P>

      <P>I know it is included in the Donegal scheme, but not in the special scheme where there <Col N="949" /> is compensation for animals which are found to be affected.  I advise the Minister to make an effort to include Donegal in the very near future, so that we will at an early stage reach the position where it will become one of the first T.B. free areas, so that exports of cattle from Derry, say, to Glasgow, will not be affected, as they are in danger of being affected in the near future when Scotland becomes 100 per cent. T.B. free.</P>
      <P>I interrupted Deputy Tully earlier this evening on the question of farm labourers and their wages.  He was advocating, as I have advocated on several occasions, increased wages for these people who are really skilled men.  They are the men who do the skilled work on the majority of the farms, especially in East Donegal, and in other parts of the country as well. The farmer may do the main planning, but these men do the very technical work which has to do with the planting of crops, and so forth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully&mdash;whose job it is to go around to these people, to attend farm labourers' meetings, and who gets paid for doing it&mdash;said I would be better advised to go back to my school. I must say I know more about the conditions of farm labourers than Deputy Tully does.  The Minister represented Donegal once upon a time.  We have not invited him back yet, I notice, nor do I think we shall, but, as he knows, there are more farm labourers in one parish of East Donegal than there are in the whole of County Meath.  That is not an exaggeration.  I know both their housing conditions and their conditions of work which, I must say, have been improved very much from, say, those of 15 years ago, when a farm labourer received the magnificent sum of 26/- a week.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil gave the farm worker the 50-hour week in 1952.  That was a vast improvement in their conditions of work because before then the agricultural worker was compelied to work very much longer hours. I do not want to make political capital out of a debate like this, but, as the Minister has succeeded in putting bad thoughts in my mind, I will say that, within the past 20 years, the farm workers have come a long way indeed under Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the farm labourers have, in their conditions and their rates, come a long way.  I think, however, the wage paid to a farm labourer at the moment is not a living wage in present-day conditions. All sections of the people&mdash; better-off sections and very much better-off sections&mdash;have got substantial increases, amounting in some cases to 10 per cent., to compensate for the high cost of living imposed upon this country recently by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>The sections who are organised, who have unions, and so forth, agitated and tried to pull one section of the Government or the other of the various sections composing the Coalition.  They succeeded, and rightly so, because they were able to point out to the Government: &ldquo;Look here, you have allowed these increases in the cost of living.  You have allowed the prices of commodities used every day in the home to go up.  Therefore, we must get 10 per cent.&rdquo;  They got 10 per cent., but the farm labourer did not get 10 per cent. It is about time something, at long last, was done about the farm labourers, seeing that other sections of the people have been in enjoyment of these increases since 1st November last.  We now find that the farm labourers have got an increase of 6/-per week.</P>
      <P>I have not time to figure out the percentage, but I think it is something less than 5 or 6 per cent.  Why does a farm worker not get the same percentage increase as other sections of the working people of this country?  The Minister will agree with me that they do equally important work, if not more so.  It is only right that they should get such an increase.  If compensations are going in order to preserve the other sections of the people from the impact of the increased cost of living surely it is only right that the farm labouring community should be protected in a similar manner and in a similar degree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I interrupted Deputy Tully to tell him what I was told two years ago by the Minister who is over there now when I mentioned that there should be some better way of determining agricultural workers' wages than the present set-up, from which there is no appeal.  It is decided by the Agricultural Wages Board.  There is no appeal.  They must take it; they cannot do anything about it.  I suggested two years ago that there should be <Col N="952" /> some change from that.  The Minister said then that I had not been reading his 12 points.  It might be 13 points for all I know.  It was something like that.  That was one of the things the present Government was going to do. I need not bother wasting any more breath on it.</P>
    <P>I tried to point that out to the Labour Deputy, Deputy Tully, and he got mad with me.  There is one characteristic of Deputies on the opposite side.  They do not like being reminded of things that are unpleasant. After two years, I wonder what the Minister has to say about this matter now?  Is it still the intention of the Government to change the system whereby agricultural workers' wages are settled?  Is he of the same mind now?  Does he intend to have the matter transferred to the Labour Court or has the Minister for Industry and Commerce put his foot down again? This is a serious problem.  The result of the present system is bad and some other system should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot, as has become the habit of his own back benchers, congratulate the Minister on everything. In fact, as far as my county is concerned, I can congratulate him on very little.  We have in the Lagan Valley in East Donegal and in other parts of my constituency a situation which has developed and which is new to that part of the country.  As the Minister knows, there are two classes &mdash;the fairly large farmers and the agricultural workers.  We find amongst the agricultural workers very serious emigration and unemployment, something which has crept in very recently.</P>
    <P>That is not altogether the fault of the Minister.  It is his fault to the extent that wheat grown fairly extensively in Donegal was not grown last year except in a very limited way. Flax, which was a very lucrative crop and which gave a lot of employment, is finished in Donegal.  No doubt, the Belfast spinners took the Minister's advice, which he gave them three or four years ago, when he told them to take a running jump at themselves. They took him at his word and we are the worst of that in Donegal.  We have a rather serious unemployment problem amongst farm workers there. <Col N="953" /> I attended a meeting quite recently. It was not a political meeting.  It was a meeting of unemployed farm workers. After the meeting, I discussed the matter with several people and many of the responsible people there were very worried.  Whereas we might always have emigration from West Donegal to Scotland, it was a seasonal emigration. This is different because when these farm workers go they have nothing to come back to.  They do not own any land.  There is no great enticement for them to come back again with the result that what happens is this: The head of the household goes over to Scotland or England.  He finds a job and in a year or two years' time he comes back and takes the whole family away.  That is something new that is happening now.  It is something which has got Church and State worried in our county.  I know from experience that in many areas that is true.  I think, in order to remedy that situation, more work must be found on our farms.</P>
    <P>In order to entice these farmers to go in for potatoes, oats, etc., they must be assured that in some way, if they produce extra crops, that they will find a market for them and that action, such as that taken recently by the Minister, will not be taken, that when they have plenty of potatoes for sale and there is a famine right across the Border or in England they will not be told: &ldquo;You will not export.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That attitude must be stopped, as far as Donegal is concerned.  I am afraid I cannot congratulate the Minister on the results of his labours in our county.  We will, of course, look forward to an improvement and we will keep the Minister reminded of all the things that have to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only to look back a few years to the time when the present Minister for Agriculture took over in 1948 to recall that the farming community were little less than serfs under the domination of Fianna Fáil. They were growing wheat because they were made to grow wheat, taking three barrels per acre off the land.  The present Minister for Agriculture decided he was not going to make the <Col N="954" /> farmers grow three barrels of wheat per acre on their land.  He decided to give them an opportunity of selecting the land themselves and the type of suitable crops which they required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham made some remarks about the policy pursued by the present Minister for Agriculture.  If we go back we will find that, before Fianna Fáil took office in 1932, there was a far greater volume of production from the land than there was ever since.  There was a greater volume of production from the land in the years before 1932 than since.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party pursued the ridiculous economic war which brought the farmers to their knees in 1939 and then the war came to their rescue. Then in 1948, when the first Coalition Government came into office, the farmers were down on their knees again because the war was over.  The present Minister for Agriculture brought into the farmers' homes the measure of independence to which they were entitled and the better conditions which they enjoy to-day.  I am dealing with the past eight years for the moment because that was the time when a dramatic change took place, not alone in the general standard of living amongst the farming community, but in the independence of mind amongst the farmers.  The present Minister, after three years great leadership and inspiration to the farmers, was obliged to hand over to another Fianna Fáil failure in the matter of Ministers.  For three years the policy of Deputy Dillon was pursued by the Fianna Fáil Minister because it was obvious to Fianna Fáil that it was the best policy.  Not one thing was changed.</P>

In any case, he pursued the policy of Deputy Dillon during those three years because he saw, as did Fianna Fáil, that it was the best policy for the country.</P>
      <P>One thing that strikes us at the present time is that the volume of production has not changed to any great extent.  That is why I welcome the announcement from the Minister that it is desirable as soon as possible for the farmers to increase the number of live stock in this country by at least 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade figures have shown that we must increase our exports by £50,000,000 as soon as possible and when we look at our economy and try to find out where can we produce goods and what kind of goods can be produced in order to increase our exports by £50,000,000, it is obvious that we must rely on the farmer and on the land to bring us that very great increase in our exports.</P>
      <P>I heard some Deputies criticising the fact that the volume of production has not gone up, but most of our farmers are obliged to face a kind of tradition that has grown up in this country that, if they produce more than sufficient for home consumption, they are then faced with a drop in prices to such an extent that it is uneconomic to produce whatever crop is put on the market. For instance, we keep on producing too much of all kinds of food but we cannot sell it in other markets owing to production costs.  We are at present producing in the main for home consumption from our land.  We must reach a state of efficiency which will enable us to export vast quantities of surplus food which this land is capable of producing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that we can produce too much of any type of food you can think of and, if we do, we must find an export market.  Unfortunately, the cost of production of many of our <Col N="956" /> crops prevents us exporting these goods and then we must rely on home consumption amongst our very low population of 3,000,000.  There are only a few items produced on the land in regard to which we can compete in foreign markets, one of them being beef.  We have at our doorstep a huge market for all the beef we can produce. If we produce, for instance, too much butter, at our present costings and at our present prices, we cannot find anyone to buy it from us.  Similarly, we are finding it difficult to sell bacon because we are in a very competitive market in that respect also.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is to find a method of producing a surplus of food which can be exported to countries which are prepared to pay our prices for it.  In that respect we must not alone turn to the Minister for Agriculture to give us a lead but we must also ask for the co-operation and guidance which we can get from the various agricultural organisations, such as Muintir na Tíre, the Young Farmers' Clubs and the National Farmers' Association.  Anybody interested in agriculture and in the improvement of conditions of our farmers welcomes the growing strength of these organisations because he knows that, with their practical knowledge and with their goodwill and co-operation, we can be sure that we will get a greater measure of efficiency on the land.  That prompts me to suggest that it might be possible to get what might be called an agricultural council on which those various organisations and interests could be represented.  We have, for instance, an educational council on which representatives of various organisations are acting in the general interest of education.  Similarly, I believe if we had an agricultural council with these various organisations participating, we might change the economy of our farming to such an extent that we could secure the very substantial increase in our exports which is immediately necessary.</P>
    <P>When we examine the fact that production has remained almost static, we must face a few facts.  We must observe that, while agricultural production has remained static, we have imported a vast amount of raw material in connection with agriculture and that the <Col N="957" /> production of food is on the wrong side, especially for an agricultural country.  We must also realise that when we see the production figures static, there are fewer persons working on the land now than there were in 1931 just before the Fianna Fáil Party took over office first.  I think the farm labourers began to leave the land at the rate of 30,000 per year every year since Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932, and that left only a quarter of a million farm labourers working on the land when the present Minister for Agriculture became responsible.  Now we have a quarter of a million men producing a volume something less than was being produced in 1931, when there was no mechanisation.  There is more machinery now and, of course, that has enabled the very much smaller number of men to achieve a volume of production somewhat lower than it was in 1931.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Walsh suggesting last week that tillage should be increased by 3,000,000 acres immediately. I would like to ask him what would he do with the produce of these 3,000,000 acres of land?  If an extra 3,000,000 acres of wheat were produced where would he sell it or if an extra 3,000,000 acres of beet were produced where would he sell the sugar.  No matter what crop he chooses, I would ask him where he would sell the surplus from these 3,000,000 acres of land, considering we have difficulty in disposing of surpluses as it is, that we are producing a surplus of certain crops for home production and that no other nation is interested in purchasing these things from us.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe gave notice that, on the motion for the Adjournment, he would raise the subject matter of a series of questions which, summarised, requested that loans negotiated or applied for before March, 1956, should be charged for at the old rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper to-day there appeared six questions dealing generally with the question of small dwellings acquisition loans and rates of interest.  The Minister chose to bulk the six questions and to answer them together.  I want to state that Question No. 44, at least, should have been answered separately because it dealt specifically with a question different from the matters raised in the other five.  I shall come to that later.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in answering the question to-day, adopted a very lighthearted approach to the matter, showing complete disregard for the dislocation of employment and complete disregard for the fortunes of those who are engaged in the building industry. He proceeded to use an argument which was entirely false but I do not propose to deal with his reply at length.  I shall take only specific items. The Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy but the circumstances are entirely different because at that particular time there was no regulation governing the rate of interest which would be payable by the borrower.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This was in reference to the statement pointing out to the Minister that his predecessor, under very similar circumstances, had agreed to give borrowers who had borrowed up to a certain date, in good faith, the loan of the money required at a rate of interest less than that ruling as a result of the increase in the rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the circumstances were entirely different.  Why? He says that the Minister of the day, in 1952, took care&mdash;remember the expression, &ldquo;took care&rdquo;&mdash;that all future advances would be governed by the rate of interest at which money was borrowed from the Local Loans Fund and that for that purpose the circular of 1952 was issued.  The Minister, apparently, replied to these questions in complete ignorance of the facts or, if it was not in complete ignorance, in complete distortion, because his predecessor issued the circular in October, 1952, and actually gave the <Col N="959" /> remission in the increased rate of interest in November, 1952.</P>
    <P>The Minister says later in his reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position of borrowers now is exactly as it was in October, 1952. In the circumstances and in view of the letter issued by my predecessor in 1952, I see no reason for giving any further concession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, not wishing to meet in equity and justice a situation which had arisen before and which was met with generosity by the Government of the day, attempts to put the blame for his not wishing to do so now on the shoulders of his predecessor although his predecessor made that gesture and gave that concession after the issue of the particular circular.  I hope the Minister accepts that as being in accordance with the facts and realises that it does not release him from his obligation to meet the present situation.</P>
    <P>In regard to Question No. 44, the specific point was at what rate of interest Dublin Corporation will get the promised £1,000,000 from the Local Loans Fund.  It was promised and at the time it was promised it was understood that the rate would be 5¼ per cent.  I have tried to find out what the rate will be.  The Minister says to-day that it will be the rate ruling at the time of the giving of the loan.  This £1,000,000, of which Dublin Corporation have not yet received one shilling, is promised in two moieties.  The first moiety was promised for mid-April.</P>

      <P>I give the facts, as I see them and as I know them to be, and I challenge the Minister to prove that what I am saying is in any sense wrong.  We were promised this £1,000,000 in two moieties, £500,000 in mid-April and the other £500,000 in mid-August.  It was at my suggestion, at a deputation to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance that, in order to bridge an immediate serious crisis, £1,000,000 should be made available until the availability of capital would be ascertained and until the Minister for Finance might have completed what he called his survey of the situation.  Does the Minister deny that that particular proposal was made by me?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I made the proposal at this conference to get over an immediate crisis so that, if £1,000,000 were made available, we might be able and would be able, in connection with small dwellings, to carry on until about October.</P>
      <P>What happened?  The other day I signed with the Lord Mayor of the City of Dublin a mortgage between the Dublin Corporation and the Board of Works.  In that mortgage, there is no fixed rate of interest stated.  It is a mortgage which says that the rate of interest is to be that ruling when the money is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister prepared to guarantee that the rate of interest in August will be the same as it is to-day, or is he prepared to say with regard to the applications with which the £1,000,000 is mainly to deal, that it is for applications approved since last November, entered into by people as contracts, in good faith, at the then ruling rate of interest?  I have asked him that question and there was no answer to it.  I ask him now to tell us, when replying, will the rate of interest for that £1,000,000 be 5¼ per cent. and no more, so that we can conduct our business in the corporation in a businesslike way. <Col N="961" /> That money is promised to us now as from 1st May.  I hope we will get it so that we can proceed to carry out our contractual obligations with our applicants and our contractors who build these houses.</P>
    <P>I have perused the Dáil Debate in connection with matters of this nature raised when we were in Government and when the different Parties of the Coalition made up the Opposition.  I shall not read the lengthy debate arising from questions and answers during questions and an adjournment debate, but I should like to put the matter on record.  The Official Report of the Dáil Debates, Volume 134, is full of protestations against the Fianna Fáil Government for not maintaining the rate of interest for those who had applied for loans at a certain date and who found later that they had to pay higher rates of interest than those obtaining when they made their contracts.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record from that volume the following passages: columns 275 to 276, columns 395 to 407, columns 676 to 679, columns 901 to 907 and columns 1291 to 1295.  I put those on record and I challenge the Coalition groups to say whether there are any possible grounds for the Minister and the Government refusing to accede to the representations made that people who made applications up to a certain date and whose applications had been approved should be entitled as in the past, where the precedent had been established, to get their loans at the rates of interest ruling at the time they made their contracts.</P>
    <P>The volume is full of these protestations. The Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, was most vocal.  The late Deputy Byrne, Deputy Peadar Doyle, Deputy Seán Collins&mdash;none of them is here at the moment&mdash;Deputy James Larkin, Deputy Seán Dunne, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Rooney, who has just run out, General Mulcahy, Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Cosgrave, the present Minister for External Affairs, were the people who were in full sound as if they were out hunting the fox.  They belled us and bellowed us into doing justice to these poor people.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Minister, first of all, in view of the precedent established in a similar case in the past, to meet the present situation. The Minister, in reply to the question this afternoon, adopted the same lines as he adopted this morning when he said that Dublin Corporation asked for only £1,000,000 and that, therefore, they were blameworthy, knowing full well the Dublin Corporation asked for £2,000,000 for Small Dwellings Acquisition Act loans.  In that connection, I <Col N="963" /> want to ask the Minister to tell me and the House with regard to this £1,000,000, which is a tide-over sum and which will not allow any further applications to be considered for small dwelling loans after the end of May, if he is going to give this money at the rate of interest expected by the corporation at the time their representative deputation met himself and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to stand up to the situation and not to let a tragedy develop in an area where there were 15,000 operatives directly and indirectly engaged in housing.  Four thousand have already gone to England and 5,000 are due to go in a few weeks, if this crisis is not resolved.  At the moment, there is only 15 per cent. of normal employment in this business and house builders are threatened with complete extinction, if this problem is not solved.  This matter relates, first of all, to the rates of interest available on old applications and it relates further to the availability of money to continue the schemes.  I shall not rob the Minister of his full time for replying. I want him to be specific, not evasive, and to tell us what is happening in a straightforward fashion. He must take the responsibility on his own shoulders in connection with this matter of Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans.</P>

      <P>If there is one thing I cannot stand more than another, it is crocodile tears and I accuse Deputy Briscoe now of shedding crocodile tears.  Let me give the history of Dublin Corporation and the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  In the month of November last, Dublin Corporation were given the opportunity of floating a loan for £6,000,000.  They knew the rate of interest and the investing public knew the rate of interest at which the loan would be subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  I now publicly accuse Deputy Briscoe of sabotaging that loan.  That loan was <Col N="964" /> under-subscribed.  The Government and the banks had to subscribe to and underwrite that loan in full and the money which could have been made available to-day by the Government to the corporation had to be made available then to underwrite that loan fully.  I did not know then that Deputy Briscoe was capable of sabotage.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy go back to the children he has to teach and leave the high finance to the financiers of the Fianna Fáil Party?  I now accuse Deputy Briscoe of sabotaging that loan.  I made an appeal to Deputy Briscoe and to the Dublin Corporation members and said I would do everything possible to see the loan was a success.  The same appeal was made to the Cork Corporation, and I now want to pay a public tribute to Deputy McGrath, the Lord Mayor of Cork, who accepted my views at that time.  As a result of the joint efforts of Deputy McGrath, the Cork Corporation and myself, the Cork loan was fully subscribed.  I was not aware of what Deputy Briscoe had done until last Saturday night when he addressed a meeting in Jury's Hotel at which he said it was not the duty of the corporation to provide funds under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, but to administer them, knowing full well that whatever funds were available to the Dublin Corporation should have come out of that loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

      <P>I beg your pardon. The Deputy knows they were.  I say now, and he confirmed it on Saturday night, that he sabotaged that loan.  As a result of the sabotage of the loan, the Government had to come to the rescue of Dublin Corporation and they had to find the finance to underwrite the loan.  Not only did they do that, but, at the request of Deputy Briscoe and his friends, they gave a grant of £1,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come to that afterwards.  I am satisfied that not only did we do more than we are entitled to do, but if the Deputy had played his part in seeing that the loan was successful, we would have had available for the corporation the money to underwrite the loan.  When only last week Dublin Corporation came back to the Government, no greater critic could be found of what the Government were doing than Deputy Briscoe.  At the very time the Government were making available £3,000,000 for housing purposes in the City of Dublin, the Deputy, as a member of the housing committee was criticising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has done more than any Fianna Fáil Government ever did.  They have given Dublin Corporation access to the Local Loans Fund for the very first time, and I say now&mdash;and I say publicly&mdash;that, as far as housing is concerned, Dublin Corporation is no worse off to-day than it was this day 12 months.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Deputy Briscoe said about interest, I have already announced the Government's policy on this matter, in reply to the parliamentary questions put down by Deputies to-day.  I also gave at considerable length the facts as to the difference between the circumstances obtaining in 1952 which governed the decision then taken and the circumstances now obtaining.  Deputy Briscoe now contends that, subsequent to the issue of the circular letter of October, 1952, Deputy Smith, as Minister, created a precedent contrary to the terms of that circular by giving the concessions announced in the Dáil in November, 1952.  That is not so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy please keep quiet?  The issue of the circular was an essential preliminary to the grant of the concessions.  It was intended to ensure that local authorities would, as from the date of the circular and forever afterwards, make prospective borrowers aware that the terms on which they would get their loans would be governed by the rate of interest obtaining at the time that the instalment, from which their loan was obtained, was issued from the Local Loans Fund.  The circular was also intended to limit the scope of application <Col N="967" /> of the contemplated concessions to applicants for whom there might have been commitments before the rate of interest was increased.  The then Minister thus took steps to ensure that no moral obligation would, from 1952 on, rest on the local authority or the State to incur loss to the rates or the taxes by cushioning the adverse effects of any increases in interest rates which might occur from time to time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe makes the point that I did not answer Question No. 44 in full. I said that the rate of interest on loans to local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, would be the rate prevailing at the time of the issue of the appropriate instalment from the Local Loans Fund.  As regards the rate at which the loans will be made available to the applicants, this is a matter for the local authority.  They are empowered to charge 1/2 per cent. in excess of the rate at which they borrow.  If the housing authority decide to make loans available to any class of applicants at rates lower than they are empowered to charge, such a decision may be open to criticism from the ratepayers, but it would not require my sanction.  What will Deputy Briscoe say if the rate of interest in August next is lower than it is now?  Will the Deputy advise Dublin Corporation to refuse to accept the lower rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>Supposing it were lower?  Would the Deputy refuse it and advise the corporation to accept a lower rate?  Deputy Briscoe's colleague, Deputy Smith, was the man responsible for that circular.  I am merely acting on the circular.  I am now saying that, if Deputy Briscoe has any interest in the poor people of Dublin and the people who are entitled to these loans, he will, for goodness' sake, in the interest of the City of Dublin, remain silent from now on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I have succeeded in getting the Government to advance £4,000,000 to Dublin Corporation and when I have succeeded in entering into what appear to be successful negotiations with the building societies and insurance companies, Deputy Briscoe again steps in and tries to sabotage that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How did I sabotage that?  Did the Minister call the conference yet?</P>

      <P>The conference is in session for weeks back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  The Minister never called the conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for the Minister to state deliberate mistruths?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that, when he knows what is going on, he will be less likely to call me a liar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy implied it.  I can assure the Deputy&mdash;and I know it hurts&mdash;that that conference is going on and that the negotiations are being very successful.  That hurts the Deputy, does it not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>The Deputy will be very pleased!  The Deputy now accuses me of not having called one meeting of the conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Minister call the conference he promised to call&mdash; the conference between members of the corporation and these concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there would be preliminary negotiations between the officials first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to give the Deputy an opportunity of sabotaging it at this stage.  I hope I have made it clear that I am merely acting on the circular letter issued by my predecessor, Deputy Smith.  I stand over it and I am making no apology for it at this stage.  You cannot lend money at less than the rate at which <Col N="970" /> you can borrow it.  I think that is very reasonable.  It is good finance.  The Deputy, of course, as he put it to the Minister for Health to-day, is concerned with the spending of money.  I am concerned with trying to save the ratepayers of the City of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy to-day put a question to the Minister for Health which I answered on behalf of the Minister.  I am not going to put a plaster on the back of the ratepayers of Dublin.  I am here to protect them against the Deputy and his colleagues.</P>

      <P>There are a few minutes left yet.  Small dwellings do not cost the ratepayers a halfpenny. They save them money.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26th April, 1956.</P>
