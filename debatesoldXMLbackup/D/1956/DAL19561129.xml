      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to raise a matter which I think is a point of order and certainly is one which is of importance to the members of this House.  I put down some questions yesterday and to-day relating to unemployment.  In particular I put down a question to the Taoiseach which is on to-day's Order Paper, No. 27, asking whether the Government has made, or caused to be made, an assessment of the causes of the steep rise in unemployment.  That question and some other questions have all been transferred to the Minister for Finance.  May I ask you, Sir, whether it is part of the functions of the Minister for Finance to deal with Government policy and unemployment?</P>

      <P>On this stage I propose to recommit the Bill in respect of amendment No. 5.  I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;and a managing director&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment and amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 deal with the same matter, and perhaps they could be considered together.  Deputies will remember that on the Committee Stage of the Bill an amendment standing in the name of Deputy Finlay was discussed which made the suggestion that instead of a managing director the board should have available the services of a manager and that the board of directors should accordingly consist of a chairman and ordinary directors. It is not easy to be certain in one's mind whether a board of this kind would better operate through a managing director, who, of course, would have a say and perhaps a dominant say in the policy followed by the board, or whether it would be better to divorce the main executive officer from the policy-making of the board.  I considered the matter carefully and thought that the balance <Col N="1684" /> probably was in favour of a manager. I was a bit strengthened in that view in consideration of the type of officer who, it is hoped, would be appointed eventually by the board as manager. I felt that, particularly in relation to responsibilities of this kind, of piloting a new scheme dealing with what may be a complicated form of enterprise, the idea of health insurance, the board must be concerned to seek a person with managerial experience and technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>It was my opinion that the tenure of office of such a person might be a matter to be considered with the individual whose services would be desirable.  As a managing director, of course, under the Bill the tenure would be merely four or five years.  I have no doubt the managing director would be reappointed but that would be the only guarantee he would have.  Again in the case of a manager it would be possible for the board to make their own arrangements with him and that consideration tipped the merits in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy Finlay.  I have accordingly accepted this amendment and the other amendments providing in effect for the appointment of a manager, and I ask the Dáil to accept the proposal.</P>

      <Col N="1685" /> Bill recommitted for the purpose of taking amendment No. 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before Section 7, to insert the following new section :&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may make a scheme for the payment, subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed in the scheme, of superannuation benefits on retirement to whole-time members of the board and may, with the like concurrence, amend any such scheme.</P>
      <P>(2)  A scheme under this section shall be carried out by the board in accordance with its terms.</P>
      <P>(3)  Every scheme made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if either House, within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the scheme is laid before it, passes a resolution annulling the scheme, the scheme shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to enable pensions to be paid, if necessary, to full-time members of the board.  Similar provision was made in the case of Bord na Móna, An Bord Fáilte and Fogra Fáilte.  While it does not appear likely at the moment that any members of the board would be full-time, the possibility could arise in the future when the scope of the board's activities, it is hoped, will have extended, that it would be found necessary to have, for instance, a full-time chairman.  If that were to arise it would be a weakness if provision were not made whereby pension rights could be acquired.  It is implicit in the amendment that there is also a negative side to it which would preclude the provision of pensions for part-time members of the board.  I think it is a necessary provision and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the other boards mentioned by the Minister he is, of course, aware that provision for the payment of pensions to full-time members was introduced long after the boards had been in operation and when it was clear that the length of service given by individuals entitled them to that right.  I doubt if it is wise to introduce this provision initially until some experience has been gained as to the extent to which the activities of this board will go and as to the quality of the persons appointed.  I do not know of any case where there is a State board the part-time members of which ever quality for pension.  It seems to me to be a very undesirable precedent to establish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said it had a negative side to prevent pensions being given to part-time members. The only power under the amendment is that where a director becomes whole-time he then acquires pension rights.  No part-time member has pension rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the other case there is provision that where a member has already given a specified number of years' service he qualifies for a pension.  I understand the Minister contemplates that he might at the very beginning of the appointment negotiate for pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the provision in relation to these other boards was found necessary on actual experience.  I am now suggesting to the Dáil that the experience already gained suggests that this power should be available now if necessary.  In fact, the board to be established on present indications will consist of part-time directors but as the insurance scheme spreads and extends, as it is hoped it will, it may in the future be found necessary to supplement the manager by a full-time chairman and in those <Col N="1687" /> circumstances I think it would be wrong to put on the Minister for Health the necessity of coming back to the Dáil to seek this particular power when we can provide it now.  It can only be utilised in the event of whole-time appointment being found necessary. It cannot be used otherwise than on a whole-time appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this to the Minister?  Any pension scheme will undoubtedly provide for payment of a pension after a specified period of service.  In the case of other boards that period of service has already been rendered and the person concerned had been appointed and reappointed before pension rights were given to him.  The insertion of a provision of that kind in the Bill at this stage would appear to imply that when a person is going to be appointed he will be allowed to spend the minimum number of years to qualify.  That would seem to be undesirable at this stage. I approve of the principle that a person who has whole-time service for a period of years should have pension rights but to bind the Minister's hands in advance to enable that person to fulfil the condition of service seems to be undesirable and would seem to make it more difficult to remove him within that period if his service is not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather the Deputy's objection is this.  Assume it were found necessary to appoint a whole-time director, for example, the chairman, and the pension scheme in relation to him is then provided for and it might provide that if he serves whole-time for seven or ten years, whatever it may be, he might qualify for a pension since his tenure is five years.  I can see there is an objection along those lines.  I understand that in relation to Bord na Móna the pension scheme was introduced seven years after the board was established but in relation to Bord Fáilte I am informed that it was introduced three years after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite the position.  In relation to Bord na Móna <Col N="1688" /> and Bord Fáilte the persons concerned had already been in the whole-time employment of the State in a similar capacity.  If my recollection is correct both Acts provided for the counting in of that previous service.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that the agricultural community should be given information on that particular line and on the advantages to be gained by the export of beer and spirits.  I am glad to see that the value of beer and spirits exports went up by something like £500,000 in the past 12 months. Unfortunately, in connection with that last matter we are faced with another aspect.  We are informed by those companies that they have to sell in competition with outside breweries. The producers of the raw materials for those outside breweries have a <Col N="1690" /> double advantage over the brewers of malting barley in this country.  If we are to get any benefit from this Bill by way of increased exports, some steps will have to be taken side by side with the measure to enable the farmers to produce the raw materials essential to any increase in exports.</P>
      <P>The British farmer has the advantage of a subsidy of £6 a ton on artificial manures which is not available to our farmers.  Up to a few years ago, the actual position of the Irish and British farmers was recognised by Messrs.  Guinness, inasmuch as they laid down a definite sum which, in their opinion, would compensate the Irish farmer for the disadvantage under which he suffered in the production of barley.  That sum was 2/6 per barrel for malting barley.  I suggest to the Minister that it is his duty to see that this disadvantage which the Irish farmer has to face is overcome.  It will have to be met if the Minister is to get any benefit by way of increased exports as a result of the reliefs being given in this Bill.  If we farmers could learn the amount of the relief we are likely to get, it would enable us to meet our competitors, and it would give an advantage to Messrs.  Guinness over their competitors.  In that way, the Irish farmers would know exactly where they stood.  We do not know that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of manufactured goods referred to in Part III of the Bill, are we to take it that dead and plucked turkeys are manufactured goods within the terms of the Bill?  After all, the producer is the man in charge of that factory, and he gets the eggs to produce the turkey chicks, rear them, and feed them up to the stage when they are ready for sale.  The turkey is then killed and exported.  I would suggest that that then puts the producer in the position of a manufacturer under the Bill, and he is entitled, as an exporter, to some relief.  In that way, turkey producers could get something towards paying for the extra £8 a ton which the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, put on the wheat offals that are fed to these turkeys, and the producer would get <Col N="1691" /> something to help him in the present situation in which turkeys are selling at less than would have been paid per lb. for rabbits a few years ago.  I think we should know that we will get some relief.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us in that regard whether, in the first instance, a turkey is a manufactured article, or comes under the heading of manufactured goods under Part III of the Bill, and, if so, what is the amount of bonus that would be justified by way of relief afforded to the exporter.  It would be a relief to the people to know that at this time when the Minister for Agriculture is giving us no relief in the matter of turkeys.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I do not know whether the Minister is considering putting in a special section in the Bill dealing with the white swans or turkeys which the Minister for Agriculture is going to have next year.  I think we are to have white turkeys next year, but it is questionable whether we will have any turkeys at all.</P>

      <P>The next thing I wish to deal with is the position of exporters of canned beef and of meat generally, both beef and mutton.  Is the man <Col N="1692" /> who sells a fat animal to be regarded as a producer of manufactured goods under this Bill?  He gets his raw material in the calf which he feeds for three years, and he has to put some of that mixture of the Minister for Industry and Commerce into the calf to produce beef.  I hold that under Section 10 in Part III of this Bill that beef or the fat animal now comes within the definition of manufactured goods.  We would like to know, considering the position of agriculture generally, how far the producer of that fat animal is entitled to relief under the Bill and whether he will get some relief, either when he sells the animal on hoof, in a can, or as dressed beef. Has the Minister considered the difference in those three things, and the amount of employment given in that trade?  Will he enlarge the Bill so as to make some differentiation between the three?</P>
      <P>Those are a few of the matters I wanted to deal with, but I would suggest to the Minister, since the object of this Bill is apparently to reduce the £35,000,000 differential in the trade balance, that he would be far better advised if, instead of proceeding with this measure, he restored the cuts that have been imposed on the agricultural community in regard to the production of grain, for which he is now paying the foreigner.  I suggest to the Minister that that would be a far wiser step.  The Minister is aware that, due to the malicious action&mdash;and I can describe it in no other way&mdash;of the reduction of £5 per ton on wheat, the wheat acreage has fallen some 140,000 acres.  At present we have to buy on &ldquo;tick&rdquo; from the foreigners the wheat to produce the bread we eat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that we could have had a pretty large export of bacon from this country if there had not been a reduction of 200,000 pigs because of the Minister's action in putting on that penal tariff. It would be a great help to the exporters if the Minister would now do away with that tariff and give the farmers an opportunity of producing those pigs for export.  I suggest that is something the Minister should turn his mind to.  We have the tragedy&mdash; I can call it nothing else&mdash;of the turkeys and now we have the tragedy of the pigs.  If we are to consider ways and means of increasing our export trade and of giving reliefs to those who have the means at hand of increasing that export trade by increasing production, surely it would be far better to go on the lines I am suggesting than on those the Minister is taking here.</P>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that if we produce more and export it, he is prepared to give certain reliefs.  I am suggesting the first thing that should be done is to remove the penal tariff on production.  It would be far easier to do that than to promise reliefs from income-tax, as the Minister is doing. I am suggesting to the Minister that a tax on home produced offals of £8 10s. per ton has resulted in an absolute stoppage of the export of bacon from this country and that the Minister should take immediate steps to deal with that.  I can guarantee him a far better result if he takes those steps rather than the blind drive to encourage exports which he is making under sections of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to other articles of farm production.  The Minister knows that the gain of roughly £1,000,000, contributed towards the flour subsidy by the pig feeders, does not compensate for a reduction of some 300,000 cwts. of bacon which could have been exported, but which was not exported because of this penal tax on the producer.  The Minister would be better advised to deal with that matter instead of endeavouring to induce some foreigner to come in here and export goods.  The Minister is relieving him of taxation, taxation which will fall back on us.  I suggest <Col N="1695" /> the Minister should now take steps to give to the producer of malting barley his artificial manures at the same price as his competitor in Britain pays for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order, Sir, to give the exporter of beer and spirits an opportunity to have the raw material for the production of the manufactured article for export.  These are the things to which the Minister should turn his mind.  Pious resolutions are heard from all sides of this House every day about increasing production. If we are to increase production for export, the first thing that will have to be done is to remove all the restrictions on production that at present exist to a glaring degree and which put us out of the market in competition with farmers in other countries.</P>
      <P>I make these suggestions in good faith to the Minister, in the belief that any person in his boots would examine them and would act upon them, instead of introducing this kind of a Bill guaranteeing relief to exporters.  We, too, want reliefs so that we may produce for export and I suggest to the Minister that the reliefs we are seeking are not in this Bill and should be in it, if we are to continue.</P>
      <P>I have put the case as I see it and as it applies to practically every finished article produced on the land at the present day.  We are driven out of the market.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted here some time ago that we are driven out of the market in respect of finished products such as eggs, butter and other commodities. The deliberate action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, ably supported, I think, by the Minister for Finance, has driven us out of the market and has deprived this country of the benefit of some 300,000 or 400,000 cwts. of bacon that otherwise we would export.  The deliberate action, again, of the Minister has deprived the unfortunate breeder of turkeys of production and has driven him out of the market.</P>

      <P>The Bill which is before the House is, to my mind, supplemental to the Government's economic policy as it has been put into operation over the past nine months or so.  It seems to me that this Bill gives concrete expression to the Government's desire and intention to increase production, particularly industrial production, in the State.  We must examine these proposals in the light of the experience of the past nine months.  It is important for us to appreciate that the measures which the Government has perforce taken have, in fact, brought undoubted improvements to the economic situation of our country.  The deficit in the balance of payments, which developed into such serious proportions last year, was one which nobody has suggested was the fault of the Government, was one which nobody has suggested could have been foreseen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee seems to enter a <i>caveat</i> when I make these remarks, but I would ask him to point to any one speech which he or any of his colleagues made last year pointing out the deficit which in fact developed in the last quarter of the year.  The position was that the deficit last year developed suddenly and it took on serious and grave proportions and the Government had to take certain measures to deal with the <Col N="1697" /> situation.  I want to point out to the House the effect of those measures, because the Opposition did not vote against them; the Opposition made no concrete proposals as to what was to be done.  The Opposition stated that the situation was of crisis proportions and that the Government was incapable of dealing with it.  I want to reiterate some of the facts which recent figures demonstrate, showing that, in fact, in the six months or so since the Government's measures have come into force, very remarkable improvement in our balance of payments situation has developed.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the deficit last year was a serious one and, in the first two months of this year, it was running at an even greater level than in the similar period in the previous year.  In spite of the fact that our trade balance in the early parts of this year was worse than it was last year, the position in the first nine months of this year is that the trade balance has been improved by £10.2 million.  That improvement is all the more remarkable when we examine the rate of improvement, for, in the first quarter of the year, the import excess was over £28,000,000 and, in the third quarter, the import excess was reduced to £11.2 million and the import excess for the third quarter of this year was down by £9,000,000 on last year.  I think the Government are entitled to take credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is an obsession.  I think it is a grave problem which we must face and which we must discuss and my remarks on this Bill are related to the results that the Government have had in dealing with it.  The facts illustrate that we, the Government have brought this now very close to a solution.  On the improvement that has been brought about it is possible to expand our economy in order to bring about the full employment and the reduction in emigration which Deputy McQuillan is not alone in wanting.  I do not think there is a Deputy on this side of the House and I do not think there is a Deputy on the other side who does not want to stop emigration and who does not want to give full employment at home to all our people.</P>
      <P>There is no use speaking about stopping emigration and the giving of full employment, if one has not got a policy.  Let the Opposition tell us what their policy is.  The Government have stated that the serious economic situation which developed last year had to be dealt with.  I say that the Government have dealt with that situation and dealt with it successfully.  We are now dealing with a Bill designed to encourage exports.  The remarks I have been making have been related to the fact that it is now possible for us to expand our economy on the basis of the success of the Government in dealing with a very real emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to refer to some other figures which have been made available recently to show the improvement which has taken place here in our banking operations.  The commercial banks complained of the dangers they were facing if the decline in deposits continued.  It is interesting to note that deposits have, in fact, increased in the past few months.  The general economic situation is, of course, largely dependent on a healthy banking situation. <Col N="1699" /> To my mind, the trend that had developed last year has been arrested and we have had in the last few months an increase of no less than £10,000,000 in the deposits of the commercial banks between July and October of this year.  The drop in deposits which occurred last year and which continued for the first six months of this year has been arrested and deposits have increased by £10.7 million as between the middle of July and the middle of October of this year.</P>
    <P>During that time, too, there has been an increase in gross external assets.  I am using the gross external assets and not the net external assets to indicate the external holdings position of the commercial banks.  Their gross assets declined last year.  They declined in the beginning of this year, due to the serious and continuing deficit in the trade balance.  Due to the improvement that took place since, their gross external assets increased from July to October by over £30,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Government has by its measures averted a dangerous situation.  It has brought the balance of payments situation almost to a position of normalcy, as can be seen from the fact that the drop in the deposits in the commercial banks has been arrested and their gross external assets have started to increase.  In addition, the savings campaign has proved to be remarkably successful. The figures demonstrate that small savings have increased.  We had, too, the experience of the undoubtedly remarkable success of the recent National Loan.  Deputy MacEntee coughs in a sarcastic manner indicating presumably&mdash;possibly he will put it in more forceful terms when he comes to speak&mdash;that the National Loan has not been a success.  I take for my authority the chairman of the Central Bank, and I refer to the statements made last Saturday night at the bankers' dinner.  It does seem to me that with the improvement on the financial side, which the figures indicate, it is now possible for us to plan a general economic policy on the basis of an expanding economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is one of <Col N="1700" /> the methods by which that expansion can be brought about.  This Bill is by no means comprehensive Government proposals.  It is only one of them. This Bill demonstrates an agreed Government policy with regard to the principle of industrial production.  I challenge the Opposition not to run away from the realities of the political situation.  I challenge them to state what their policy is, if they disagree with what we are doing.  Can Deputy MacEntee or any Front Bench speaker tell us what Fianna Fáil policy is in current circumstances?  It is their aim, they say, to increase agricultural and industrial production by 20 per cent. That is our aim, too.  Indeed, it is our aim to go better, if we can.  But there is no good saying what the ends of our policy are.  It is the means that count. Tell us how the Opposition will do it. Tell us what the Opposition will do if they get back into power.  Will they bring in a measure such as this?  Will they do what Deputy Corry suggests for the agricultural producers?  Let us know what they will do and then we can discuss it with them.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been curiously silent.  I venture to prophesy that when Deputy MacEntee comes to speak we will not hear one concrete suggestion in relation to policy, one concrete suggestion as to how we should deal with the economic situation. I believe I am as concerned as Deputy McQuillan is with the unemployment situation and with the emigration situation, but I do not think these problems can be solved merely by stating that they exist and demanding that something be done about them. It is necessary to take certain steps. This Government in this measure is taking some steps&mdash;not complete steps &mdash;to remedy the situation.  This Bill will not end emigration overnight, but the Government is taking some measures, measures we are confident will increase production and give more employment.</P>
    <P>From the long-term point of view, this economy of ours must be considerably expanded.  There is a lot of slack in the economy.  There are a lot of resources left lying idle.  There is a lot of labour for which there is no employment.  There is consequently <Col N="1701" /> the high level of emigration which we all deplore.  In the long run the only way that can be remedied is by an expansion in capital formation. Although the rate of capital formation has been improved in the past seven or eight years it is still very much below what it is in other countries, for example, in Denmark.  We must increase our rate of capital formation and the main agency through which that can be increased will have to be by raising the economic stability of the country.  That will have to be done by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to maintain and, to my mind, increase its capital investment programme.  The great task of increasing production, agricultural and industrial, will, I think, devolve to a large extent on the Government.  It will have to see that the framework of the State is such that the increased agricultural and industrial production which we want is made possible.  The Government will have to stimulate it by means of its capital investment programme.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which this Government, or any Government, has to face with regard to maintaining its capital investment programme is the means of financing it and the great problem which is with us at the present time is to find the money for the desirable schemes which we all want to continue and expand.  That is one of the reasons why the increase in savings is so welcome&mdash;because savings represent a direct means by which we make possible an increase in the Government's capital investment programme.</P>
    <P>I think we must face realities and one of the realities is that savings, certainly in the foreseeable future, will not be sufficient to meet the full requirements of the capital investment programme.  I think the Government will have to find other means in order to keep the capital investment programme at its present level and, if possible, expand it.  To my mind it would be desirable and practicable, and, I think, good economics in the circumstances, to request the commercial banks to lend directly to the Government in order to increase the funds available for the capital investment <Col N="1702" /> programme.  I can see no objection, in our present circumstances, to the savings of our people being augmented by the commercial banks assisting directly, as they do in other countries, in the capital investment programme before us.</P>
    <P>I feel that this country has been going through a very difficult period but I also feel that it is very nearly through it and that the hesitancy of the commercial banks in lending money at the present time can no longer be justified in view of the improvement in our trade balance which is so obvious, and when, in fact, the deposits are increased and gross external assets also.  I believe that the period for expansion has come, and that this measure along with other measures that the Government has proposed or has already acted on, or will in future act on, will bring about, or help to bring about, a greater improvement in our unemployment situation and will also assist in bringing about a reduction in emigration.</P>
    <P>As I said before, it is useless for us to talk about ending emigration and ending unemployment.  We all want these things ended; what we have to discuss in a practical and realistic way are the measures needed to end them and I will welcome suggestions from any part of the House as to how that can be done.  This debate would certainly be worth while if we get some concrete suggestions.  The difficulties which this Government has had to face have largely been overcome, I think, and on that basis I think we can look forward to a much greater expansion of our economy and a higher level of employment generally.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy on this side, every Opposition Deputy, stressed that the policy outlined by the Government would inevitably lead to inflation and that such inflation would dislocate our whole economy by leading to an increase in imports and by further depleting the last of our external reserves.  In the light of that debate, how can Deputy Declan Costello have the hardihood to state, as he has done, that the Government was not warned of what would happen if the Coalition policy, as set out in formal terms in that amendment, were persisted in?  Of course, we know the Deputy is trading on the fact that the public have short memories and that debates in this House are not reported <i>in extenso.</i>  But the records are there.</P>
      <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Costello referred several times to the improvement in our trade balance.  One of the main reasons for that improvement is that stocks are being allowed to run down.  We have already consumed a large part of our external resources; we are now engaged in consuming a large part of our internal capital.  That consumption is represented by the depletion which has taken place in stocks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Declan Costello also suggested that the commercial banks were not doing enough to help the Government in this emergency and that they should contribute more directly to the financing of the Government.  I should like the Deputy to refer to a written answer which was given in this House on November 14th setting out particulars of national loans and showing the extent to which the commercial banks had directly participated in the financing of what the Deputy is pleased to call &ldquo;the Government's capital programme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that in September, 1950, when a 3½ per cent. issue of Exchequer Bonds was made amounting to £15,000,000 the public took up virtually only two-thirds of that amount, to the extent of £10,096,000, but the <Col N="1704" /> commercial banks took up £3,269,000 and departmental funds took up £1,634,000.  In the case of the 5 per cent.  National Loan of 1952, the loan which was decried by Deputy Declan Costello and his colleagues, the commercial banks of course were not called upon to participate because that loan was over-subscribed by the public.</P>

      <P>Let me say here that in contrast to the 1950 loan and subsequent loans which have since been floated by the Government, that loan did not inject any element of inflation into our economy because that loan absorbed the real savings of the public, which had previously been lying dormant, and put them to work on behalf of the State.  Then again there were other loans.  In deference to the views of the Opposition that the rate of interest on the 1952 loan was too high, I find that a 4½ per cent. National Loan was issued in October, 1953, for the sum of £25,000,000.  The public subscribed £16,290,000 of that loan, which carried interest at 4½ per cent. and was issued at 97; the commercial banks took £5,000,000 of it and subscriptions from departmental funds amounted to £3,450,000.  In 1954 a 4¼ per cent. loan was issued at 96. The amount of the issue was £20,000,000.  The public took up £15,197,000, the commercial banks £4,202,000 and subscriptions from departmental funds amounted to £600,000.  In February of 1956&mdash;that is this year&mdash;a 5 per cent. issue of national savings bonds was made at a price of £98½ per cent.  The amount asked for was £20,000,000.  The general public subscribed to that £20,000,000 issue the sum of £8,701,000.  The commercial banks, whom Deputy Declan Costello has attacked in this House, alleging they have not been of direct assistance to the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy attacked the commercial banks for not contributing to the capital programme of the Government.  I was referring to the 1956 issue of 5 per cent. savings bonds, and was pointing out that the public had subscribed £8,701,000 and that the commercial banks, whom Deputy Costello has attacked, were called upon to take up £5,000,000 of that issue.  I now come to the 5½ per cent.  National Loan, issued in October last for £12,000,000.  Of that loan the public took up £9,166,000 and the commercial banks £1,316,000.  Having regard to the fact that the commercial banks have been established mainly for the purpose of financing trade and commerce in this country, mainly for the purposes&mdash;perhaps one should put first things first&mdash;of providing a safe deposit for the savings of the people of this country, and of channelling <Col N="1706" /> those deposits into our economy for the use of those who are engaged in trade and enterprise, I think they have done remarkably well in financing the capital programmes of successive Governments.</P>
      <P>They have done it so well that we are now faced with the situation in which they have not got the resources which the private producer and the private trader require to enable them to carry on their business, to expand and develop.  Because of the work of successive Governments&mdash;I do not single out any Government&mdash;we have reached a stage in which industry is finding it impossible to get the credit resources and the capital resources which would enable it to expand.</P>
      <P>I think, having regard to the position of the Irish banks at the present moment, that they may not be able to participate to any great extent in Government financing and at the same time meet the requirements of private trade and industry.  Deputy Declan Costello says they ought to provide more money for the Government. Where will they get more money; does he suggest they should create a paper credit for the purpose?  When he next speaks would Deputy D. Costello be good enough to dilate upon that theme?</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to talk about these matters openly and freely in public because if one does one is quite likely to be accused of damaging the credit and reputation of certain institutions. But would Deputy Declan Costello just tell the House how he expects the commercial banks to give any further assistance to the Government of this State?  I am not now referring exclusively or particularly to the Coalition Government.  Would Deputy Costello say how he thinks the commercial banks could, in their present circumstances, do more than they have been doing over recent years to enable the Government to carry out the programmes of alleged capital development which have been put before them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Deputy not know the present liquidity ratio of our banks? Does he not know how hard-pressed they are to try and maintain their <Col N="1707" /> present banking reserves?  Does he suggest that they should deliberately create credit and intensify the inflationary spiral which has brought the country to its present condition?  If he has that in mind, the Deputy ought to say it out and not come in here, as a member of the Government Party, pretending to have a magical panacea which will get the people of this country out of these difficulties without imposing any hardship or any deprivation upon them.  Having dealt with what Deputy Declan Costello had to say on this matter, perhaps I can get back more directly to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the first thing that will occur to the general direct taxpayer, when he reads this Bill&mdash;if he ever reads it &mdash;or when he learns about it, will be to ask himself why the incentive of a reduction in the taxation of profits is extended only to mine-owners and not to him.  Surely he will ask himself why should one category of producers be singled out for this favoured treatment as against all other sections &mdash;why should one section of earners be given concessions which are not extended to all?  These are all relevant questions.  They are questions of great importance to the 200,000 odd individual payers of income-tax who will receive no benefit whatsoever under this Bill.  Why should concessions be confined solely to a small class of producers and not extended to those who render the essential service of distributing goods?  I want to make that point.  The people who distribute goods in this country render indispensable service to the economy.  Why should distribution of goods not receive the same ra of concession as those who produce them?  Finally, why should tax concessions be confined to a class of owners only and withheld from wage-earners and other employees?</P>
    <P>I have said that these are all relevant questions to the 200,000 odd individual payers of income-tax who will receive no benefit under this Bill. They are questions of particular personal interest because, as Deputy Corry pointed out in the course of his speech, not only will the 200,000 odd payers of income-tax receive no concession <Col N="1708" /> or direct benefit under this Bill but they will be placed under an additional disability by reason of the fact that they will ultimately be called upon to bear the costs of the concessions when they become effective.</P>
    <P>I mention these aspects of the Minister's proposal not to raise vexatious questions or in any spirit of factious opposition but to underline the fundamental defect of our tax structure which has made a Bill of this sort, limited as it is, essential if we are to pursue the policy of developing our resources.  The fact which this Bill spotlights is that our present system of taxation bears too heavily on producers of all classes&mdash;not merely, remember, on those to whom this Bill will grant some relief, not merely on mine-owners or owners of industrial buildings or exporters but also on every direct taxpayer who is engaged in trade and industry&mdash;on the managers, on the salaried personnel and on the wage-earners alike.  The very fact that the Minister has brought in this Bill is an admission that the burden of direct taxation on production and on producers is so heavy that it has killed all initiative and spancelled enterprise.</P>
    <P>In that connection, let us consider the class of enterprises which the Minister has singled out in the Bill for preferential treatment.  When we do, I think we will realise that they give startling proof of the argument which I make.  I want to be quite clear on this matter.  I am not criticising the Minister for what he is proposing to do in Parts II, III and IV of the Bill because even the little that the Bill does is better than nothing and, for that reason, we welcome it.  But let us consider the measure in relation to the undeniable fact that taxation on trade and industry, on enterprise and labour is too heavy.</P>
    <P>Let us consider, as I said before, the principal beneficiaries of the Bill-those who work and develop our mineral deposits in general and those who engage in mining coal for domestic consumption.  In relation to the first of these classes, the general mining interests, the Minister has mentioned that never in our history have <Col N="1709" /> foreigners manifested so much interest in the mineral resources of this country. We should ask ourselves in that connection what is the urge behind these interests.  It will be found in the world situation as it has developed, and as it is likely to continue to develop with increasing tension in the near future.  In these conditions, the mining companies are feverishly prospecting for new mineral resources and are speculating at great odds in doing so.  Because, I think, of the success which attended the long and hazardous efforts of the Fianna Fáil Government to prove the existence of a large body of ore in Wicklow which could be economically worked, the attention of mining experts has been directed to this country.  Normally, that attention would be followed by investment and prospecting and working.  Apparently, however, these concerns, even with all their large resources, have come to the conclusion that investment would not be worth while and even in present circumstances would not be justified because of the heavy tax burden their efforts would have to carry.  The Minister&mdash;and, I take it, this Bill is proof of it&mdash;apparently has been convinced that this is indeed the position and, as I have said, has brought in this Bill to ease the burden so far as this special class of enterprise and investment is concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us draw the moral from the Minister's action in this regard.  At a time when there is an abnormal and rapidly increasing demand for minerals, when, one might say, the four corners of the earth are being scoured for workable deposits, when the several Governments behind these great mining corporations are clamouring for them to find greater and greater mineral resources, the Minister admits in a very practical and undeniable way that, even in the unique circumstances of to-day, taxation in this country is so high that unless it is reduced by 50 per cent. our mineral resources will never be developed.</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to the general mining operations applies in like manner to our coal-mining deposits. We are confronted with a probable fuel famine, with a possibility that for <Col N="1710" /> a long time this country will be grievously short of fuel and that, therefore, for years to come there will be a ready sale for any coal which may be made available here.  In such conditions, it would be normal to expect that there would be intense interest in our coal deposits and intense activity in working them.  In fact, the interest and the activity appear to be nonexistent. Again, we should ask ourselves what is the reason for this entirely abnormal lack of interest.  The Minister's Bill gives the answer.  It expresses his emphatic opinion that in this country taxation of production and the profits which arise therefrom is at least twice as high as it should be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It would be dishonest to conceal that I share that view.  I have, time and time again, said in this Dáil and elsewhere, not merely this year or last year, but when in office and out of office, over the whole period since 1927, that the rate of direct taxation on industry and producers is too high.  The present Minister has expressed that same view&mdash;at least while in office.  It can be alleged against him, as it could also be charged against me, that we have failed to make our views effective and that we have not reduced the direct taxation which is crippling our industries.  But let us bear in mind that when huge expenditures are demanded from the State, the Minister for Finance has got to get the money where he finds it.  In view of the public attitude towards these expenditures, the strong demand for them, heightened and stimulated by speeches not only of the Tánaiste and his colleagues of the Labour Party but by members of the other Parties also when the Coalition was in Opposition, it was practically impossible to exert such control as would enable taxation to be reduced.  The best one could do in the circumstances of the time was to try and make ends meet and no matter how excessive the expenditures were to try and make the State pay its way as it went.</P>
    <P>The consequence of following even that limited policy was evidenced by the result of the 1954 election.  The country is now reaping the result of <Col N="1711" /> that and I wish that Deputy Declan Costello was present to hear me because he is one of the persons who was largely responsible for reducing the State to its present depressed condition. The country is now reaping the whirlwind from the seeds which were sown by an irresponsible Opposition in 1947 and 1948 and from 1951 to 1954. It is now reaping that whirlwind in the shape of shortage of capital; in the restriction of credit for the legitimate needs of trade and industry; in the deprivations to which the community as a whole is being subjected; in the growing unemployment; in the headlong emigration; in the debased public credit; in our depleted capital resources and in an empty Exchequer.  Our local authorities, having incurred obligations at the instance of the Central Government, are also reaping it for they, too, are now finding it impossible to get the Central Government to honour its obligations to them. All of these evils stem from the success of the Opposition in defeating the Fianna Fáil Government in its endeavour in 1952 to restore order in the public finances and put the national economy on a sound foundation.  However, Sir, that is water under the bridge, it is past history, and I refer to it&mdash;even if.  I have referred to it somewhat emphatically&mdash;only to reinforce the argument that if we want the State to survive there must be a new approach to these matters on both sides of the House, no matter who may be in office as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On that basis I approach this Bill. It gives some relief but not enough relief.  It does not give that widespread easement which is the crying need of all those who are engaged in productive employment.  The Minister may well say that he cannot do more. Perhaps it is for that reason that the long Title of the Bill is so narrowly drawn.  If it were not so narrowly drawn perhaps useful amendments could be put down, not, indeed, with the expectation that the Minister in present circumstances could accept them but with a view to discussing closely the disabilities under which our producers labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> We could even have the Tánaiste in on that discussion.  He might then learn enough about our industrial problems to convince him that Irish industrialists are not blood-sucking profiteers whose proper place is behind jail walls.  He might even be convinced that barnstorming speeches will not lead to the establishment of new ventures. The provisions of this Bill are proof that industrialists cannot be solicited to invest their capital in this country by the verbal blandishments of the Tánaiste.  The newspapers this morning lend point to that with the announcement that an American corporation of the highest standing has arrived in Derry to establish a huge works there to manufacture a product of ever-increasing importance in life and industry, and for this purpose has acquired a site of almost 400 acres.</P>
    <P>As an Ulsterman I am glad that the industry is at least to be located in Ireland and not elsewhere.  But I ask myself, and I think we all ought to ask ourselves, why is it not coming to this part of Ireland?  The provisions of this Bill suggest the answer.  The Tánaiste has been tireless in his travels seeking to interest foreign capitalists in our industrial possibilities. I have no doubt that he painted these in glowing terms and I have no doubt that he established contact with the Du Pont concern in America and employed all his powers of persuasion to induce the management of that firm to consider the advantages of establishing their new neoprene works in this part of Ireland.  Apparently he was not successful, not only in this but, judging by recent replies which the Tánaiste gave in this House, in every other instance too.  Apparently, the American businessmen all came down to brass tacks saying: &ldquo;Now, Mr. Norton, tell us how is industry taxed in your part of Ireland?&rdquo; No doubt when that question was put to him, the Minister acted like a parish priest whom I heard of who had been to Rome.  The parish priest was able to answer satisfactorily every question which the Holy Father had put to him until the very end when the Holy Father said: &ldquo;Well, now, Fr. O'Donoghue, could you tell me how do the people pay their dues?&rdquo; and <Col N="1713" /> the priest, recounting this to his parishioners at a later stage, said: &ldquo;And that, my dear brethren, is when I had to hang my head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose when this question was put the Tánaiste had to hang his head and if he did not he should have.  Only a few years ago the Tánaiste's Party was crying out for penal taxation to prevent private enterprise from making profits.  I have referred to this topical instance to show how our industrial development is being hampered by excessive taxation and in order to drive my point home and that point is that the Bill does not go far enough.  Even to the limited extent to which it gives any reliefs those reliefs are too restricted in point of time.  Several of the operative sections of this Bill and in particular those in Part IV of the Bill relating to industrial building allowances, only make the allowances applicable in respect of expenditure incurred on or after the 30th day of September 1956.  Having regard to the terms of the Minister's Budget speech many people assumed, particularly when the clauses of the Finance Bill relating to initial allowances were read by him, that any concession in respect of industrial building would run as from the 30th June 1956.  It would be well if the Minister could see his way to amend the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know it would be futile having regard to the state of the Budget, to ask him to widen the scope of the measure, but this measure in itself is an indictment of the tax structure which has been built up here over the years and which weighs much too heavily upon production.  We cannot hope to develop an export trade.  We cannot hope even to cater for our home needs unless some relief is given to industrial enterprise and indeed to agricultural enterprise because do not forget that that is over-laden in another way.  However, that would be outside the scope of this measure and I do not want to touch upon it. Unless we can find some way of allowing a greater share of the profits derived from industry to remain with the industrialist to fructify by being reemployed in the development and expansion of his business, I cannot see <Col N="1714" /> that we shall ever again be able to affect the fringe of the unemployment problem which will grow as the years go by.</P>
    <P>I have not so far referred to Part V of the Bill which enhances the moral of what I have said when I was referring to the remarks which were made by Deputy Costello.  It is a sad thing to think that this State, after being over 30 years in existence, having survived, if you like, the vicissitudes of a civil war, having survived the economic war and the last World War, having come out of the last World War one of the strongest and most creditworthy States in the world, should be reduced to the poor devices to which the Minister was reduced when he was floating his last loan.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the amount of that loan.  Deputy Declan Costello thought the loan was a great success. I think it was a great humiliation to everybody in this House and to all those who are concerned for the reputation and prestige of our country abroad that we should have to offer 5½ per cent. for an issue which, by preceding issues, was a relatively modest one for what is virtually a five-year loan, because that is what it means.  The terms of this loan, according to the prospectus, are, that it can be tendered at its issue price for any loan which the Government may make within the next five years.  It is said in justification, of course, that this is a device to safeguard the subscriber against depreciation.  The loans of this State should not depreciate.  We are a young State and we had a modest national debt.  The whole tendency of our loans was to appreciate until the time came when we could no longer raise the money, when, because of the manner in which previous moneys had been expended, we could no longer raise money upon reasonable terms, and when, because we could not allow a construction programme, once embarked upon, to collapse for want of finance, we had to offer those terms which would attract the moneys we required.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am being a little bit diffuse in this matter but the point I am making is that for the next five <Col N="1715" /> years whatever Party is in office, whoever happens to be Minister for Finance, whenever a new loan is issued and the Minister wants £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 and he is compelled because of the state of the market to offer, say, 5¾ per cent. or 6 per cent. every penny of the £12,000,000 raised in last October, except to the limited extent to which people may avail of the option to exchange into Exchequer Bonds, can be tendered to the Minister's successor in subscription for the loan.  That certainly is a case of making certain that whoever comes after you will have to honour, to his detriment, the obligations that you incurred.  I could characterise it in very strong language, except for the fact that being a former Minister for Finance I recognise the difficulties of my successor.  I do not want to offend him or do anything which would reflect upon him.  However, I do say that all of us in this House should take note of this matter and see whither we are tending.  We are tending towards positive bankruptcy and it is a matter of such grave public importance that I do not want to talk too much.  I try to refrain from talking about it, except when it is necessary to do so because of the issues which are raised in the House.</P>
    <P>There are a few other things one could say about the premium bond issue.  There we have another instance where within six months a person can secure capital appreciation to the extent of a fraction over 2 per cent. free of tax.  The Minister will, perhaps, be in office when he issues the bonds but if he is not, think of what his successor will be up against.  One could jeer and sneer at these things. One could talk about the Minister and the Government running a pool-room or making a book.  One could say that the Taoiseach would be going around the fairground, with a band around his hat saying: &ldquo;Costello cannot cheat&rdquo; or perhaps that the Minister for Agriculture might have another band around his, saying: &ldquo;Dillon does not diddle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can make jokes about it but it is a serious problem not merely for the <Col N="1716" /> Minister for Finance but for everyone in this House and for the people outside this House who think that all the Government has got to do is to spend and borrow in order to keep the appearance of an unreal prosperity in the community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more about this situation.  I think it is a bad thing and a poor thing that this State, which was founded not merely on the sacrifices of our generation but on those of previous generations, should, after a little over 30 years of self-government, be reduced to raising money on these terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Introducing this Bill, the Minister has done something unique.  I commend his spirit of enterprise and I congratulate him on his constructive and prompt proposals in this measure.  It is obvious that he is a person who can cut across the conventional precedents in his Department and that is something upon which I, in particular, commend him.  For a very long time we have been far too conservative in dealing with our tax code.</P>
      <P>In Part III of this Bill we have certain rather unorthodox, perhaps, revolutionary, provisions which I welcome very much.  In granting in Part IV the industrial building allowance the Minister is implementing the second major recommendation of the Committee on Industrial Taxation. That, too, is something which will serve as a valuable incentive to our industrialists to modernise their industrial buildings.  The American experts who produced a report here on industrial activities recommended, I think, an amendment of our tax code of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too many of our industrialists are endeavouring to carry on in antiquated buildings and competing against heavy odds.  This 10 per cent. allowance is quite generous.  Certainly, we can say that the Minister would have been quite chary in introducing it because there is no doubt that in many cases it will have the effect of completely exempting from tax an industrial firm which carries out capital development during a particular year of assessment. <Col N="1717" /> To that extent, it will, of course, affect the Minister's revenue.</P>
    <P>I think the last speaker referred to the fact that the proposal in Part III, the export concession, was restricted as to time.  I may have misunderstood him but, in any event, that view could be expressed.  I welcome the five-year restriction on this export concession. I think we should be very slow to introduce discriminatory provisions into our tax code and I believe it is only because of the particular circumstances of the time and the grave urgency of coping with the balance of payments problem that justifies us in bringing in this particular concession for exporters.  It may be decided, after the determination of the five years, to carry it on, but in any event I believe that for the moment the Minister is doing a wise thing in restricting it somewhat.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to see Part III of the Act mechanically less unwieldy and perhaps somewhat broader in its scope.  I do not wish to go into detail in regard to it, but there are three or four points to which I should like to refer.  It appears to me &mdash;I hope I am wrong, but I am afraid I am not&mdash;that the export concession is confined to corporate bodies.  I cannot see why that should be the case. There are many firms exporting which are sole proprietorships or partnerships and not registered in the form of a registered company.  Why should they be discriminated against to that extent?</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Lemass queried the definition of the word &ldquo;goods&rdquo; which are defined in this section as goods manufactured within the State. I am rather afraid that when an inspector of taxes or the Special Commissioners come to interpret that it is possible that there may be a precedent for the exclusion of goods assembled within the State, perhaps components imported and assembled for re-export. There is not enough of that type of the export trade carried on here.  To some extent I think it is possible to argue that we do not sufficiently avail of the imperial preference concession in respect of assembled goods provided they are of 50 per cent.  Irish content. <Col N="1718" /> I should like some clarification on that point by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In connection with this part of the Bill, I should like to ask the Minister what is wrong with earning profits and having earned them what is wrong with distributing them?  Surely the aim of this Part should be to provide the maximum possible incentive to enterprising industrialists to export their goods?  Is it reasonable to debar them purely from increasing their personal incomes as a result of their initiative and enterprise?</P>
    <P>Section 12 sets out how the tax concession is obtainable.  Again, in connection with the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; used in the section I suggest that is a very vague and broad term and individual inspectors could very well query certain expenditure.  There is a further difficulty which I see as an accountant in connection with a firm which is engaged in the export and home market and has a mixed profit. Who is to say which particular portion of the profit has been utilised for development purposes?  Again, surely it is out of accord with the aim and spirit of the Bill to confine that development expenditure to expenditure incurred within the State?</P>
    <P>I will not go into too much detail on that section, but I want to suggest that there is an obvious form of development of the export market which might not qualify under the section. For example there could be the case of an exporter selling in a foreign market who would set up a sales department in a foreign country.  A firm of sufficient enterprise to carry out that step could find itself debarred from these concessions because it was development on a foreign market and not on the home market.  Again, there is the case of people solely engaged in the export trade and they could similarly find themselves debarred. These are points I should like the Minister to clarify in his reply or at some later stage.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that the standard period referred to in the Act is taken as the year ended September 30th and here I can see problems arising in which I have a particular <Col N="1719" /> technical interest.  Is the Minister in a position to tell us that, for the purposes of this section, a declaration of these export sales will satisfy the Revenue Commissioners?  If the Revenue Commissioners are going to require full manufacturing trading accounts for the purpose of this section very considerable expense will be incurred both in the office of the Inspector of Taxes, because of the extra work involved, and by the industrialists because they will have to have a separate accounting and it would be questionable whether the expense involved would justify the concession obtained.</P>
    <P>If it is necessary to prepare full accounts for this purpose I can well see individual inspectors, who would apparently have discretion in the matter, insisting on full details of trading.  If that is necessary the Minister will understand that it will require taxpayers to furnish annual accounts for the usual accounting period and then come along again and furnish further accounts for the year ended September 30th in the basic period.  That could provide a very considerable administrative difficulty.  I would like the Minister to deal with that matter and to consider the question of using as the standard period the ordinary accounting year which the individual taxpayer avails of.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  I think that the last speaker was unnecessarily concerned about the ethics or the morality of Part V.  I can see nothing wrong with it.  There is a lot of money spent on schemes of this nature.  Again I commend the Minister for the spirit of enterprise and initiative which he has shown in producing these attractive proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as I see it, is an implementation of the Government's policy as recently announced. It is definitely related not only to that policy by which we seek to get out of our present difficulties but it also has a direct relation to the policy of the past and the set-up politically and economically in this country over the last few years.  It has a direct relation to the shortage of capital that exists <Col N="1720" /> and which, whether we like it or not, is with us.  It has also a direct relation to the underdevelopment of this country.  It is a definite step forward and is a very realistic measure which will help us to come through our present difficulties.  It is a measure which undoubtedly will give great and material assistance to the efforts of our industrialists by helping them to enter the export markets and in helping us to cure our balance of payment difficulties.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy MacEntee and, while I agree with quite a lot of what he says, I think he did go a bit too far in trying to condemn some of the things contained in this measure. It is hard to reconcile his case with some of his statements in the past.  It is hard to reconcile his statement that indirect industrial taxation is too high with the statements that we know to have been made by Deputy MacEntee in the past when, as Minister for Finance, he said that it was better for the people that he should spend more of their money for them and that they should spend less.  I cannot give his exact words on that occasion, but it is very prominently in the minds of everybody, politically or economically interested in the welfare of this country.</P>
      <P>I do not want to spend most of my time in dealing with the statements made in the past by Deputy MacEntee but I would say that I think he should have approached this Bill in a fairer manner.  This Bill, as I have said, has a direct relation to the political policy over the last few years and also to the political policy of the Government of this country at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can compare the action of the Government of 1952 in rather similar circumstances&mdash;with the one very definite difference that we had not got at that time a great shortage of capital &mdash;with the steps now being taken and with the other steps that have been taken.  We find that, taking the long term view, it is obvious that the steps taken in 1952 failed.  The steam-roller Budget imposed then was dealing with an exactly similar position, with the reservation that there was then no shortage of capital and in 1955 we have reversed right back to a situation <Col N="1721" /> similar to that in which we found ourselves in 1952.  That is not a political statement by me but a statement of fact.  The present approach to our difficulties is in my view the right one and I am inclined to think that Deputy MacEntee also believes it to be the right one and believes that an increase in direct or indirect taxation is the wrong line to follow.  I think he, too, believes as I do that any approach to the problem should be the approach that has now been taken, namely, that any impost that must be put on goods or commodities to discourage people from using those commodities should be placed on the specific commodities that are the cause of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that credit should be restricted.  It was restricted by the commercial banks and I think they approached the problem very wisely.  It was necessary that there should be credit restriction in order to preserve our dwindling external assets.  However, they did not restrict credit for agriculture and I do not think they restricted credit for industry either.  They restricted credit for other purposes.  They restricted credit in cases of spending by people who should not have spent money on themselves, in cases where there was wastage.  But I think their general attitude was the correct one and they made a very real contribution towards effecting relief from our difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill proper seems to me to be one in which we seek to overcome specific difficulties.  It is not wide in its scope.  It could not be because any upheaval in our present economic setup would be totally unwise at this stage.  But it does provide for relief from taxation in respect of capital expenditure on mining.  This morning Deputy MacEntee took the same line as he did in relation to the Avoca Mines when they were being discussed. That line was that mine-owners should not get this concession.  He began his remarks on the Bill proper by saying it was not wide enough, and his second remark was that coal-mine proprietors should not have got this concession at all.</P>
    <P>I believe they should.  If we want miners to seek to bring to the surface the valuable assets buried under the <Col N="1722" /> land of this country, we must give them the opportunity of doing so without having to pay tax on capital expenditure in relation to their new shafts and openings.  It is all right to say the mining countries do not do that.  Of course they do not, because there has been mining there for years. They probably know, in fact, when they sink their shafts and spend their money that they will get a return. Ireland, however, is an absolutely new venture.  While I know nothing about the technical side of it, I may assume that, no matter what tests you have to make sure that, if you spend, say, £500,000 on a mining project, you would get an asset worth that amount, in the case of Ireland you might still be bitterly disappointed and get something not worth a penny.  This concession must be given to miners.  Mining here is different from anywhere else in the world and when we ask people to risk their capital here we should be prepared to give miners that concession.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the provisions for temporary relief from income-tax and corporation profits tax in respect of exports.  The specific problem here is our balance of payments.  If we give this specific temporary relief from taxation, we will be directing our efforts towards solving that specific problem.  We will not have the necessity of placing huge increases in taxation on the shoulders of all our people.  If we have a specific problem why not address ourselves to it?  In 1952 the general approach to this problem failed.  Why should we make the same mistake in 1956?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee may ask why should not the industrialists who are producing for the home market get a concession which will allow them increase the output of their factories? If we gave that concession we might have to increase taxation generally.  I believe it is fair to cure a specific problem by attacking it specifically.  I think the Minister has done very well in giving this temporary relief from taxation and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>The allowance for industrial buildings is again an approach on the same <Col N="1723" /> lines.  If we build up our factories we import less and export more.  We are giving there a very valuable concession and I believe the Opposition think that is so also.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that this is just another of the measures which the Government has taken to deal with our problems.  It appears now as if there is a chink in the dark cloud to be seen on the horizon.  I do not think for a moment, however, that it is any more than a chink, any more than the merest suspicion of a silver lining. Every person in this country who addresses himself to the problem must know that the measures taken by the Government have brought about this situation.  While it has been a weary wait for this improvement to come about, I believe it was better to have it brought about in this manner rather than the way Fianna Fáil attempted to do it in 1952.  I have the utmost confidence in the Minister.  This Bill has a definite approach to our specific problem and I look forward to its successful results in the economy of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sitting in this House reminds me of the situation where a man stays out in the sun all day.  By his over-indulgence, he is inclined to get a touch of the sun.  If a Deputy stays here all day listening to the speeches, both good and bad, he is inclined to get into a fog in regard to his own contribution.  To be quite frank, that is the position I find myself in now with regard to this measure. Listening to Deputy MacEntee I felt that if we were to take him seriously we should all have the creeps about the future of this country.  He gave the impression that, after surviving the Civil War, the Economic War, the last war and the various other crises that arose, it appeared now that we were at the end of our tether.  I agree with him that the situation is very bad but I also maintain that this country will go on in spite of the Deputies in this House and irrespective of whatever Deputies are in it.  This country in each generation is prepared to throw up suitable material to help the <Col N="1724" /> country out of its difficulties whatever those difficulties may be.  I would suggest that the right to guide the destiny of this country does not lie in the hands of a few individuals in this House who because of the past feel entitled to hold on forever to the reins of office.</P>
      <P>In the course of Deputy MacEntee's contribution one point struck me.  It was the fact he admitted that since 1927 he has felt that the burden of taxation has lain too heavily on the State.  He pointed out that Deputy Sweetman, the present Minister for Finance, agreed with him on this, especially while Deputy Sweetman was Minister for Finance.  Both these men had the responsibility of being in control of our financial situation.  Is that not an admission that neither of them was in a position to take any worthwhile practical measures in regard to that matter?</P>
      <P>Would it be unfair to suggest that, if they put their heads together and sat together, for a change, they might get practical results, instead of playing petty Party politics opposite each other in the House?  I can see no fundamental difference of approach on this matter here to-day, no cleavage, no real difference of opinion as to how to tackle the problems that face the country.  Every Deputy who spoke from the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Benches admitted the seriousness of the situation and all the contributions to the debate so far can be summed up by &ldquo;What is your plan?&rdquo;, hurled from one side of the House to the other.  As far as I can see, no plan has emerged from either side of the House.  Where we have unification is in the lack of concrete proposals to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance introducing this measure, stated that it was of paramount necessity to stimulate production and thereby increase exports. The measure he introduced was, I presume, intended to give the necessary fillip to industrialists within the State to export.  In so far as this measure will give the necessary encouragement to exporters, I welcome it, but I <Col N="1725" /> think the Bill is nothing to get excited about.  No great benefits will accrue to the country in the form of dynamic increases in exports from it.  The tragedy is that the Taoiseach, in his efforts to come to grips with the situation, instead of going to the root of the trouble and tackling it there, is prepared to snipe at the problem and deal with minor issues.</P>
    <P>This measure has been introduced in order to try to solve the balance of payments problem.  Reference has been made to that problem in every contribution to the debate to-day as if it were the most serious matter that could exist or the most important matter to be tackled to-day.  It is only in so far as it has reference to this Bill that I propose to deal with that problem.  Whether we increase exports to-morrow morning or not, we will still have a balance of payments problem.  If exports are doubled tomorrow morning, we will still have a balance of payments problem because the very fact that we create more wealth by producing more will stimulate a demand for more goods that must be imported and for every £ worth of goods imported, the people will demand luxuries and the more luxuries we are forced to import as a result of increased expansion here, the greater the balance of payments problem will become.  It is sheer lunacy to harp continually on the balance of payments problem.  That problem has been with us always and will be always with us, while we are tied as we are to the pound sterling.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into that aspect of the matter, but as long as we are in the sterling group and have not control over our credit or currency, a balance of payments problem will exist&mdash;whether big or small is another matter.  The tragedy is that so much time and attention is devoted to that problem, that there is more concern at the present time about that problem than there is in regard to the figures for emigration and unemployment, that there is more respect for the £1 note than there is for the family that have to leave the country. That is what this measure proves.</P>
    <P>For the nine year period ending <Col N="1726" /> 1955, we imported £1,500,000,000 worth of goods and exported £745,000,000 worth of goods.  During the same period, our income from pensions, remittances, tourism, and so forth, was £548,000,000, leaving a deficit over that nine year period of £207,000,000. The average was £23,000,000 per year in that period.  In one year, it was £61,000,000.  Is it not a fact that that lack of balance has existed for the nine years for which I have given figures and that, no matter what we may say or do, it will remain?</P>
    <P>Going back to 1947, we find Fianna Fáil were beginning to realise that the first signs of danger were appearing. They took steps at that particular stage to cut down on spending.  Every three or four years this problem arises and it is extraordinary that Deputy MacEntee maintains that it arises only when the inter-Party Government are in office or are about to leave office. To be fair, I say that this balance of payments problem has existed irrespective of whether a Fianna Fáil Government or an inter-Party Government were in office.  If we could get an honest admission that the balance of payments problem does not arise because there is an inter-Party Government in office or a Fianna Fáil Government in office, but arises irrespective of which outfit is in office, something would be achieved.</P>
    <P>Instead of being obsessed as to whether we owe £10,000,000 or have £10,000,000 too much outstanding in our balance of payments, would it not be advisable to produce at home the goods we are now importing?  Instead of having a restriction on credit and having very worthwhile capital development programmes held up, postponed or deferred on the basis that money is not available, would it not be better to allow the money that is available to go into circulation and thereby increase employment and afford an opportunity to the industrialists in Ireland to have their products or portion of them sold within the State?  Is it not a fact that, if the present rate of emigration continues, our industrialists will in future be planning on the basis of an export market only?  There will be no <Col N="1727" /> reasonably proportionate home market available to absorb production.  That stage has already been reached in many spheres.  It is no longer a paying proposition for a man to go into industry on the basis that he will have a home market for the consumption of his goods.  At the rate at which we are losing people through emigration the majority of our industrialists will in future have to depend more and more on the export market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry was quite right in emphasising the things that are not brought within the scope of this Bill. I challenge contradiction now of the fact that we import in foodstuffs, processed and unprocessed, at the rate of £2 per family per week.  That is the import figure for foodstuffs over the years.  Those foodstuffs could be and should be produced here.  Would not that be a more practical way in which to deal with our balance of payments problem?  Would it not be better to offer the essential attractive terms to the producer here to induce him to produce those foodstuffs for our own people instead of trying to generate enthusiasm for an export market amongst a limited number of industrialists? That is what this Bill is seeking to do.</P>
    <P>I say there is nothing in this Bill about which to get excited.  It does not reach the fundamentals.  The land is there.  The people, to a limited number, are still there.  Instead of bringing these palliatives, which will only have a limited effect, the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government should get down to the serious problem of producing within the State the goods that are at present imported.  We know that the restrictions which the Minister had to impose earlier this year have caused a certain amount of hardship.  They have caused hardship in the distributive trades. Many have lost their work in the distributive trades because of the import restrictions and because we felt that the balance of payments problem was a serious one.  We could have avoided all that hardship had we said: &ldquo;Instead of hitting at all these semi-luxuries, we will block our ports in so far as the <Col N="1728" /> admission of foodstuffs is concerned and give the necessary guarantees to the primary producer here to enable him to produce the articles here.&rdquo;  Is it not a better proposition to give a guaranteed price to the man who is prepared to grow malting barley rather than pay three times as much to a man 3,000 miles away to send that food here?  The same applies to wheat and all the other foodstuffs that are imported now.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I can see no new approach on the part of this Government.  I can see no difference between the approach of this Government and the approach of Fianna Fáil in the past on this question of external assets and the balance of payments.  To give them their due, Fianna Fáil have always worshipped at the sacred altar of external assets.  When the inter-Party Government came into office, having listened to their keymen, I thought there would be a change of mentality and a change of approach on this question of external assets.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  They have bowed down even lower in worship before the sacred altar of external assets than Fianna Fáil ever did.  That leaves the public in general very depressed. Fianna Fáil have made their policy very clear.  We know where they stand, and we can take it or leave it. But, with regard to the inter-Party Government, we do not know what exactly is the guiding influence and the controlling principle as far as finance is concerned.  Is it the old orthodox policy that has been pursued for the last 30 years?  Is that still controlling our destiny?</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has enumerated the various stages of crises through which we have gone, which we have managed to surmount or from which we have succeeded in protecting ourselves. It cannot be denied that our finances are in a perilous state.  It cannot be denied that the volume of emigration is suicidal from a national point of view.  It cannot be denied that the unemployment problem is very, very grave.  It cannot be denied that taken all round our country is in a bad way.  All that is admitted.  Yet, have we changed one single iota from <Col N="1729" /> the financial policy pursued over the last 34 years?</P>
    <P>Have we not pursued down along the years the same orthodox financial policy all the time?  Where has it got us to-day?  Is it fair that we should blindly follow the same financial policy over the next 30 years, the policy that has brought us to the present impasse?  A change of mentality is essential if we are to bring the country out of the state in which it is to-day.  We want a new approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello said to-day that he is as interested in solving emigration and unemployment as I or any other Deputy.  I never suggested that he was not interested.  But I suggest now that the path that Deputy Costello is travelling is the path that has been trod for the past 30 years without any success in remedying unemployment and emigration.  I think I am entitled to emphasise that at every possible opportunity.  The solutions that have been adopted in the past have proved a failure.  It is time new solutions were found and a new outlook adopted.</P>
    <P>Our balance of payments position can be affected by devaluation.  In reply to a question, the Minister told me that we have full control over our credit and currency.  I could hardly beheve my ears when he gave that reply.  He did not even blink.  Would the Minister agree that when devaluation took place in 1949 we lost 30 per cent. of our external assets?  Had we any control then?  Had we any say when import prices, about which we have heard so much under this Bill, went up in the following two years by 47 per cent?  Had we any control then? Is it not a fact that we are at the mercy of outside influences in all these things?  It is unfair to penalise the public.  It is unfair to say to the public: &ldquo;If you tighten your belts this week things will improve next week.&rdquo; Is it not unfair to suggest that the position can be remedied in that way when outside influences may completely alter the position in two years' time?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me some information about these coal-mining <Col N="1730" /> concessions.  In my constituency there is a good deal of coal-mining. The difficulty confronting the people in Roscommon over the years has been the difficulty of getting a market.  I have seen the coal lying outside with no market for it.  In the last 12 months practically all the mines in Roscommon and Leitrim closed down because there was no market for their commodity.  Many of the workers had years of training and the majority of them went to England and Wales and are working there at present.  How does the Minister hope that the incentive in this Bill will provide employment for these men who have now left?  Is it felt that the concessions offered in this measure will be attractive to the mine-owners and, if so, how can they get a market if they go into further production?</P>
    <P>The position is that there is no market available at the moment and I would like the Minister to explain how the incentive in this measure is going to provide a market.  I know we all want to see our minerals exploited and developed, and that applies of course to our coal deposits equally.  I feel we should, as the saying is, leave no stone unturned to get maximum production but I think there are other ways of going about it apart from offering very attractive terms.  If British coal is available, or American coal secured through British sources or any other sources, there is a certain element in this country who will buy the imported commodity in preference to the home-produced and I believe we should not have this foreign coal made available.  The simplest way out of it is that if you have no foreign coal available there will be a market for the home-produced coal.  Only for the fact that foreign coal is available in such liberal quantities, the miners in Arigna would be working to-day because there would be a market for the home-produced commodity.</P>
    <P>I have even seen a big State company utilising foreign fuel in preference to excellent fuel available to them at Arigna, and they were allowed to get away with that.  The Minister will not discuss, of course, what is at the back of all this.  I have <Col N="1731" /> often asked in this House why it is we are allowing in so much coal.  Would it not be a simple matter to put on an embargo to prevent the coal coming in?  Would that not be simpler than trying to do it indirectly through this measure by giving an incentive to colliery owners to increase their production?</P>
    <P>Of course that cannot be done, we know, because of the 1938 Agreement. We are bound hand and foot by that to import whatever coal Britain wants us to take and we cannot get out of that agreement, as far as I can judge.  At any rate we have made no move to get out of it.  We have the extraordinary situation in which Britain cannot produce enough coal for herself.  At times she has to import coal from America. Yet, we insist on keeping up our end of the 1938 agreement by importing coal from her.  I think we should get that position clarified, and as far as Britain is concerned let us make it clear that we will not be tied to any agreement regarding the purchase of coal and that we will utilise our home-produced fuel, peat, water and coal, so far as it is available, to replace this foreign fuel.  If the Minister took that line of approach it would not be so necessary to give these further incentives to mine-owners.</P>
    <P>There is another section on which I would like some information, Section 16.  It is a matter of clarification.  I feel there may be a clash there with the Undeveloped Areas Act.  There are certain provisions at the moment by which facility or at least priority, is given to industrialists in undeveloped areas.  I wonder if there will now be a clash of interests so far as the development of new industries is concerned, whether further attractive concessions will be made in the undeveloped areas as a result of this measure, or whether the concessions now being made available generally will detract in any way from the attractions already in existence for undeveloped areas.  Will there be a reduction, so far as these areas are concerned, in the attractions available up to now?  If you like it could be put this way: Will the increased <Col N="1732" /> attractions now offered to industrialists to set up in Dublin or Kildare or anywhere else react unfavourably on the undeveloped areas?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question and I would ask the Minister to refer to it if he has time.  What bearing has this Bill on our distilling industry?  I do not want to delay the House but I have here a copy of distillers' report over a number of years.  They made this report available to the Minister&mdash;it was last year, actually&mdash;in which they put up a case for certain reductions in taxation and so on in order to give them a chance to get into the export market.  I would like the Minister to let us know, if he can do so briefly, are there attractions in this measure that facilitate any of the distillers who are anxious to expand their trade to the Canadian and American markets in particular, for the sale of whiskey?</P>
    <P>In any efforts that are being made by the Minister or by the Government to expand industry preference should be given, I maintain, to those industries which are based on the land.  It may be that a certain amount of benefit can be got through assembling industries which give employment, but the industry that is depending on the land for its raw material should in my opinion, get preference over any industry that has to import its raw materials.  The industry to which I referred a few moments ago, whiskey, depends on the land for the barley and everything in connection with it. These raw materials are produced within the State and if, as the position has been up to the present, that the distillers maintain that the home market has not been available to them, or in other words, that the cost of commodities has been driven up in recent years with the result that there is no demand on the home market for their output, will the Minister not tell me now whether he thinks the case made by the distillers that the home market is not able to absorb their product or even two-thirds of it, will still stand?  Will they, under this measure, be still in the position in which they will be putting up excuses that incentives and attractions are <Col N="1733" /> necessary for them to go into the export market in a big way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has ranged over a very wide field.  It has ranged over a field dealing not merely with this Bill and its provisions in their true application and implications, but also in relation somewhat to our entire economic position.  It would therefore perhaps be better that I should, at the outset, deal with some of the economic implications on the economy in general before I come to consider and discuss some of the points that were raised in regard to the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, when he opened the debate for the Opposition, raised, too, some of these general matters.  This morning Deputy Declan Costello did the same, perhaps in a wider sphere. Deputy MacEntee followed on that sphere and Deputy McQuillan also did the same.  Deputy Declan Costello is a young man who has come into public life and who, by his speeches here, makes it clear that he is endeavouring to the best of his ability to analyse in a serious way our economic problems and the methods which are, in his view, best to meet those problems and difficulties.  It is a very good thing that young people would make a serious appraisal in that way.</P>
      <P>I am afraid, however, that I must say I disagree entirely with the remedy suggested by Deputy Declan Costello this morning.  I think the remedy suggested by him was based on an insufficient appraisal of certain facts with which I must deal.  Whatever about Deputy Declan Costello, it is relevant in that connection to consider the proposals that were put forward by Deputy Lemass some 12 months ago&mdash; proposals published on the 12th October, 1955, having been outlined by Deputy Lemass, not in this House but at a meeting of his Party in Clery's Restaurant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals that were made by Deputy Lemass at that time, to a degree even greater than they were touched on by Deputy Declan Costello this morning, were aimed at the creation of credit with all its inflationary effects.  I must say one thing <Col N="1734" /> now in relation to Deputy MacEntee's speech.  He said Deputy Declan Costello attacked the banks.  I do not think that was a fair criticism of Deputy Declan Costello because I do not think Deputy Declan Costello meant his speech as an attack an anyone, much less on the banks.</P>
    <P>It is vital that, in our present economic circumstances particularly, Deputies and the public outside this House should realise as far as possible the economic implications of any further trend towards inflation.  We have here an economy which is, perhaps, more open than any economy anywhere else, and as soon as one has in an open economy inflation of the type suggested by Deputy Lemass 12 months ago, the result is bound to be that it has the effect, not of driving up internal prices but of bringing in imports from outside to meet the inflation so created.</P>
    <P>The effect of the remedies that were suggested by Deputy Lemass 12 months ago would be to make our balance of payments situation infinitely worse and far more precarious in regard to our economy as a whole.  We must accept that one of the difficulties with which we are faced is that there are many things here that require to be done&mdash;things it is desirable to do but which, if people try to do too much all at once, will result in complete failure, or worse, in the collapse of their efforts.</P>
    <P>The proposals that were adumbrated by Deputy Lemass then were clearly based on Keynesian economics, relevant perhaps in the circumstances of the 1930's but entirely irrelevant to-day.  In the 1930's when Deputy Lemass was in Government, the difficulty throughout the world was rather one of excessive saving.  It was not one of excessive spending.  It was to meet those difficulties that theories were put forward by Keynes at that time.</P>
    <P>It has taken Deputy Lemass some 20 years to realise what was then meant, and he is trying to suggest now that the remedies that might have been applicable to an entirely different set of circumstances in the 1930's, are suitable in 1956 when our difficulty is, far <Col N="1735" /> from excessive saving, excessive spending and too little saving.  We have got to realise in relation to programmes by public authorities that such programmes must be financed in a way that they will not impose an undue strain on the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>If a programme by a public authority is so financed that it will cause a long drain on our balance of payments, the ultimate result will be that the country will not have sufficient external reserves to purchase the raw materials that are required for industry&mdash;the raw materials and other things we cannot produce at home&mdash; and we shall be faced with an economic situation involving a collapse of employment such as any of us would shudder to contemplate.  It is because I see that possibility at the end of the policy that was adumbrated 12 months ago by Deputy Lemass that I want to-day to make clear exactly where lies the difference between his line and the line that I believe should be pursued in relation to our financial problems at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have had, over the past eight years, a programme of capital expenditure which was financed, in addition to savings, partly by the Marshall Aid funds, partly by departmental reserves and partly by the external assets of the commercial banks.  It was a programme which included both productive and unproductive expenditure.  One of the things of which I am most proud is the fact that, in the past couple of years, I have been able to achieve a change in the trend of capital expenditure so that now far more emphasis is given to productive expenditure.  Talking very roughly only some two-fifths of our capital expenditure used to be utilised for productive purposes.  We have in the past couple of years been able to increase that percentage by 50 per cent. and we have now been able to bring the productive proportion of that programme up to some 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in the time ahead, we will be able to increase still more the emphasis on productive development and, with that productive development, we will get the real increase in our economic conditions that all of us <Col N="1736" /> desire and that every Party in this House would wish to see.  That capital expenditure of all public authorities has, as I said, been financed over the past six years or so by three different methods.  It is only right, having regard to what was said here this morning, that the share in that development that was undertaken by the commercial banks should be stated clearly and without reserve.  In the past six years, from 1950-51 up to the current financial year, the amount of the share which the commercial banks have taken towards financing that capital expenditure is some £33,000,000 or roughly one-fifth of the amount involved.  I think it is only right that that should be understood when we are discussing their contribution, as we were discussing it this morning.</P>
    <P>In relation to the policy, so far as I am concerned, of capital development, I want to make myself quite clear in quite a simple sentence.  I believe that what we need here is the largest possible productive capital development that the public will sustain and that, in relation to that, the emphasis must be on two things&mdash;on &ldquo;productive&rdquo; and on &ldquo;sustain&rdquo;.  If we dissipate our resources on non-productive expenditure, then we will find at the end of the time that that expenditure has made not a healthier economy but a less healthy economy.  It is for that reason that I have endeavoured to switch from unproductive to productive work.  If we fix that programme above the level which the people will sustain, then, inevitably, as surely as day follows night, we will be met with balance of payments difficulties and problems, and, if they were to be allowed to continue over any protracted period, the result would be the type of collapse to which I referred earlier.  I am determined, in so far as I can, to prevent that.</P>
    <P>Any form of credit creation over and above the capital programme that the public will sustain, whether voluntarily through savings given to small savings, to national loans, or by reason of taxation being utilised to finance capital works, can be met only by drawing on external reserves in the <Col N="1737" /> open economy which we have.  As I said recently outside this House, we no longer have the props towards that which we had before.</P>
    <P>The external reserves of the commercial banks are lower and, in relation to that, I am not going to discuss gross reserves or net reserves.  The only thing I think is relevant in that context is the available external resources.  We have not got the Marshall Aid Counterpart Funds, in reference to which I will be answering two questions on to-day's Order Paper.  We have not got the reserves of departmental funds to the extent to which they were available in the past.  We are, therefore, in the position that it is vital to our economy, if we wish to have capital development, to pay for that development by doing without, now, some of the things that might be pleasant but that are not so essential for us.</P>
    <P>One cannot have a sound, healthy, economic, progressive development except at the expense of foregoing some pleasure of the moment in order to achieve the ultimate result of a progressively higher standard of living. Deputies will remember that, when I introduced the special import levies last March, one of the provisions I made in respect to the moneys that would be obtained by these levies was that the amount would be paid not to revenue but to capital account.</P>
    <P>The levies, in order to deal with our balance of payments situation then evident, were intended to have a twofold effect.  They were intended, in the first instance, to operate as a deterrent from purchases of those imports; a deterrent because the imports themselves would be deterred on the one hand, and in addition, because of the psychological effect, as the deterrent over other spheres of unnecessary imports that their imposition would undoubtedly provide.  But that is not the only basis upon which their efficacy can or should be judged.  The second part of the effect of their imposition was that they eliminated, to the amount that was collected by those levies, deficit financing in an inflationary way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> The moneys that were obtained by the levies, and transferred into the capital fund, eliminated to that extent the need to inject any further inflationary force into the economy.  When one considers the effect of the levies on our balance of payments problems, it is vital to do so, not merely in the deterrent context, but also in the context of the amount that was thereby made available for financing capital expenditure and made available in a way that was not inflationary.  We must try to ensure by every means in our power that we do not do anything at this juncture which would have the effect of undoing the improvement in our balance of trade and with it, our balance of payments, that has resulted from the measures taken by me on behalf of the Government in the past eight months.</P>
    <P>There has been an improvement in the balance of trade.  It is an improvement which is evident in the figures, and I am talking about a time before any question of the Middle East arose. It is an improvement which was there to see, but it was an improvement that arose because of the measures taken by the Government.  If those measures were relaxed, or if we were to revise them completely, as Deputy Declan Costello suggested at the end of his speech, by a policy of credit expansion in an inflationary manner, then we would be merely undoing everything that was done since the Government, with a proper and due sense of responsibility, went out to rectify the situation last March.  They succeeded in bringing about a much bigger change than people at the time expected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that the sole improvement in these months arose because of a drawing down of stocks.  Some of the improvement is undoubtedly due to that, but the figures he quoted are not, in my view, the accurate figures upon which to base a judgment.  If one turns to the 1955 Statistical Survey, one will find there that the volume of stocks, excluding the value of the change in the numbers of live stock on farms, increased by £5,000,000.  That compares with an increase of £400,000 in 1954. The change in the volume of non-agricultural <Col N="1739" /> stocks between 1954 and 1955 was thus about £4,500,000.</P>
    <P>On the basis, therefore, of the estimates now available to us, stock changes accounted for less than £5,000,000 of the deficit of £35,500,000 in the balance of payments in 1955. Perhaps when Deputy Lemass was speaking he did not advert to certain revisions that were made in estimates published earlier and, in addition, I think he took a figure for commercial stocks, extracted from a Central Bank bulletin, without adverting to other compensatory figures in other respects or over the economy as a whole.  It is an undeniable fact, as I said yesterday when I was introducing this Bill, that a great part of our difficulty in relation to our international account arises from factors completely beyond our control.  It arises because we in this country cannot under any circumstances control the price of things we have to buy from abroad, nor can we control the price we can get for the things that we want to sell abroad.</P>
    <P>The terms of trade in the past four years, since 1953, have consistently worsened for the economy of our country.  There has been a consistent rise in the things we want to buy and a consistent fall in what we are able to obtain abroad for the things we have to sell.  In the third quarter of this year, the terms of trade were no leas than 12 per cent. worse than they were in the same quarter of 1953.  In the first nine months of this year, that deterioration in terms of trade was responsible for our having no less than £10,000,000 of the trade deficit which accrued during that period.  The fact that we have no control over those terms of trade; the fact that they are moving against us and may move against us even more in the future&mdash; I do not mean at an accelerated rate but they may increase against us in the future&mdash;make it far more essential that, in respect of the matters over which we have control within our own economy, we should take the appropriate steps in order to remedy and overcome them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;simply a continuance Bill of the standard type.  It proposes little more. Deputy Boland last night commented on the fact that it was possible to give effect to the recommendations of a commission that had reported later than the two years, which I think was the interval from the other report.  Perhaps it could be argued that the matters to be dealt with in the second case were essentially simpler and could be more expeditiously dealt with from the point of view of preparing a Bill.  I do not see that there was a great deal of difference having regard to the lapse of time.  I do not think the Minister or any Minister could attribute the delays merely to the delays of preparing a Bill to implement the commission's report as it stands. That report is explicit and definite. It is accepted that the time involved in the preparation of a Bill and the routine consideration that arises in the preparation of any Bill would not be sufficient excuse for failing to present the Bill here to-day or indeed to have presented it a matter of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine the fundamental problem here is that the Government and the Minister have not made up their minds on matters of policy arising under that code.  I am not saying that the thing can be dismissed as an easy matter.  It is not.  There are problems there, but the fact is that arising out of the Conroy Report on a very large number of points, serious matters of policy are involved.  One matter was touched on by another Deputy here yesterday in regard to lock-up shops.  That is only an indicator.  There is the question of furnished lettings, the question of application to newly built houses; there is, in fact, the whole question of the conflict between the owner of property who is using it as an investment and the occupier who is interested in the property primarily as the roof over <Col N="1741" /> his head.  There are serious policy matters involved in this, and neither this Government nor this Minister has given any indication as to what the policy in these matters is.</P>
    <P>This debate is an occasion when at least that could be clarified.  The Minister's introduction to the Bill was so short and cursory as to give rise to the suspicion that it was simply tossed up in the routine way for reenactment, giving just that scant consideration which is given to reenactments, and that this measure is indefinitely shelved.  I will not pretend that the Rent Restrictions Act and the rent code are as urgent as some other of the national problems that are facing us.  I am not trying to suggest that this should be given over-all priority.  Nevertheless, within the bailiwick of the Minister for Justice and his Department there are few measures that can compete with this measure in the matter of public importance and urgency.</P>
    <P>We have had the Minister recently introducing a number of lawyers' Bills. These Bills, desirable as they are for amending the law and improving things from the point of view particularly of practitioners and litigants, may be all very well and very desirable, but we got on very well with the Statute of Limitations code as it was for a long time.  We have had introduced here a most detailed and carefully drafted lawyers' Bill which apparently was a preoccupation of the Department of Justice for the last while back, the measure dealing with married women's property, in relation to which if the average citizen was asked to decide which was the more important public matter, he would say this rent code was infinitely more important than the relatively restricted measure dealing with married women's property.  We have had tortfeasors' Bills and various relatively insignificant measures of that nature brought and brought very well before us.</P>
    <P>Do not let me run down the Minister on account of that.  From the lawyers' point of view and from the point of view of legal nicety and legal thoroughness there has been quite a good job done on these measures, but when it <Col N="1742" /> comes to a matter of general public interest involving questions of policy that the Government should face up to, a Continuation Bill is brought in here in the most perfunctory and routine manner.  Does it mean that in this, as in very many other things, this Government is unable to make up its mind when it comes to serious matters?  Is it again the case, as instanced yesterday in passing off the business we had here when we could not get even the unemployment problem looked at in its proper light, that serious matters of policy&mdash;and there are serious matters of policy involved in this Bill&mdash;cannot be grappled with?</P>
    <P>This is not a simple measure.  I know that at every stage of importance, at every point where legislation of the nature about which I am speaking rises above the routine lawyers' level to which I have referred in the case of the other Bills, there will be different points of view with substance behind them and there will be certain difficulties in arriving at a decision, and when a decision is arrived at that decision will be open to controversy. That is quite true but then what is the Government there for but to deal with these questions, to make up its own mind, to propound its views and to have the moral courage to propound its views and to stick to them if it really believes in them?  What is the Government or the Minister there for but to do precisely that?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House by going into detail but there was one case mentioned yesterday.  There is the question of furnished lettings, the question of the application of the Act in point of time, and there are innumerable points touching every tenant in the country in fact, touching nearly every member of the community in the urban areas anyway.  There are points of policy involved in that.  The Minister could have availed himself of this occasion to propound at least the problems if not his views.  It is not sufficient to say a thing is under consideration. We have had typical jokes in the funny journals not only in this country but in others in regard to the various stages of consideration a matter can have in a ministerial <Col N="1743" /> Department.  It used to be customary to say: &ldquo;The matter is under consideration&rdquo; until it became synonomous with: &ldquo;The matter is on the very long finger&rdquo;.  Then somebody thought of adding: &ldquo;The matter is under active consideration&rdquo;.  We sometimes say &ldquo;urgent consideration&rdquo; and various other variants of the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, which in that context means nothing more than a shelf that it is hoped will remain untouched for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Why am I criticising the Minister on this?  I do not think he is treating the House properly in not giving us at least a report on the progress made in examining this matter.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that either I or any other Deputy can ask a question.  We can, but what is the use if the only answer we get, as I got recently in respect of a question, is that the matter is under consideration? The initiative lies with the Government. What is the Government there for but to give a lead to the community? Here in the bailiwick of the Minister for Justice is an important matter.  Why cannot he give us a lead and give us a concrete realisation of the problems of delay?  By doing that, he will make democracy work and make it simpler and easier for the people to accept the ultimate decisions arrived at.  It is only common sense to approach the matter in that way.</P>
    <P>Even if the decision was against me as an ordinary man, I would be more prone to understand the reason and accept it if I see the matter is being re-examined and the rational reasons why the decision was given against me. Surely it would make it easier for the Government or its successor to deal at least with the problems that are the cause of the delay&mdash;problems of policy in respect of which apparently this Government has not yet been able to make up its mind as to a decision. These problems of policy, these conflicting interests, should be pinpointed. I appreciate&mdash;let me not be unreasonable&mdash;that the matter is bristling with difficulty.  Again, I think the Minister is hardly treating the House in the most helpful way by not making some statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> The Minister may have wondered perhaps why I embarked on this line. I can give him two very good reasons. Actually, I have given the first.  This is a matter of public importance.  The Minister is not crowded out with business.  In regard to Tortfeasors' Bills and Statutes of Limitations, there is time for consideration.  There is a less worthy reason perhaps, but, nevertheless, it is a reason.  I know the Minister would not and did not scruple to use it.  When the Minister's colleagues in the Government were on this side of the House, why were they so insistent on this Bill?  Deputy Boland, I think, reminded the House that in his time there was an attempt to refuse the passage of the Bill for six months.  There was an uproar and I think the present Taoiseach&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;or at least leading members of the Government took a most active part and divided the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to arraign them on that.  As an Opposition, they were entitled to do that, but, having done it, if, when they were in Government, they found they could not do it as quickly as they said they could, I would be inclined to be reasonable in the matter, but in that case I would at least expect that the Government and the Minister responsible in that Government would give to the House and the country an indication why it was not possible to follow the line.  If we were to insist in the same way upon a six months' time limit on him, it would be very relevant to ask him, in the light of all that has happened, why could he not comply with that requirement ?</P>
    <P>As I say, I have a pretty good idea, but the time has come when the Minister should say so.  As in the matter of the exploitation of the unemployed by the Tánaiste, the cost of living and so forth by the Taoiseach and the rest, so also in this.  I say that this Government, in the light of the way the Minister has acted in this, is open to the charge of insincerity.  Surely, the Minister can examine what are the problems in bringing in legislation of that nature?  I am not even going so far as to ask him to make final decisions without due consideration. <Col N="1745" /> Goodness knows, there has been plenty of time to consider these matters, but I urge him to do that before he concludes. The paralysis of decision that has seized upon this Government in many respects and their inability to push things to a conclusion or get effective action for the benefit of the community will not, I hope, deteriorate to the degree where the actual problems that are there will not even be recognised.</P>

The Deputy stated that on one occasion the inter-Party group, when on that side of the House, challenged his colleague and brought this matter to a division.

I submit that two reasonable men should be able to listen to what the other side of the story is without saying something which is practically offensive.

      <P>All I want to say is that they had ample time if they thought it was an easy problem.

I am sure knowing the present Minister for Justice and the Government they will give a decision on the matter as early as possible.  I only wanted to comment on that matter and to make sure that there is no misunderstanding.

I want to raise one problem that exists in many parts of the country and in the county I represent.  I do not see anything in the Bill, for instance, dealing with the purchase of lands from people who are not of this country and who have been referred to by the Minister and his colleagues as &ldquo;Cromwellians&rdquo;. I understood from public statements made by the Minister and some of the Deputies on the Government Benches that this matter would be dealt with last year, not this year, but I fail to see any section in this Bill dealing with the matter.  I want to know from the Minister is that question being considered, actively or otherwise, in his Department, and if it is will some provision dealing with it be included in <Col N="1747" /> a further Bill brought before the House before the end of next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland asked why it was that I dealt with the second Conroy report first.  As I stated earlier, Deputy Boland is well aware of the fact that the report on reversionary leases affects only a small number of people whereas the first Conroy report on rent control affects tens of thousands.  Deputy Boland criticises me because while he was a Minister and we were in opposition we challenged him about not bringing in a Bill between 1952 and 1954.  If Deputy de Valera has any doubts on that aspect I will say that Deputy Boland can give him all the assistance and enlightenment about the delay that occurred even in 1954.  Since then, Deputies will admit, the Government has had to deal, particularly last year, with the housing problem and with other national problems.  They have had to consider very carefully the whole position in the light of events that may take place in international affairs.  I think that Deputies will realise that this is not an opportune time to bring in permanent legislation dealing with this very important national problem.</P>
      <P>That being so, the Government is examining all aspects of the matter. They had to examine the position in the light of all the events.  Since 1952 something like 50,000 houses were built while a further 20,000 were reconstructed, so that the position to-day is quite different from that at the time when the report was submitted to my predecessor.  In the general housing plan of the Government, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance have a direct interest.  I should not like to be put in the position of advising the Government at the present time without having all the material and the facts before me on such an important matter as rent control.  I think that is a reasonable position to take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government was faced with many problems, including the international situation, and I am not in a position to guarantee that the report <Col N="1748" /> on rent control can be dealt with very soon as Deputy de Valera wants it dealt with.  The whole matter will have to be dealt with in the light of events as we find them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence had the hardihood to come in here and state that he and other members of his Party were justified in the view they took when in opposition, in pressing me to bring in a Bill arising out of the report of the commission that was presented to me in 1952.  I do not think that I had the report in my hands more than 12 months before these demands for action were being made.  As I pointed out, and I now repeat, there was no necessity at all for that commission. The problems which arose at the time were well known in the Department of Justice, but when legislation which had been running for five years was about to expire the Minister at the time, to avoid bringing in new legislation, decided to appoint a commission as the Government did in all other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I got that report I decided to leave it for at least 12 months so that interested parties would have an opportunity of studying it and making representations to their Deputies. Now the Minister is trying to justify not doing anything two and a half years after I left office.  I suppose I had not the report in my hand for more than 18 months altogether. Deputy Sweetman, the present Minister for Finance, was one of those who pressed for a division and another was the Minister for Health. They insisted that six months was ample time in which to do it.  Now they have the audacity to come in here and say 2½ years afterwards that there is an excuse for not bringing in <Col N="1749" /> a Bill which they considered to be of such urgency that it should be brought in within almost six months after the report had been brought in.  I think that is going a bit too far.</P>
    <P>Now we have another excuse&mdash;the international situation.  What has the international situation and the building of houses to do with the problem of rent control?  Nothing whatever. As far as I can see the thing has been shelved quite definitely.  But when the Government changes&mdash;and it looks as if it certainly will&mdash;I daresay the people sitting on the Government Benches now will have the nerve to get up again and press for a Bill which they failed to bring in themselves.  The Minister for Defence was quite right. I did undoubtedly say there was never any necessity for that commission. But since the commission sat and made its report, we were bound to take notice of that report.</P>

      <P>I shall talk about the delay.  It is a more serious matter than the Government may appreciate.  In every town in the country there are artisans' dwellings going into decay. Landlords or owners may own one, two or three of these houses.  They are offering to give them away to get out of their liability.  They are letting them fall down because the rent allowed under the law is not sufficient.  The Minister for Finance is intimately concerned with this because he has to provide the money to build new houses. In a small town near where I live I know of over a dozen houses at the moment.  A few years ago they were reasonably good houses.  The owners own two or three houses each&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Only certain sections of the public can be charged under the Rent Restriction Act.  I believe everybody who builds houses should be brought in under this Bill when it becomes law.  I do not see why there should be one law for one section of the community and another law for the other.  We should try and make this a just and impartial Bill which will be fair both to tenant and landlord.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking before the Adjournment I had been dealing with the methods by which up to this our public capital programme had been financed.  I had been dealing with the three ways that had been utilised in addition to the normal method of savings.  I had explained that one of them, the Marshall Aid Counterpart Loan, was completely exhausted and the two others were now much attenuated and were required in other directions.  They are the external reserves of the commercial banks and the external reserves of departmental funds.</P>
      <P>It is because the normal method, savings, is there, as the basis upon which there must be any capital development in the future, if we are not to have further inflation resulting in balance of payments deficits, that the Government has been for some very considerable time stressing the necessity of savings.  In relation to that, we must remember that the capital programme of public authorities is only one part of the draw on the available capital of the community, that if the whole pool of savings is not sufficient to meet the requirements of public authorities and of the private sector of the economy, the effect of too high a proportion being taken in one sector may mean, and will mean, less for the other sector.  If the pool of savings is restricted and the public programme takes up too much of that pool, the effect will be that there will be less capital available for the development that is required, and urgently required, in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, therefore, take any and every step that lies open to us to increase the volume of savings in the community.  We must realise that, having regard to the absence of the three props which were there in the past and to which I referred, if we want productive capital development in future, as I think every Party in this House does want, realising that on it will depend the chance of a progressive increase in the economy of the country, it must be sustained, and adequately sustained, by a proper volume of <Col N="1752" /> savings.  That will not be the case merely for this Government.  It will be the case for the Government&mdash;it will be a long time off&mdash;that succeeds this one and it will be the case for the Government that succeeds that one again.</P>
    <P>We must realise that, if we are to be able to get the development of the kind that we want, we must be prepared to do without some of the things that we might like for our most immediate needs.  It was on that account that the selection of certain less essential articles was made in the lists of the import levies that were introduced. Real works of development are better than things like furs or television sets.  That is the principle upon which the import levies were based.</P>
    <P>So much for the general economic picture that was thrown up during the course of this debate.  There were certain other incidental things that were mentioned by Deputies, as apart from the actual Bill, to which I might refer very briefly. Deputy Lemass said that I had called the situation a desperate situation. That was not the word I used or would use.  It is a serious situation but one which can be surmounted by proper steps taken to surmount it and it is improper of Deputy Lemass to endeavour to put into my mouth words that I never uttered.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, when he was speaking, referred to the interest rates on national loans.  I think the appropriate thing in considering, as he was considering, the interest rates on different loans, is not just to take the rate of interest on any particular loan but to take the rate of interest on that loan in relation to the general international rate of interest prevailing at the time and, if the Deputy cares to take the matter on that basis and to compare the rates that I offered vis-a-vis, for example, the rates then available for similar gilt-edged securities in the British market, he will find that my margin is much nearer than was his margin.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the results of the National Loan the other day.  It is, of course, a matter for regret that only £9,000,000, instead of <Col N="1753" /> £12,000,000 was subscribed if the effect of that means that the £3,000,000 has got to be found in other ways and that the £3,000,000 that will now be put in to fill the vacuum there would be available otherwise if the full subscription had been made but, while that is so, it is also a matter for congratulation in relation to the loan that the number of small subscribers was far greater than had recently been the case and that the loan was subscribed to the extent of 75 per cent. at a time when the international situation had developed in the Middle East in a way that nobody visualised.  The comparative course, for example, of our loan here and the Australian loan that was floated in London on more or less the same terms showed that our results, in that international situation, were far better than those obtained by Australia, who got approximately only £2,500,000 out of the £7,000,000 for which they were looking.</P>
    <P>Criticisms were made by Deputy Lemass in relation to the provisions in this measure, that one of the things that should have been included, in particular, was relief in respect of the acquisition of costs of mines.  I find it very, very hard indeed to accept from Deputy Lemass that brazen assertion when I remember that it was his Government, in 1946, that brought in a provision for writing off certain development costs in relation to mines and quite specifically excluded from the 1946 Act the cost of acquisition to which he refers to-day.  In fact, it would be fair for me to say that there was hardly one sentence that was uttered by Deputy Lemass yesterday, when he was speaking on the provisions of the Bill, that was not open to the charge that they, on their side of the House, had 19 years to endeavour to utilise this form of mining tax legislation and the form that I operated in relation to metallic or non-bedded ores early this year and that, during those 19 years, they never brought in any such tax incentive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the outcome of Deputy <Col N="1755" /> Lemass's speech was in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  At one stage he suggested it was undesirable that there should be the type of tax concession given in this Bill and then he passed from that, as far as I could follow him, and agreed that the type of tax concession given here was the only type available or open to us in present circumstances in order to get any kind of result within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>When we introduced, 12 months ago, the tax incentives for metallic mining, we were told by the Opposition then that those incentives would not have any effect.  We were told they would be ineffective and would not produce the results required.  I suggest in relation to this Bill, in relation to its work as a tax incentive for getting the particular type of work done in regard to coal which is visualised here, in relation to getting the increase in exports that is visualised here, it is fair for us to make a comparison as between where we stood before that last Bill was passed and where we stand now.</P>
      <P>As a result of the action we took then, £500,000 has already been spent on development in Avoca.  A further £750,000 will be spent next year to bring the Avoca mine into production. There were then 80 men employed in Avoca.  To-day there are 250 men. Next year, there will be about 500 men employed.  Mineral exploratory work is going on at Beauparc in Meath and Allihies in Cork.  Surveys are being undertaken in other parts of the country.  It is not unfair to say that before the introduction of these measures in relation to metallic ores interest in mining in Ireland was virtually dead and the steps that were taken by us have meant a greater effort towards exploiting whatever mineral resources we may possess, and mineral exploration is now going on at a greater rate than at any time during the past 30 years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry addressed the House last night and this morning, but not of course on the terms of the Bill.  Perhaps that might be too much to expect.  Deputy Corry talked first of all of the effect this might have on agricultural production directly.  This Bill gives a concession by way of a diminution of tax which a company would have to pay under Schedule D.  That is a tax in relation to assessed profits.  We all know that farmers pay under Schedule A or <Col N="1757" /> Schedule B, if they pay at all, and not under Schedule D.  Those rates are fixed and therefore there cannot be an increasing excess for taxation such as there would be under Schedule D.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with one remark made by Deputy McQuillan.  He said the industries we should push forward as far as we possibly can are those which are based on native raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty we have had to face in relation to our balance of payments has been to some extent a difficulty created by the necessity for our having to import raw materials for many of our industries. Deputy P. Byrne wanted to know why the provisions of this Bill were restricted to companies in relation to exports.  The provisions of the Bill are to facilitate those who are manufacturing goods for export.  I think we must all agree that such manufactures are, in modern economy, usually carried out by companies.  He asked what was wrong with earning profits and then distributing them?  There is, of course, nothing wrong with earning reasonable profits, but I do not want this Bill to be used for the purpose of enabling people to get into a market quickly and then get out of it.  I want the Bill to be used as an incentive, so that those who are entitled to the concessions visualised in the Bill will go into the export market.  Having gone into that market, the remissions they will get under this Bill will be such as will enable them to build up and develop that export trade further in the future on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>The other points raised on the Bill are, I think, points that can be more properly discussed on the Committee Stage.  Until such time as this Bill is enacted, firms will not make their plans.  Firms will not be satisfied with statements even by Ministers and Deputies during the passage of a Bill. It is only when the Bill is enacted that they will make their plans and it is because I want their plans to be put into operation at the earliest date, that I regard it as a matter of urgency that this Bill should be enacted as soon as is reasonably possible.</P>

    <P>These figures show that there was a progressive increase in industrial production and employment until June, 1956, when a decline was recorded.  The <Col N="1760" /> figures quoted relate broadly to the manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>The most desirable way of redressing the recent decline in employment, the causes for which vary from one industry to another, is an adequate overall expansion of our productive economy.  With this object in view the Government have now introduced proposals for legislation:&mdash; (a) to provide a tax-relief on export profits; (b) to provide grants for the erection of new factory buildings; (c) to provide a tax-relief for new industrial buildings and hotel accommodation; and (d) to provide a tax concession on increased coal production.</P>
    <P>With regard to the references in the question to the import levies and the credit situation, these are matters for the Minister for Finance, to whom the Deputy should address any questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether, in view of the fall in industrial employment and industrial production which has taken place particularly since June, he can state to what extent the credit squeeze has been an important factor in producing that fall, and secondly, in view of the statement of the Tánaiste that the Government considers the expansion of the economy as the proper remedy, does he consider it is possible to secure an expansion of production and expansion of the economy in general, if at the same time a policy restrictive of investment is pursued by the banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If these questions were appropriate to me, I would have no hesitation in answering them, but the question of the credit situation and the levies is a matter which I think is proper to the Minister for Finance and the Deputy appears to have accepted that view, judging by the terms of Question No. 27 which he has addressed to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, perhaps, explain&mdash;perhaps the Tánaiste was not present.  May I point out that Question No. 27 was addressed by me to the Taoiseach but was transferred to the Minister for Finance, so that I do not think that is a valid argument about the reply to my question?  May I ask <Col N="1761" /> this supplementary of the Tánaiste: as the Minister in charge of industrial development, surely he must have a view as to whether it is possible to secure expansion of industrial production and industrial employment, if a restrictive credit policy is being pursued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy thought it was proper to address the question to the Taoiseach, in the first instance, presumably he regarded the Taoiseach as the proper person to whom to address the question and if it was transferred to the Minister for Finance, it must have been because there was an assumption by somebody that the Minister for Finance was the appropriate person.  I would have no hesitation in answering the question if it were clearly within my province, but the Deputy will appreciate that, for obvious reasons, questions relating to the affairs of another Department should be answered by the Minister in charge of that Department.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Following representations made to me some time ago on this question I have examined the matter.  In view of the fact that the area of arable land is small and surrounded by plantations, it would be entirely undesirable to allot it because of the great risk of fire to the forest.</P>
      <P>However, I have asked the Land Commission to take steps to relieve the congestion in the area by other means as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>In view of the fact that the surrounding uneconomic holders <Col N="1764" /> have an average valuation of only £1 5s., will the Minister not consider the request of the local people to have this arable land divided between them?

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The group of people interested met me and I had the matter examined.  I found there was only a small area concerned.  The total area that could be handed over to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion in that district would be only about five roods, with the exception of a fairly long plot of about two acres right in the heart of a forest, and access to which could be gained only by travelling one and a half miles through the forest.  Taking everything into consideration&mdash;the small amount of the arable land available and the difficulty of access to it&mdash;I decided it would not make any appreciable dent in the congestion problem there.  It is obvious that the congestion in that area must be tackled on a much bigger scale by the Land Commission.  The amount of land available would not be sufficient to help even one family; it would not bring the valuation of that family's holding up to £10.</P>

The strip was two miles long and the plantable area was only about 100 yards deep at its widest point.  Fencing costs on such an area would be inordinately high and there were no prospects of expansion <Col N="1765" /> as the adjoining land was of good agricultural quality.

      <P>The policy of my Department is to promote the most efficient use of nitrogenous fertilisers of all types.  In general no distinction is drawn between sulphate of ammonia and fertilisers based on ammonium nitrate, but preference is given to one or other of these fertilisers in relation to special circumstances of soil and cropping conditions.  Present conditions of compounding necessitate, in the main, the use of sulphate of ammonia as a nitrogen source.</P>
      <P>There are no restrictions on the importation of nitrogenous fertilisers and importers should have no difficulty in obtaining their full requirements of the various types on offer.  As I indicated in my reply to a question by the Deputy yesterday the prices are slightly below those prevailing last season.</P>

      <P>The point of my question is that, in looking to the future, would the Minister prefer to see a concentration of ammonium sulphate rather than ammonium nitrate or any other nitrogenous fertilisers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite honestly, my reaction to that would be entirely, or almost entirely, based on which would provide nitrogen at the lowest unit cost to the farmers of this country and I have not got that information.  I take it the Deputy has in mind the question of whether proposals were made for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia in this country and if I had a predilection for one instead of another.  The answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; except when it would come to light if two products were to be chosen between and one would provide the farmer with nitrogenous units cheaper than the other, I would be in favour of the cheaper one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that the Minister reduces the matter to one of price&mdash;that if there were proposals for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers his Department would not press in favour of ammonium sulphate as against nitrate products except on a question of economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to say exclusive economic price, but I do say that would be the predominant idea in my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I may then take it that with the exception of the economic price problem, the Department have no particular interest in one form of nitrogenous fertiliser as against the other within, of course, the restriction of nitrates as against ammonium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to give the Deputy the comprehensive answer he seeks for fear I might have overlooked some facet of the problem that should be considered.  There is always the question of compounding.  However, fundamentally, my approach to the two would be to provide nitrogenous units at the lowest cost to the farmers of the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that <Col N="1769" /> since the reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of 25th October, 1956, the price of maize meal has been further increased by 10/- a ton, and if he will state the reasons for this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is already aware there is no statutory control over the price of maize meal or maize meal mixtures.  On and from 19th November, 1956, the quantity of maize and milo maize which may be sold by Grain Importers (Éire), Limited, has been reduced from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. of the quantity sold in the datum period.  No change has been made in the price of £27 a ton, carriage paid to the purchaser's nearest railhead, which has been in operation since 14th May, 1956.  As a result of the reduction in the allocation of maize and milo maize an increased quantity of home-grown barley is being used by millers.  As the cost of the home-grown barley in some areas is higher than the present price charged. for maize and milo maize an increase in the price of maize/milo/barley mixtures in those areas may have resulted.  Farmers themselves can help to overcome these price variations by producing as far as possible their own requirements of feeding barley.</P>

      <P>As the House has approved of the general idea that the day-to-day administration of Radio Éireann should be left to the Comhairle and Director, I suggest that this question should have been addressed direct to Radio Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Director that the phrase &ldquo;British Isles&rdquo; was not <Col N="1770" /> used by the Radio Éireann interviewer. The Swedish newspaper editor concerned was asked why more Swedish people do not visit Dublin and, in his reply, he said that the cost of transporting a car to the British Isles, &ldquo;including Dublin,&rdquo; is prohibitive. The expression &ldquo;British Isles&rdquo; is, of course, a widely used geographical term for these islands and there was no question of an intentional insult to the nation.</P>
    <P>The recorded interviews for &ldquo;Who's News&rdquo; are unscripted, but they are played back, timed and edited before the programme is broadcast.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's fantastic reply, is he aware that he has just informed this House that the term &ldquo;British Isles&rdquo; is commonly used to describe these islands to visitors?

He answered to the best of his ability; that does not arise.  On a point of such public importance, will the Minister throw the onus on the Director of Broadcasting of Radio Eireann and will he take no steps, as was asked in the question, to ensure that there will not be such an insult to the nation again?</P>

      <P>If Deputy de Valera wishes me to give an answer, I will be prepared to give it, but I cannot give it if he keeps on interrupting me. Between 1st April and 13th June, 1951, the amount invested was £2,100,361, something less than £1,000,000 a month.  As the Deputy will hear in a second when the next question is answered, in the six months from 13th June, 1951, to 13th December, 1951, the total was £22,000,000 or £3,600,000 a month, three and a half times as great.</P>

      <P>My supplementary question dealt with the period from the 21st December when the money first began to be used, until 13th June, during which period, the Minister's reply makes clear, over £18,000,000 was used which is at the rate of over £1,000,000 a month.  My question was really this: what compelling reasons <Col N="1776" /> were there to induce the Government of that day to utilise these funds, seeing that they were inflationary, according to the Minister?</P>

      <P>In one case, up to 13th June, 1951, they were utilised for the purpose of supplementing other more normal methods of financing the capital programme.  After 13th June, 1951, they were used instead of the more normal methods.</P>

      <P>In the case of goods imported into this country, no similar certificates are required of the exporters, but the importers must themselves furnish certificates substantially on the lines of (a) and (b).  No certificate as at (c) is called for, nor would its production as regards imports from Britain or elsewhere serve any useful purpose in view of the terms of our definition of the value of goods for customs purposes as set out in Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1952.</P>

      <P>The situation here, as the Deputy is aware, is governed by Section 15 and the Third Schedule of the Finance Act, 1952, which was enacted at the time the Deputy was Minister for Finance.  Under that, in the case of our imports, the value of goods on the home market in their country of origin is not a factor in the <Col N="1779" /> determination of their value for customs purposes.  Under the 1952 Act our value of imported goods for customs purposes, in cases where the relations between the importer and the foreign supplier are solely those of buyer and seller, is ordinarily the price paid for the goods on the foreign market with the addition of all other costs, freight, insurance, etc., incidental to the sale of the goods and their delivery at the place of importation.</P>

Would the Minister indicate when he will be in a position to deal with these applications? It is very difficult for a local authority to plan ahead and at the present time we in Limerick are coming to a full stop, due to our inability to plan in relation to further schemes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the mounting unemployment and of the business recession which is preventing an expansion in production, the Government will request the commercial banks to relax the present credit squeeze as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the implications of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Credit may be made available within the State by the commercial banks through loans and advances, investments and the discounting of bills.  To put the matter in proper perspective I propose to quote the amount so lent within the State by the commercial banks at mid-October in recent years. The figures are: 1953, £153.4 million; 1954, £166.8 million; 1955, £193.3 million; 1956, £195.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The readiness of the commercial banks to extend accommodation to credit-worthy customers is limited only by consideration of the liquidity requirements established by banking experience and practice.  Between 1954 and 1955 bank lending within the State increased at an exceptionally high rate. The figures I have quoted show an increase of £26,000,000 as compared with <Col N="1783" /> an increase of £13,000,000 between the corresponding dates of 1953 and 1954. During 1955 the deficit in the balance of payments increased, the external reserves of the banks were sharply drawn down and their liquidity ratios were reduced.  In view of this, transfers of sterling have been made to the commercial banks by the Central Bank to facilitate advances for essential transactions which otherwise would have added unduly to the strains on banking liquidity.  These transfers and the substantial sales this year of sterling investments of departmental funds have sustained the lending capacity of the commercial banks.  The amount of bank lending within the State has in fact increased as between October, 1955, and October, 1956, notwithstanding the decline in the need for bank accommodation to finance imports consequent upon the fall in imports of £16,000,000 in the ten months January to October, 1956.</P>
    <P>It would be consistent with Government policy that the banks should adopt a cautious attitude towards applications for credit which may be intended to sustain an unduly high level of imports of less essential consumer goods but that credit should be available for productive purposes to the maximum extent permitted by available banking resources.</P>

      <P>I might point out, however, that the percentage unemployed last year was the lowest ever recorded.  The increase as compared with last year in the number registered as unemployed is due to a variety of factors, of which changes in the pattern and volume of home requirements and in external market conditions have been of considerable importance.  Changes of this nature obviously cannot be ascribed to Government action.</P>
      <P>The latest industrial analysis of the live register, that for mid-October, 1956, shows that the increase in unemployment as compared with mid-October, 1955, has occurred mainly in such broad categories as building and construction, agriculture, the distributive trades, motor assembly, the footwear and food industries.  Two-thirds of the increase occurred outside Dublin and Dún Laoire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In building and construction one of the causes is that the demand for houses has inevitably shown a downward trend according as arrears of housing needs have been satisfied.  In <Col N="1786" /> the motor assembly industry, as I indicated in reply to a question on the 25th October, factors other than the levy&mdash;in particular the collapse of the second-hand market in Britain&mdash;have been largely responsible for the decline in motor car sales.  Other industries, including the footwear and food exporting industries, have been affected by factors, including in some cases external factors, which are entirely unconnected with the import levies.  In fact, as I stated in the reply on the 25th October, the levies have had the incidental effect in some industries of conserving and increasing home employment.</P>
    <P>It must, of course, be recognised that the levies cannot achieve their purpose unless they reduce imports. The reduction in less essential consumer imports which is necessary to avert national insolvency must cause some contraction of trade and business which can be offset only in so far as domestic production is increased.  A significant increase in home production and in exports is one of the most important and urgent objectives of Government policy and national endeavour. To secure it various measures have been and are being taken, including those contained in the Finance Bill now before the House.  Meanwhile, however, the Government could not allow the deficit in the balance of payments to continue unchecked.  Employment dependent on excessive spending on imports, at a rate entailing the rapid exhaustion of our available external reserves, would be extremely short-lived and would be superseded by widespread unemployment and hardship when we found ourselves, as we quickly would, without adequate resources to pay even for essential raw materials.</P>
    <P>As regards employment on public works I need not add to my replies to the various questions concerning the additional sum of £1,000,000 recently allocated by the Government for productive works of a public character.  I would inform the Deputy and the House, however, that the public capital programme on its present scale&mdash; and consequently the employment it affords&mdash;is not being sustained by the voluntary savings of the public, even as supplemented by the proceeds of the <Col N="1787" /> special import levies.  The deficiency has had to be made good by sales of sterling investments by the Government and the banking system, sales which have reduced these external assets to a low level.  The maintenance of the public capital programme has now become directly dependent on the current savings of the community, supplemented for the time being by the proceeds of the import levies.  For this reason, and because of the inadequacy of the present level of savings, a savings campaign has been initiated, various incentives have been granted and Government policy is actively concerned with the stimulation of savings.</P>
    <P>I have indicated at some length in reply to another question by the Deputy on to-day's Order Paper the position in regard to the supply of bank credit within the State.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it is not possible to secure an expansion in production or an expansion of constructive employment if a credit restrictive policy is pursued at the same time?  Will the Minister not agree that in view of the fact that in the last three months the commercial banks have accumulated approximately £10.6 million in sterling assets that there is no necessity for persisting in a restrictive credit policy?</P>

      <P>So far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned I can only repeat what I said in relation to Question No. 26&mdash;that I feel that credit should be available for constructive purposes to the maximum extent permitted by available banking concerns.  So far as the second part of the question is concerned, in considering the available external resources these are not only the resources <Col N="1788" /> of the commercial banks which must be considered but also the external assets of Governmental funds, the Central Bank and the commercial banks.  The increase in the external assets of the commercial banks has arisen virtually in full because of the transfer of sterling by the Central Bank and the transfers from Governmental funds to the commercial banks.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the years 1954, 1955 and 1956 the value and description of furniture, fittings and goods of foreign origin purchased by the Office of Public Works for use in Government offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to supply the information sought by the Deputy it would be necessary to scrutinise the vouchers for all purchases made during the three years mentioned.  These run into many thousands of items and the expenditure involved would not be warranted.</P>
      <P>So far as concerns standard articles such as tables, chairs, presses, etc., no foreign made articles were purchased by the Commissioners of Public Works. Goods of foreign origin are purchased only when suitable items of home manufacture are not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that information of a similar character was given by the Parliamentary Secretary on previous occasions and the answers to those questions are on the records of the House?  I had replies previously to questions regarding furniture, furnishings and other goods purchased <Col N="1795" /> from abroad on several occasions by the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) whether tenders have been invited for the erection of a national school at Lissigriffin, Goleen, County Cork, (b) whether tenders have been accepted for the execution of the work, and (c) when work is likely to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenders for the erection of a new national school at Lissigriffin, County Cork, were invited in May, 1956, but no tenders were received. Re-invitation of tenders was deferred because of the extent of the existing contractual commitments of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I regret that I am not yet in a position to say when the case can proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the allocation of a Christmas relief grant in respect of a particular area is based on the unemployment figures for that area; and if, in view of the fact that the number of registered unemployed in Bray exceeds that of last year, he has satisfied himself that the grant of £800 to Bray Urban Council is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants are not allocated from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote specifically for Christmas relief works.  The amount of the allocation to each urban area for the annual winter employment schemes programme is governed by the total amount available for the country as a whole, which is apportioned as between one area and another on the basis of the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area.</P>
      <P>The grant of £800 originally allocated to Bray Urban District has since been supplemented by a grant of an equal amount, making a total grant of £1,600 for new schemes for the current year, which, together with £739 outstanding on 1st April, 1956, makes a total for the current year of £2,339.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of a rural employment scheme proposal for a road work at Ardnacally, Taugheen, County Mayo, Ref. Mayo 1180, (a) the date on which the proposal was received in his Department, (b) the date on which an inspection took place, (c) the reason for the long delay in dealing with the application, and (d) when he proposes to sanction the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal referred to was received on 14th April, 1955, and was inspected on 29th May, 1956.  The delay in dealing with this and other applications under the rural improvements scheme is largely unavoidable due to the increase in recent years in the demand for grants.  The position was aggravated in some areas due to staff vacancies, a number of which have now been filled.  I am not at present in a position to offer a grant for the Ardnacally proposal as the commitments in respect of offers already issued this year are sufficient to absorb the current allocation of funds for rural improvements schemes; but I shall communicate with the applicants immediately the issue of offers is resumed.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the implications in the Deputy's question.  There has been no change in the Government's policy on housing finance as indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on the 2nd May last.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, compared with the same period in 1954, there are over 2,500 more people unemployed in the building industry?  Further, is the Minister aware that the payments to the Local Loans Fund in the financial year ending 31st March, 1953, totalled £10,205,000 and up to 30th December of this financial year totalled £3,792,000, of which some £2,690,000 was for housing?  Is the Minister further aware that the number of local authority houses under construction on 1st October, 1953, and those under construction on the latest available date, 1st September, 1956, shows a drop of nearly 1,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a drop of 3.9 per cent. in local authority housing in the past <Col N="1800" /> 12 months.  Deputies should bear in mind that some day, please God, we will reach saturation point in the building of houses.  It is a good thing that we are now reaching saturation point and that there is a tapering off.  To assist people who wish to acquire their own houses and are unable to do so, £150,000 has been made available by the Government within the past week for allocation in loans under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are waiting in Limerick for £40,000, which we will never see.  Is the Minister aware that, on a document he gave me, at least 50 local authorities in this State are awaiting approval by the Minister in order to proceed with their housing programmes, and in nearly every case, when I ask the Minister to give me the position, this is the position: &ldquo;Information requested, plans not approved, matter under consideration.&rdquo; Nearly everything is &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo; and some of the matters have been &ldquo;under consideration&rdquo; for well over a year.  Surely that does not indicate that the Minister is very anxious to promote the building of houses in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that local authorities have informed applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts that such loans will bear an interest rate of 6¼ per cent.; that in many cases the applicants have completed the erection of their houses, or have had a substantial portion of the work done; and if, in view of the fact that many of such loans were approved, some six to 12 months ago, he will take steps to alleviate the great hardship in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. I might, however, remind the Deputy that local authorities were advised in a circular letter from the Department in October, 1952, to make it clear to borrowers that the rate of interest on advances under the Small Dwelling Acquisition Acts would be governed by that at which the relevant issues were made from the Local Loans Fund.  The matter was fully discussed in the House earlier this year.  Since then the enactment of Section 20 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, has given an absolute discretion to local authorities in fixing the interest rate to be charged to individual borrowers <Col N="1802" /> under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, when a similar increase took place, in 1952, the Minister of that time appreciated that certain cases of hardship existed because people had erected or substantially erected their houses and in such cases made an order whereby these people were to be given the money at the old rate of interest?  Is the Minister aware that, due to the increase in the rate of interest, it will cost these people who have entered into commitments and who have nearly completed their houses 5/- to 6/- a week more over 35 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, in 1952, the Minister had sole discretion in fixing the rate of interest for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, but I am also aware that I have now handed to the local authority that discretion and that they are the sole arbiters under Section 20 of the Act of 1956 as to what the rate of interest must be.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that before Section 20 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, was introduced, a local authority could always lend the money at the rate at which they borrowed it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  They may have charged that increase if they wished, for administrative purposes, but is the Minister aware that they could have lent it at any time up to the introduction of Section 20 at the rate at which they borrowed from the Local Loans Fund?  That is nothing new.</P>

    <Title>Coast Protection Bill, 1956&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter last week we appealed to the Minister to leave the financial provision in this particular section open on the grounds that if the State contribution is at a maximum of 50 per cent. there is practically no hope whatever of going ahead with any coast erosion project.  I gave a few examples last week of what will happen.  I can give a few more now.</P>
      <P>Last week I mentioned the position in relation to Youghal Urban Council and the coast erosion at Clay Castle. That project was sent forward by the Youghal Urban Council to the Minister for Local Government for consideration under the National Development Fund. The cost roughly would be something in the neighbourhood of £30,000&mdash;that is, to make any kind of job of it at all.  Now under this Bill the urban council would be responsible for 50 per cent. of that.  That would be £15,000 of a levy on the ratepayers of an area where 1d. in the £ brings in £46.  It immediately rules out the project and it means that the coast erosion at present taking place and which has now reached a very serious stage will, within a very few years, wipe out the whole of the front strand at Youghal and the houses adjoining, and will seriously interfere with the position of the railway line of C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the financial clause in this particular section were left open so that the Minister could deal with a case of that <Col N="1813" /> description in a special way it would leave some hope of the scheme being done.  We could carry on some way, but as it stands at present there is practically no hope.  As I said on the Money Resolution, this Bill was brought as a face-saver and nothing else, and I think it is wrong of the Minister to waste the time of the House bringing in a face-saving Bill when he knows this section will render it inoperative.</P>
    <P>The Bill is useless while this section remains as it is.  The Minister can consider any project but I can say that no project I know of in my constituency in East Cork can be done under this measure.  There is no justice in the Minister's proposals.  I gave reasons on the Money Resolution why the Government in this case should stump up the whole of the money.  I am concerned with some 300 acres of land stretching from Ballymacoda to Ballycotton.  A scheme prepared for that by the late County Surveyor for Cork, Mr. Denis Coffey&mdash;God rest his soul&mdash;and sent up to the Department for Local Government is still lying there among other urgent jobs that are to be done waiting until the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Flanagan, will print the notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know any other way it can be done.  That scheme alone, I understand, is for £26,000.  The main necessity for the scheme is that the farmers who are affected by this coast erosion now find it practically impossible to work their land.  The P.L.V. of the land is some 35/- per statute acre on which those people have to pay 38/- in the pound in rates.</P>
      <P>The present position is brought about through the criminal neglect of the officials of the Land Commission when this land was taken over under the Compulsory Purchase Act of 1923.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am putting forward reasons why the State should come to the rescue in those cases instead of the ratepayer and, as mentioned in a further section, the owners of the land.  The landowners in this case were compelled to purchase from the landlord under the Compulsory Purchase Act.  The State at that time had the power to withhold out of the purchase money, sufficient money to maintain the embankments on those estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Money Resolution, Sir, not on this section.  The State did not do that, but paid the landlord the full amount and he went home to Mother England with his dough.  Now the State, the ratepayers and the unfortunate tenants have to make up the difference, and under Section 19 are to find 50 per cent. of the money.  What hope is there of doing it?  That part of Cork County has six representatives on Cork County Council out of 46. This is to be a county-at-large charge. What hope have the six county councillors for that area of inducing the other 40 representatives on the county council to stump up 3d. in the £ to make up for the criminal neglect of a Department of State here?  They have none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, this whole Bill is a fraud, and an imposition on the credulity of the people outside because the Minister and his Department know that the whole Bill is rendered inoperative through Section 19.  What hope has Deputy Desmond of getting his proposals through in regard to the Ballinhassig area?  In that case, it would mean about 8d. in the £ on the ratepayers of Cork County.  Where is the money to be found?  Is there any Deputy in the House foolish enough to think that a councillor representing the Fermoy area, or a councillor representing Macroom, or a councillor representing Millstreet, will come in and vote 1/- or 2/- in the £ on the ratepayers in his district in order that <Col N="1815" /> breakwaters may be built at Ballinhassig in South Cork to prevent coast erosion there?  The Minister knows it is impossible, and he knows that if those councillors voted for it they would have no business going back to those who elected them.  The Minister knows that very well but he coolly comes in here with this fraud of a Bill and endeavours to pretend to the people that he is doing something which was left neglected for 15 years.</P>
    <P>What is he doing?  He is taking no steps to rectify any of the problems that exist.  We, who represent seaboard areas, know these difficulties and know how little the Minister is doing to relieve them.  As a matter of fact, a half mile from my house I saw one of those embankments broken seven years ago at Little Island.  The embankment was broken through and some 70 acres of land were flooded immediately. At high tide the water was actually washing through the tenants' residences.  The Land Commission refused to repair the embankment unless they received from the unfortunate tenants, whom they had already looted, a guarantee that they would have added to their annuities the cost of these repairs.</P>
    <P>The position remained in that way for two years and at the end of the two years the Land Commission came down and repaired the embankments with the proviso I have mentioned. The next time the embankment breaks, under the provisions of this section the ratepayers will suffer because of this manoeuvring by State Departments and by Ministers in shifting the burden from the State to the ratepayer, another instance of which we see in this Bill.  This shifting of the burden has gone on for too long.</P>
    <P>The 70 acres to which I have referred were flooded.  The tenants were paying on a poor law valuation of something between 32/6 and 34/- per acre.  The tenant refused to pay any further rates on that holding, just as the tenants in Garryvoe at the present moment are refusing to pay rates on land which is rendered derelict by flooding.  For three years Cork County Council had to put up with the loss of rates on that <Col N="1816" /> holding.  That is the actual position; that is the actual implication of Section 19 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should be compelled to come down and repair that embankment.  Instead of that the ratepayers are now asked to come along and pay the piper.  We have the same position in Ballymacoda, where we had to get the Land Commission to repair the embankments four or five years ago.  Those embankments will not hold.  It is a very difficult job to lay down embankments that will hold for any length of time.  The result now will be that the Land Commission will be relieved of the responsibility and that the Cork County Council must come in on the job or lose the rates on the holdings.</P>
    <P>It is a toss-up whether I, as a public representative, would vote for money to do that job out of the ratepayers' pockets in order to save the annuities for the Land Commission who should have the responsibility in the first place.  That is the very same Land Commission who handed over the full amount of the purchase money to the landlords and let them clear out.  Those are the difficulties we have to meet and it is all very well for the Minister representing an inland constituency.  We are in an entirely different position; we are men who have to meet those people every day of the week, who have to hear their complaints.</P>
    <P>I saw five acres of early potates in Garryvoe this year washed away by the tide.  The man who planted them lost not alone his crop of potatoes but practically his entire income for that year. He was depending on the yield of those five acres which he planted under early potatoes.  Whatever hope there was previously of compelling the Land Commission to intervene, there is no hope at all now of getting them to do so once this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>That, in my opinion, is the underlying danger in this Bill.  This Bill is not brought in to arrest coast erosion. It was never intended by the Minister to meet that end.  This Bill was brought in here for the specific purpose of relieving the Land Commission of responsibility in this respect.  We appealed to the Minister last week, <Col N="1817" /> when the Bill was previously before the House, to change this financial clause.  I wonder if the Minister is now prepared to change his mind as regards this 50 per cent. local contribution.  We would like an answer from him on that.  I have given the case of Youghal; I can give the Minister the case of Ballymacoda, of Gortroe and of other areas and if he talks to Deputy Desmond he will hear more of the difficulties; he will hear what extra difficulties will be imposed through the financial provisions enshrined in this Bill.  I cannot visualise the Minister paying even five bob under its financial provisions.  The Bill was brought in here as a fraud to mislead the public. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day, I asked the Minister for Local Government what decisions had been reached by the Government with a view to alleviating the chaotic condition of the house building industry, and if he would give particulars of such decisions.  In his reply, the Minister once again suggested, and in fact stated, he did not agree that chaotic conditions existed in the industry.  I tried to point out to him that, on the last date available in 1956, there were 6,543 building operatives unemployed as compared with 5,037 in the same period in 1954.  According to the latest available figures which I can get, on 1st October, 1953, there were 7,146 houses under construction.  On 1st September, 1956, there were 6,200 local authority houses under construction. In 1953, 8,065 men were employed in the period and on 1st September, 1956, the figure was 5,895, and there are considerably fewer since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry is the most important industry after agriculture.  It is agreed by all Parties and members of local authorities that things are in a sorry plight.  From answers to questions I put down in this House, one fact becomes obvious, namely, that <Col N="1818" /> for some obscure reason the plans of houses and the approval of housing schemes are being held up by the Minister for Local Government.  It is criminal and the height of folly for the Minister to suggest, not only in this House but at Fine Gael meetings, particularly in Dublin, that there is no scarcity of money for housing.</P>
    <P>As I have said, according to the unemployment register, there is a reduction of over 2,000 persons employed in the building industry.  You could add to that another 3,000 persons who have gone over to England to try to earn their livelihood.  In many cases, these are men who will be lost to this country for a long time.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Housing (Amendment) Bill, he also introduced the infamous guarantee scheme.  What is the position with regard to that scheme?  The loans were to be confined to people of modest means whom the Minister did not define. He left that to the local authority. The local authority was asked to adopt a guarantee scheme for people outside that category.  What happened? I am glad Deputy Donegan is sitting behind the Minister.  He wrote a letter to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 26th October last in which he stated that the Government guarantee scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He dealt with the guarantee scheme and complained that 13 individuals in Drogheda had pointed out to him that they could not avail of the guarantee scheme because it was not operated.  That is a typical example of the failure of the scheme. According to an answer given by the Minister in this House, the scheme was adopted by 26 local authorities.  One building society is operating that scheme and then only in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway.  What chance have people outside the categories mentioned by Deputy Donegan, both in Drogheda and in other areas, where the guarantee scheme is not operative and where it is inoperable?</P>

      <P>The time has come when there will have to be a proper show-down in respect of the tragic history of housing in this country. According to figures supplied by the Minister, there has been a cutting-down in relation to the housing of the working classes.  In 1952-53, £2,658,000 was issued to local authorities from the Local Loans Fund for that purpose. The figure in respect of 1955-56 is £1,334,000.  In 1952-53, the amount allocated for labourers' cottages was £3,087,000.  In 1955-56, the figure was £1,894,000.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  In 1952-53, the amount of money for that purpose was £3,041,000.  In 1955-56, the amount was £2,874,000.</P>
      <P>That figure for 1955-56 included Dublin and Cork Corporations who hitherto had not access to the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people are sick and tired of being told by the Minister and Government members of local authorities that there is ample money available for housing.  If the Minister said to members of local authorities and to the people of the country: &ldquo;There is all you are getting; do the best you can with that,&rdquo; we would have to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We would have to ration the money he was <Col N="1820" /> giving us.  If he would say how much money we would get in a specified period, we would know how we would stand.</P>
    <P>There are housing schemes in Limerick actually completed and the money has not been paid.  If it had not been for the banks, I do not know how we would have carried on.  We are up to the limit of our borrowing capacity and we can borrow no further. Unless the Minister deals not only with Limerick but with every case throughout the country, I think the industry is completely finished.</P>
    <P>That is not necessarily my view on the matter.  There are people who possibly have a lot more knowledge than I have who have dealt with these matters.  The views of the joint negotiating committee of the building industry are interesting.  They refer to a reply given by the Taoiseach to me in this House, in a letter of the 5th of this month to the <i>Irish Independent</i> and they said&mdash;and this is very far-reaching and I think you will agree it throws light on the position:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the statement of An Taoiseach would appear to infer that representations have not been made by the building trade unions, we are obliged to point out that in anticipation of the situation then developing, representations were made some months back, by the joint negotiating committee, to An Taoiseach and assurances were then given which have not materialised.  Since then a worsening of the employment situation has necessitated representation being made to An Tánaiste and Mr. Sweetman, Minister for Finance, the meeting taking place on September 25.  The deputation was assured that their representations would receive the serious consideration of the Cabinet, and at the conclusion of the meeting an assurance was given that the joint negotiating committee would be informed of the outcome of the Cabinet discussions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As we did not receive a reply as promised by October 9, a further letter was sent on that day, expressing our surprise and regret.  We concluded our letter by stating that we were obliged to report to our <Col N="1821" /> people and having informed them of the undertaking, we had to ask for an early reply indicating what steps the Cabinet had decided upon in relation to the employment of our people through the various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only response has been a formal acknowledgement of our communication from the secretary of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The joint negotiating committee is, therefore, obliged to make public this serious omission, as the statement made by An Taoiseach is misleading and completely overlooks the non-fulfilment of the undertakings referred to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we have one of the most prominent members of the union directly concerned with the building industry saying to the Government that, unless they took steps, and immediate steps, the building industry was finished.  We had the president of the Royal Institute of Architects&mdash;I think the Minister was present with the Taoiseach at their dinner&mdash;pointing out to the Minister the serious effects of the Government's policy on the building industry.</P>
    <P>When I originally put down this question, I addressed it to the Taoiseach, for the Minister is concerned only with the housing of the people.  For some reason, it was switched to the Minister for Local Government.  I wished to deal with the building of schools and the building of other things, but I cannot now refer to them on this matter when I am speaking on a question to the Minister for Local Government.  As I say, the main complaint that members of local authorities have, and the main complaint of people in the building trade, is that they are completely in the dark as to what the present position is and what the future holds.  Let us not go into the reasons as to why sufficient money is not available; we can do that some other time.  Let us accept the fact that there is only £x available for housing.  Has the time not come for the Minister, before we break up for Christmas, to write to every local <Col N="1822" /> authority telling them exactly when their plans will be approved and when they can proceed with the work?</P>
    <P>Surely the present position is not fair to the workers in the building industry?  I am sure that the Minister does not like to see this emigration of skilled tradesmen, and of building labourers who are now leaving every week in hundreds.  As a member of a local authority, I say that it is pitiful and the Minister must know it when he gets back to Donegal and people in the building industry say to him: &ldquo;Is there any chance of a job to tide us over Christmas and then we will go to England?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a fantastic situation and one which cannot continue much longer.  It is a matter which is completely above political gain for any side of this House.  As far as I am concerned, it is too serious to cloud the issue any more, too serious for the Minister to taunt the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Briscoe, about it.  The livelihood of people is vitally concerned in this issue.  The Minister asked me to give any specific cases on ordinary houses and cottages alone.  As far back as last May, there were nearly 2,000 such houses awaiting sanction from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>Various reasons have been given here for that&mdash;Clare County Council: 189 cottages; applied 16th August&mdash;&ldquo;under consideration&rdquo;.  The building industry in Clare, like everywhere else, is in a very serious plight.  The figures which I have read out showing that there were 2,500 more unemployed now than last year simply indicate those who are drawing unemployment benefit.  Just as many more have emigrated. Kildare County Council: 816 cottages; applied 19th December, 1955 &mdash;&ldquo;further information required&rdquo;. Wexford County Council: 100 cottages, applied 2nd March, 1956&mdash;&ldquo;further information required&rdquo;.  What is the stock answer?  &ldquo;Under consideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;Further information required&rdquo;, and the six other cases going back to the early part of this year.</P>
    <P>Then we have the supplementary grants.  There is nearly £200,000 lying in the Minister's Department.  It makes <Col N="1823" /> one so sick to think that the Government will not face up to the issue and certainly even at this late stage I would have the greatest admiration for the Minister if he would agree to the suggestion that I have put.  All that we want is for him to tell us the truth. We have not got the truth and I do not mean by that that the Minister has been telling us falsehoods, but the position has been shown in a false light and it is about time that a true statement on the housing position was given.</P>

      <P>With regard to Dublin, it has been alleged that the reduction in the content of unemployment in Dublin and the reduction in the building programme here is in no small part attributable to delays in furnishing approval for plans submitted. This has been stated so persistently that I think the Minister should avail of this opportunity to clarify the position.  A Deputy who supports the Minister in this House and who is in a position to speak as a member of a local authority and a former Lord Mayor, Deputy Denis Larkin, specifically made that charge against the Minister's Department only yesterday.  He said that the reduction in employment on corporation housing schemes is due to the failure of the Department of Local Government to approve plans of the corporation and that they lie in the Department for months.  That is his statement.  I think it is certainly the impression that is abroad that there has been a substantial failure in this situation.</P>

    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, a vital point here&mdash;and perhaps we should make it the net point in this argument &mdash;is: can we know where we stand?  A person will at least listen to the Minister if he says: &ldquo;We have no money; there is a shortage of money.&rdquo;  That is an understandable approach, but, on the one hand, we are told that funds are apparently available <i>ad lib</i>&mdash; because that is the only construction I can put on certain ministerial statements&mdash;while, <Col N="1824" /> on the other hand, every local authority in the country is complaining of the shortage of facilities and of delays in sanction.  As regards local authorities it must be remembered that they are appointed and elected by the same type of suffrage as other public representatives.  They will be as anxious as others to see that the best is got out of the situation, but they are all unanimous&mdash; and I am speaking as somebody who is not a member of a local authority and who is merely forming an impression from what he has heard&mdash;in these complaints against the Government and the Minister's Department as voiced by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me say with regard to the two gentlemen who occupy the Front Benches of the Opposition that they are two Deputies for whom I have nothing but the greatest respect.  I value everything they say in this House and I certainly think they are two of the most industrious Deputies in the Opposition.  Therefore, I would not like to charge them with endeavouring to sabotage the building industry, but I do say, and I say it deliberately that they are now propagating the falsehoods of their mentors.</P>
      <P>The facts are there, that there has only been a slight decrease of 3.9 per cent. in the building of local authority housing in this country within the past 12 months.  I do not think that worth discussing, so I will confine my arguments to employment in the building of private houses, namely, houses for which Small Dwelling (Acquisition) Act loans are made available.  I think we will all agree that the major portion of these houses are built in the City of Dublin.  Let us take the City of Dublin and examine the position in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government for the first time in history gave to the Corporation of Dublin £1,000,000 for small dwellings, plus £3,000,000 for other capital projects. That £1,000,000 was committed some time ago, but not paid; in other words, the houses are not yet completed. We have told the corporation that for next year we are going to give them £4,000,000 for small dwellings and all other capital works with which they <Col N="1825" /> wish to proceed.  They spent £1,000,000 this year.  If they want to, out of that £4,000,000, they could spend another £1,000,000 next year and they could be getting on with the work of building those houses because there will be no draw before 31st March next on whatever moneys they wish to make available for Small Dwellings Acquisition Loans.  Dublin Corporation knew there was a by-election in the City of Dublin. They knew it from the month of June and they decided then that there would be no allocation out of their £4,000,000 for loans for small dwellings.</P>

      <P>Immediately the by-election was over, Dublin Corporation last week decided to give £213,000 for small dwellings, despite the fact that all during the election campaign they said we would give no money to them. They have given £213,000, and I was very glad to hear Deputy Larkin saying last night they would probably have £500,000 for small dwellings during the coming year.  That is something I like to hear.  Why was that not said in the month of June last?  Why did Dublin Corporation not allocate £213,000 for small dwellings in the <Col N="1826" /> month of June and not hold up the building trade?  The work could be going on.  There would be no draws before 1st April next and, in case there were draws, I gave Dublin Corporation sanction for an overdraft of £500,000, so that in the interim period between this year and next year there might be no stoppage whatsoever in the building of private houses.  I am very glad that Deputy Larkin told the House there will be £213,000 available. I went further.  I notified Dublin Corporation on 26th of this month that they will not get the £4,000,000 next year unless they are prepared to give a reasonable allocation for small dwellings, and I consider a reasonable allocation £500,000.  I have notified them by letter that they must give £500,000 to enable the builders in Dublin to continue in employment the men who have been employed in the building trade down through the years. This is sabotage and it is nothing but sabotage.</P>

      <P>Very good.  It is headed &ldquo;Bunbeg, 27th September, 1956, Dáil Éireann&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Edward,</P>
      <P>Your letter to hand.  There is no use in appealing against the Doctor's decision as the Department will always back him up to the very end. I would advise you to go into the Labour Exchange there with that letter and ask the manager if you can apply for Stamp Benefit since the Doctor states that you are fit for work.  I enclose the other Doctor's certificate but the Department will not accept it.</P>
      <P>Regarding roads.  The county council has informed us that all grants are stopped as the Government has no money.  Even housing grants, farm improvement and drainage grants are all stopped and things are even getting worse.  I am getting in touch to-day with the Land Commission and will let you know the results later.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
      <P Just="Right">(Signed) Cormac Breslin, T.D.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is not an act of sabotage against this State, then I do not know what is.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 5th December, 1956</P>
