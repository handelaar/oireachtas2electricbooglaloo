    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of each of the months September, 1955, to March, 1956, (a) the average dead weight price per cwt. paid to producers for each grade of pig received at bacon factories, and (b) the average price per carcase cwt. received by bacon factories for each grade of bacon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the information asked for by the Deputy is not available in the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Certain information is received for prices index number purposes as regards the wholesale prices charged by a limited, number of concerns.  These prices, however, cannot be directly related to the grazes of pigs, and, furthermore, there is considerable variability in the classifications used for the quotation of the wholesale prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has informed me that there are no prices available, but could I ask how it is that the retail price of bacon is fixed?  There must be information available in the Departments about the price per cwt. paid to producers and about the price at which bacon is sold.  There is not any doubt in the world about that.  I asked the same question of the Minister for Agriculture last week and he said that the information was not available, and the Taoiseach's Statistics Department refused to give the information also.  I want, to state that I believe Deputies <Col N="858" /> are being treated unfairly.  I believe that the information is there and the Deputies are entitled to get this information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct in saying that the definite, precise information he requested is there; he is not quite right in making that charge.  If we had the information the Deputy would receive it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary say how the retail price of bacon is fixed, if there is no information as to what is paid for bacon and what is charged by the producers of the bacon?  How is the price fixed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of each of the years 1953 to 1955 the total cost of imported wheat, and the estimated cost of such imports in the current year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement showing the total value (c.i.f.) of wheat imported in each year 1953 to 1955.  No estimate can be given of the cost of wheat likely to be imported during the calender year <Col N="859" /> 1956.  The quantity will depend on the amount of native wheat that the coming harvest will provide.  For the cereal year 1955-56, that is for the 12-month period ending 31st August, 1956, imports of wheat other than for seed are expected to come to a total of £3,290,000 (c.i.f).</P>

I am also informed that the necessity for special charges is partly dependent on the percentage of acceptances in an area and tends to diminish as the percentage of acceptances increases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before a State grant could be made towards the cost of a school transport service, there should be a sufficient number of children available for conveyance to school to ensure that the daily average number of eligible children conveyed each quarter would reach at least ten.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>Final decisions as regards migration each year are based on a number of factors including the circumstances of the various applicants, the suitability of their lands for use in effecting rearrangement and the number of new holdings which are available for disposal. By reason of these considerations it was not found possible to effect any migrations from Toorglass this season.  I would mention, however, that in 1953 four tenants from Toorglass were offered exchange holdings in the eastern countries but they refused to accept the holdings offered. As far as I am aware, no undertaking was given to the tenants that the townland would be rearranged this year.</P>

The claims of all applicants for land on the estate must be fully investigated before a scheme for its division can be formulated.</P>

Most of the houses being provided by housing authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts qualify for the higher rate of subsidy.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the fact that the debate on the Vote on Account has pretty well covered the ground on the matters which would ordinarily be discussed on this Bill.  I do not proposed to delay the, House for any very long period.  Neverthless, I think it might be well that some of the matters discussed should be spoken to by a Labour member&mdash;in particular the suggestion that what this country needs very badly is increased production.  I think all, of us, no matter on which side of the House we sit, would agree that it would be a good thing for this State if we could secure increased production. But while I have heard that suggestion made from many sides of the House I have yet to hear somebody indicate how that increased production is to be obtained.</P>
      <P>With regard to increased production in agriculture, I do not feel competent to hazard a guess as to how that desirable state of affairs is to be achieved. All I would say is that, in my opinion, the giving of grants and the system of coaxing have been tried and, apparently, are unavailing.  I would suggest that if some penalty was now imposed, some deterrent placed on the farmer who does not give the desired increased production, it would be more effective than the system of coaxing by way of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> On the industrial side, I hear a good deal of talk from management, and the people who are responsible for management, on the desirability of getting the workers to give increased production but when we on the Labour side, or in the trade union movement, ask for a share in consultation in the management of these enterprises it is denied us.  We are told that the problem of how to run a factory is a function reserved to the management only. Why should the workers in a factory increase the effort which they now make, without having the slightest knowledge as to whether they are working themselves out of their jobs or not.  That has been the effect on many workers in many factories here. They were induced to give increased production by bribes of efficiency bonuses and, after a short time, they were reverted to the old system of work, with a new daily average chalked up against them, and they were compelled to keep that average, an average which they had struck having being bribed into it by inducements of higher pay.  After a short time many of these workers found themselves laid off because stocks had been built up sufficiently to permit the laying-off of a big percentage of them.</P>
    <P>Now if the workers are assured on certain points they will co-operate. One of their points is, I suggest, that it will not mean unemployment for them or for their colleagues; secondly, that they will be paid for the extra work they do and, thirdly, that that increased production will be reflected in a reduced cost in the price of the commodity if it is for sale on the home market.</P>
    <P>The problem facing the country is that of increased production.  I understand that a committee was set up a number of years ago which had as its object an examination of the potential of the whole State, both agriculturally and industrially.  If the Government are desirous, as I know they are, of increasing output both in industry and agriculture, I would suggest that some similar body should be set up to examine the problem as a whole and contrast the figures they arrive at against the normal population of the <Col N="876" /> State, thereby striking a figure, or a standard of living, which we hope to give our people.  They could appoint then, if they so saw fir, officials to act as liasion officers, or in some other capacity, who would move from factory to factory or area to area, in order to secure between management and workers the co-operation necessary to achieve the desired result.  We, in the Labour Party, will be quite willing to do our part.  The factory is the employer's profit.  It is not only his profit but it is his only and his sole method of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech made by The Minister for Industry and Commerce when introducing the Supplies and Services Bill was further evidence, if further evidence were needed, that the Government does not know where it is going or what it is trying to do. Every statement we get from a Minister regarding the intention of the Government is rarely fulfilled; every forecast which they make is rarely proved accurate.  We find them now denouncing as impracticable or undesirable the courses of action they were recommending only a few short months ago.  The mismanagement which has characterised the Government in every phase of activity is particularly obvious in relation to the matter of prices.  Prices, the trend of prices, the actions and intentions of the Government in regard to prices are the matters which are relevant to this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Supplies and Services Act is kept on the Statement Book primarily for the purpose of giving the Government power to control prices and, if there is one thing this Government expressed its intention of doing, it was to control prices, to reduce prices by a more effective system of control than they had found in operation in 1954.  It is right that this occasion, the submission of this Bill to continue the Act for another period, should be availed of to test the competence and efficiency of the Government by reference to its record in regard to prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the general election which put the present Minister for Industry <Col N="877" /> and Commerce over there, it was a common theme with all the Deputies now sitting opposite that the system of price control then in operation was ineffective and inefficient.  Amongst the many pledges which they made to the electors in the months prior to the General Election of 1954 was one to introduce another more efficient, more effective and more comprehensive system of price regulation.  I do not know when that pledge of the Government was put into the wastepaper basket, when that declared intention of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce was allowed to die.  It must have been very recently.</P>
    <P>This is an annual Bill.  Year after year, the Dáil has been asked to renew the powers which the Government exercises under this Supplies and Services Act.  Twelve months ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce was here, as he is to-day, urging the continuation of these powers for another year and he said then that this new legislation which was to enable the Government to control prices, to fulfil their election pledges to reduce prices and replace the outworn, absolete, inefficient system of Fianna Fáil by a new and effective system, would be introduced within that year. The Minister pledged himself to the Dáil, as an argument in favour of the passing of the 1955 Supplies and Services Bill, that he would make every effort to produce this new system of price control and the legislation that was to set up this new system, as soon as possible.  He would try to do it, he said, within 12 months.</P>
    <P>All that has now gone by the board and the Minister tells us that he would feel a considerable reluctance at this point of time to substitute for the now familiar arrangements new and untried arrangements for price control.  The &ldquo;obsolete inefficient arrangements&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil are now the familiar arrangements with which the Government is reluctant to part and the brand new efficacious system of price regulation, about which all the Deputies opposite were eloquent during the election campaign, is not going to appear.  The Minister said he was reluctant to produce it, or reluctant to <Col N="878" /> replace the present familiar arrangements with a new and untried system.</P>
    <P>But why has this now legislation not been produced?  The Minister was frank enough in telling us the reason why he changed his mind.  When he changed it, I do not know; but he has now announced the change, and Deputies opposite have got to take it whether they like it or not. This new system of price control is now not going to be introduced&mdash;I want members of the Labour Party to note these words particularly&mdash;because, as the Minister said himself, prices will continue to rise and the Government does not know what to do about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is for this reason that I feel a considerable reluctance, at this particular point of time, to substitute for the now familiar arrangements, new and untried arrangements.  It would be most unfortunate if any new price control arrangements became at the outset associated in the public mind with the rising costs inseparable from a general inflationary situation and the harmful economic consequences which inevitably follow, or became discredited through inability to hold prices stable <Col N="879" /> in circumstances, like those at present prevailing, in which increasing costs stem primarily from external factors which it is beyond the capacity of any authority here to control.&rdquo;</P>

Does it or does it not mean that the Government is not going ahead with its declared intention to introduce legislation for the establishment of a new system of price control, first, because prices will continue to rise, secondly, because the Government can do nothing about it and, thirdly, because they do not want to have the blame for the continuing rise in prices placed upon whatever system of price control they may devise and substitute for the present one.

      <P>The principal characteristic of this Government is its complete mismanagement of the nation's business and behind that is its incapacity even to pursue a straight course in any matter, even in these matters in which they appear to have made up their minds as to what they are going to do.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was talking about the new, efficient system of price control which he was going to introduce last year to replace the absolete inefficient system of Fianna Fáil.  Now that intention is being reversed.  We are going to have the old familiar <Col N="880" /> arrangements which in these circumstances are preferable to any new arrangement.  We are going to have that because, as the Minister said, prices will continue to rise and because the Government can do nothing about the continuing rise in prices, they think they can escape some of the political consequences of that situation by not proceeding with their intention to establish their own system of price regulation and demonstrating in its operation how inefficient it would certainly be.</P>
      <P>How the tune has changed during the past year.  Last year when this Supplies and Services Bill was before the House the Minister for Industry and Commerce was assuring the Dáil that &ldquo;the Government are trying to get the prices of essential commodities down.  That is our policy&rdquo; he proclaimed. What about their policy? When are the members of the Dáil and the people in the country going to see this policy in operation?  Did prices come down during the past year?  Will the Minister say what happened to prevent him and his colleagues in the Government fulfilling their policy. &ldquo;We are trying to get the price of essential commodities down.  That is our policy.&rdquo;  How many essential commodities went down in price last year? Will the Minister name one?  Is there any Deputy opposite to name one essential commodity the price of which was reduced last year?</P>

Why did he not do it?  Is there anything wrong in trying to reduce prices now?  That is the very question the Minister asked last year and the Parliamentary Secretary asks now.  What happened the time again in this House to the Deputies supporting the Government to be honest with the people, to tell the people why it was they found it impossible to fulfil that declared policy or why they did not try.  Are we going to have the Minister again proclaiming that it is their policy to reduce the price of essential goods?  Is he going to turn around, sweeping his arms towards the benches behind, to ask is there anything wrong with reducing prices?  We heard him speaking yesterday like a director of the Central Bank with a toothache, and no director of the Central Bank was ever so concerned, so enthusiastic for the policy of austerity as the Minister for Industry and Commerce showed himself yesterday.</P>

      <P>The point that arises on this Bill is the Government's miserable failure to make even an effort to reduce prices last year.  I remind Deputies opposite it was only two years ago, they were proclaiming <Col N="882" /> to the world they had a system of price regulation which they were going to introduce, replacing the inefficient system of Fianna Fáil, that would bring down all prices and keep the cost of living within the limits of the purse of the poorest man.  Everybody was going to be better off because prices were coming down.  What happened? Will you be honest with the people and tell them why you did not find it practicable, why you are running away from these pledges which were given so liberally and so glibly two years ago?  Do you not think that now that you have started upon this process of trying to educate the ordinary Irish people in economic realities, you should go the whole way and tell them the truth about prices?</P>
      <P>This price gag you played at the general election paid its dividends; you got the votes and you got into office. You cannot possibly hope that the same gag will work twice, or do you?  Does any Deputy opposite think he can go to the next election and get returned on a promise to reduce prices?  Is there any Deputy opposite who would have the hardihood to stand up in public at a meeting and promise to reduce prices? Does he think he would get away from that meeting without hearing some very sarcastic comments from the ordinary people attending it?  This gag will not work twice.  Therefore you may as well as honest.  It will not cost you anything.</P>

      <P>Twelve months ago the policy was to reduce prices.  Twelve months ago there was nothing wrong with this idea that the cost of essential commodities should be brought down. Twelve months ago the Governments was going to use all the ingenuity at its disposal to reduce prices.  It exercised some of that ingenuity in relation to tea.  Last year the Minister said here on the Supplies and Services Bill that he would hold the price of tea at the level at which it was when they came into office.  Mind you, during the <Col N="883" /> election they were not promising to hold the price of tea at the level at which it then was.  They were promising to reduce it below that level.  They were contending amongst the people that the price of tea was unnecessarily high and that it could be reduced. They even had a device for bringing about a reduction in the price of tea which some of them spoke about, but after a few months in office they had given up that hope and were limiting their aim then and their policy to keeping the price of tea at the level at which it then was.  Why was not that done?  What happened the price of tea?  Will Deputy O'Leary tell me by how much tea went up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem of the price of bread is not an emergency one. From the day that the Fianna Fáil Government decided that we were going to produce Irish flour in Irish flour mills and as far as possible from Irish grown wheat, we set out to ensure that the possible effects of that policy upon the consumers of bread would be minimised and the price of bread is controlled under permanent legislation and not under the Supplies and Services Act.  Long before the war there was an Act passed hero for the regulation of the price of bread in relation to the price of flour.  Is that legislation going to be repealed?  Is all the talk which the Deputies opposite indulged in before the election about reducing the price of bread, about vigorous action to bring down the price of all essential commodities, going to end up in the complete stripping of controls and the creation of a situation in which those who sell these commodities can charge what they like?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some questions here to-day regarding biscuits.  Again, I accuse the Minister for Industry and Commerce of gross incompetence in handling the situation which developed following the Government's decision in the Budget of last year to withdraw <Col N="889" /> the subsidy for flour used in the manufacture of biscuits.  I say the biscuit manufacturers tried for months to get from the Government some decision as to what arrangements were to be substituted for those that prevailed previously. I do not know to what extent deterioration of conditions in the biscuit trade, the laying-off of workers, about which the Labour Party appear to be so unconcerned, is directly attributable to that change or is in part attributable to other circumstances, but it is obvious that there has taken place in that industry during the most year, since the Government altered the arrangements which operated for that industry, a very considerable worsening of conditions involving the closing of one factory and a reduction of employment in others.</P>
    <P>Is the Government going do anything about it?  I urged them when they brought their proposals here in the Budget last year to effect this saving on the flour subsidy by withdrawing the subsidy on flour used in biscuit manufacture&mdash;a saving, I think, of about £500,000&mdash;to consider again what the consequences of that act might be.  I pointed out that that was an industry which was not merely of considerable importance from the point of view of employment but also as an exporting industry which was helping to contribute to the reduction in the trade deficit about which Ministers are now so concerned, but, instead of getting a modification of views from the Government, a position was allowed to develop in which those engaged in the industry did not know where they were for weeks, did not know what prices they were going to pay for the flour they were using. They were using flour making goods not knowing what it would cost them, while pressing for a decision from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and unable to get it.</P>
    <P>The Government said it was going to use all the ingenuity at its disposal to reduce prices.  Well, the ingenuity at the Government's disposal has put prices up to an all-time record.  There never was in the history of this country a time when the price level was as high as it is now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is going up. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has warned us that an upward movement in prices is in progress; it has not stopped yet.  The Minister for Finance has repeatedly warned us that the worst has yet to come.  Has the Government thrown in the towel completely? Have they now abandoned all pretence that they can do anything to influence the course of prices?  Do they not realise that by far the most important problem before this country at the present time is how to bring about stability in prices?</P>
      <P>I said here in the debate on the Vote on Account that all the exhortations of Ministers and of representatives of the savings committee to the people of this country to save money are wasted if they cannot hold out the promise that the money saved now will buy as much in 12 months' time as it will buy to-day, that it will not have depreciated in value by reason of a continued rise in prices.</P>

Will the Government hold out any prospect of price stability?  Are they going to try to do anything to keep prices stable? Have they any idea in their minds now as to how it might be done?  Two years ago they were gaily forecasting a rapid reduction in prices, an improvement in the standard of living by reason of a reduction in prices&mdash;what is their view now?</P>
      <P>I am sure Ministers do not like the new tune they have to play nowadays. There is a popular song which goes&mdash;I think&mdash;&ldquo;We wish we were young and foolish again&rdquo;.  It must be almost the theme song&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It must happen now and again that somebody stops the Deputy in the street and says: &ldquo;When are these promises that you made going to be fulfilled?  When is the price of any commodity going to come down?&rdquo; I am sure Deputy O'Leary is not stumped for an explanation, but I think he would be greatly reinforced if he had a word of explanation from the Minister.  I am not sure that he is going to get it, but it is no harm to remind the Minister of what be said 12 months ago&mdash;that they would get prices down or explain why&mdash;and to invite him to give the Dáil that explanation now.</P>
      <P>I have said that it is the extreme incompetence with which the affairs of the State have been administered in almost every Department of the Government that is the main cause of most of the present problems facing our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us set out their record briefly. They said they were going to reduce prices.  They said: &ldquo;We are trying to <Col N="893" /> get the prices of essential commodities down.  That is our policy.&rdquo; Those are words used by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Since then prices have gone up and they are still rising.  They used all the ingenuity at their disposal and the net result was that prices went up and are still going up.  They were going to reduce taxation.  That is something they would like to forget now.  They were to reduce the cost of Government by £10,000,000 and to reduce taxation in consequence.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister for Finance has issued a threat about the forthcoming Budget.  According to what they say it will be a difficult one.  Not one of them is now saying it is their policy to reduce taxation.  Not one of them is now holding out that bright prospect to the people of this country.  Or are they?  I have said it may be their tactics to build up fears about the increase in taxation in the Budget so that anything they produce may be regarded with relief by the community. They are building up apprehensions now so that any little imposition that may be necessary will be accepted with relief.  I do not know if an increase in taxation is necessary. Probably the taxes imposed last week are the first instalment of the 1956 Budget so that the rest of it will be a little more pleasant than the first part. But they promised to reduce taxes and taxes went up.  They were to reduce the cost of capital.  Deputy O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, spoke on this Bill last year and said it was the policy of the Government to bring down the cost of money.  Does the Deputy remember that?</P>

      <P>Let us see how successfully that policy was fulfilled.  The Minister for Finance is now crying because the cost of money is going up. He is crying because capital is scarce and dear.  What a successful policy that was.  I admit that the Parliamentary Secretary was only repeating what the Taoiseach had said before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Within a few weeks of their statement they announced a new policy and said the new policy was far better than the old.  A short time ago we had the Minister for Finance describing this balance of payments deficiency as a fetish.  I want to bring up that word again&mdash;a fetish, a bogey created by Fianna Fáil to mislead the people.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that those who said the Irish people were spending more than they could afford were mentally deficient.  We had the Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan, saying it was utter nonsense to assert the Irish people were spending beyond their means.  How quickly that cry has changed.  Now faced with this deficit in the balance of payments they have panicked, not that their panicking produced any worthwhile proposals to ease the situation, but we have now this <Col N="895" /> amazing result of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Leader of the Labour Party, paraphrasing the report of the Central Bank and we have the Minister for Finance saying &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to all that.</P>
      <P>Incompetence, mishandling, mismanagement in every Department have added to our problems, I do not say that even the most competent Government in the world, even a Fianna Fáil Government, could have solved all the problems, but they could have prevented them developing at the rate and on the scale they have developed under the Coalition.  These are not the only problems.  There is the growing threat to our fuel supplies.  I warned the Government that the British authorities were forecasting the day when Britain will be unable to meet her own coal needs, much less have a surplus to export to us.  What are the Government doing about that?  This is the Bill which gives them the powers to control the supplies of essential commodities. Are there any more essential supplies than fuel?  They are putting back the electricity generating programme.  The power stations in Offaly, in Longford and elsewhere, which were to come into production this year, are put back until next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is utter nonsense. There is no country in Western Europe where the per capita consumption of electricity is so low as it is here.  In some countries in Western Europe the <i>per capita</i> consumption of electricity <Col N="896" /> is four times what it is here.  Did the E.S.B. say they had more current than they could sell and, if so, what are they doing to sell it?  Does any Deputy believe that?  If they have more current than they can sell, where is the E.S.B. staff of commercial travellers to sell it?  The E.S.B. were never in that position.  From the end of the war&mdash; we will leave the war out of it because it was an exceptional period&mdash;they were never more than one step ahead of the growth of the demand for current, a demand which was not stimulated by any action on their part. They barely kept ahead of the demand and there were years during that, period when it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep ahead, years when they had to go to large electricity consumers like Cement Ltd. and ask them to be prepared to shut down at short notice so that the power they were using could be made available for hospitals and other such institutions, for domestic lighting and other purposes.</P>
      <P>While it is true that I pressed them to get ahead with the construction programme, first because I felt we should be in a position in which the board would have to go out to sell current to bring about the improvement in the standard of living of our people which a higher <i>per capita</i> consumption would represent, I did not ever ask the board to do something that they said could not be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Something very interesting has been said here now.  I pressed them to erect four stations, one in Kerry, one in Clare, one in Galway, and one in Donegal, all designed to burn hand-won turf, stations which would take the whole of the surplus turf produced by private individuals in these areas at reasonable prices.  The board did not want to do it because they felt it was not an economic proposition, that it was a social welfare scheme.  I agree the primary purpose was social.  In fact I said to the board that if they did not want to do it I would set up another authority which would run the stations and sell the current to the board.  The board did not fancy the prospect of another electricity authority and said they would run the stations themselves. I admit the idea was that these stations would take over wherever turf was available and that they would not be operating at all when turf was not available either because of weather conditions or because there was some other market for the turf.  I feel that the effort which is being made to give to these areas the tremendous benefits which a secure market for hand-won turf represents is completely inadequate. I see advertisements offering 50/- per ton for turf delivered at the stations being published but apart from these advertisements there is no sign of any inducement being offered to expedite turf production.  I am also conscious of the fact that the £200,000 allocated out of the National Development Fund to provide the roads leading to the stations has not been spent. I do not know if there was a change of policy there.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not allow any arguments from the board to dissuade him from proceeding with the erection of these stations, which have, undoubtedly, a social purpose.  The amount of current they would produce would be comparatively insignificant but they represent for these areas a higher standard of living for the people living in them.  I hope there is no pressure coming from the board to the Minister to drop these projects and if there is such pressure I hope he will resist it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> In my view we have not yet got into the position in which we have enough generating capacity to enable us successfully to propagate the use of electricity in this country and, if we are facing a shortage of coal as I fear we are, the demand for current will increase considerably and rapidly.  There must always be some surplus generating capacity.  We cannot at the peak hour of the peak day of the peak month take the risk that a temporary breakdown in one single generating unit will throw the whole scheme out of gear. There must be some surplus generating capacity and I do not believe that we have that.  The demand for electric power has been increasing by 80,000,000 units a year and we are not getting new generating capacity established to meet that rate of increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The generating capacity is well in excess of the consumer capacity. Let the people who know talk about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumer capacity varies from the lowest point on, I think, the 20th June to the highest point on the 20th November and at 6 o'clock on the 20th November there is a demand for current more than double the demand at the lowest point.  The board must have installed capacity to meet that demand.</P>

      <P>Everything which the Coalition Government put their hands to they make a mess of it.  Even the plans which were going reasonably well when they came into office are now operating in a haphazard irregular way since they got control.  There used to be a legendary king called Midas who had the faculty that everything he touched turned to gold.  There is something completely opposite to that in the Coalition Government because everything that they touch turns sour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to oppose this Bill. We do not think that this Government is to be trusted with the powers and responsibilities which the Supplies and Services Act gives them.  I do not think that any Government is to be trusted with these powers.  We took these powers in the exceptional years of the war and we retained them to handle the abnormal difficulties of the <Col N="900" /> post-war period.  The Fianna Fáil Government took a decision in 1953 that that Act should lapse; that it was not right for any Government to hold the power of directing by Order the lives and the business of our people.</P>
    <P>There was an obligation placed then on every member of the Government to come to the Dáil to get, by legislation, any of these powers which he thought it necessary to retain.  We took that decision and every member of the Government was notified that by the end of 1954 the Act would cease to operate.  They were notified that they had to bring into the Dáil legislation to retain powers which they might require to retain.</P>
    <P>Some of that legislation has already appeared before this House.  Other Bills which we had forecast will, no doubt, come along.  That decision was announced to the Dáil by me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, when I brought in the 1953 Supplies and Services Bill.  Since that we have the 1955 Act and this 1956 Bill continuing the powers for a further period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act which I had passed in 1953 was to continue the powers for 15 months instead of the usual 12 months in order to give members of the Government time to consider the terms of whatever legislation was deemed to be necessary.  I said last year, and I repeat, and I speak with the experience of one who was a member of a Government for 20 years, that every Department of State is extremely loath to part with powers which they have once obtained. There seems to be an idea in the heads of civil servants that a situation may arise at some time in the future when the exercise of these powers will be necessary.  And only a Government that realises the importance of it and insists upon that change will be able to strip these Departments of their exceptional powers.  That must be done; and the Dáil, I think, should register its disapproval of the failure of the Government to get rid of this Supplies and Services Act in 1955 by refusing to continue the powers conferred under the Act for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Giving these powers to the Coalition Government is like giving a hatchet to a child.  It is as dangerous as that. One does not know at what it will take a swipe next.  Government incompetence can, in time, bring this country to disaster.  I realise that there is nothing much we can do about it. The Government has a majority in this House, a majority which will for a time continue to support it.  The Labour Party, in whom no doubt some sections of our people still repose some hopes, will not use their power; they are mute in face of what the Government is doing &mdash; not mute of malice but mute of discretion.  The other groups and Deputies who support the Government are just like dumb sheep which will go wherever they are driven.</P>
    <P>The situation that faces the country is, therefore, a very dangerous one. Twice before in my lifetime the Fine Gael Party brought this country to the brink of ruin, brought it to a position where even the retention of our political freedom appeared to be a matter of some doubt.  Now, once more, under Fine Gael leadership, the country is being brought on the same road again. There are some people in this Dáil who can stop them.  The ordinary people outside have not got a chance to stop them yet.  We cannot stop them as an Opposition because they have a permanent majority here.  But there must be somebody opposite who must realise that this is a far more serious matter than Deputy O'Leary would suggest.</P>

There must be some people in some of the Parties supporting the Government who realise that that is at stake and who will exercise the influence they may have to bring a halt to this march of incompetence, this continued mismanagement of the nation's business. There must be some people who will do that, not because it will bring <Col N="902" /> votes in an election but because it is their duty as Irishmen and their duty to the people who sent them here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to-day to the election programmes of the past.  The main burden of his complaint was that the prices of essential commodities had not been reduced. But he failed to refer to the fact that wage levels had been increased so that wage earners could meet these increased costs.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Lemass refer to the Supplies and Services Act of 1953 which, he said, would be altered at the end of 1954. Deputy Lemass must remember that the Supplies and Services Bill comes before the House each year before 31st March.  In 1954, therefore, he had an opportunity once more of doing away with this measure if he so wished.</P>
      <P>This Bill relates to the control of prices, including food, clothes, fuel and rent.  That is the basis of this Bill.  It is designed to keep a fair balance between prices and wages.  If we did not have this legislation we would have to replace it by some other legislation with a similar purpose and a similar effect.  It has been necessary for us to decide whether the existing legislation should be replaced or kept in force for a further period.  Now this legislation has been found, not alone during the war years but since the war years, to be reasonably effective and in the changing circumstances over the years, since the end of the war, this legislation has been found reasonably flexible in meeting those changing circumstances. Our complaint against the Fianna Fáil Party is that they always failed to preserve a fair balance between the cost of living and the level of wages.  We have only to look back and see what has occurred.  We remember that Fianna Fáil put up the cost of living by 23 points from 1951 to 1954.</P>

      <P>They put it up 13 points in their Budget.  They put that Budget to a vote here and got it passed.  In the ultimate the cost of living went up by 23 points during that period, but wage levels did not increase to the same extent.  They did not keen pace with the cost of living, and that was our complaint.  There is a clear example <Col N="903" /> of what happened in the case of the civil servants.  Towards the end of 1954, the employees of the State put their case to an independent judge and he decided, in their favour, that the margin between the level of their incomes and the cost of living had been made greater by the policy of Fianna Fáil in increasing the prices of items included in the index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>My complaint is that, so far as the cost of living is concerned, Fianna Fáil allowed the cost of essential <Col N="904" /> goods to go up and, at the same time, kept down the level of wages.  If you like, they did not allow wages to chase the cost of living at a uniform rate.  When the margin as between the level of the cost of living and the income of the civil servants was made greater than it ought to be, the civil servants put their case to an arbitrator, if you like, to decide as between the State and the civil servants.  Having considered all the circumstances, that arbitrator decided that the case made by the civil servants was the correct one and that the margin between their income and the level of the cost of living had been made greater by the action of the Government; and he awarded them retrospective pay.</P>
      <P>Now I come back to the point I was going to make, had I been allowed. The civil servants were granted retrospective pay because the arbitrator decided that Fianna Fáil had allowed the margin to grow greater.  But the Fianna Fáil Government decided not to pay that retrospective award.  They decided that the State would not pay that money although it had been awarded on an independent decision. That is the civil servants' side of the case so far as the margin between wage levels and the cost of living is concerned.</P>
      <P>Are we not correct in assuming that the same position existed in the commercial world between the wage levels of our workers and the cost-of-living increases that occurred during those years?  The margin probably became greater there, too, than existed at the particular time which was the basis of the argument.  The point I am making is that so far as the inter-Party Government is concerned we are taking steps to ensure, and have adopted a policy which ensures that wage earners, people in business and people receiving incomes from other sources, will be enabled to keep pace with the cost-of-living increase if there is a rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the Fine Gael Party promised to reduce prices.  When that case was made it was intended that the margin between the cost of living and the prices would be reduced, and we have done so.  Although the cost of living has gone up a number of points the average level of our <Col N="905" /> people's earnings has gone up a greater number of points.  Consequently, the people were compensated for any rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Fianna Fáil Party advocating a reduction in prices of certain commodities but do not forget that they are, in effect, advocating a reduction of wages which form the basis of those prices.  We should hear from Fianna Fáil whether, if they suggest we should reduce prices, we should also reduce wage levels.  That is the effect of the case being made by Fianna Fáil but they would not use those words.  They would not ask us to reduce wages but they would ask us to reduce prices which form the greater part of the wages being paid to our people.  A suggestion regarding a reduction of prices is a suggestion of a reduction of wages.</P>

      <P>Why do not the Fianna Fáil Party say that they want wages reduced again?  That is the point they are in fact making but they do not want to use those words.  We know they were very fond of the Wages Standstill Order and at the same time they allowed the cost of living to get out of control.  We remember the conditions that existed in 1948 when we took office, nearly three years after the war.  People were on a ration of two oz. butter per week at a rationed price.  We used this Supplies and Services Bill in the years which followed to enable us to adopt a two-price system.  The two-price system enabled us to give a larger ration of a ½ lb. of butter per week.  Eight <Col N="906" /> oz. per week were given instead of two oz. at the same price as Fianna Fáil were giving the people two oz. In addition to that they had the opportunity of purchasing any extra butter at the normal cost.  We used this Bill also to give to the consumer a ¼ lb. of tea instead of a ½ oz. at the same price as in 1948.  In addition to that we gave them all the tea they wanted at 3/- a lb.</P>

Deputy Lemass talked about reductions in prices.  This Bill enables food prices to be adjusted upwards and downwards.  I would like to remind Deputy Lemass that when this Government came into office in 1954 we reduced the price of bread and we also reduced the price of butter by 5d. a pound.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Lemass is not here because he knows himself we also used the powers under this Bill to keep the price of butter down by 5d. a lb., costing approximately £2,000,000.  That reduction of 5d. a lb. was a contribution of £2,000,000 to the dairying industry of this country. The fate of that industry was in the balance when we took office in 1954.  In February, 1954, a strike took place and the farmers refused to sell the milk. The demand for creamery butter was falling very rapidly because the Fianna <Col N="907" /> Fáil Party had put the price of butter so high.  The inter-Party Government reduced it by 5d. and the sales of Irish creamery butter continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They increased.  The statistics again will show that when we reduced the price of Irish creamery butter to the consumer the quantity being consumed increased.  We heard Deputy Lemass talking about pledges and promises but did we ever read a pledge or promise so clear as Point 15 in the Fianna Fáil programme which they enunciated in 1951 to maintain food subsidies and to control prices? In less than 12 months they increased the price of bread by 3d. a loaf; they increased the price of butter by 1/4 a lb. and they also increased the prices of tea, cigarettes, beer and spirits.</P>
      <P>The only thing they took off, of course, was the tax on the dance halls. That was the contribution which they made to the national economy that year.  So, when we hear the Fianna Fáil Party talking about pledges and promises and undertakings given, let them never forget Point 15 of their own programme which, in fact, was thrown overboard at the first opportunity. That point is supposed to have been a promise to five irresponsible Deputies who came into this House and changed the Government although they had been elected to vote against Fianna Fáil in the nomination of a Taoiseach. Those five gentlemen were not returned to this House when they went to the electors and asked them once more to send them into the Dáil to turn their coats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but this Bill refers to the maintenance of food subsidies and the controlling of prices. That is what I am speaking about.  I heard Deputy Lemass talking about the purchasing power of the £.  That was a very brazen reference because, if he goes to the trouble of looking up the records, he will find that from 1932, when the Fianna Fáil Party came into office, to 1948, when they went out of office, the purchasing power of the £ dropped 10s.  That was a fair contribution towards the reduction of the purchasing power of the £ in the space of 16 years.  The purchasing power of the £, of course, has fallen since.  The Fianna Fáil Party do not seem to remember that at least they cut the value of the £ in half over the period of 16 years.</P>
      <P>Let us remember, when we are considering the cost-of-living level, that we must take three things into consideration. We must see what is the total national income.  We must see whether it is going up or coming down and if the level of wages is keeping a reasonable distance in front of the cost of living.  These three factors will contribute to stability.  I agree with the remark of one of the Deputies opposite that when we have taken these three aspects into consideration, the fourth and the most important factor to the nation is productivity.  It is on productivity that our policy should be based.  Our efforts should be directed towards an increase of productivity because in productivity lies the possibility of prosperity and improvement in the standard of living.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Lemass talking about the standard of living.  Is there anybody here who will compare the standard of living that existed in 1948 with the standard of living that exists at the present time, after two terms under the inter-Party Government?</P>

      <P>Is there anybody who remembers the 100,000 families in Dublin City, sleeping on staircases and in hallways, waiting for houses after eight years of Fianna Fáil before the war and three years after the war?  In addition we remember the weekly ration of 2 oz. of Irish creamery butter in this agricultural country and the fact that people had to go under the counter for a rasher.  We hear from the other side of the House all this talk about pigs.  Let us remember that in 1948, when we came into office, a good price for bacon was about 130/- per cwt. and at the present time the price proposed to be guaranteed for grade A bacon, when we have a surplus to export, is 235/- per cwt.  At that time there was a complete shortage of bacon in the country.</P>
      <P>We remember also that there was a shortage of cattle and sheep in the country.  The total value of our exports at that time in live stock was only approximately £40,000,000.  Let me remind Deputies, when there is all this talk about the adverse trade balance, that the adverse trade balance in 1947 was £30,000,000, although the total value of our live stock exported was £40,000,000.  The total value of our live-stock exports at the present time is approximately between £110,000,000 and £120,000,000.  They are comparing the adverse trade balance of to-day with the adverse trade balance of 1947, which was £30,000,000, in relation to live-stock exports of £40,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in my comment and to deal with one specific matter only.  Before I do so I want, without any discourtesy to the Parliamentary Secretary, to inform him of the point I make and the subject matter of my remarks so that he may reply to-night.  Otherwise, I shall ask here to-morrow for special time to have this matter discussed.  I want, in an uncontentious manner, to have the Minister's view, if possible, to-night so that the time of the House will not be taken up to-morrow and he will be <Col N="910" /> saved and I will be saved the trouble of having this thing thrashed out <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>
      <P>In order to ensure, as far as the Acting-Chairman is concerned, that I am keeping within the rules of procedure on this particular Bill, I want to assure the Acting-Chairman that the matter to which I intend to refer is definitely a matter that comes under Supplies and Services.  The subject matter has already been dealt with under a Bill that was passed in this House last November, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1955.  In his opening statement on that Bill the Minister said, as reported in Volume 153, column 943, of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Powers of this nature sought to be afforded by the Bill is already available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, but I have felt it desirable to provide a firmer basis for powers, the necessity for which arose largely out of the emergency conditions which prevailed from 1939 onwards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, in so far as the matter concerned is related to that particular Bill of 1955, it can also be raised on this Supplies and Services measure.</P>
      <P>To get down to the actual matter in question, it is in connection with the supply and processing of waste paper in this country.  Deputies may be aware that in recent weeks &mdash; within the last three weeks &mdash; a statement was published in a number of daily papers that the save waste paper campaign which had been so successful for the last two or three years was in jeopardy and that the paper mills in this country that had been taking the waste paper had decided, in view of the glut that was brought about through imports, to cease taking the supply of waste paper from the rural areas and from the city areas in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote the <i>Irish Times</i> of March 13th:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The National Waste Paper Company of Waterford has so much waste <Col N="911" /> paper on hands that it has informed collectors that it will not accept any at least for three or four weeks.  The reason for the present glut, according to an official of the Waterford company, is that nearly every parish in Ireland is collecting waste paper now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the company's statement, but I propose to show the House, from statistics available in the Minister's own Department, that is completely untrue; that this glut has arisen, not through collections in rural Ireland, but through imports of waste paper from Bristol, Belfast and other centres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to argue that the glut that has come about is due to imports rather than to extra supplies on the home front as suggested by the particular companies themselves.  For the past couple of years the two leading mills in Ireland, namely, the Killeen Paper Mills and the National Board and Paper Company in Waterford, have, through various publicity campaigns, urged the people in rural Ireland and in the cities to collect waste paper and they said if this waste paper was collected a reasonable price would be given by these two mills so that that paper would be processed and used at a later date.  We know that all over Ireland prominent, high-ranking churchmen asked the parishioners to embark on a &ldquo;Save Waste Paper&rdquo; campaign.  That appeal was made and met with a wide response generally.  People began to become thrifty with regard to paper and they felt if they collected it they would get reasonable remuneration. Apart from that, they felt they were doing a good day's work for the country <Col N="912" /> by helping to reduce this balance of payments problem.</P>
      <P>Now we find that after all the encouragement, the save waste paper campaign has resulted in a large supply of waste paper being made available, a first-class organisation for its collection being set up and quite a number of experts being employed in the sorting of it.  We find the two companies now responsible for initiating this campaign have suggested that due to the increasing amount of waste paper available in Ireland they have to refuse to take further supplies.  What is the real position?  In January of 1956 alone imports under the heading of &ldquo;Paper&mdash;waste, old paper&rdquo; we had 21,799 cwt. valued at £14,736.  From January to December of 1955&mdash;that is the previous 12 months &mdash; we had 506,816 cwt. of waste paper imported and the cost of that was £347,834.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only quote January to show that waste paper is coming in at the present moment from abroad when the firms maintain that they have a glut of waste paper from Irish sources.  Yet here in January we have this amount being imported from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get this clear. The argument, according to the spokesman of this National Board and Paper Company, is that the reason for the present glut is that nearly every parish in Ireland is collecting waste paper now.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were alert enough, he would exercise the powers conferred on him under the Supplies and Services Act or under the Control of Imports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1955 to ensure that this mess would not have taken place and that there would be rigid <Col N="913" /> control over the importation of waste paper while suitable waste paper supplies were available from home sources.  That is the point I want to make.  Nobody would for a moment suggest that a complete prohibition on the import of waste paper should take place: no such unreasonable suggestion is made, but the point I want to make is that when the supply is available from home sources of a reasonable type, equal to the imported commodity, why should the people be deprived of an opportunity of selling waste paper here and why should these companies or mills be allowed to import it at the same time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a good case there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want the Minister to do is to examine this position forthwith.  It is not next week I want him to do it.  He was asked about it last week and I understand he has sent one of his officials to some of these people concerned.  So far no decision has been taken although a number of experts in the processing of waste paper have lost their employment within the last week.</P>
      <P>Apart from dealing with the immediate crisis that has arisen with regard to supplies, I want the Minister to have this thing thoroughly examined, because there is a lot more in it than meets the eye.  These two particular mills to which I have referred &mdash; one in particular at any rate &mdash; got substantial credit from the Industrial Credit Corporation in order to carry out its work. It is financed by Irish capital and the loan given to it is at a relatively low rate, only a very low rate of interest being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are tariff facilities made available also, ranging from 37½ to 50 per cent. to protect the industry against foreign competition, and yet we find a company like this set up with the help of home capital, with a large loan made available to it by the Irish people, turning down waste paper given by the Irish people in order to give preference to imports of that commodity from Bristol, Belfast and elsewhere.  There is no justification for that position where a Government or a Minister has <Col N="914" /> the power to ensure that that position is remedied.</P>
    <P>I gave figures here.  The sum of £347,834 was expended on the importation of waste paper.  That works out at an average of £13 to £16 per ton spent abroad on waste paper.  Now let us look at the figure given by these two mills for waste paper collected here in Ireland.  I want to make it clear to the House that in the two categories of craft and printed paper the home supplied waste paper is of equally high standard as that imported.  But there is a vast difference in prices.  The average price per ton for the imported article is £13 to £16 and the home collector gets at the maximum between £4 and £6 per ton for Irish waste paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the price is ex the town in which the paper is collected. I am sure freight charges would be 10/- to 12/- a cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not taken into consideration the freight costs of the imported commodity, but I know that £4 to £6 is the price given by the home collector.  Before it reaches the mill the cost to be added would probably be 15/- to £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing the Deputy's case but I am afraid he is not equating the prices fairly.  He is not adding the cost of collecting the paper in towns throughout the country and of taking it to Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am not sure of the freight costs attached to the imported commodity.  I take it it is included in the £13 to £16 per ton, but I am not sure.  If we allow £1 a ton for the cost of the transport of Irish waste paper it should satisfy Deputy Barry's anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be much more than £1 a ton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think a fair price is being given to the home supplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The freight charge <Col N="915" /> would be at least £5 a ton from the average town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that the highest quality craft paper, when taken into the mill in Waterford, is paid for at the rate of £10 per ton. That is the maximum.  For the other type of paper the maximum price paid is £6 per ton at the mill.  That is the fairest way I can put it.  You can compare that highest price of £6 with the £13 to £16 paid for the imported commodity.  I shall not make any charges here against particular firms, but I want the matter to be thrashed out with the Minister because to-morrow I can assure him I will make charges in the House if there is not a specific guarantee that he will have the matter clarified.  I can produce enough evidence to have an inquiry held into the whole set-up of one of these companies.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why I felt it desirable to raise this question on this Bill was the statement made by the Minister himself last November when he introduced a Bill for the control of exports.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There remains a short list of essential industrial raw materials including, for example, timber, aluminium, scrap and waste paper which are still in short supply and the unrestricted export of which could seriously disrupt our industrial production and industrial employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister then asked for special powers to prevent the export of an essential industrial raw material called waste paper.  That power was given to him by this House but the particular mills which require this commodity failed to accept it and at the same time we allow foreign waste paper to be brought into the country, thus harming not alone the drive for waste paper collection but the livelihood of many of those engaged in the processing and classifying of this waste paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not say anything more about it at the moment.  It is the only matter to which I wish to refer on this measure and I do hope the Parliamentary <Col N="916" /> Secretary will convey my remarks to the Minister because I feel sure that when he examines the situation this evening he will take the necessary steps to remedy the situation.  The mills might be prevailed upon to take surplus waste paper which now lies in the hands of collectors throughout the country because much of it is going to waste at the moment.  The serious situation could arise where those people who are enthusiastic enough to act as voluntary collectors for desirable parochial purposes will no longer continue the drive for waste paper and that campaign will die out.  That would be a tragic thing to allow to happen especially when we in the House have the power to ensure that protection is given to all home suppliers by reducing the quantity imported.  In order that the home surplus will be immediately taken, an embargo should be put to-morrow on the imported article.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise to the Minister in a general way that when he is carrying out an examination of the position he will get his experts to compare, category by category, the imported waste paper with the home supplied commodity so that he will be able to ensure that the same situation does not arise as existed in the bacon factories. Where the bacon factories are concerned, the farmer had no come-back because he had to take the word of the particular factory as far as the grade of pig is concerned.  The Minister for Agriculture is now in a position to have inspectors on the job and I see no reason why a Department of Industry and Commerce inspector would not be present in these paper mills to decide as to whether the Irish-supplied waste paper is equal in quality and standard to the imported stuff.  If such is the case the Minister should ensure that a proper price is paid for the home material &mdash; that the home collector will get as good a price for waste paper as is paid for the imported material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy McQuillan on this question.  At the moment there is a deputation waiting on me to complain that their supply of waste paper is cut by at least 60 per cent.  I believe that <Col N="917" /> decrease in demand for waste paper is due to the cause pointed out by the Deputy&mdash;too much waste paper is being imported.  If this thing is not handled immediately by the Minister and his departmental officers a chaotic situation will arise and a number of deserving charitable organisations throughout the country who have been selling waste paper will have to close down.  If this trade is disorganised through the laxity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and if the market is to be glutted by imported paper, when we have a lot of paper at our disposal here, it is going to be a bad thing for the people in that industry.  It is a matter that deserves the immediate consideration of the Minister and his Department because it is one of the small links that make up the life of our country and no matter how small a link may be, it is well worthy of sympathetic consideration. I do not see why we should import it when we produce a certain amount of it here.  There should be some supervision and I have just got a note telling me that there are people in the House who want to see me to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>On this Bill I want to say that there is a serious position facing this country through the incompetence of the inter-Party Government.  I say that in all seriousness.  When we, in Fianna Fáil, tried to adopt a policy that had proved successful in other countries which had enjoyed their freedom for hundreds of years, a policy that was successful in bringing this country through World War II, it was scorned and jeered at by the inter-Party group. There is only one way to build up a nation and that is to develop the natural resources of the nation.  When, many a time, I spoke in this House to defend a manufacturer, a manufactured product or an agricultural product, I was told that I was only concerned with vested interests.  Now the members of the inter-Party Government are beginning to learn what they have done when they interfered with the national and economic well-being of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the Fianna Fáil Party, are not afraid to put the interests of Ireland <Col N="918" /> and the people of Ireland before the interests of our own Party.  The statements made by members of the inter-Party Government in 1948, again in 1951 and again in 1954, have disturbed people in charge of production in this country, the people in a position to contribute something to the welfare of the country.  Due to these statements, these people did not know how they stood.  The continuity of a policy for the improvement of our agricultural production was always in the balance when it came to an election. The agriculturists did not know where they stood; they did not know whether a new Government was going to import things which could be produced here.  That position should not be allowed to exist from the national point of view and I hold the people on the other side of the House responsible for it.</P>
    <P>We all know that people in other countries who have succeeded in improving their standards of living, their natural resources and their interests, have done so by means of a continued and definite policy, and not a policy which can be changed directly one Government leaves office and another comes into power.  The inter-Party group accused us of not bringing home our foreign investments but now we find ourselves facing an adverse trade balance of £109,000,000.</P>
    <P>When I spoke here about certain agricultural products and asked for reasonable production of these products, I was told that I was not concerned with the concerns themselves, but only with the vested interests.  Is there any wonder that we now have an adverse trade balance of £109,000,000?  We all heard the present Minister for Industry and Commerce say that manufacturers should be behind closed doors and saying that people who produced anything were taking advantage of the country.  The same applies to the tourist industry.  We were misrepresented on that also and we were told that we were raising white elephants.  So long as we have that mentality in this Dáil, so long as certain public representatives approach things in that line and insult people from whom we are anxious to get more <Col N="919" /> production, our trade balance will be on the wrong side.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are anxious to co-operate with any Government which is doing something useful for the nation, but I hold that the statements made by responsible Ministers from time to time have brought about the present state of affairs facing the country.  It is a serious thing that the people of Ireland can be deluded by election promises into voting for such people.  The electors were deluded by election posters which said that if they elected the inter-Party groups they would have nothing before them but lán-a-mhála.  There is one compliment I must pay to these people-as far as making promises or getting out an election poster are concerned, you cannot beat them.  One issued not long ago said, &ldquo;Lower taxes, better times.&rdquo;  We had that only a short time ago.  It is not my intention to quote all the promises that were made but I would refer to the promise that we were going to have the prices of all commodities considerably reduced. Every single commodity we needed, we were going to buy cheaper.  Statements were made by responsible Ministers of the inter-Party Government that the people naturally expected were true and honest.  What did they find?  That there was no honesty and no sincerity in these statements.  Ministers made promises and gulled the people.  The people believed that all they had to do was vote for an inter-Party Government and everything would be all right.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the position that the cost of living is continuing to rise.  We are told that the machinery set up by Fianna Fáil is not too bad at all, although prior to the election they were to change all that.  They had plans up their sleeves.  I do not know whether the plans were up both sleeves. I do not know whether they lost them coming to the Dáil after the election, but all the plans were up their sleeves. They had cures for all our ills.  They reminded me of the magician touring the fairs down the country with a bottle to cure everything.  The members of the inter-Party Government were like him &mdash; they could cure everything &mdash;they had the right method.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> The position is a serious one.  The Government will have to give confidence to the people who are in a position to produce, to farmers, manufacturers and other sections of our community engaged in production. These must be assured of support if they are doing reasonably good work and they must know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister, will not give an import licence which will have the effect of putting them out of business.</P>
    <P>On many an occasion from 1948 to 1951, I defended our producers here.  I tried to get all the protection I could for them.  I tried to get them a square deal.  All that time, the inter-Party Government failed to realise that we were speaking in the national interest. They did not realise that it was the national well-being and the national welfare of our people which were at stake.  They thought it was a Fianna Fáil ramp, as they so often described it.  Apparently they have not learned very much, even in those years from 1948 to 1951.  They destroyed the economic trend and the prosperity that we at least had brought about.  In 1948 when Fianna Fáil were defeated. Deputy Lemass pointed out that we were handing over the country in a sound financial position and he asked the inter-Party Government to give it back to us in the same condition.</P>

      <P>This Government has succeeded in destroying both the <Col N="921" /> confidence and the initiative of our people, the confidence and initiative we gave them to develop industries and establish factories and to produce more from the land.  Responsible statesmen are supposed to constitute the present Government.  Will they ever change their outlook?  Will they ever cease quibbling and telling the people they are honest with them? Will they get down to the economic potential of the country and assure those who are prepared to develop industries or produce more from the land that they will stand by them and see they get an even break?  Will they try to get an export market for their surplus produce?  These are the vital economic matters which concern us.</P>
      <P>Emigration is perhaps the worst cancer from which we suffer to-day. We are not facing up to the position at all.  We should take some practicable steps to keep our young people at home.  If something is not done, we will soon be in the position that we will be a nation of old men and women because the youth is going, day after day. The Labour Party, as well as all the other Parties in the Coalition, will have to take responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Rooney telling us what the inter-Party Government did in 1948.  No Government was in such a sound financial position as the inter-Party Government was in 1948, having been handed over a shipshape country.  No Government could have wished to take up office under better auspices.  Looking back to-day, I think it would have paid the inter-Party Government then to have advertised for an economist to advise them on the proper way of running the country.  None of us here wish to betray those who gave their lives to free this country.  We talk about getting back the Six Counties.  One of the greatest contributions we could make towards achieving that object would be by managing our economic affairs here properly and putting our own house in order.  When we do that, we shall be going some way towards securing the unity of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many times I have wondered whether or not some of the Ministers in the <Col N="922" /> inter-Party Government are really serious.  Many a time I have had to tell myself they could not be serious in the statements they make.  I heard the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce say, sitting here on this side of the House, that we were overtaxing the people to the extent of £10,000,000. They succeeded in bolstering up that case and getting others to support them in it.  Would any responsible man tell any responsible Government that they had overtaxed the people by £10,000,000 more than required to meet the ordinary demands in the particular financial year?  What can one expect from the people who indulge in that type of misrepresentation?  Remember the ornate posters they put out during the election.  Remember the promises they made, by implication if you like. Then they come in here and say they made no promises.  Just like Pilate, they wash their hands.  Had they made no promises and had they not indulged in misrepresentation, they would not be in Government to-day.  I am sorry for the people who have reposed trust in this Government for so long.</P>
    <P>In regard to price control, we were told that prices were to be slashed, that we were helping to keep prices up, and that we would not interfere with certain people.  We were told also that the machinery we had for price control was outdated and that the present Government intended to introduce up-to-date methods in regard to prices. They have had their opportunity and they have failed miserably.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the biscuit industry.  My information in relation to this industry is that it did not get a square deal from the Government. It was a very important industry within the country and also in connection with exports.  It was so important as an export industry that not alone should the Government not have hampered it, but they should have helped it. All the Governments in Europe to-day have to go as far as subsidising various industries in an effort to get into the export market.  That is the intelligent line that economists have taken in most progressive countries.  Here <Col N="923" /> through mismanagement and neglect the biscuit industry, which had enjoyed such a prominent position in the export market, is now fighting for its very existence.  In two firms alone engaged in this industry there are about 600 people who have lost their employment. While that is serious enough, it is still more serious that an industry is damaged because of a lack of guidance and a lack of encouragement and sympathy on the part of the Government and the particular Department dealing with this very fine industry.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the tea and the butter.  We were to have cheap tea and cheap butter for all time according to a statement that was made here when the present Government were subsidising the price of tea and butter.  However, they changed very quickly and when the bubble burst completely they told the people of Ireland they would have to pay the full economic price for tea and butter.  Of course, that was another of the election promises gone with the wind.  Whatever about the various promises in regard to reducing prices I thought that in regard to tea and butter they would at least have said to themselves: &ldquo;We will give cheap tea and butter to our people so that when we go on the platforms we can say we did our best to hold at least two subsidies.&rdquo;  They were not able to do it even for 12 months and that was another broken promise.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the increase in the bank rate and in regard to the local loan charges.  When the local loan charges went up during our term of office there was a big meeting in O'Connell Hall which I attended. I wanted to assist the people who had already contracted for the buying out of their own houses and on that platform I was supported by many members of the inter-Party Government, including the Attorney-General.  That night I made an appeal to my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that the people who had already contracted for the buying out of their houses would not be charged the increased rates, and I succeeded in that appeal.  While I dealt with the matter from another angle, the Attorney-General <Col N="924" /> and some of the members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party raised their hands in horror at the thought of the loan charges going up, saying that if they were in power this would not happen.  The question was only approached by them for one reason, to discredit the Government in office.  The idea was that it did not make any difference whether they made false statements; they must discredit the Government at all costs.  They succeeded to a great extent in discrediting us.  Now they are in office and the loan charges are going up and, worse than that, the people cannot get the loans now.  We have the position in the Dublin Corporation to-day that the people do not know how they stand. The people who have made application or entered into commitments do not know what they will be charged for the loan or whether they will get it at all.  The loan charges have gone up considerably over 5 per cent. and there are no big meetings now to protest.  I must say the present Government have a wonderful way of muzzling a lot of people who were very vocal during our term of office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass spoke about the fuel position.  The Government should get their advisers to examine the position and not allow things to develop until such time that we will wake up some morning and find ourselves with no fuel.  The only thing I hope is that, after the years of office that the inter-Party Government have now enjoyed, they have learned something and that they will give up their codology and do something to improve conditions within the country.  I hope they will extricate the country from its present economic muddle and that they will give up making false statements to the people of Ireland.  As I have said before, I am not asking that as a Fianna Fáil representative, because we are concerned to put the national interests before the interests of our own Party.  The Coalition have made a bad job of it.  Whether it is in by-elections or general elections that they preach to the people, the sensible people of this nation and the people that have the well-being of this nation at heart know well that they have made a bad job of it and are continuing to do so.</P>

      <P>When I came into this House first, Sir, I was very impressed by Deputy Lemass.  When he used to wrap that cloak of vehemence around him and his eyes used to blaze with honest indignation, I felt that I had done something serious.  Having witnessed that performance many times I realised that it was all part of a very theatrical kind of act.  He conducts his speech-making in this House, as far as I can see, by a series of interrogatory demands.  The only thing he did not ask this evening was whether we had stopped beating our wives.  I really think I would prefer even the bumbling kind of Toryism that Deputy Aiken puts out here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass says that in 1953 he had made a major decision that he was going to get rid of this kind of legislation. Back in 1953, he thought that, that it was not right, that no Government should be trusted with that power.  I wonder would I be uncharitable if I thought that Deputy Lemass, at that time, saw some cracks in the edifice and realised that he was a member of a Government that was supported by four very wobbly pillars which might come down at any time, that the future of Fianna Fáil was anything but a secure and pleasant future and that it would be better that whatever Government the Irish people would select in future should not have this kind of authority.  I just wonder if I am being uncharitable in thinking that Deputy Lemass, like members of his Party, would think that excessive powers would be quite safe in the hands of Fianna Fáil, but not so safe in the hands of other people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had only intended to speak in this debate because of the very vehement references Deputy Lemass made about tea.  I do feel that I do know a little bit about tea.  He has alleged that we have behaved with extraordinary incompetence in the way we have handled the tea situation here.  The case he has made against us is that the people are paying 3d. per lb. more for tea than the world market price.  It is only a year ago that he made a similar speech and he said the rest of the world were paying 3/- per lb. <Col N="926" /> more for tea than the Irish consumer and asked when were we going to face up to it, what were we going to do about it.  We displayed consideration for the consumers' purse and we were able to supply the consumer for ten months after Deputy Lemass made that speech at what he alleged was 3/- under the world market price.  That was a very considerable achievement and the people are remembering us for it.</P>
    <P>I do not know yet what the future of the tea situation will be, but I do think it will not be anything as serious for the Irish people as it would be if Deputy Lemass had the ordering of our tea supplies because I must remember, when he talks about incompetence, that when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce he went on the market and bought over 2,000,000 lb. of tea at 1/2½ per lb. and the Irish consumer paid 4/- per lb. for that tea.  I am not saying that the difference was all profit.  The difference was taking up the loss incurred by incompetent buying in the remainder of our supplies.</P>
    <P>Every time I mention that, Deputy Lemass gets very sore and very annoyed, but I know the facts of the case.  Tea was delivered to my stores at that time from Tea Importers, Eire, Limited, ostensibly having arrived from India, but still bearing the wharf marks of the London stores.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass says that we should not go to London to buy tea, that this Government should not have power to have a Supplies and Services Bill. Deputy Lemass could do that kind of thing, but we should not be allowed to do it.  I think I have found out about Deputy Lemass and I think there is a good deal of stage thunder about the act he puts on here.</P>
    <P>His allusion to the bank rate this evening was, I think, very typical also. I do not know whether he approves of what the Government did ten or 12 months ago in preventing an increase in the bank rate.  Does he contend that we should not have controlled the price of money at that time?  He conveyed to the House that it was only a few weeks from the time we had made <Col N="927" /> that decision that we changed our minds, but actually it was ten months afterwards.</P>
    <P>I should like to know where Deputy Lemass stands in this business.  Does he think it is wise that an Irish Government should have a say in these important matters or does he agree with Deputy MacEntee and think that we should not poke our fingers into this kind of thing, should leave it to those gentlemen whom some people in the House have described as pulling the money strings without the people's consent?</P>
    <P>At any rate, there are differences of opinion in the opposite benches about this.  As far as I know, there are no differences on this side of the House. I think this House asserts a certain authority over the financial affairs of this country and that anybody who makes any step towards emphasising that assertion of authority should get support from every side of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass wound up by saying that what the people could expect from the Fine Gael Party was to be put under a stone in a bog.  That particular sentence, I think, was a fair sample of what he spent an hour and a half saying.  That sentence was as related to the truth as his whole speech was. The Irish people know that they will get a bit more from this side of the House than being put under a stone in a bog and they know very well that the entire Fianna Fáil Party climbed down off those benches there three years ago and climbed up those stairs to vote to increase the price of bread from 6d. to 9d. per head and that is putting a bit more than a stone on top of their bodies in a bog.  It is about time that we did not allow them to get away with that kind of thing.  I will stop because I get too cross about things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke is at the other extreme of the Fianna Fáil Party.  His näiveté is delicious.  He says that Fianna Fáil have complete loyalty to this country. He would not agree, I am sure, that the Fianna Fáil Party and their newspaper had in any way influenced the price of cattle in this country in the last few months; he would not agree that <Col N="928" /> Deputy Aiken, with his Kildare Street Club menality, had done anything to injure the prospects of raising money for public purposes in this country in the last two weeks, and would not agree that Deputy Lemass, in the speech he made an hour ago, had done anything to injure the savings campaign undertaken by this Government. The truth about all this is that the Fianna Fáil Party loyalty is much narrower than their loyalty to Ireland.</P>

      <P>On this debate it is, of course, exceptionally difficult to follow the line of reasoning which actuates Fianna Fáil in its decision, announced by Deputy Lemass, that they will vote against the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has based his case on the claim that by now legislation should be available, and, of course, the range of legislation that should be available to replace this emergency legislation is exceptionally wide.  I said last year I would go a good deal of the way with speakers on the Fianna Fáil side in last year's debate and I expressed the view that it was time that we had a <Col N="929" /> permanent policy in regard to price control.  But price control is only one of the major features of emergency powers covered by this Bill and the farce is completely exposed when we realise that if many of the emergency powers that are embodied in this Bill &mdash; which Fianna Fáil proposes to vote against&mdash;were not given to the Government, many of the measures which Fianna Fáil require the Government to carry out in order to meet what they regard now as an emergency situation could not be taken.  These include the appeal made by Deputy Burke a few moments ago asking the Minister to deal with the importation of paper pulp.  Deputy Burke is going to vote against this Bill and at the same time he asks the Minister for Industry and Commerce to control these paper imports.  That is a lot of cod of the type that we get from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and we are entitled to fill in the gaps.  However, I want to deal with some of the points in this debate and I am mainly concerned with a problem which we discussed here before.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present; House counted, and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. J. Larkin Mr. J. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that probably the main point on which the discussion develops in regard to the present Bill is price control machinery. Again we have an opportunity of reviewing the operation of that machinery during the past 12 months.  In the course of Deputy Childers' speech at the opening of this debate he expressed the view that there should be permanent character given to this <Col N="931" /> legislation.  I expressed that view last year and, despite the remarks made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the difficulties of trying to provide permanent price control machinery in the present circumstances of fluctuating economic conditions, I am still an unrepentant believer that we should have by this a permanent prices policy and permanent price machinery.  The machinery still requires to be improved.</P>
      <P>One of the factors we seem to have lost sight of in considering price control machinery is that many members of the House seem to think of it only in relation to what we would regard as emergency or fluctuating conditions such as we have had for a number of years since the war, but I believe that, in the economic and fiscal conditions that we have created in this country in respect of a protectionist policy, even in normal times there is need for price control machinery.  We seem to lose sight of the fact that the basis of our protection for industry, and such protection or such assistance as we give to agriculture, is not provided out of the air but out of the pockets of the consumers, and, whether it be in the form of a direct loan to an industry or a guarantee of a trade loan or a substantial grant or merely the imposition of a customs duty, ultimately the cost of that goes back to the general mass of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite farcical for people to think of price control in terms of orthodox operation of the capitalist system and free competition.  We have not got free competition in this country and I am not one of those who believe in it, but I am sometimes amazed, particularly at people of the type of Deputy Childers and Deputy Lemass, who, on the one hand, deprecate some of the more extreme views they say those of us on this bench hold, especially in regard to price control, and, on the other hand, suggest to us that the answer to the problem of price levels is the operation of the ordinary laws of competition when they know themselves that they claim the credit through their policy as a Government and the policy operated by their Party <Col N="932" /> over the years of having introduced measures here which are designed to prevent free competition.</P>
    <P>Competition is not confined to a city or a county or a country.  When speaking of competition we must consider the general economic situation both in this country and outside it, and when we decide&mdash;as we can rightfully decide &mdash;in the interests of Irish industry or of developing our own economic resources or of providing employment that we are going to stop foreign competition, at that time, free competition is no longer possible and let us forget about free competition.</P>
    <P>If we decide on that policy &mdash; with which I agree&mdash;and provide those facilities for Irish manufacturers, is there anything wrong in insisting that in the interests of the consumers, who are the people who pay the cost of that interference with free competition, there should be some control machinery to exercise supervision and control over prices paid for those protected commodities as sold to Irish consumers? That is the problem we are faced with in regard to price control and that problem remains with us whether we have emergency conditions or have the normal conditions such as prevailed prior to 1939.</P>
    <P>But more than merely the question of price is involved because there are certain economic factors that can be taken as the testing point in regard to economic development.  One must add the question of prices because prices represent the relationship between the manufacturer and distributor, on the one hand, and the consumer on the other.  Prices are also a social factor. Equally the problem of wages is not merely a direct transaction between an employer and a worker, but involves the wage fund out of which the worker, when he leaves the factory and becomes a consumer, is going to pay the price for the actual product made by himself or by other workers.  Unless there is a proper relationship between that wage fund and the volume of the commodities available there are going to be economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Because of these factors, the question of price control becomes not merely the problem of the mechanical <Col N="933" /> operation of the Prices Advisory Body, but also involves the question of the formulation of a policy in respect of such items as price levels, profits margins, wage levels and the general extent of protection of the overall national economy that we are prepared to pay in order to bring up our industrial facilities.  That is why I believe that time should have been spent on giving consideration to the ways and means of evolving a permanent price policy and of price control machinery suited to the carrying out of that policy.  Here let me say Deputy Lemass raised the question as to whether everybody is satisfied with the progress of this Government.</P>
    <P>I think if everybody were satisfied with any Government, no matter what the Parties were, there is something wrong because I cannot see how any Government can do everything so completely, efficiently and so rapidly as to satisfy everybody with critical views. I am critical of the present Government because I feel that, in respect of many basic problems, they are not able or they have not yet devised machinery to make it possible to give attention to urgent problems.  One of those is the question of this price control machinery.  Last year in this debate we considered the question of whether prices, which were then on a rising level, would go on rising, whether the powers available to the Government would be effective in keeping down that rise and if they failed what would happen.  I said in that debate that if price levels were to rise, workers would look for increased incomes.  That viewpoint was subsequently accepted by spokesmen of the Government, not in direct form but in the form of declaring that, if factors outside the control of the Government or of the country gave rise to an increase in price levels, there would be justification for workers to seek adjustments in their incomes.</P>
    <P>That has been done to a very wide extent both by direct actions of organised workers and through the form of Government decision in regard to State and local authority employees.  It has still to be carried a stage further in regard to the very large section of people who have no direct organised <Col N="934" /> power of their own because they are the wards of Government offices.  I am talking about the great mass of people dependent upon the goodwill of the community as expressed and conveyed through our social service system.  That particular blank is one that has got to be filled in.</P>
    <P>We now meet again after 12 months to review what has happened since and we are still to some extent facing the problem of rising price levels.  It is still necessary to realise that if these rising price levels continue we will have continued difficulties in the country. It is too much to expect that, unless there is evolved a complete national policy to deal with the situation, you will get one section of the community, those dependent on salaries and wages, voluntarily to sacrifice their standards because action is not taken to adjust the burden to the ability of all sections to bear it.</P>
    <P>That is a problem with which we are faced at the moment.  There is no doubt that, if our prices continue to rise, there will be pressure for adjustment of wages and salaries and even though discussions have been opened between the organised workers and the employers, they are only in their initial stages and developments can take place that will create difficulties with which neither organised workers nor employers will be able to deal.  It is here that probably the most marked difference occurs between the policy carried out by the present Government and that which would be followed if Fianna Fáil were in office.  Were Fianna Fáil on these benches, we would be expecting that by the end of May Government decisions would have been taken that would have a drastic effect on the standard of living.  We would expect that food subsidies would disappear, that inevitably &mdash; you can almost hear it coming from the Deputies opposite; there would be a rise in the bank rate and various other deflationary measures would be taken &mdash;there would be a repetition of the 1951-52 policy.</P>
    <P>I trust that, whatever measures this Government may decide to take to deal with the present situation, one thing they will bear in mind will be <Col N="935" /> that while it may be difficult to deal with the situation there are certain elements of inflation that could be worsened by the pursuit of wrong policies.  That situation would change from inflation to deflation if Fianna Fáil were in office.  It is relatively easy to curb an inflationary situation by proper policy but it is almost impossible, particularly within a short space of time, to change deflation back into a normal, progressive and expanding economy again.</P>
    <P>For that reason, such measures as those adopted in 1952 would, in my opinion, be disastrous for this country. In regard to the question of price control machinery, I expressed the view last year &mdash; I am still of that view and it is now necessary to repeat it&mdash; that nobody expects that any system of price control can of itself prevent prices in all cases increasing or in all cases reducing.  We have, however, a responsibility to the mass of consumers, who, by various direct or indirect means, provide very large subsidies for the establishment and maintenance of Irish manufacturing industries. Purely as a question of right we are entitled to be in a position to have the representations of that Irish manufacturing industry examined.  If we go through the Revenue Commissioners' list of import duties it is surprising to see the great number of commodities that are subject to restriction. To each and every one of these commodities, even if they are not imported, the home market contributes in that form of subsidy.</P>
    <P>That is the case of price control machinery, to assure the public that, when an application is made for a price increase, it will be widely examined, not merely in a neutral attitude but with a definite bias on the side of the consumer, in other words that the Prices Advisory Body will not sit in a calm, judicial atmosphere, in a neutral way, hear all the arguments and then hold a nice balance on the case made as between the consumer and the applicant for an increase in price.</P>
    <P>In my opinion price control machinery should be openly and officially declared to be on the side of the <Col N="936" /> consumer and the attitude to any application should be that we have got to be shown that the case is sound. There is need for that.  It is only a matter of some months since the Government officially had to decide that they could not repeal a recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body, that the case for an application had not been supported by satisfactory costings.  Trade unions are in the habit of making claims for wages before the Labour Court but, even when they have a completely documented and well supported case for an increase, they never have any assurance that their claim is going to be granted.</P>
    <P>The idea that a group of manufacturers, producing an essential commodity, could believe that they could go before a public body, and make a case without presenting adequate information and expert costings indicates to my mind the opinion that these manufacturers have of the Prices Advisory Body.  I cannot conceive a serious body of manufacturers going before the Prices Advisory Body, if they thought that body was going to be difficult to convince and was on the side of the consumer and if that body had the expert staff available to check and counter-check the case put before them, if they did not have complete and adequate information to present to the body.  That seems to be the case according to the Government's own official statement.</P>
    <P>It has happened repeatedly that claims have been made to the body and some of the most elementary facts in regard to the costings of the article have not been available to support that application for an increase.  If the manufacturer of an essential commodity such as bread can go before a public body and submit an inadequate case in support of an application for an increase in price of that essential commodity one can quite easily imagine what would happen if the manufacturer was free to put on the increase on the price without reference to anybody.  That is the problem that faces us in regard to this question of price control machinery and that is why I say that the body should not be neutral in its approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> It should quite definitely be a body that requires to be convinced that there is a case for an increase in price in the present day conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I think it highly desirable that while there is quite a number of expert gentlemen on that body, it still requires expert staff, cost accountants in particular, who will have the responsibility of gathering together all the available information in regard to a particular application.  We want to bear in mind that, in this country, a great deal of information is not available. Our company law is backward and, when applications are made by private companies, no access is possible to their accounts.  Now is the time to rectify this particular defect.  In 1948, Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Finance, indicated his intention of rectifying that situation in regard to company accounts.  That rectification is now long overdue, particularly in the light of the need for more detailed knowledge.</P>
    <P>That expert staff to which I have referred should be available not merely for the private information of the body, but also for that of other parties interested. We should bear in mind that, when manufacturers approach the Prices Advisory Body, they have got at their service information of all their own manufacturing processes.  They have their expert accountants and cost accountants and have every opportunity of making up their case in a most convincing way to the body. Against them at the most are a number of voluntary representatives of the consumers who have no expert staff at their service and who have got no access to confidential information. They are required to stand up in public and represent the consumers.</P>
    <P>I submit that such information as could be gathered together by an expert staff attached to the body should be made available in public, to all parties, then all parties would be enabled to make their case on the basis of the information available to them and then allow the Prices Advisory Body to make the final recommendation. In that way we will have equality between the two interested <Col N="938" /> parties and the body can deal with the application bearing in mind its bias towards the interest of the consumer before making its final decision.</P>
    <P>It is important that when we deal with a situation where prices cannot be kept down and where increases may have to be granted the consuming public should be as widely informed as possible of the reasons why particular increases have been granted.  Again I stress that the Press reports of the proceedings are not always fair to members of the body and to the parties appearing before the body.  Consumers are often left in the dark as to the big factors influencing the Prices Advisory Body or the responsible Minister in finally agreeing to increase a particular price.</P>
    <P>I consider that in the interests of establishing and mainaining confidence, even to a limited degree, on the part of the consuming public in this prices control machinery, it would be desirable, even though it might mean buying space in the newspapers, to publish a short summary of the main points in the particular application and the main reasons on which the recommendations of the body were formulated, either for or against the increase in price.  Prices control machinery has two functions.  It has a disciplinary function in relation to manufacturers and distributors and those who may be seeking to increase prices; it should also have an educational function in relation to consumers generally because, quite clearly, in our particular type of economy and despite the particular type of industrial policy we are operating, it is necessary to try to educate the public, consumers and workers, in regard to many of the factors constituting our economy.</P>
    <P>Even if we are only going to pursue our present policy of industrial protection, it is important that we should carry with us the general mass of the consuming public by convincing them that such a policy is in their best interests, even though it may require from them a sacrifice in the form of a relatively high price level in respect of certain commodities, a higher level than might otherwise obtain if there was free competition on an international market. <Col N="939" /> The balance of employment has to be set against slightly higher prices, security for our own people at home and the building up and strengthening of our overall economy.  These are factors which must be taken into consideration, factors which come under the general heading of prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers referred to one aspect, namely, the question of the need to increase production and increase productivity.  He also made certain references in relation to the problem of the wage factor in prices. Now I think it is very important that we should have some balanced view not only in regard to prices but also in regard to wages.  I have recently been in conference and have heard the statement made by responsible employers that an increase in wages must be reflected in prices.  I am not one of those who take the view that, no matter what wage increases we get, they will not affect prices; but there has to be a little closer analysis than that, and that is why these sweeping statements are so dangerous.  On the one hand, we probably on our side say we can get an increase in wages and there need be no increase in prices as a result of that; the employers say that, if we get an increase in wages, the whole of that increase must be reflected in prices.  That is one of the difficulties in which we find ourselves at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the effect of, say, a 10 per cent. increase in wages in so far as prices are concerned varies very considerably from industry to industry.  Taking industry as a whole in 1952, if there had been a 10 per cent. increase in the total wage in that year the final effect on the value of the gross output of that industry would be a little over 1 per cent.  Yet, when we talk to many employers, a 10 per cent. increase in wages means a 10 per cent. increase in prices.  If one examines that 10 per cent. increase in, say, the biscuit trade, one finds that it reflects a 2 per cent. increase in the gross value of the output. If one takes mines and quarries, the final figure becomes 5 per cent. Quite clearly, we cannot accept the <Col N="940" /> position then that, when there is, as there has been in the past 12 months, a justifiable adjustment in wages and salaries to meet a higher price level automatically employers, manufacturers and distributors are entitled, without question, to apply the same amount of percentage increase on their prices as they have given in wages.</P>
    <P>I had the experience of sitting on a statutory body with employers where agreement was reached to increase wages.  One of our requirements was that they should set down what would be the result and the effect of that increase on prices.  In a period of about 18 months we had three increases in wages.  On the first occasion when we came to the point of answering that question the employers said: &ldquo;It is not worth bothering about; it is very small.&rdquo;  On the second occasion they were a little bit more careful and they said: &ldquo;We cannot exactly say what it will be; we should say it will have some effect.&rdquo;  Those of us who were concerned to be clear on the position replied: &ldquo;If we cannot prove what the effect is, it is better to say nothing.&rdquo;  That passed.  On the third occasion, and by that time there had been fairly considerable increases in wages, we got a statement from the employers' representatives to the effect that we should say, in reply to the question, that &ldquo;the increase in wages will have a very considerable effect on prices, and they must be increased.&rdquo; We said: &ldquo;No; we cannot agree to put that answer down until you bring your accounts in and prove it.&rdquo;  We fought that issue for a whole afternoon and finally, although the employers had insisted they could not in any circumstances carry the increased cost of the wage increase without an increase in prices, rather than prove the point they let the question go; they agreed that it would have no effect on prices.</P>
    <P>Now when those of us who are active in the trade union movement have this particular doubting attitude to the formulation of prices and costings, as expressed by typical employers, we have got very good reason for it for we have had experience of dealing with this problem across the table with the employers and we know from practical <Col N="941" /> experience that the direct effect of any increase in wages varies from industry to industry and is, in certain cases, inappreciable and incapable of measurement; in others it may be appreciable and have to be taken into account.  But we object to the theory that because wages have been increased prices must be increased also. That is not true and that is the reason why all these applications have to be examined carefully and minutely by such a body as the Prices Advisory Body, which does not grant an increase merely because it is applied for but solely on the basis that the case is proven, and proven against the weight of their quite natural bias in favour of protecting the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the question of production, I want to make one or two general remarks.  We have been told that the main way out of our present difficulty is by increasing production.  Nobody on the trade union side disputes that. We are in agreement with increasing production and increasing productivity in the interests of the nation.  But we want to ask two questions: What contribution are the employers making?  If we increase production and productivity to where do the benefits flow? Will the workers get any share?</P>
    <P>Last year a special body was set up to try to deal with this problem of increasing productivity.  It was set up officially under the aegis of the Government. To it were invited representatives of a large number of organisations. It may not be known generally that, although that body has had a number of meetings, the only section that so far has apparently decided that they will not co-operate is the section representative of the employers.  The workers' representatives are there. Where the employers' representatives are at the moment nobody knows.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to have the employers patting themselves on the back, saying they are the only body concerned with the economy of the nation. The real test is that in the world to-day more and more it is becoming accepted that the workers have not only a contribution to make but have a right to make that contribution, and a right also to be heard in relation to the <Col N="942" /> problem of production.  In this country, up to the present, the main spokesmen of the employers have not yet advanced to that view and we are still being told that the place for the worker is outside the door of the boardroom and, when a decision is taken by the directors, he will be told what he must do.  We will never get increased production on that basis.  Even where we have secured co-operation between the two sides we are still entitled to ask to where will the fruits of such increased production flow?</P>
    <P>Are the workers to get any share or is it it all going to be taken by the employers, or if it is not, in what form, whether direct or indirect, will it benefit those for whom the workers have a concern, that is, the mass of the people of the country?  We still have not got answers to those questions.  We are told the workers are too pressing in their claims for an improved standard of living.</P>
    <P>Recently, a paper was read by a gentleman, not as a spokesman for employers, but largely from the point of view of the employer.  He made the statement that on calculations he made, the real wages of workers had gone up about 10 per cent. since 1939.  We are prepared to accept that figure.  That is not a very great advance for the working class to have gained after 17 years, including the emergency, because in that period the national income has gone up nearly three times. The profits of private and public companies have increased over three times.  I grant that the real wages have increased also nearly three times in terms of money.  But the interesting fact is that in industry, where the main bulk of wage workers are employed, up to 1952 production had increased by 75 per cent. and the output per head had gone up by 21 per cent.  In other words every worker employed in industry to-day or in 1952 was contributing 21 per cent. more than he did in 1939.  Nevertheless, his return is only 10 per cent. more than what he got in 1939.  Nobody can cavil when the workers feel that somewhere along the line something has been taken from their reasonable share in this increased wealth they have made.  That is why, when we are dealing with this problem <Col N="943" /> of production and productivity, it is not sufficient to exhort workers; there has got to be a practical balance made, a practical prospect of the future taken and there has got to be some indication of the social objectivity for which we are seeking to increase production.</P>
    <P>My criticism, to some extent, of the present system revolves around the statement made by Deputy Childers. He said one of the weaknesses of the present Government was that they would not make up their mind whether this country was going to be a completely socialist economy or a completely private enterprise economy.  Of course, Deputy Childers, by putting that question, is just showing, to put it very brutally, how stupid he is because Deputy Childers for quite a long time has been fairly closely associated with the manufacturing and employing class in this country &mdash; I am not saying that in any derogatory way &mdash; and he does know that the idea of a completely private enterprise economy has gone for the last 30 or 40 years in this and every other country, that the industrial policy of protection for Irish industries and for Irish agriculture that Fianna Fáil claims to have devised and practised, is a negation of private enterprise and open competition, and that if Irish industry was to be asked tomorrow morning to depend completely on private enterprise and on open competition, probably there would be a collapse in 24 hours and the first to complain would be the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>There is mixed economy here as there is a mixed economy in the home of enterprise, in the United States of America.  We are living in changing times and the old-style capitalism is changing.  Even business people and employers realise that they have to depend on the State and on the community and, if you like, on social concepts of economy to help them in carrying through their responsibilities in the domain of private industry.  For a Deputy, with the knowledge which Deputy Childers has, to put a question like that is foolish and misleading.  My criticism is that the Government, having a national responsibility in regard to the development of the economy <Col N="944" /> of this country, is not exercising its national leadership sufficiently.  I personally believe that, whether it is this Government or Fianna Fáil, within the Cabinet, there should be one, or possibly two, Ministers who have no other responsibility whatever, no administrative or departmental responsibility but to deal with the problem of examining the broad features of our economy, in co-operation naturally with the other Ministers in the Cabinet as a whole, and to try to lay down and secure agreement on the line of our economic development both in regard to industry and agriculture and our general national economy. I believe it is a physical impossibility for a Minister in charge of such major Departments as Agriculture, Finance, Industry and Commerce, to be at the same time in a position where he can sit down and immediately think and ponder on major economic problems, try to relate the various factors that have to be dealt with and evolve a policy that can be pursued over a period of years.  Until that is done we will meet all the difficulties that we are facing at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to close on one note that seems to me to indicate the need of that.  I have on a number of occasions here said that probably all I know about agriculture will never do me or any farmer any harm, but I have at least sufficient simple understanding to be able to see a stone wall when I walk up against it.  In the course of the last few days' debate in regard to the balance of payments, there has been continuous emphasis on one aspect of the problem and that is our inability to expand our exports.  We have had a small expansion in regard to industrial exports.  We have had the difficulty of the fall back in our agricultural exports and that is quite clearly the basic problem.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House would be the slightest bit concerned even if we spent a considerably larger sum of money on importing consumer goods if we were well able to balance them by our exports. The problem is that the balance is not there and, equally clearly, the balance, if it is to be secured, must come from agriculture.  Yesterday in the newspapers there was a report of <Col N="945" /> a discussion among a number of experts as to what they would do to deal with the present agricultural problem.  I think the title was: &ldquo;How I would plan for increased agricultural production&rdquo;. I am merely going to quote one sentence, and again I am not doing it in any critical fashion, but because it is helpful to me in making the point I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan who was a member of this House for many years and is now in the Seanad, in the course of that symposium, is reported as making the following statement.  He said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the real cause of our relatively low agricultural output, in his opinion it lies in the simple fact that the keen, hardheaded farmer here finds from experience that it pays just as well to farm for a low output as to farm for a higher output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Whether that is true or not I do not pretend to know, but I do realise that if that is the case we have a very difficult problem to face and to overcome. It seems to me that there is a great deal of truth in it, in view of the fact that year after year the State has been pouring into agriculture very large sums of money to which I personally have no objection, and I think the majority of people do not object to that aid being given to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I recall in 1949 Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, giving an estimate that in his opinion, in that year or the year before, the direct financial contribution being made to the farming community to assist them in reducing the cost of production was of the order of not less than £10,000,000.  No doubt since that year, with the land reclamation project and the additional assistance being given by successive Governments, that figure has become much greater.  With all due deference to the Minister for Agriculture, who is in the House, it seems to me that we have got into the position where the more money we put into agriculture the less production we get and, therefore, the less exports. Until we find the solution to that problem our whole difficulty in regard to price levels, in regard to production, in regard to improving our <Col N="946" /> industrial economy and the whole standard of life of our people is at stake.</P>
    <P>I will close on the plea that I made a moment ago that my criticism, such as it is, of this Government &mdash; and I would make it of the Fianna Fáil Government if they were in power to-day, because there would probably be no change in regard to the structure of the Cabinet&mdash;is that there is a requirement for making an analysis, for the working out of plans in advance as any careful businessman or any artisan who decides to make an article of furniture, would do.  He would sit down and having determined what he was going to make, he would take the measurements, draw his blue-print and work according to that.  That is just as necessary in regard to the economic life of a nation and a people as it is in regard to individual business.  I do not believe we are doing it.  I do not believe, as I say, the responsible Ministers in the Cabinet have got the physical possibility of doing it and I do not believe that the Cabinet collectively are doing it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I feel, while we have a Cabinet, whether it be inter-Party Government or Fianna Fáil, composed of men of ability, men of understanding of public affairs, that because of the Cabinet structure, with its emphasis on the administrative and departmental responsibility, we are denying to that national leadership the possibility of calm and careful consideration of the economic problems that arise and the possibility of an overall review and an overall plan in the light of what is required.  Granted, Ministers must have departmental responsibility.  Departments have to carry on their work.  But it should be possible to relieve one or two of the leading members of a Government or a Cabinet of this quite clearly routine and soul-killing departmental administrative work which makes it impossible for them to do any creative thinking, any forecasting or any considering of the basic problems.  Let them have expert staff and set them to work on this problem and let us try to produce something in the way of a forecast and a plan of what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> As it is, it seems to me we are going around in circles and, clearly, if there is any substance in Senator Cogan's remarks the other day with regard to the attitude of Irish farmers, then we have a very serious problem on our hands.  I am not blaming the farmers. If a farmer believes that by increasing production he will decrease prices and his ultimate position will be no better than previously he has got the same right as the businessman to keep back production in order to keep up prices. That is part of the economy we live in. I am not blaming the farmer.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Irish farmer for what I feel is part of the explanation of our difficulty that, to the Irish farmer, land is more a question of security, personal and family security, than a means of production.  That is all part of our historical background. But, if we are facing the kind of problem we have to-day in regard to our external trade, our balance of payments, if we are thinking in terms of trying to produce a greater measure of national wealth both in industry and agriculture, quite clearly, if that attitude of mind exists among the Irish farmers, we will not cure it by pouring more and more money into farms.  We have to try to get a change of mind and understanding that the land of Ireland, while it has been won for the farmers by the joint efforts of the farming community and the Irish people as a whole, is a question of trust, that they have an obligation to use that land, not only in their own interest, but in the best interest of the Irish people and that, if they do it, they will get a fair and proper return.</P>
    <P>Equally, they are not entitled, if such be the case, and it does appear to be at the moment, to contribute to an economic problem which is becoming increasingly serious and which finally can only be mended by a very great improvement in agricultural production, which can make its contribution to national wealth and in relation to which we can secure a better balance in our payments and provide a wider economic basis for the development of Irish industries on the basis of raw materials produced in Irish fields.</P>

      <P>In most of the debates here Deputies have dealt with wages and prices.  Deputy Rooney said that if prices went up wages were keeping pace with them.  Deputy Larkin, in the debate on the Vote of No Confidence, said that if prices went up the worker looked for an increase of wages and sometimes he had to wait a long time walking the streets, on strike, before he secured it. He spoke at that time about the helpless people who did not belong to strong trade unions, people who were on fixed incomes, small investments and other things, who were not in a position to catch up with the increase in prices.  I wonder what the Labour Party has done about these helpless people since the time when the Deputy made that statement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health told Deputy Jack Lynch and me that there was no necessity to increase the T.B. benefits, that the recipients had got very good benefits in 1953 from Fianna Fáil. There is nothing now about those helpless people but the worker with the strong trade union can keep up with the increased prices.</P>
      <P>Some months ago there was arbitration in regard to civil servants' pay and the arbitrator made an award which was awaited by several local authorities throughout the country. The award was 10 per cent. increase on the first £300 and 6½ per cent. on the remainder.  In what way have the Labour Party honoured that award this week in Cork?  Seven Labour members of the Cork County Council decided that they would not agree to this.  Three of them are Deputies. They agreed that they would not give the clerical officers and officials in Cork the same salary as they provided for the civil servants in a Supplementary Estimate.  The cost of living did not affect the people working for the local authorities as it affected the civil servants and, with the help of the seven Labour members and Fine Gael members, the manager's order was defeated.</P>

Cork Mental Hospital Committee decided two months ago to give a recommendation to the county manager to discuss the dispute on a national basis with the trade unions of the country. Deputy Larkin was representing one trade union and he knows that a national agreement was reached.  I said the committee recommended the manager to deal with it on a national basis but what happened at the meeting yesterday in Cork?

    <P>It seems to me, judging by some of the speeches made here, that we are to have compulsory tillage.  Deputy Kyne said if the farmers would not till the ground a penalty should be put on them.  Deputy Larkin spoke in much the same strain.  But nobody tells them what they can produce to sell at an economic price.  I listened to three city men in the Chamber of Commerce in Cork&mdash;they included the Taoiseach&mdash; and they all told the farmers to produce more but the devil a bit any of them were producing themselves.  When we had a glut of potatoes and oats here a couple of years ago they had to send the present Minister for Agriculture <Col N="952" /> to America in order to let Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They did take 5d. off the butter, but in the 1953 Budget Deputy MacEntee made it clear that things were improved.  He gave a reduction in the price of bread and increased allowances because the country was improving, and he continued to give about £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 for flour and bread subsidies.  But what happened?  When the inter-Party Government got back again, they did take the 5d. off the butter.  The Minister for Finance at that time said that would be all for that year until the 31st March but that other things would be done after that.  Before the election we had wailing and gnashing of teeth about the old age pensioner's smoke of tobacco, about the little drop of <Col N="953" /> whiskey and the pinch of snuff, and about the hair shirt that Deputy MacEntee put on the people and it was said he had done it deliberately.</P>
      <P>Why was it not open to the Coalition Government, by deliberate action, to undo all the things Deputy MacEntee had done?  Because they knew Deputy MacEntee was quite correct.  They knew he had to take these measures to clear up the mess they had made during their first period of office.  We are heading the same way to-day.  During their first period of office the Coalition Minister for Agriculture said his difficulty was how to spend the money.  He had to spend £5,000,000 in one afternoon and Deputy Seán Collins is well aware of that.</P>

      <P>There was nothing done to renew it.  Deputy Lemass and others referred to the prospects of getting coal in the coming year.  Are we to get a continuation of our coal agreement with Britain or what provision is being made to keep the industries depending on coal supplied in the coming 12 months?  Surely we should get a statement on these matters from the Government.  I did not intend to speak on this Bill at all until I heard Deputy McQuillan talk about the waste paper campaign and the situation which now confronts that industry.  I feel sure Deputy Casey and the other Cork Deputies were shocked when they saw in the Cork evening papers last night an advertisement headed &ldquo;Used Paper Drive Suspended&rdquo;.  We have in the papers a report which says that over the year £7,633 had been collected by voluntary effort in Cork for church purposes.  I feel sure Deputy Casey will agree there was never a better voluntary effort carried out anywhere.  The schools in Cork were vying with one another as to which would collect most. These voluntary workers also believed that by their efforts they were helping a new industry in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, I represented the Cork Corporation on a visit to the mill <Col N="954" /> in Waterford.  Various other local authorities were also represented.  We met a manager who appeared to be an intelligent, progressive man who was more than anxious that waste paper would be collected by local authorities. The representatives of Waterford, Limerick, Kilkenny and other local authorities were all interested in this collection of waste paper.  We were told by the factory at the time that they had to go as far as America to get waste paper to keep the factory going.  It certainly was a credit to the country.  At that time also, we got letters from Labour leaders in Dublin asking us to help in the drive. Naturally we were shocked when we saw the statement in the papers that the factory was flooded out with paper collected in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When we visited the factory in Waterford, there was a guaranteed price of something like £6 per ton. Depots were established in various towns and cities to facilitate collection. Deputy McQuillan now points out that 100,000 cwt. of foreign waste paper was imported last year.  He also mentioned a figure for this year up to the end of January.  I do not know how any Government, so supposedly anxious to balance exports with imports, should fail to see that a market was found for Irish waste paper and to ensure that no imports occurred. Besides the economic good that it did, this waste paper drive also had the effect of bringing a spirit of co-operation among the young people.  I, like Deputy McQuillan, would like to get a statement from the Minister on the position.  Perhaps there is a good reason for it, but it does seem strange that a factory which was appealing so strongly for Irish waste paper and which said it had to establish depots in Bristol and elsewhere abroad should suddenly become so crowded up with paper that they cannot take any more. There must be something wrong.  The people of Cork are anxious to know what is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives extraordinary powers to the Government to deal with any distortions which may arise from time to time in our economy.  Many people in recent <Col N="955" /> months have been giving their own particular diagnosis on the economic ills from which we are suffering and it does seem to me as if the situation in which we find ourselves is difficult, not because of the situation itself but because of some of the things the people have been saying about it.  The debate has centred, as far as it was possible to gather, around one aspect of our economy &mdash; the rise in wholesale and retail prices.  I want to refer to other aspects of the situation, a continuation of which would appear to give more grounds for concern at the present moment than do the increases in retail and wholesale prices, although they admittedly directly affect most people in the community.  But in addition there have been the estimated deficiency of about £35,000,000, the increase in the bank credit of £31.2 million and the decrease in bank deposits.  There was also a decline in the external assets of the banks by approximately £40,000,000.</P>
      <P>These features developed over the last year and they were superimposed on the existing chronic ailments from which our economy suffers, namely the high level of emigration, the low level of physical capital formation and, compared with other countries, the high level of unemployment.  In deciding how to deal with the present situation, this or any other Government must bear in mind all these factors.  It has been pointed out here in the House that the situation from which we are suffering to-day is very different from the inflationary situation from which England, Germany and other countries of Western Europe suffer.  That there has been an increase in monetary demand in this country over the past year cannot be denied and I do not think it can be denied that this increase has been excessive.  That is something from which most countries in Western Europe are suffering at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to appreciate how the demands generated by the increased supply of money became excessive.  It became excessive in two ways.  Firstly it became excessive where a country's economy was already <Col N="956" /> at full stretch, where there is full employment and where the physical resources are being fully utilised such as in England.  There you had superimposed on that situation an increased monetary demand which gave rise to the present situation in production and the balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>That is very different from our position and the position of some other Western European countries also.  Our demand became excessive because the excessive demand has not been matched by a similar increase in home production.  Unfortunately, that is what happened last year.  Industrial production here increased over the average of the last few years but the increase in agricultural and industrial production was not sufficient to meet the demands which is evidenced by an increase in our adverse trade balance of over £30,000,000 last year.  In England the great increase in monetary demand brought about boom conditions.  The increased demand here resulted, not in increased prices, but, because of the fact that our resources were not available to meet the increased demand, in a deficit in our balance of payments of rather large magnitude.</P>
    <P>I think it important that this should be borne in mind when we come to deal with the distortion in our economy which we are facing at the present time.  It has been said, probably inside, and certainly outside the House, that we were engaged last year in some sort of a spending spree. The facts and the figures do not warrant such a suggestion.  It is true that the volume of imports last year increased by 9 per cent. and the overall figures by £24,000,000.  But it is interesting to see how that increase was made up.  One of the most important things to remember is that the percentage of that total quantity of imports of consumer goods last year remained the same as the previous year.  Last year, of our total imports, 23 per cent. were in respect of consumer goods and in 1954 23 per cent. were also in respect of consumer goods.  There was a slight, a very slight increase, in our imports of consumer goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> The main increase in the £24,000,000 of our imports last year was made up in Class 2 which comprised food, drink and tobacco.  These items were £8.5 million up last year.  Again it is important to appreciate that we were eating more food and smoking more tobacco than during the year before. I think it is demonstrable that there was an improvement in the standard of living last year but the large increase under this one class of goods was not because we consumed so much more but mainly because of two factors &mdash;a drop in the national production of wheat and maize and an increase in prices.</P>
    <P>The other important and big increase in imports last year was under Class 3 &mdash; raw materials and manufactured goods.  There was an increase of over £15,000,000 under that heading. Again it is important to bear in mind that there is a large price factor to be taken into account.  Import prices increased throughout the year and, secondly, there was a large amount of restocking taking place last year. Thirdly, the increases were brought about because of increased industrial production last year which went up considerably.</P>
    <P>I think the production figures for last year, the employment figures for last year which reached an all-time high record, and the unemployment figures which reached an all-time low record, have to be taken into account when we decide how we are going to face the difficulties from which we are suffering.  I think it is important that we should realise that we did have a high standard of living last year and we paid for that high standard of living by importing more.  If we want to maintain last year's standard of living and improve it, it is demonstrable now to everybody that the only way that can be done is by producing more, particularly for export, and that means agriculture.</P>
    <P>Therefore it seems to me to be very important, when these facts are borne in mind, that any steps which this Government, or any Government, should take, should not impinge on our ability to produce more.  It is worth quoting to the House a phrase <Col N="958" /> used in the last Report of the O.E.E.C. on page 14, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Public policy must steer a course which would restrict excessive demand without impairing business confidence in continued expansion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me important to appreciate that here in this country we are different from England or Germany, in that these countries have full use of their physical resources.  We have nothing like that.  We need to expand more, give more employment and have more capital investment.  We must achieve that and at the same time we must see that our balance of payments does not go awry.  It seems to me that the steps which this Government have taken to meet the problem have been appropriate in the present circumstances. The Government has clearly indicated that, if they are not sufficient, they will be forced to take more severe measures.  I am confident that what the Government has done will be sufficient to meet the situation without bringing about a contraction in our economy which was the effect of putting another policy into operation in 1952.  We must appreciate that a contraction in our economy would mean a contraction in production and employment.</P>
    <P>We have also got to avoid any excessive deficits in our balance of payments. I am not a bit afraid of deficits in our balance of payments when those deficits are equated to increased domestic physical capital formation.  I believe the steps taken by the Government are correct, because they do not appear to me to damp down production or contract new economy as a whole, in the manner in which it was contracted when the last Government endeavoured to meet a balance of payments position in 1952.</P>
    <P>I think the lessons learned from these last few years are now very obvious to everybody.  I hope that the steps taken by the Government in its endeavour to increase agricultural production will bear fruit in the near future.  The reason that the steps taken by the Government will, in all probability, be sufficient is because already in the February figures, although exports have not increased to the same <Col N="959" /> extent as last year, the great excess of imports seems to have begun to decline. It does appear that the great demand for imports, which was a feature of last year's trading position, has already begun to decline.  The outlook for exports is fairly healthy.  We have a record amount of cattle at the moment and the recent increases in England should indeed help our export position.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two suggestions, which may meet with approval, in relation to our endeavour to increase agricultural production.  Our farming community is subsidised in many ways. It is subsidised with regard to the payment of rates, with regard to the building programme and with regard to land reclamation.  I think money would be well spent in subsidising credit to farmers. We spend many millions every year trying to assist agricultural production; if we were to lower interest rates to farmers by subsidies from the Central Fund I am sure that would have the effect of increasing production. It is very necessary to help farmers to produce more by incentives of a practical character.  I would like the Minister to bear in mind the suggestion that, where it can be proved that over a period of 12 months a farmer has on his land more stock, tilled more or demonstrated in some practicable way that he has increased the wealth of his farm, he should get a remission of rates.  There may be practical administrative difficulties in following out such a suggestion, but it seems to me that what is wanted at the present time are incentives for farmers to produce more, incentives of a practical character.</P>

      <P>Truth to tell, I do not care whether it comes from the Central Fund or local funds.  It is so vital that farmers should increase production that I think they should get some sort of incentive to do so.  A remission of rates, if it can be administered, where production has been increased over a 12-month period might be worthy of some consideration.</P>

      <P>Apparently I am wrong.  I think it is of importance, and the agreement in the House is patently obvious on the necessity to increase more, that we should take practical steps to bring about increased production.  Concrete proposals as to how that increased production can be achieved will be welcomed from the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate so far and the debate on the Vote on Account have been singularly barren of any concrete suggestion as to how we should deal with our present problem.  It is of little use Deputies coming in here and saying they are in favour of increased production. Increased production is something with which we all agree, and even the differences in the House as between one Party and another are a means to that end.  I am hopeful that the situation which has developed over the past year will be remedied by the action taken by the Government because I think that our external resources, while they need to be watched, are sufficient to bear some <Col N="961" /> deficits in the balance of payments when those deficits are matched by increased capital formation at home.  The important thing is to maintain and increase employment, increase the wealth of the community by more capital investment in industry and land.  That can be done only by an extension of the savings campaign the Government has undertaken and, if necessary, by a deficit in our balance of payments.  For these reasons, I think the House and the country should welcome the steps that have been taken by the Government, steps which will not impede the proper development of the country along productive lines and which will ensure that the trend which developed over the last year will not grow to the dimensions of a real crisis.</P>

      <P>I am sure that if the Party on this side of the House had been still in office and had introduced this measure once more they would have met with at least severe criticism. I am not in a position to say whether our opponents would have declared their intention to vote against the measure but, knowing the distaste that legal luminaries have for the exercise of powers conferred in emergency periods and the use of emergency legislation in normal times, I am quite sure that if the rôles were reversed, the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General and all the other legal members of the Parties opposite would question very strongly whether the powers and the purposes of the Supplies and Services Bill could not adequately be achieved under normal legislation.  I have no doubt, too, that they would have blamed the Government for being too lazy, too idle and too complacent to produce the necessary legislation in substitution for this supplies and services measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy J. Larkin suggested that if we had not got this measure we could not deal with the prices situation. Leaving aside for the moment the naïve belief of Deputy Larkin that this problem of prices could be dealt with by legislation and by administrative processes to his satisfaction, may I remind him that the Orders which we were discussing a few days ago in relation to import levies were imposed <Col N="962" /> under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932?  Of course, as regards hire purchase and such other matters, I presume they could be dealt with in the Budget in the ordinary way; and, if the Budget were not considered a suitable medium, I am sure the ingenuity and inspiration of the Parliamentary Draftsman's office is not likely to run dry in endeavouring to facilitate the Government in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the question of prices I would like to support the plea that has been made by Deputy Lemass that the House should receive more information from the Tánaiste regarding the programme of the E.S.B.  I am not interested in the programme as a debating point or a technical question from year to year.  I am interested in it from the point of view of knowing what our situation in regard to power will be in, say, five years' time.  If I remember correctly, a leading Dublin scientist said recently in the course of a discussion on nuclear power that the capacity of our electricity organisation would be fully extended in five years' time; we would come to a halt &mdash; I took that to be the meaning of his words.</P>
    <P>Surely if we are examining our economic position in any earnest way and if we are examining our import and export lists from the point of view of increasing our exports and reducing imports to what are necessary, we ought equally to pay special attention to the question of our power and fuel resources.  There should be a special branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce, if there is not such in existence, which would deal with that particular matter, as in the cases of other technical questions.  As was rightly pointed out by Deputy Larkin, Ministers may be overburdened with departmental work and day-to-day decisions of a rather petty character but which, nevertheless, are important from many points of view.  The Minister, therefore, could surely call in research specialists or power experts to advise him in regard to this very important matter.  Perhaps the E.S.B. has this information, but in its annual report we only get information of its <Col N="963" /> work for the year, and some suggestions as to what it intends to do in the future.  But the whole problem of the power resources of the State and the position which may face us in five or ten years' time has not been given proper attention or proper investigation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry seemed to suggest that if the Mincing Lane monopoly were allowed to function freely we might be better off in regard to our tea supplies.  I cannot say that was precisely his argument on this occasion but on other occasions it was, and although I have no doubt that the Deputy is an expert in this matter of tea, his prophecy in this connection may be like the prophecy of others who suggested that the Government was very wise to subsidise the price of tea for a period, although they took very good care not to raise the money from taxation; they borrowed it for that purpose which was a rather unheard of procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry ought to recollect that India was not in the tea market immediately after the war.  As far as I know, it took a period before the Indian organisation was set up. Deputy Lemass, having had experience of the English attitude to our consumers, when they as far as I know&mdash; I do not know whether he is at liberty to state it or not but I am going to state it &mdash; broke their promise that they would give us a sufficient supply of tea to enable us to maintain a ration equivalent to the ration they were giving their own people, decided that when the opportunity offered so far as he was concerned, if he had authority in the matter, he would endeavour to alter that state of affairs.  I see no reason why we ought not be able to get as good terms, even though there may be certain advantages from the traders' point of view in the Mincing Lane connection, by direct dealing with the producers in India or Ceylon, thus achieving at least as good results from the point of view of the consumers here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney has departed from the line of his Party and I am rather surprised in view of the adjurations <Col N="964" /> and supplications of the Minister for Finance that people should restrain their demands and that increases in money incomes are very bad for our economy at the present time unless matched, of course, by an improvement in production and in productivity. Deputy Rooney has treated us again to the advice that since wage levels have increased, presumably we ought not to bother about prices.  We must consider the question so far as the consumer is concerned; he apparently does not exist in Deputy Rooney's imagination.  The point is that those persons who are sufficiently well organised either industrially or in the State services or otherwise, can have their wage levels adjusted, according to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There should be a fair balance, he said, between prices and wages.  What is this fair balance?  We have the Minister for Finance telling us that we ought to restrain ourselves, that is, those of us who are in a position to enforce our demands or at least to try to enforce them upon the rest of the community.  What is a fair balance? Would the Deputy not think that the balance should be not alone between prices and wages but that it should be a balance between all sections of the community equally and that one section ought not, as the saying has it, to endeavour to get more out of the national cake than it is entitled to.  If it does that it will prevent some other section presumably, that is, the poorest, most badly organised and perhaps worst off section from getting its share.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have this fair balance let it be fair to all sections of the community.  Surely that is a fundamental provision in our Constitution, that we must aim at the general interest and welfare of the community as a whole.  The more we depart from that principle the harder we are hitting at the principle of real democracy and the more damage, in my view, we are going to do this country not alone economically, but spiritually.</P>
    <P>We can hardly blame Deputy Rooney, in view of the statements by the Minister for Finance.  On the one hand, he is advising the community <Col N="965" /> that they should refrain from making these demands.  Presumably these remarks are addressed in particular to those who are in an organised position, able to try to force their demands and to get what they are looking for from the rest of the community.  But, when I asked him what was the explanation of the increase in remuneration for the public services, what was the basis of the agreement, he said he had regard to the general circumstances.  Later on he said &mdash; I have not his exact words by me but I think I am giving fairly the gist of it &mdash; that he was having regard to what other sections of the community have got.  So that, instead of basing the remuneration or incomes of persons or interests or categories or sections of the community on their productive capacity, or productivity, this fair balance that Deputy Rooney has spoken of has been altered and a new basis is adopted which is, &ldquo;if the other fellow gets it, I must get it also&rdquo;.  Of course, one cannot continue very long on that particular line without &ldquo;coming a cropper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin accused this Party of speaking with different voices.  I could remind the Deputy that the unanimity in the Government at the present time, when the Tánaiste has come forward very strongly in support of what I might call the Central Bank policy, has come as a surprise, rather a pleasant surprise indeed, because it is not so long ago that prominent members on the other side were preaching the doctrine which I was surprised to hear Deputy Rooney give utterance to here to-day: &ldquo;Go ahead; it is all right; you will get your compensation; if prices go up, what does it matter; you will get increased emoluments, increased remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin has admitted that prices are affected by wage increases, depending, of course, on the particular case, but we know that a wage increase sets in motion other increases.  When the Gas Company or C.I.E. or some other such organisation providing a public utility or service gives increased wages to its employees more than the increase in wages is passed on and has to be paid for by an increase in the cost of gas or of bus fares or whatever else it may be.</P>

      <Col N="966" /> The Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A further increase in money incomes, not matched by an improvement in production and in productivity, could only at this juncture drive up domestic prices by causing an internal inflation, or increase still further the volume of our imports for consumption purposes or perhaps effect a mixture of both.  These are consequences that the nation cannot afford in present circumstances, and imports must be checked until we can earn more by selling additional exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The expansion of our exports,&rdquo; adds the Minister, &ldquo;requires that costs of production be kept from rising.&rdquo;  He goes on then to state that it is his &ldquo;earnest hope that &mdash; at least until we have surmounted our present difficulties&mdash;there will be stability in money incomes.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Pages 11 and 12 of the script of the Minister's statement on the Vote on Account.  I do not know the column in which it appears in the Official Report.  Some time ago, the Minister, although he was more circumspect on this occasion than on a previous occasion, stated at the Galway Chamber of Commerce, as reported in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that further increases in money incomes could only result in driving prices higher and making our trade deficit worse unless they are backed up by at least a commensurate increase in output per head.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the copy of the Swedish Newsletter for the end of last year there is a paragraph under the heading, &ldquo;Swedish Wages Agreement&rdquo;, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A wage truce has been reached between Swedish employers and employees after nine weeks of negotiations, it has been announced recently. It aims at curbing inflation by a uniform wage increase for all organised workers and limiting it <Col N="967" /> to the amount by which the value of production is expected to increase this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The acceptance of the principle that, because some section or category has obtained an increase, another section must get similar, or perhaps even higher, increases because of better bargaining power, does not tally with the ideas of our Scandinavian friends who have always emphasised that there can be no increase in income in real terms unless production and productivity are increased proportionately.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin stated that the Fianna Fáil policy, presumably &mdash; that is the meaning I took from his remarks&mdash;was one of inflation.  The Deputy does not seem to be aware that, like our neighbours and to a large extent caused by the inflationary situation in their country during the war, we have been living in a continually inflationary situation since the war period.  If there was deflation, it might be what Sir Stafford Cripps would have called &ldquo;disinflation&rdquo; but there was nothing in the way of deflation in these years.  Our troubles have arisen from the fact that there has been inflation of one kind or another as is evidenced by the continuing fall in the value of the currency and the threats to the pound sterling which are still so evident. I think that perhaps there is too much emphasis on the necessity for increasing the standard of living without having concomitant emphasis on the efforts that are necessary.  Not sufficient emphasis is placed on the effort, the restraint and the discipline which are necessary in order to enable us to secure that result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin wanted to know if we increased production in the industrial sphere were the workers going to get the benefit?  At a later stage he seemed to admit that there might be another class in the community as well as the workers and the employers, that is to say, the consumers, who would be interested in this very important matter.  One of the extraordinary things in all this talk about production and the tremendous increase in output <Col N="968" /> that has been obtained in other countries under mass production and mechanised methods and the enormous improvement in productive processes is that in this country, by contrast, the consumer is left rather at the end of the queue.  He has to take what the employers and the workers leave when they have had their share&mdash; whether or not they agree about their respective shares.  Whatever is left goes to the consumers.  One would imagine that with an increase in production&mdash;if it has any meaning at all &mdash;the consuming public should benefit, so that some of the fruits of increased productivity would go to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Larkin expects that legislation and administrative methods under an organisation like the Prices Advisory Council are going to stabilise prices, he does not seem to have given attention to the fact that raw materials have to be imported and then prices often increase.  He has not given sufficient attention to the fact that the prices of agricultural produce in many instances have gone up in the world market, but at any rate, all Parties in the House are agreed that our farming community should, as far as possible, get guaranteed prices and a guaranteed market for their output.  Moreover, he has not put into the picture the distributive costs to which I have referred.  In a modern community, where you have fewer and fewer people in primary production and more and more in distribution, it stands to reason that distributive costs, unless there is a very strong element of competition, will go up unduly high and the consumer will have to pay for that and the stability in prices which Deputy Larkin seeks will be upset.</P>
    <P>It has been found in the neighbouring country that one cannot carry on even nationalised industries without capital.  An accumulation of capital is necessary for production to increase and also for an increased or improved standard of living and if we are not prepared by persuasion, by acquainting ourselves with the basic facts in this matter and making the necessary effort, abstaining, and carrying into effect a policy of thrift; if we do not <Col N="969" /> do that in a democratic country and if we do not build up our capital reserves, then it simply means that we will have these recurring crises.  Even from today's newspapers we know there are people very anxious to take advantage of these crises in democratic countries and to pave the way for some form of authoritarianism.</P>
    <P>If we do not do what is necessary in the interests of the community in a spirit of goodwill and participation in the general effort, then, inevitably, and ultimately, we are going to call into being some authority that will enforce its decrees by force.  The suggestion has been made elsewhere that an effort should be made, if increased wages and increased remuneration are being paid out, to try to siphon some of that money off with, of course, the co-operation and the goodwill of those who are in receipt of those increases, into a saving pool, and in that way, those who are in receipt of money incomes would see that a certain proportion of the income would go towards the national saving pool.  In the same way as the prudent householder or the prudent wage-earner will set aside a certain amount for the rainy day so as to meet his personal capital requirements and those of his family, we should also be able to put aside a certain further proportion of our income and invest it in Irish projects.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Larkin was speaking, I was reminded very forcibly of the fact that we constantly read of the trade union representatives on the production councils in Great Britain taking a very prominent part in plans and discussions and giving advice about helping their country out of its economic difficulties.  I think that they do not look at the problems that present themselves to them solely as trade union leaders and from the standpoint only of the benefit to their own class although of course that must receive their primary consideration.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear from Deputy Larkin that the workers of the country, so far as he knows, are prepared to co-operate and to work with whatever plans the Government or the authorities of the time may have for increasing <Col N="970" /> production.  I am sure that is true in industry and wherever men are employed, and it is only right and proper that steps should be taken by the public authorities and the industrial managements to enable the workers to see the advantage to themselves, looking at it from the selfish point of view, of increasing their own productivity and that of the industry in which they are engaged, and to enable them to see that they are building up a reserve for themselves in the shape of continuing employment, and building up the country also, and helping to right the present economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made by Deputy Costello that proposals have not been made as to ways in which the present situation might be improved.  I think that there should be an examination of our position from the point of view of our raw materials generally in the same way as I have suggested with regard to our power and fuel resources.</P>
    <P>I think also that in industry more should be done to bring before the public what has been achieved in our Irish industries.  We will have an industrial exhibition shortly and I am surprised we have not had one long ago.  I hope we will have more of them here, not alone to exhibit the product of our industries but to acquaint our people with the working of particular industries.  Leaders in other walks of life such as university men, teachers, and technical school students, should be given the opportunity of seeing what is being done in our industries because I believe very strongly that no matter what system of technical education you have &mdash; and I think we ought to spend a great deal more on it&mdash;in the long run, even when he has done his course in the technical school or college, the young person will have to learn in the factory.  It is in the workshop or factory where he serves his apprenticeship or preliminary years that the young person will learn the necessary skills in his trade or craft.</P>
    <P>Certainly the unions can do a great deal in the way of dissemination of information among their members, particularly among apprentices and <Col N="971" /> new entrants to industrial employment. Union members should do everything to acquaint themselves with new processes and do everything they can to make Irish industrial enterprises such that they can compare favourably, having regard to our conditions, with those in other countries.</P>
    <P>Of course I cannot let the opportunity pass without reminding Deputy Larkin that when he refers to money being &ldquo;poured&rdquo; into agriculture that money is being poured out in many other directions at the present time. We cannot apply holus-bolus these criteria of industrial mechanisation to our small farming economy in this State.  I think we are rather too apt to look at Irish agriculture through American spectacles and some of the experts who have come in here have not had sufficient knowledge or experience to understand that our conditions are entirely different.  They, with their enormous market and their potential, can talk in very big terms but, in regard to Irish agriculture, one point in the farmer's favour is that he provides the capital for his industry. He provides the capital himself and whatever return he may get by way of price for his product we have to make allowance in that price for a reasonable return on the capital he has invested in his live stock, farm and equipment.</P>
    <P>I think it is valuable to our community that we have the social conditions we have in Irish agriculture. Though 80 per cent. of our farms might be described in other countries as very small, splendid families, which it would do your heart good to look at, have come out of them.  Splendid families have been raised on these smallholdings of a few pounds' valuation and have gone all over the world to do honour to this country.  I have always had the feeling that, as far as possible, assistance to agriculture or to industry should be followed by increased production or productivity from the factory or the land but we have to bear in mind that the farmer is not able to give up his business in the same way as the industrialist.  The farmer cannot go into some new venture <Col N="972" /> if times change and if things are not going well.  He must contend with the climate and with price fluctuations which come very rapidly and which can be very sudden and very devastating because change comes very rapidly at the present time.  Accordingly, we have to make allowances for these and other aspects of our agriculture when we are determining what policy the State should adopt in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Agriculture has taken due note of the present price of feeding stuffs in the price he will guarantee to the pig producers of this State.  I do not agree with Deputy Declan Costello when he says the increase in imports of consumer goods was comparatively small and should not have affected the situation.  I do not know whether he is trying to take the bottom out of the case of the Minister for Finance, because if the increase in imports of consumer goods is as insignificant as the Deputy would suggest &mdash; insignificant was not the word he used but he suggested it was not significant &mdash; then what is the reason for the import levies and the steps which the Government are now taking?  I think perhaps that a point which the Deputy has overlooked is that to the extent that people are spending in other directions, in amusements and so on, and that they feel these are necessary for their standard or way of life, if they are putting aside a certain amount of their budget for that purpose, they are more disinclined to make proper provision for the actual necessities of the budget.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Great Britain a new cost-of-living index, with some hundreds of items, is now being constituted. The question is, what are the items which should go into our cost-of-living index.  We have been expanding it gradually, but if we look at the ordinary farmer or agricultural worker down the country, at his way of life and at the amusements he has and calculate an index on that basis, I think he will find that a very great number of items which might be included by urban or city people could be left aside.  We have departed a great deal from essential things like food, clothing and shelter and we are putting non-essential elements into our <Col N="973" /> cost-of-living calculations.  To the extent, then, that people are spending on amusements or on unnecessary consumer goods, which are often being imported, they must impinge on savings and, in fact, money that is being spent unnecessarily &mdash; no matter in what direction &mdash; obviously is going contrary to the general national aim of trying to increase national savings and national capital investment.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to go into further detail but I could say that, when Deputy Costello congratulated the Government and those associated with them on a reduction in unemployment figures, he should have been aware that the emigration figures have done much to keep unemployment figures down. It is very noticeable that emigration was mentioned only from this side of the House.  As far as I am aware, not even lip service was given from the Government side to the urgent necessity for taking steps to try and keep some of the many thousands of our young people particularly our young girls from having to emigrate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one note running through some of the speeches from the Government side of the house to-day and yesterday.  It is a note which should sound a warning to Government Deputies.  It is the warning of the fact that millions are being poured into Irish agriculture. Yesterday, during his contribution to the debate on the Vote on Account, the Minister for Industry and Commerce specifically referred to the millions that were going into Irish agriculture. He also bemoaned and bewailed the fact that Irish agriculture did not increase in production or give any return for those millions.  Deputy Larkin referred to the same thing to-night and Deputy Costello, when speaking some time ago during this debate, said that what the Government should do, instead of giving subsidies and grants to the farmers, was to dangle a carrot in front of the donkey. Those were his words.  He said that that should be done in order to entice the farmers to produce more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, a threat was being held over the farmers that the subsidy was there, that the grants were there, <Col N="974" /> and that the Government was willing to give them, but, unless the farming community produced the goods first, there was nothing doing.  That is a dangerous theory.  We know that the main trouble in this country to-day is lack of capital and lack of money and that until such time as the farmer can get enough money to develop his industry, to apply ground limestone to his land, to buy machinery, to buy one more cow and one more sow &mdash; until that time is reached we cannot expect more production.  It is, as I interjected during Deputy Costello's speech, putting the cart before the horse to say:&mdash;&ldquo;Produce the goods and we will give you the bounties and the subsidies and the grants&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would not mind if that statement were made by one individual on the Government Benches but it has been repeated three times during yesterday evening and this afternoon.  It should be a warning to us, but from this side of the house we are warning the Government that any policy such as that will be seriously and strongly opposed by this side of the House.  We know, as the Government should know, that Irish agriculture is starved of investment and that we cannot expect the small farmers of this country to produce more unless we come to their assistance and help them to do that.  It is the Government's duty to do that and to see to it that the farmers have the tools and the means of putting into the economy of this State a higher and more efficient production than heretofore. You will not do it by dangling the carrot before the donkey.</P>
    <P>There is another fallacy propounded from the Government Benches this evening which I mean to nail.  Deputy Rooney, when speaking to-night, said that Fianna Fáil wanted lower prices in order to be able to reduce wages. Deputy Rooney said also that wages would have to be reduced.  He said that if you had a reduction of prices automatically there was a reduction in wages.  Of course that is not so. We can have the present level of wages if we have more production.  If there is a greater volume of production, we can hold the present level of wages and also reduce prices.  That is agreed on by most people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Why Deputy Rooney should propagate such a theory to-night I do not know, except that he might be trying to force us into the position where it might be said that we wanted to lower wages.  He said that workers have got increased wages and that, therefore, they can pay increased prices for their purchases.  He said that business people are getting more money and that therefore they can get more for what they require.  Producers, he said, were able to guard themselves against the increases in the cost of living that have taken place over the last two years.</P>
    <P>Let us examine that and see how true it is.  It is true that workers were able to cushion themselves against the impact of the increase in the cost of living.  But is it true that business people were able to do likewise?  Of course it is not.  Every businessman in the country knows that his business is suffering over the last two years. Every businessman knows that the volume of his trade and the margin of his profit has gone down.  Is it true to say that producers are able to cushion themselves against the impact of the increased cost of living?  Take the farmers who are the largest section of producers in this country.  Have they been able to get something extra which would go towards meeting the increase in the cost of living?  They have not.  We know that over the last two years the farmers' incomes have gone down.  We know that their income from wheat has gone down.  We know that cattle prices have dropped over the last six months.  We know that the flax industry has declined and that other aspects of farming have also declined.</P>
    <P>We know that other aspects of farming have also deteriorated.  It is not true to say that the farmers, who are our main producers, have been able to protect themselves against the draught of increased prices of the commodities which they have to purchase every day in the week.  The measures which the Minister took last week to cut down the difference as between our exports and our imports will reduce the figure on imports by about £7,000,000.  Deputy <Col N="976" /> D. Costello said that he thought, and the Government thought, that these measures would be sufficient but that, if further measures were necessary, they would be taken.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position for a moment.  We have a deficit of £94,000,000 in our balance of payments. Even if there is a decrease of £7,000,000 in that figure, will it create the effect that the Government expect it to create?  Will a reduction of £7,000,000 cure the ills mentioned by the Minister in his statement?  Will it remedy the ills?  I do not think it will, but I agree it would be a bad thing to go any further in that direction at the moment.  We know that these steps will create some unemployment.  We know that the tightening-up on hire purchase will cause less to be sold and must, therefore, cause unemployment in some of our industries at home.  For that reason I think the Government are wise not to go any further along that line.  But there are other lines along which the Government could fruitfully move.  Will they do so?  Will they take any steps to reduce the figure of £11,000,000 for grain imports? That is something for the Government to decide.  That would cause a further reduction in our balance of payments, but will the Government take any steps along that particular line?  Will they try to find out whether there are any other lines along which they could move in order to redress our balance of payments position?</P>
    <P>One of the best ways, of course, would be by increasing our exports. We listened to a lengthy speech last Thursday from the Minister but we did not hear of any steps being taken to increase exports.  If the policy of Deputy D. Costello is followed and if the advice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is followed to hold the carrot before the farmers and give them nothing until they produce more, I do not think we will get any increase as far as our exports are concerned.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked for the full cooperation of the House towards finding a solution of our problems.  Judging by the tone of the debate on this side of the House yesterday, we can see that <Col N="977" /> we are more or less in agreement on the main principles and the action taken by the Government.  We know that the steps taken by the Minister for Finance, the introduction of the proposals which were sanctioned here yesterday, are really in the nature of a Budget.  We know the Minister may call these import levies.  He can call them what he likes.  We know this is a purchase tax.  The Minister called it an import tax.  Other Deputies on the Government Benches call it something else.  It is a purchase tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with that statement.  That statement is taken from Volume 130, column 1113 of the Official Report.  It is the opening sentence of the Minister's speech on the 1952 Budget.  I think it would have been a very appropriate introduction to the statement made by the present Minister for Finance on Thursday last. The Budget that year was framed to restore order in the public finances.  In 1952 there was a deficit of £62,000,000, plus other ills inherited from the Coalition Government in 1951.  I shall not enumerate them, but they were there.  One of them was a deficit of £62,000,000 in the balance of payments. The Minister for Finance in that year introduced an early Budget, but not as early as the first instalment of this Budget.  It was about a month earlier. What was the first charge levied against him?  It was said that he introduced an early Budget because he had been told to do so by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Butler.  Are we levelling that charge across the House now?  Are we saying that this first instalment is introduced in March because of some influence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer?  We are not, because it is not true, and neither was it true then.</P>

      <P>But I am sure Deputies opposite will continue to repeat that all the same.  And, then, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce ask for co-operation from this side of the House. They are getting it.  The remedies taken by the present Government have yet to be proved effective.  We do not know, neither does the Government know, whether the remedies they have <Col N="979" /> taken, or any other remedies which they propose to take, will have the effect of bringing down the deficit in the balance of payments.  But the remedies that Deputy MacEntee used between 1952 and 1954, when the Coalition took office after the election, had the effect of reducing our balance of payments deficit from £65,000,000 to £6,000,000.  When the Government over there climbed up those steps they were left with a deficit of £6,000,000 in the balance of payments.</P>

      <P>While over there we certainly did not get any co-operation when remedies were taken which were effective to deal with a similar problem and other ills as well.  We are asked now for more production and for more saving.  The Government knows, and I am sure the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce know, that we cannot get more saving unless we create a climate which will help saving.  It is up to the Government to take steps which will help our people to save and, so far, I must say that very many of the actions taken by the Government will not create a climate where savings will thrive.</P>
      <P>The Government has shown in the Book of Estimates that expenditure during the coming year will be, I think, £4,750,000 in excess of last year's expenditure, which was a record.  Until the Government itself and every other body in the country like local authorities, set a headline and create an atmosphere suitable for savings we will not progress in that direction; we cannot expect people to economise or to be thrifty, while at the head there is the bad example set by the Government, Government Departments and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one important matter and that is the question of fuel.  It should <Col N="980" /> receive very serious attention by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We can expect in the years ahead that we will have a fuel problem of the first magnitude.  We know that the price of imported coal is rocketing year after year and that the quality of that coal is decreasing.  If there is any further expansion in either direction, that is, if the price further increases and the quality further deteriorates, we will have to cease imports of coal or at least cut them down very substantially, and then our problem crops up unless, in the meantime, we have taken some steps to be prepared against the development of such a situation.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that local authorities throughout the country, the different county councils, should be provided with incentives which would enable them to develop roads leading into bogs, to improve existing roads and to build other new roads in the, so far, undeveloped bogs.  In that way, if there is a deterioration of the imported fuel situation we will at least have that amount of work done to meet a crisis or a threatened crisis in fuel.</P>
    <P>I notice from to-day's newspapers that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken action in regard to the price of one commodity, the import of which was the subject of a penal duty during the week, and that is, gramophone records.  Is the Minister satisfied that gramophone records represent the only article, of the many which on Thursday last were subject to purchase tax, in respect of which there is price exploitation?  I think that one is of such small account that the Minister should not have bothered.  It is quite possible if he looked further afield he would find more important articles in that list of 68 to deal with in the way he has dealt with gramophone records.</P>
    <P>The question of emigration and unemployment has been discussed on all the Supplies and Services Bills for a number of years past.  These twin evils are to-day as great and as much in need of solution as ever.  Superimposed on them, this year, and as far as most of us can see, for years to come, is a re-flow to this country of emigrants who are finding themselves <Col N="981" /> unemployed, especially in English factories. A feature of the economy of Britain in the last six months is that in the factories, in the Midlands, in Birmingham and such towns, there is growing unemployment and many Irish people who emigrated now find themselves on the unemployed list there. There will be an inflow of such persons while the position there deteriorates as it seems to us to be deteriorating.  The Government must take steps to do something about those figures of unemployment and emigration.  Despite the lamentations that millions are being poured into agriculture, we feel that the position can only be remedied by pouring more into the primary industry, agriculture.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Cunningham is going at this stage.  Deputy Cunningham expressed certain fears with regard to the agricultural community.  I want to say that although I am a city Deputy, I am proud to belong to a Party that has always recognised the primary importance of the agricultural industry in this country, and recognised what I believe to be a simple truth, namely, that the farming industry is the keystone to any degree of prosperity which we may enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham may have forgotten some of the views expressed by one-time Fianna Fáil Deputies with regard to the farmers.  If he would refresh his mind by looking up the Dáil Debates, Volume 129, column 2335, he would find that a prominent Fianna <Col N="982" /> Fáil Deputy who is no longer in this House, had this to say with regard to the farmers:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It should be instilled into the farming community that they hold the land in trust for the people and it is their duty to increase the productivity of their land to the maximum of which it is capable....  The farmers must be given to understand that unless they are prepared to take on the responsibility of developing their holdings to their maximum, the Government will have to take control and reallocate the land to those who are prepared to make the best use of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of Deputy Cunningham's one-time colleagues. Deputy Cunningham gave a scrap of Deputy MacEntee's speech in introducing the 1952 Budget.  I am surprised that, when he was on the topic of the farming community and the reliefs and benefits that are given to them, it did not occur to him to quote another famous sentence from that famous speech of Deputy MacEntee, when he said, according to column 1185, Volume 138 of the Dáil Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Taxation presses lightly on the land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Cunningham's leader in finance with regard to the position of the farmers.  On 24th November, 1953, when he was speaking to the Dublin Society of Chartered Accountants, Deputy Lemass gave tongue with regard to the benefits and so on that the farmers were getting:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Farmers in Ireland were relying upon Government action and upon political agitation to secure it.  Not merely have they agitated to get Government help but they had done so with remarkable success.  They had grants for various things, and a guaranteed price for certain crops and so long as the farmer continued to be successful in his political agitation he was not likely to be attracted by the idea of having to do things for himself.  If the idea of promoting <Col N="983" /> co-operation was to develop, he thought, they must, if they were to make it succeed, contemplate some withdrawal of State aid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are three quotations from colleagues of Deputy Cunningham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that they would have to hold a carrot in front of them and get them to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that he would take away the carrot altogether.  I think we can excuse Deputy Cunningham before we quote Deputy Smith's idea as to how the farmer should be treated.  I am sure Deputy Blaney and Deputy Corry will remember that Deputy Smith was at one time Minister for Agriculture.  He spoke in this House &mdash; Volume 106, columns 2239 and 2240 &mdash; and this is what he had to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would have had inspectors tucked after them, and I would have tucked them out into fresh land, and I would compel them to break fresh land, and if they did not do it I would tuck in the tractors through the ditches and through the gates and tuck out the land for them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Lord Almighty provides us with good weather that will enable us to make a start, and if there should be any necessity next season to be as rigid as heretofore &mdash; and there may be &mdash; I am going to tell them here and now that I will recruit the full of ten fields of inspectors, and I will spend plenty of money in paying them travelling expenses and everything else, and I will hire all the tractors and machinery I can get and I will go down and pick every one of the &lsquo;cods&rsquo; out and I will say: &lsquo;Take down that piece of wire and put it around the other corner...&rsquo;</P>
      <P>When I do that, you can call me a thug or a clod or a driver, whatever you like, I do not care.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the Fianna Fáil mentality towards the farmers.</P>

      <P>But one cannot fail to be impressed by the mentality which Deputy Cunningham's leaders have displayed with regard to the agricultural community.  Deputy Corry is a brave man to sit it out.  I do not doubt his courage at all; it must have taken considerable courage for a stalwart farmer like Deputy Corry to remain in the Fianna Fáil Party all these years, despite the words which I have quoted falling from the lips of Fianna Fáil leaders with regard to the agricultural community.  Deputy Corry might not like to read these things, but I want to show him another exhibit which he will not have to read; it is nicely sketched out for him.  I am referring now to a pamphlet produced by Deputy Corry's Party on the occasion of the local election.  I do not know whether this was intended for consumption only in the City of Dublin or whether it was allowed to trickle down to the farming community.</P>

      <P>This was the demonstrated outlook of the Fianna Fáil Party with regard to the farming community and this question of prices for farmers.  At the back of this document there is a nicely sketched illustrated pamphlet which does not require to be read.  Just look at it, and read the first three words.  They are, &ldquo;Up, up, up&rdquo;.  The whole case was that prices were going up and up and up and that something should be done about it.  Fianna Fáil members <Col N="985" /> were crying their hearts out because prices were going up and up and up.</P>
      <P>What were the prices that were going up and up and up?  On the top left-hand corner we find &ldquo;beef and mutton.&rdquo;  Was that intended for the City of Dublin, or was it intended for Deputy Corry's constituency?  Beef and mutton were going up and up and up, and that was not the end of it.  On the top right-hand corner Fianna Fáil are complaining that cabbage, onions, carrots and potatoes are going up and up and up.  And if we turn to the bottom of this little illustrated sketch, we see that Fianna Fáil are complaining that the prices of boiling fowl are going up and up and up.</P>
      <P>This is the Party that is able to produce spokesmen such as Deputy Cunningham to warn the agricultural community against the threat being directed against them from the Government Benches.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party apparently had a sweet tooth also because they also complain that the prices of boiled sweets and chocolate bars are going up and up and up.</P>
      <P>They are not satisfied with that. Deputy Corry will find, if he looks at this little illustrated pamphlet, that the poor Fianna Fáil Deputies are also crying their hearts out because the bold, bad inter-Party Government had put up and up and up the price of interior-sprung mattresses.  These are the things that Fianna Fáil complains that have gone up and up and up in price. I do not know whether Deputy Corry intends to contribute to this discussion or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This debate has ranged over a rather wide field. Deputy Derrig complained that any references made to the question of emigration had come from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  I want to point out that, certainly in recent years, no Minister has done more or has been more active in endeavouring to deal with the problem of emigration than the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton.  I think it is due to him that someone should express the very sincere appreciation felt by the people of the extremely strenuous work which the Tánaiste undertook when he went to America in an effort to secure the investment of American capital in this country for the purpose of setting up industries which would absorb the unemployed here, as far as possible, and of his attempt to stem the flow of emigration. I do not know that it is entirely adequate, but it is certainly difficult to resist reminding Deputy Derrig and his colleagues that they had a period of about 20 years in which to do something about emigration instead of talking about it.  He seemed to pat himself on the back here this evening because whatever was said about emigration in this debate came from the Fianna Fáil Benches.  It is easy for them to talk now; they had every opportunity for a generation to do a little bit of acting instead of talking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in his first term of office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, endeavoured to tackle that problem in a very vigorous way. Certainly, speaking for myself &mdash; and I think I may claim to speak for my Party in this too &mdash; I want to express appreciation for the efforts he has made and to thank him for the hard work he has been doing in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham criticised Deputy Rooney's speech this evening on the grounds that Deputy Rooney had argued that a reduction in prices would mean a reduction in wages.  I do not know whether a reduction in prices would necessarily mean a reduction in wages; I do know that as wages have increased it would, I think, be impossible and quite unthinkable that any effort should be made to reduce wages.  The important thing <Col N="987" /> from the point of view of the purchasing public is whether or not they are put in a better position to purchase what they require than they were before the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I do think that prices are too high in a great number of cases.  I want to deny that anyone on these benches ever suggested that it would be possible to bring prices back to the 1951 level.  The members of the present Government and those supporting them during the last general election did not hesitate to point out that the prices then obtaining, in so far as most foodstuffs were concerned, were due to the deliberate and positive action of the Fianna Fáil Government, and it is because we used that, and used it successfully that Fianna Fáil resented the punishment which the people meted out to them in the last election.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach and the present Leader of the Opposition were invited by the <i>Irish Times,</i> prior to the general election, to answer a certain questionnaire which was presented to them.  One of the questions asked of them related to the cost of living and to the question of prices generally. Deputy John Costello, then Leader of the Opposition and now Taoiseach, made his attitude clear in regard to that questionnaire.  The particular questions to which I wish to refer were: &ldquo;If returned to Government, do you propose in the coming year to retain taxation as it is at present on beer, spirits, motoring and cigarettes?&rdquo; And: &ldquo;If returned to Government do you propose in the coming year to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The answer which the Taoiseach gave to those questions makes it quite clear what his policy was to be and what the policy of the present Government is in relation to those particular questions.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An object of our policy is to reduce the cost of living and to relieve the burden of prices by using all practical means of increasing the real value of people's money.  The extent to which and the rate at which revisions in subsidies combined <Col N="988" /> with readjustments in taxation are possible cannot be determined in advance by an Opposition. Responsible decisions on these two matters require, (1) access to all relevant facts concerning the condition of the Exchequer, (2) the ascertainment of the effect on the Exchequer of a fundamental reform of the financial policy.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat the action of our opponents in 1951, when they made specific promises which they subsequently broke.  They failed to keep their specific promises to maintain subsidies and not restore certain taxes.  I am prepared to make only one promise &mdash; to provide good government to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, very fairly, straightforwardly and honestly answered the queries put to him.  The Deputies opposite, who presumably take an interest in matters political, can hardly be unaware of the clear, unambiguous and specific nature of the answer which the Taoiseach gave to that questionnaire, and despite that, we have them getting up one after the other talking about promises to bring prices back to the 1951 level.  There were no such promises made.  It was stated it would be the policy of the Government &mdash;and it is the policy of this Government &mdash; to endeavour to reduce the cost of living and the burden of prices by raising the income or the purchasing power of the people.</P>
    <P>I started these remarks by referring to Deputy Cunningham's criticism of Deputy Rooney on the grounds that Deputy Rooney had stated that a reduction in prices would mean a reduction in wages.  That was what Fianna Fáil went round the place telling the people in the General Election of 1954.  The stalwart from East Cork may probably remember this illustrated pamphlet which I think was printed by The Irish Press, Limited, and published by Fianna Fáil.  It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do not cut a stick to beat yourselves. Fine Gael talks of getting back to 1951.  This means&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did they say it meant?:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;12/6 off wages, more in many cases; 4/- off old age pensions; 4/- <Col N="989" /> off children's allowances (for three children); 27/6 off sickness benefits; 10/- off the widows' contributory pensions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil view was that, if there was to be any reduction in prices, that could only be done by cutting wages and by cutting all the rest of the benefits which the people enjoy. Our attitude was that the purchasing power of the people, the real wages of the people, could be increased, that you could narrow the gap between their incomes and prices.</P>
    <P>That in fact has been done.  I do not think there is any Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House who can question that. Many of them may be inclined to question whether it has been done to any great extent.  In any event, it has been done and in so far as there can be any criticism of the Book of Estimates published this year because of increases in it, I think the Deputies opposite will recognise the fact that an increase of £4,000,000 is due practically entirely to increased wages to public servants, civil servants, the Army, Garda, postmen, etc.  Without being too precise regarding the figures I think that accounts for something in the region of £3,500,000.</P>
    <P>The policy of the present Government is one which undoubtedly has the support and confidence of the people. Reference was made by Deputy Cunningham to the similarity of the problem confronting the present Government and that confronting the Fianna Fáil Government in 1952.  That is a very dangerous topic for any Fianna Fáil Deputy to bring up voluntarily but, since Deputy Cunningham insists on talking about 1952, let us examine the position for a minute.  It may be that the problem is the same. Let us assume that the problem facing the present Government and the problem which faced Fianna Fáil in 1952 is the same or a similar problem. How about the remedy &mdash; the steps taken by the different Governments? Fianna Fáil set their sights in 1952 and did not set them too low.  They set them on food prices and subsidies and the prices went up and up and up. Prices of essential foods went up and <Col N="990" /> up and up by the deliberate action of the Fianna Fáil Government.  That was the Fianna Fáil remedy.  That was the effective action which Fianna Fáil took.  You have Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Cunningham stating that the action which this Government are now taking is inadequate and is not going to be effective.  Does that mean that Deputy Lemass, Deputy Corry and the rest of them are still yearning for further slashes at the food subsidies?  The 1952 action was only a beginning as far as Fianna Fáil was concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to say, and I believe it to be a fact, that the steps which the present Government are taking are steps which show calm, cool and deliberate appraisal of the problems that confront us.  It shows a resolute determination on the part of the Government to deal with the situation and to do that as far as possible, without being unduly harsh on the people.  Fianna Fáil approached, what they tell us was a similar problem, with the attitude of a bull in a china shop.  They charged in at it.  They saw the food subsidies in front of them like a red rag and they cut them down.  That was the Fianna Fáil attitude.</P>
    <P>We know what this Government are doing.  Fianna Fáil state, if they are sincere&mdash;and I take them to be sincere &mdash;that the present Government are not going far enough.  If that is so, is it not reasonable to assume that if Fianna Fáil were on these benches now, the actions they would take would be more drastic?  Is it wrong to assume that if Deputy Lemass was sitting on these benches to-day he would not complete the task of abolishing food subsidies?  Is it not reasonable to assume from the attitude of Deputy Lemass and of Deputy MacEntee that, if they were here to-day, the remainder of the subsidies would go?  1952 was a starting point.  They did not make any secret of the fact that they considered the cutting down of the subsidies in 1952 as a starting point.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 21st April, 1952, we have a report of the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, visiting Rathdowney, in Laois.  He described the 1952 <Col N="991" /> Budget as an honest one and asserted that they could have been even more severe.  He went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the subsidies had been left, the alternative would have been to put twopence more on beer, three-pence more on cigarettes, fourpence more on petrol, a shilling on the income-tax and twopence more on whiskey.  A very large proportion of the population spent at three to four times the rate, assuming that every man, woman and child indulged in drink, tobacco and amusements, more than they received in subsidies on food.  It seems reasonable, therefore, to end the food subsidies by stages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appeared to them reasonable to end the food subsidies by stages!  The year 1952 marked the first stage of the Fianna Fáil effort to end the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>As far as this Government are concerned, they have listed about 68 articles none of which can be considered as essential.  Many of them, I agree, are useful.  There are over 100 Deputies in this House and there are probably over 100 views which can be expressed regarding various items on that list.  If I were drawing up that list, I might very well have left out some of the articles and included others.  I think it is quite true to say that the list compiled by the Government contains no article that can be considered as essential.  It contains many articles that can be classed as luxuries and it makes no effort to interfere with the essential foodstuffs of the people.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Corry is anxious to contribute his quota to this discussion and I have not got it in my heart to stand between the Deputy and the House for very much longer.  I want to get back, however, if I may, for a moment to a point which might be worth developing for Deputy Corry's benefit.  I referred earlier to the fact that, since this Government took office, the purchasing power in the hands of the people has been increased, that the people have been put in a better position to square up to prices <Col N="992" /> of the vital commodities.  Fianna Fáil, in their election propaganda and literature of 1954, went to great pains to convince the people that that was the important thing.  I have here an election effort of the Fianna Fáil Party, an advertisement published in the <i>Radio Review</i> of the 7th May, 1954.</P>

      <P>I would not like to deprive the Deputy of it.  Do not press me too hard because I have a number of others in front of me.  This is what the Fianna Fáil propagandists have to say.  This is the situation they want to drive home to the people and I do not think that Deputy Corry will challenge the accuracy of what was said.  This is what they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The people, as far as food is concerned, are better off now than in 1951 and much better off than before the war.  If a man has a family he gets further help from children's allowances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The next paragraph is brought out in heavy, black leaded type:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Remember, that the important question is not what does it cost but how much will my wages buy?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that question was the important question in 1954 it is also the important question in 1956.  Pay-packets have gone up.  Every worker in the City of Dublin and throughout the country knows that; and that applies over all levels in the community. People have been put in a better position than they were in before to withstand the impact of higher prices.  In other words, as far as the policy of the Government is concerned, they have lived up to the specific, clear and unambiguous answer given by the Taoiseach when he was questioned by the <i>Irish Times</i> on the eve of the election as to what would be the policy of an inter-Party Government in relation to the cost of living and high prices.</P>
      <P>I understand it has been arranged that the Minister will get in to conclude at quarter to ten.  I have a feeling Deputy Corry would like to say a few words.</P>

      <P>I hold that 90 per cent. of our lopsided economy to-day is caused by one thing, namely, the cost-of-living bonus, prepared by officials and operated by officials for officials. That is not confined altogether to the Deputies over there.  I heard Deputy McGrath to-night attack the Labour Deputies in the county council for their attitude in that respect.  I do not know, when we come here and vote £1,000,000 or more for civil servants on the basis of a cost-of-living bonus, how that bonus is scattered.  The first thing we hear about here is the 2/- extra on the lb. of tea.  In order to provide that 2/- on the lb. of tea we have a cost-of-living bonus.  Now, we in the Cork County Council decided on that basis that our officials would all get 12/6 a week.  It is different from the method in the Civil Service whereby a pound of Deputy Tony Barry's tea is increased in price and the extra 2/- per lb. for it is provided by giving £30 to one fellow and £150 to another to buy the same pound of tea.  Millions of the nation's money has been squandered in that way.  It is a false economy, an economy which lays it down that, because some article goes up in price by a couple of bob, one man is to get 5/- to buy that couple of bobs' worth and another man is to get five quid to buy exactly the same article. That is known as the cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Deputy McGrath was so free, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating both the Labour representatives, the farmers and Fine Gael, who stood together in relation to a managerial order down in Cork last Monday, and I would like to give one warning that if there is any more noise about it, they will get nothing. They can take that whatever way they like.  It is about time we put an end to the farce that is going on here.  I <Col N="994" /> do not care who likes it and who does not.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal here to-day about all the money that was being poured into agriculture, according to Deputy J. Larkin.  We had suggestions about credit from one Deputy, and something else from another.  We had Deputy Declan Costello talking about the increase, God save us, in agricultural production.  Now I would like Deputy Larkin to take this to heart. How would Deputy Larkin feel and how much would he be inclined to work if there was a tax of 12/6 put on every bag that he produced?</P>

      <P>Yes, so that he would lose more.  The answer of the farming community to that was to reduce their acreage of wheat by 129,000 acres.  That was their answer to the tax of £5 per ton on their wheat by this Government. Then the Minister for Industry and Commerce came along and put a tax of £6 per ton on pig feeding.</P>

      <P>That was the tax that he put on the ration and he took £617,000 out of the pockets of the pig feeders in order to provide the subsidy on flour that Deputy M.J. O'Higgins has been holding out here to us as a gift from somebody.  Manna from Heaven!  Now we know where the manna came from: &mdash;£617,000 of the flour subsidy dug out of the pig feeders by the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the last 12 months because of his increase in the price of offals by £6 per ton.</P>
      <P>The increase in production about which Deputy Declan Costello was talking is shown here in the statistics as a reduction of 159,456 pigs in the last 12 months.  That is what this nation paid for Deputy Norton's new income-tax on the pig feeder.</P>

      <P>Last week I had a couple of hours to spare and I went through a whole volume of the Official Report. I found in that volume that Deputy Coogan, sitting over there, had made 278 interruptions in the period covered by that particular volume.  He has never yet made a speech.  Why does he not get up, like all the rest of us, and say what he has to say?  Let him try that for a change.</P>
      <P>In going down through this list, let us look at three items in particular. There is a good deal of talk about our adverse trading balance.  According to this list, our wheat imports in 1945 cost us £1,724,253.  In order to make up the 129,000 acres that the farmer did not grow our imports of wheat in 1955 cost us £4,991,632, an increase of £3,267,000 &mdash; a payment for the tax put on wheat by this Minister for Agriculture of £5 per ton.</P>
      <P>In 1955 we paid £608,338 for foreign barley.  We paid nothing in 1954.  The increase in maize was from £4,000,000 to £5,400,000 in order to make up for the £4 a ton shot we got from the Minister for Agriculture on feeding barley.  The cost of living had gone up and the cost of production had gone up but that is the kind of a shot we got as farmers.  Then we had Deputies having the neck to stand up and say: &ldquo;Give the farmers credit, give them loans.&rdquo;  Deputy Costello suggested that for every acre we would plough, he would give us a slice off the rates. All the farmers of this country want is that Governments should take their hands out of the farmers' pockets. Stop robbing us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about hairshirts.  We can call the policy of the present Minister for Finance the hairy man's policy because he must be looking for a race of hairy men when he put a levy of 37½ per cent. on the necessary haircutting machines.  Unless we have some definite change of attitude, the same position will continue again next year.  We will have less wheat grown next year, less barley and less beet grown next year.  In regard to sugar, in 1954 we imported £1,600,000 worth. In 1955 there was £2,721,431 worth imported. We paid the foreigner £5,076,000 more for grain and we paid him £2,500,000 more for sugar.  I am asking here, in fairness, that those penal taxes which are being put on the farming community, and which will decrease production, should be removed.</P>
      <P>I understand that an arrangement was come to here and I do not intend to delay the House.  But I would make an appeal, if appeal is any use, that if there is going to be any improvement in what the Government is crying out for, more production, then they must remove the penal tariffs from the farmer's back, remove the £617,000 that has been put on the pig feeder's back and the burden that has been placed on wheat.  If the Government does those things there will be an increase in production.  If they do not, then this time 12 months we will be here discussing the Supplies and Services Bill and the tale will be just as woeful as it was when we were discussing what we were going to do with the oats for which we had no market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has followed its customary course over the last ten years and one would not object to many of the things that were said in the course of the debate.  Deputy Corry, of course, is usually shooting up the wrong street and one need not deal with the remarks which he made <Col N="997" /> for the past ten minutes because they are more appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture. Generally, we can regard the other remarks from the Opposition Benches, with one exception, as being fairly customary criticism on a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>The one exception is, of course, Deputy Lemass.  He came in here this evening with a blustering speech and made up his mind he was going to indulge in as much misrepresentation of the position as he possibly could.  As I listened to Deputy Lemass, with his experience, talking this evening as he did on the Supplies and Services Bill, and misrepresenting things in the manner in which he did, I came to the conclusion that if there were such a thing in this country as an aristocracy of people skilled in the art of chancing their arm, Deputy Lemass, because of his talents in that field, would be a prince in his own right.  The Deputy indulged in misrepresentation here this evening which he must have known constituted misrepresentation to a very high degree.</P>
      <P>The Supplies and Services Bill was introduced in 1946.  It was continued in 1947 when Fianna Fáil were in office, and we used it from 1948 to 1951. Fianna Fáil used it in 1952, 1953 and 1954.  They said then they were hoping to get rid of it.  So are we hoping to get rid of it and we gave evidence of our goodwill in that respect during the past 12 months.  Before the Supplies and Services Bill can be got rid of, it requires the enactment of special legislation covering different aspects of matters which are at present dealt with under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
      <P>During the past year we passed seven of these permanent Bills to replace the Supplies and Services Bill. Two further Bills are before the House and nine other Bills have yet to be introduced.  I hope to see many of these, if not passed during the year, at least on the Order Paper during the year, so that we can get rid of the Supplies and Services Bill as soon as it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, certainly, have no reputation for using power in any abusive sense. <Col N="998" /> Deputy Lemass, who was really the Caesar of the Fianna Fáil Party during his period as Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the last person who ought to indulge in criticism of that kind because Deputy Lemass wielded despotic power in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Government during the 19 years that the Fianna Fáil Party was in office. The boys on the back benches thought they were the Government.  Even the boys on the front benches thought they had some contribution to make.  They could make all the contributions they liked as long as Deputy Lemass approved of them.  For the same Deputy to say that I want to invest myself with any special powers in this respect is a travesty of the facts and the Deputy must know it.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to see the Supplies and Services Bill go and be replaced by permanent legislation, but at the present time nine Bills have yet to be passed and it would be wanton disarming of the Dáil and of the Government of necessary powers to protect the people, to repeal a Bill which carries powers vital for the sustenance of life in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>So far as prices legislation is concerned, I never said that our prices legislation was out of date, effete and ineffective.  All I said in that matter was that I wanted to see permanent price legislation on the Statute Book. What form it should take is a matter for consideration in the light of the circumstances prevailing and I say now, as I said in my opening speech on this Bill, that it is preferable, in the fluid state in which we now are and in which the world is&mdash;and ours is the smallest population in Western Europe to-day and we cannot influence the course of world events&mdash;in present circumstances here and in present world circumstances and with general inflationary tendencies moving all around us, a flexible piece of legislation in the form of the present price control mechanism is something that is useful and might very well be as good as anything we could devise in the form of permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no apology, therefore, for saying to the House and to the country <Col N="999" /> that for the time being this is the best instrument that we can use and it has been used with alertness and efficiency during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is a problem to be dealt with in this matter.  Let us and let the country see the way we have dealt with it in comparison with the way in which Fianna Fáil would have dealt with a similar problem.  In 1947, when Fianna Fáil thought prices were going to rise and when they were afraid that wages were going to rise, that workers were beginning to look for some of the money and some of the wages that they were cheated out of by the Fianna Fáil Wage Standstill Order during the emergency, Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, came to this House and&mdash; Volume 108, column 558&mdash;he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has announced that if a voluntary arrangement (in respect of wage control) is not possible it will introduce proposals for legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the same debate he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want, however, to make it clear that the Government regards it as an essential safeguard to the interests of the general community at the present time that some check upon the upward movement of wages should operate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same debate, the Taoiseach at the time, Deputy de Valera, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government regards this temporary limitation of wages increases as vitally necessary in present circumstances, and if the trade unions cannot undertake such an agreement as I have outlined then the Government will produce proposals for legislation to the same effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil method. That was the good old Czars' method of dealing with it.  That was the method of the gentleman who was used to having his way no matter where he was.</P>
    <P>This was no idle threat, of course. After these remarks had been made, <Col N="1000" /> Deputy Lemass repaired to the Department of Industry and Commerce and in his own handwriting wrote a two-page memorandum directing the Department to produce with fire-brigade expedition a wage freeze Bill. His own handwriting shows that he had made up his mind clearly that this was going to be as tough a piece of wage freezing legislation as he could introduce.  He forgot one thing&mdash;what the penalty should be &mdash; and he put into the document which he wrote in his own handwriting a postscript saying that the penalties should be severe for a transgression.  Then you saw the Bill to see what the penalties were and the penalties were to be £500 for each offence.  What were the offences to be?  One provision was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To prohibit any employer from paying or agreeing to pay to any worker a wage greater than the wage which the worker was receiving on the 15th October, 1947, or such wage varied upwards or downwards in the same proportion as the current cost-of-living index number varies from the index number for mid-November, 1947.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Bill is still in the Department of Industry and Commerce; anybody who likes can read it.  If the Opposition want it I will table it here in the House, Deputy Lemass's manuscript instruction and all.  To get an interpretation of the last portion of it, here is what it means: that, under Deputy Lemass's Bill, a person who had £5 a week in 1939 could get an increase of only 50 per cent. over the 1939 level although at that time the cost-of-living index figure was 84 per cent. over the 1939 level.  So, for the worker who had £5 a week in 1939 &mdash; and he was far from being a wealthy person &mdash; Deputy Lemass's wage freezing Bill of 1947 purported to allow that man an increase of only 50 per cent. over his 1939 rate of wages, although his own figure at the time showed that the cost-of-living index figure was 84 per cent. over the 1939 level.</P>
    <P>That was the way Deputy Lemass, of course, would do things then and, in case the trade unions were to take any action to break through this wage freeze Order, this wage freeze legislation, <Col N="1001" /> Deputy Lemass made sure that there would be a clause inserted in the Bill which prohibited the trade union from taking any strike action whatever. No matter what rascality the employer resorted to, in the matter of the fixation of low rates of wages compared with his capacity to pay, the trade unions were to be prevented from exercising their normal right of taking strike action, which is the badge of free men in every free country and, instead, were to be prohibited from using their funds and were to be subjected to fines of £500 in respect of each offence.</P>

      <P>That does not seem to be the kind of legislation which is promoted in the interests of the working class.  I could understand that being the kind of legislation that company promoters want.  I could understand that being the kind of mentality associated with 1913.  Some of the employers of 1913 would have loved to have done that but they could not get any minion to do it then.  It was left to Deputy Lemass, in 1947, to produce that piece of legislation.  He had not the courage to introduce it into this House.  The association of his name, or anybody's name, with that piece of legislation is an odious association because it represents a violation of everything that is fair and decent and honourable treatment so far as the toiling people of this country are concerned.</P>
      <P>We will not do that.  We will not introduce wage freeze legislation.  This is a free country in which our employers and workers are free to bargain. We will let them bargain hoping that common sense and regard for the economic welfare of their country will induce them to make reasonable settlements which will not disturb the national economy.  But this Government will not attempt to repeat Deputy Lemass's attempt of 1947 when he conceived this odious and vicious piece of wage freezing legislation, a piece of legislation the like of which has never seen the light of day in any democratic country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> We had another example of how Fianna Fáil deals with emergencies. In 1951, we had solemn promises made by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Taoiseach at that time, in which he said it was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government to control prices and to maintain the food subsidies.  That declaration was made by the then Taoiseach in the famous 17 point programme of the Fianna Fáil Party. What happened?  Twelve months after that solemn declaration, 12 months after that covenant was entered into with the people, the Fianna Fáil Party came into this House with the 1952 Budget, and in that Budget they slashed the subsidies and deliberately increased, by their own actions, the prices of tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour, cigarettes, tobacco, beer and a whole variety of other things.</P>
    <P>This was all done as the Fianna Fáil method of dealing with the situation. They deliberately increased prices because they said the people were eating too much; they were dressing too well; they were spending too much money in getting away from a standard of living which they detested and for which everybody applauds their detestation.  But Fianna Fáil said they were eating too much, dressing too well and getting a standard of living that they should not have in this poor country. The Central Bank had, of course previously said: &ldquo;Let us slash food subsidies; they are a hidden subsidy to wages; they are making the people too well off and the people are not exporting as much goods as they ought to export to other countries in order to store up credit balances there.&rdquo;  The Central Bank thought that this should be done and the Central Bank found the Fianna Fáil Party very soft putty when it came to implementing the recommendations of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There has been no slashing of food subsidies by this Government.  One of the first things we did was to increase the subsidies, to give a subsidy of £2,000,000 a year, to reduce the price of butter by 5d a lb.  That subsidy is still being paid.  I have no hesitation in saying, that having regard to their past record, having regard to the speech made by Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance when he introduced <Col N="1003" /> the 1952 Budget that if we were in this House to-day with Fianna Fáil in power there would be no subsidy on bread, no subsidy on flour and no subsidy on butter; that all these subsidies would have gone because that was clearly the mentality which was responsible for the introduction of the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the cost-of-living index figure and let us take our responsibility for the movement of that figure.  Let Fianna Fáil take their responsibility, and let us contrast the circumstances of 1952 and the circumstances of 1955-56.  In 1952 the cost of living was driven up by the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in slashing the subsidies to increase prices and debase the standard of living of our people.  We took no action during our period of office to force prices up; we did not slash any subsidies to drive up prices.  Instead we paid out £2,000,000 a year for a subsidy on butter.  What is the position in regard to the cost-of-living index figure?  When we left office in May, 1951, the cost-of-living index figure was 109; when we came back to office in June, 1954, the cost-of-living index figure had jumped in the meantime to 124.  In other words the cost of living had increased by the deliberate action of the Fianna Fáil Government by 15 points during the three years they were in office.</P>
    <P>We took over at a time when it was stated that the cost-of-living index figure was 124; we might argue that the first figure we saw after we had come into office was 126, because that was the first figure that became operative, in August, 1954.  The figure to-day is 131.  It has increased from 126 to 131, an increase of five points.  Nobody wants to conceal that fact; it is there.  But surely there is an explanation for it.  Have not the people been reading what has been happening all around the world in the last 20 or 22 months?  Does anybody imagine that a small country like this with 3,000,000 people can hold at bay inflationary forces which are operating in all the countries of the world?  The cost of living has gone up in Britain and in <Col N="1004" /> the Six Counties; it has gone up in every other country in Europe, and it has gone up in all these places for the same reasons.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has impacted on our cost of living here is coal; we do not produce the coal we need.  The cost of transport has gone up, freight rates have gone up.  We do not produce the raw materials; we do not produce these basic articles, and here we have to buy them at the prices at which they are going or do without them.  That increase of five points has been affected too by the increased prices for agricultural produce which the Fianna Fáil Party allege they want to see because they allege they are interested in the wellbeing of the farmers.  Compare our record of five points with their record of 15 points, and I do not think there is anything that this Government need apologise for when its record is placed against that of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In any case, let us remember, and let this be quoted &mdash; speaking in the Dáil on October 26th last, Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We in Fianna Fáil know no method by which a general reduction in price levels could be achieved in the immediate future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an admission by the Fianna Fáil Party and in the face of that, Deputy Lemass comes in here to-night with blustering misrepresentations of what the real position is.</P>
    <P>Now let me pass on to some other views of Deputy Lemass.  The Deputy also purported to be an expert on E.S.B. organisation and E.S.B. finances this evening.  He expressed doubts as to the accuracy of a statement, which I made in the House last week; or the week before, in which I said the E.S.B. had an installed capacity in excess of that which it required to produce the current it could sell to-day or could sell in the immediate future.  What is the position?  Deputy Lemass purported to know it.  In so far as he is indebted to his memory for statistics, his memory has played him false; in so far as he has been briefed, he ought to change his briefer as soon as he can. <Col N="1005" /> The position is that the installed capacity of the E.S.B. on December 31st, 1956 will be 572 megawatts; in 1955 it was 512 megawatts.  That means that, theoretically, it could generate 4,500,000,000 units a year.  Its practical generating capacity is about half that, that is, 2,250,000,000 units a year. Let Deputies keep that figure of 2,000,000,000 units a year in their minds now.  The estimate from the E.S.B. certified by their chief mechanical engineer, a man of high reputation in that field, says that the estimated demand for the year ending 31st March, 1956, is 1,540,000,000 units.  This figure is well below the figure of 1,780,000,000 units contained in the White Paper in March, 1954, and is even less than the estimate of 1,689,000,000 units which was subsequently furnished by the board in January, 1955, to the inter-departmental committee on the State capital programme.</P>
    <P>From this is it clear the installed capacity of the E.S.B. is at least equal to if not well ahead of the actual demand and that the rate of growth of the demand is even less than shown in the revised estimate of the E.S.B. in January, 1955.  In other words, we have an installed capacity in sight which is not only capable of supplying more current than we can sell to-day but of doing that and meeting any anticipated demand up to at least 1960.</P>

      <P>It was estimated that the consumption would double itself every five years.  That has proved to be a fantastic estimate, and at the time that estimate was being made the E.S.B. were telling the Department, when Deputy Lemass was there, that they did not believe that progress could be attained.  The position is that the existing equipment of the E.S.B. is able not only to meet all the present demand but to produce from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. more, even at the peak hour.  That is the testimony of the chief mechanical engineer of the E.S.B. without any qualifications at all. Deputy Lemass doubts the figures and testimony of the chief mechanical engineer of the E.S.B.</P>

      <P>The Deputy posed this evening as a specialist in bread production and costs.  When down in Kerry while I was out of the country he went around with his usual misrepresentation and said the price of bread would go up, and he tumbled into my lap the responsibility for increasing the price of bread.  The <i>Sunday Press</i>, of course, the devil's bible, says: &ldquo;Bread is going up, said Mr. Lemass.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let me give the Deputy some information.  Here is a copy of a memo in the Department of Industry and Commerce dictated and signed by Deputy Lemass.  It deals with the discussion which took place with a gentleman of the miller and baker class in Dublin and is dated the 18th December, 1952.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Lemass said he took advantage of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s visit to ask his opinion on bread prices.  He said we blundered in July last when adjusting flour prices by giving the bakers too large a profit margin.  In the case of his own firm he said the profit margin was inordinate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The memorandum later quotes the gentleman in question as saying that his firm would hesitate to start a price war with the other bakers.  He gave the Minister his view however that all the bakers could stand a lower profit per sack even if not to the extent of 3/9, which ¼d. per loaf would represent.</P>
      <P>Here we have a miller baker upbraiding Deputy Lemass for having treated the bakers too generously.  He said the profits of his own bakery were unduly high and went on to say that all the bakers were getting too much. To use Deputy Lemass's own words, he had blundered in giving them too much.  That is the gentleman who is now so concerned with the price of the poor man's bread.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should take his medicine gently.  He should not swallow his own words so hardly.  Now we come to the generating stations. I said here this evening by way of interruption to an abrupt and rude speech by Deputy Lemass that he had, without consideration, directed the E.S.B. to put up electricity generating turf stations in certain areas.  I am in <Col N="1008" /> favour of putting them up wherever they can be operated successfully. Turf burning stations will not succeed and should not be erected in areas where there is no turf available. Deputy Lemass gave instructions to have one erected in Screebe.  Would you be surprised to know that not a single person took the slightest trouble to find out if there was any surplus turf in Screebe before the station was erected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me protect Deputy Lemass from himself now because it would be unfair to him to permit him to demand an inquiry into what occurred. The position is that no investigation was held.  Both bodies blamed the other for not having carried out the investigation.  The file says that one of them said the other should carry it out while the other said the first should have carried it out.  The result was that nobody carried out the investigation. Let me bring Deputy Lemass up to date on it.  On the file is a minute from the Land Commission dated 20th October, 1954, in which it is stated that the commissioners were quite satisfied that turf is quite scarce in the district in which a number of bogs are suitable.  Moreover, the Land Commission stated that if the turf were used to the extent contemplated, turf supplies would be rapidly denuded and no turf would be available for domestic use except at a great distance from their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea was to take the turf away from the local people. <Col N="1009" /> In reply to an advertisement last year for turf for the Screebe station only one firm's tender was received for 300 tons at 45/- a ton.  The turf would be delivered in March, 1956.  The station's capacity is 30,000 tons a year and we have an offer for the supply of 300 tons.  Is not that marvellous economy?</P>

      <P>We come to the roads now.  The amount provided out of the National Development Fund for the provision and repair of roads was £200,000 and not £250,000, as has been stated by some speakers here.  Of that, £120,000 was intended for county roads, of which £50,000 has been paid to the local authorities concerned.  The balance is to be spent in 1956-57.  £80,000 was earmarked for accommodation roads in the bogs and arrangements are being made with the Special Employment Schemes Office for the carrying out of these works. The need for these roads will not be known until tenders for the supply of turf to the small stations are received by the E.S.B.  No applications have yet been received in the Department for any of the grants for these schemes.</P>

      <P>The question of biscuits was raised by Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>God be with the night I heard him talk about it in Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When we wanted money for useful schemes of a social welfare nature it seemed unreal, in 1956, to be subsidising flour so that some people could get creamy biscuits to eat.  That is the real fact of the matter.  Nobody ever thought of subsidising biscuits in Ireland before the war.  Nobody in any other country subsidised flour for the purpose of making biscuits.  It was accepted, arising out of the general subsidisation of flour during the war.</P>
      <P>It was felt that the taking of the subsidy from flour for the making of biscuits might harm the export trade, so we have given the exporters of biscuits flour at a price as cheap as the flour which their competitors can get in the countries to which they export their biscuits.  If a biscuit manufacturer in Ireland is exporting biscuits to the British market as well we will put the flour on his floor at the same price as the British manufacturer is getting the flour on his floor. Recently, because of an added mixture of foreign, as compared with Irish wheats, we were able to give the manufacturer a reduction of 10/- in the sack of the unsubsidised flour which they use in the manufacture of biscuits.</P>
      <P>Biscuit manufacturers are being treated reasonably well and, so far as employment is concerned, I think the total home production is in the vicinity of 300,000 lb. and only 2 per cent. of the biscuits used are imported.  The manufacturers, in this matter, had better look for a return of the trade by offering their biscuits to the public at a price which will induce the public to buy.  If the manufacturers want to sell biscuits they must have their biscuits on the market at a price which will induce the public to buy their biscuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not because of imports or because of anything that we have done that they are in difficulties.  I do not want to discuss their private affairs here and now.  If they are in difficulties <Col N="1011" /> they are in these difficulties because of other reasons, and I defy the Deputy to come in here with a letter from any of these manufacturers saying that their difficulties are due to the price of flour being charged to them and not through any other type of misadventure.</P>
    <P>One other question was raised by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy McGrath.  That was in relation to the question of waste paper here and the <Col N="1012" /> prospects of finding a market for the waste paper collected here on the assumption that there was a market for it.  They took the general line that, as far as possible, Irish waste paper should be consumed here.  A complaint about the matter only reached me within the last few days, and I have instituted inquiries to see what can be done to provide a market for Irish waste paper collected here.</P>
