      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received representations from Balbriggan Town Commissioners in connection with the establishment of industries in the town, and, in particular, in connection with the establishment of a hosiery, linen and textile industry, with which Balbriggan has been associated in the past; and, if so, if he will take steps to ensure that the advantages of Balbriggan will be brought to the notice of interested persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from the Balbriggan Town Commissioners as to the need for the establishment of an industry in the town.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the establishment of industries is primarily a matter for private enterprise and local initiative.  The Balbriggan Town Commissioners have been informed that if they will let me have particulars of the facilities at Balbriggan, including information as to factory sites and an estimate of the capital available locally for investment in industrial projects, I will arrange through the Department and the Industrial Development Authority to have these facilities brought to the notice of parties who submit industrial proposals and who have not already selected a location.  The Deputy will realise, of <Col N="4" /> course, that the claims of other towns with facilities to offer are also brought to the notice of industrial promoters.</P>
      <P>Should any interests submit to me a sound proposal for the establishment of an industry at Balbriggan, I will be glad to assist in any way possible in bringing it to fruition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that English biscuits are being sold in Dublin at a price which is 3d. to 4d. per lb. cheaper than biscuits manufactured in Ireland, and if so, if he is prepared to increase the rebate on flour used for biscuits manufactured for export to enable the home-manufacturer to compete on more advantageous terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position regarding the price of English biscuits sold in Dublin is as indicated by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The rebate payable on flour used in the manufacture of biscuits for export is intended to equate the flour price to that obtaining in the country of destination of the exports, and could not, therefore, affect the price of Irish made biscuits sold on the home market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the price of (a) imported glucose, and (b) home-produced glucose, and the duty, if any, charged thereon; further, whether persons engaged in the confectionery export trade are entitled to any concessions or remission of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Imported glucose is subject to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 37½ per cent. full, 25 per cent. preferential. Home-produced glucose is not subject to any duty.</P>
      <P>Immediately prior to the imposition of the duty, the price here of imported glucose was approximately £46 per ton.  As the prices in the home markets of the exporting countries were substantially higher, this artificially low price merely represented the price at which foreign manufacturers were prepared to dispose of their surplus production here.</P>
      <P>The ex-factory price of home-produced glucose is £52 5s. a ton, less a rebate of 15/- to customers supplying their own drums.  The price delivered in returnable drums to customers' premises in Dublin, Cork or Limerick is £54 10s. per ton and £55 10s. to other destinations.  The corresponding delivered price in Britain is £56 5s. per ton.</P>
      <P>As regards glucose for the export trade, the position is still as explained in the reply given to a question on the same subject on the 9th November, 1955.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware <Col N="7" /> of the grave inconvenience caused to persons travelling via Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead during the Christmas holiday period as a result of the totally inadequate service provided by British Railways, and, if so, if he will take steps to put an end to this annually recurring inconvenience to the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The recurring difficulties in connection with the services on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route in recent years have been the subject of a number of discussions with the British Transport Commission, and at a meeting as recently as October last, the chairman of the London-Midland Area Board of the commission gave an undertaking to the Tánaiste personally that the commission would continue their efforts to improve the service and provide for the comfort and convenience of passengers.  As a result certain changes have been made.  I understand that, in fact, there was a substantial increase last Christmas in the number of additional sailings usually provided and that no intending passengers were left behind at either Dún Laoghaire or Holyhead.  I can assure the Deputy that the importance of an adequate service is fully appreciated and that it is the intention to maintain close contact with the Transport Commission to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is pretty obvious that the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route is overloaded, would the Minister not consider making representations to British Railways, who own the Fishguard company in part with C.I.E., as to an extensive development of the Rosslare-Fishguard route to meet the difficulties which arise not only in the Christmas season but in the summer holiday season?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not consider it?  Why should the Irish public be held up to ransom by British Railways?  Before Christmas, people were waiting for hours at Dún Laoghaire for boats.  The first boat was due <Col N="8" /> in at 6 o'clock but did not arrive until 10 o'clock.  Two other boats took a whole day to come in.  That is not a proper service to give the Irish people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received representations in regard to the shortage of bus drivers on Dublin City services and the lack of provision made for sudden illness, accident or the inevitable sleep-in, with the result that, morning after morning, buses are lying idle in all the garages while workers have to queue for long periods in cold and rain and, accordingly, are often late for work; and, if so, if he will ask C.I.E. to remedy this position forthwith.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative.  I must remind the Deputy, however, that matters such as this, which relate to internal administration, fall entirely within the province of the Board of C.I.E., which was appointed by the Government to manage the undertaking.

      <P>For carrying out this task the boards of the two undertakings were empowered to fix, demand, take and recover such charges as they may think fit.

    <Speaker pid="CeliaLynch" hpid="Mrs. Lynch Mrs. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the recent reduction in tea prices in Great Britain, there is an early prospect of a similar reduction in this country, and, if not, why not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the reductions in retail prices of tea in Great Britain which were reported in the Press recently do not apply to the full range of blends on the market but relate only to a limited number of blends of medium priced tea.</P>
      <P>Retail prices of tea in this country are governed by the prices charged by Tea Importers, Limited, for each of the various grades required for blending and the latter prices are based on the average cost of purchase to the company.  Tea Importers, Limited, must buy in bulk and in advance in countries of origin.  Accordingly the tea which is now in consumption and will be consumed in the coming months is tea bought last year.  It is on the basis of the cost of that tea that Tea Importers' selling price is fixed and there is therefore no scope for reductions in price unless and until teas bought at a cheaper price become available to the company and are issued to the trade.  In fact some quantities of the teas the company are now buying in countries of origin are being bought at prices comparable with those mentioned by the Deputy and other teas have been bought at prices lower than last year's.  What the effect on the future issue price of Tea Importers, Limited, will be can be determined only when the bulk of tea required for future needs has been purchased.  The position, however, will be kept under close review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>On 6th January, 1956, the Prices Advisory Body examined a proposal by the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company, Limited, about an increase in their coke prices.  As the affairs of this company, including the company's prices for coke and other by-products, had been examined in public on two occasions in 1955, the Advisory Body considered that a further public inquiry would not serve any useful purpose.  The amount of the increase proposed by the company was 10/- per ton, the need for which was due partly to higher freight rates and partly to the use of higher-priced coal screenings by the company for technical reasons.  The company estimate that the price increase of 10/- per ton will cover only about two-thirds of the additional production costs under these headings.</P>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Body recommended that the proposed increase be approved and I accepted this recommendation. As I am in agreement with the view of the Advisory Body that a further public inquiry into the affairs of the company would not be warranted at this stage, I am not prepared to withdraw my approval of the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Mrs. O'Carroll Mrs. O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the inquiry referred to by the Minister dealt with the price of gas only?  Coke was never mentioned, and, in view of the fact that coke is a lucrative and valuable by-product of gas, will the Minister not see that his sanction to the new price for coke is withheld, pending a further inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company, <Col N="14" /> Limited, propose to increase the price of coke by 15/- a ton, the Minister has no power to prevent them.</P>

      <P>The transport required for the ground limestone subsidy scheme administered by Department of Agriculture is provided by C.I.E. with their own vehicles or with vehicles hired by them from limestone producers or other hauliers for the purpose.  Inquiries about the hire of vehicles for the haulage of limestone should, accordingly, be addressed to the board.</P>
      <P>I have, nevertheless, made inquiries from C.I.E. and I am informed that the persons mentioned in these questions applied to have their lorries employed on the distribution of limestone but that the fleets already engaged in this work are adequate to deal with the traffic offering.</P>

    <P>Because of the increasingly heavy programme of work involved in connection with the building of new schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools throughout the country and of the pressure on the commissioners' architectural staff, the commissioners have not yet been <Col N="17" /> able to bring this case to the stage at which tenders for the erection of the new building can be invited.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a somewhat similar question on the 17th November, 1954, put to me by another Deputy.  As I then said: &ldquo;It will be appreciated that it is desirable on educational grounds that the same text-books should not be used indefinitely in national or secondary schools.  The unnecessary changing of books is, however, discouraged by my Department.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A notice in the following terms is now included in the list of approved books which is sent each year to managers and principal teachers of national schools:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To save parents undue expense, care should be taken to see that schoolbooks are not changed too frequently.  Where a class is taught as a separate unit, the same books should be kept in use for a number of years, unless there are special reasons for changing them.  A similar arrangement should, as far as possible, be adopted where two or more classes are grouped for teaching purposes. In such groups pupils will require fresh reading matter and possibly a change of reader also for their second year in the group, but other text-books should not be changed unless when absolutely necessary. The same readers and text-books should be used in the group every third year at least.&rdquo;</P>

My Department is, of course, concerned to secure that these books shall be made available at the lowest possible cost.  It is important, however, in the interests of the children that schoolbooks shall be printed in clear type on good paper and firmly bound, especially since it is officially recommended that schoolbooks should not be changed too frequently in order that they may be utilised by other members of a family in later school years.  In the circumstances, I do not think that the use of inferior paper would achieve the economy to the parents which the Deputy has in mind.</P>

One individual is utilising the 500 acres and is not utilising them for agricultural purposes&mdash;tillage, and so on.  If portion of the land of this farm were acquired, it would, in conjunction with the land the Minister has referred to, relieve at least 20 smallholders in the area by bringing their holdings up to an economic level.

      <P>As the reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to have it circulated with the Official Report.  It would be contrary to established departmental practice to supply the addresses of these persons. <Col N="34" /> Consequently, I regret that such information cannot be supplied.</P>
      <P>Departmental records of the persons to whom service medals have been issued are compiled in alphabetical order and not on the basis of the unit or area in which the applicant claimed to have served.  In view of the amount of official time which would be involved in extracting the information sought in the second part of the question and as the addresses could not be given, I do not propose to supply the list.  The number of such medals, without bar, which has been issued to persons resident in County Limerick is approximately 1,900.</P>

These onions had been seized under the Customs Acts as having been imported in contravention of the Onions (Regulation of Import) Order, 1948.  The requirement, in respect of dried onions, of licences under the Colorado Beetle Order, 1945, and the Foot and Mouth Disease (Importation of Plants) Order, 1952, did not come into operation until the 21st December, 1955, and, consequently, the question <Col N="46" /> of contravention of either of these Orders did not arise.</P>
      <P>The sale of the onions, which was effected after consultation with the Department of Agriculture, yielded prices ranging from 27s. 0d. to 32s. 6d. per case.</P>

      <P>Employees of Government Departments and all other State employees are subject to statutory deductions of income-tax from current salaries and wages.  Railway employees are in a similar position. In addition, voluntary schemes for deduction of tax from salaries and wages have been arranged in many cases between employers and employees with the agreement of the Revenue.  Such schemes are in operation for a number of the bodies referred to by the Deputy.  Where arrangements of this kind do not already exist the employers would, I am sure, be willing to consider establishing them if a majority of their workers so desired. The Deputy may take it that, in that event, the Revenue Commissioners would be glad to render all possible co-operation.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on 13th July, 1955, it is not possible to determine the extent to which financial assistance for the improvement of the bog roads will be necessary until details are available of the locations of the bog holdings from which the station will draw supplies of the 1956 turf crop.  I now understand that the Cahirciveen station will not be in commission until the spring of 1957 and it is too early yet to say from what bog areas the supply of turf will be received.</P>

      <P>It is the general policy to use native fuels to the greatest possible extent for purposes of heating in Government offices and buildings and quantitatively the amount of native fuels used is very much greater than the amounts of imported fuel.  By reference to current prices the use of native fuels does not result in any saving in cost. Experiments have already been carried out with varying degrees of success on devices designed to facilitate the use of turf in central heating plants.  A claim that anthracite (waste) could be utilised in suitable cases with a resultant saving in cost is at present being investigated.</P>

Separate figures for (a) established, (b) unestablished and temporary, and (c) part-time officers are not available.  It is estimated, however, that approximately 10 per cent. of the officers employed were part-time and a somewhat higher proportion were in non-pensionable employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the erection of 84 houses in Mallow were submitted by the urban district council on the 18th November last.  All but 16 of them were based on a design in considerable excess of the normal size of local authority houses. The number of houses proposed appears to have been based on applications received but no survey of the actual housing needs, numbers in families, etc., had been made.  The council were asked on the 13th December last to carry out a proper survey of the circumstances of the applicants and to submit proposals based thereon.  Suggested revisions to the house plans and the lay-out plan were also conveyed.  No reply has been received but it is understood that the survey has been undertaken and is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that when I get proposals based on properly ascertained needs and conforming with designs which will accommodate the families eligible for rehousing without imposing an undue burden on them by way of rents, such proposals will be expeditiously and favourably considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add that the procedure which the local authority was requested to follow in this case represents the normal procedure which is designed to ensure that, where housing programmes are nearing completion, detailed investigations of the balance of housing needs should be <Col N="61" /> made before deciding on the nature or extent of new schemes.  I made a statement to this effect in Bandon on the 1st instant and complimented the Cork County Council for having already instituted such a practice in their area.  In making that statement I had no purpose in mind other than to ensure reasonable compliance with these elementary requirements.  There is no foundation whatsoever for any other interpretation of my remarks, particularly that of the <i>Sunday Press</i> which suggested that they indicated a &ldquo;go-slow&rdquo; policy on housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inform the House that a new National Loan will open for subscription on Monday next, the 13th February. The loan will be for £20,000,000 <Col N="67" /> and it will be underwritten jointly by the Irish Banks and the Minister for Finance.  The title &ldquo;National Savings Bonds&rdquo; has been chosen for the issue as a reminder of the importance of savings as a source of finance for capital development.  The rate of interest will be 5 per cent. and the issue price of the Bonds £98 10s. 0d. for each £100 purchased.  These terms will, I am sure, prove attractive to investors.  The Bonds will be a sound and profitable security and should appeal not only to large companies and institutions but also to men and women of more modest means.  To facilitate the investor there is, as usual, provision in the prospectus whereby only 10 per cent. of the purchase price need be paid on application, the remainder being payable in three instalments over the months of March and April.  Applications may be for as little as one £10 Bond.  No charge will be made to the investor by the bank or stockbroker who forwards the application.</P>
      <P>The Bonds will be redeemed not later than 1981 and may be redeemed at any time from 1971 on.  As the issue is being made at a discount, those who hold the Bonds to redemption will obtain the benefit of a capital gain of £1 10s. 0d. per £100 of Bonds held, a gain which will be tax-free to the ordinary investor.</P>
      <P>The last National Loan, as the House will recollect, was very well received by the public.  The present issue, with a higher, and indeed what is for a gilt edge investment a most attractive, annual return, should not be less successful.  The credit of the State is high and bears favourable comparison with that of richer countries. Our national debt is moderate when regard is had to the development needs which confronted us on obtaining self-government.  It is relatively low by international standards and is well within our capacity to service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue will be charged on the Central Fund and will have behind it the full resources of the State.  The market value of the Bonds will be supported by their status as a trustee security and also by the concession whereby they will be accepted at face value in payment of death duties.  In <Col N="68" /> addition, the substantial sinking fund provision included in the annual service allocation of £1,300,000 will be available for purchase of Bonds throughout the lifetime of the issue and will thus further help to maintain their capital value.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the issue will benefit from the arrangements made in 1954 whereby both buying and selling prices for Irish Government stocks are quoted daily on the Stock Exchange and the Government Stockbroker is ready to buy or sell any such stock in reasonable amounts at a moment's notice.  These arrangements will operate to maintain an active market in the Bonds.</P>
    <P>In the course of my Budget speech last year, I pointed out that in our circumstances it is to our own people that we must look to provide the greater part of the funds needed for national development.  The occasion of the present issue provides a suitable opportunity for emphasising this fact once more.  Investors who place their funds at the disposal of the State through subscription to the present issue will be playing their part in ensuring that resources will continue to be available to promote the expansion of our agricultural production, the development of our fuel resources, the extension of afforestation, the purchase of tankers and dry cargo vessels, the improvement of the telephone system and the provision of houses, schools and hospitals.  These capital schemes are not only desirable in themselves but are also, of course, of the greatest importance for the maintenance of employment, the curbing of emigration and the promotion of economic activity throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress once more, in the context of this Loan, the critical need at present for a higher volume of savings&mdash;for a voluntary switch from spending to saving&mdash;so that we shall have a better balance in our external payments and be able to continue, without setback, to develop our economy and raise living standards on a lasting basis.  All subscribers to the Loan will be helping to attain this objective.</P>
    <P>The prospectus will appear in tomorrow's daily newspapers.  Copies of <Col N="69" /> the prospectus and application form will also be available as from to-morrow from any bank, stockbroker or post office.  The lists will close at latest on Friday, 17th February, and I suggest, therefore, that applications should be made as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I confidently ask for the full and active support of every Deputy in the House for this issue.</P>

      <P>We have now heard the statement of the Minister for Finance.  In the main, he has indicated the purposes for which the money he is looking for is required.  I take it that this money is urgently necessary.  We all know that, no matter what Government is in office, the State's various capital services have to be carried on; and the cost of these has to be met.  As the Minister has stated, there is no doubt that the terms of the loan are very attractive and should so prove to investors.  I think this is about the highest rate offered for money since the State came into existence.  As I say, the loan is attractive and, as far as we are concerned, we recognise that the money is necessary.  It is a national matter and we hope that the appeal of the Minister, and the Minister's efforts to get the money, will be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I am sure that every Deputy at some time or another has had the opportunity of hearing locally the tradition that exists in various centres of the country that there are minerals of value beneath the soil in those localities. In some cases these minerals were worked in the past and where there were commercial workings they were most fully exploited during the last century.  The peak of such production was about 100 years ago. From that peak production gradually declined and many undertakings ceased operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some feel they were closed because of competition or the policy of opposed interests.  Others, and I think they are correct, feel that the decline of <Col N="73" /> mining in Ireland came about because of the working out of the most profitable parts of the deposits and because of the discovery of fresh deposits of higher grade ores in other countries.</P>
    <P>In any event, whatever the reason, it is clear that an incentive is necessary if we are to get business people interested in the somewhat chancy business of searching for, working and commercially developing such non-bedded ores as may be existent in Ireland.  It will be appreciated that even the reopening of a long abandoned mine may be a very expensive, chancy and dangerous business.  No one can tell with any certainty what lies under the soil where it cannot be seen. Exploration requires very heavy expenditure. Even after exploration has been concluded, unforeseen and unforeseeable difficulties may arise at any stage.  Unexpected physical difficulties may be met and may have to be overcome. The vein of the deposits may be broken or may peter out sooner than anticipated.</P>
    <P>In other words, capital must be committed to an enterprise involving a greater risk of failure than would be associated with a normal commercial enterprise.  The house will note I have referred to non-bedded deposits which are those mentioned in the Bill.  The content of bedded deposits is capable of being more readily assessed and the extraction of such deposits is more akin to a normal commercial operation. Working on non-bedded ores is, however, for the reasons I have given, a speculative and risky venture.</P>
    <P>Mining, too, differs from an ordinary industry in another way.  Every Party in this House is committed to the policy of assisting the inception of new industries by a policy of protection. Whether that protection is given by tariff or by quota or other import restriction, assistance is in that way available to industry, particularly in its infancy.</P>
    <P>Such assistance or incentive is not available to mining.  Assistance could perhaps be given under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts and indeed I did sanction last year a very substantial guarantee under those Acts to an Irish mining concern; but though that might <Col N="74" /> help in an individual case, such guarantees would clearly not provide the broad incentive the Government deemed necessary, if such minerals as we possess are to be raised.</P>
    <P>It was clear to the Government therefore that the only satisfactory broad incentive was by way of tax concession. I do not wish to suggest that we were in any way unique in coming to that conclusion.  The U.S.A., Canada, South Africa, Australia and, I think, Germany all afford special treatment in their tax codes to mining ventures.  The concessions that these countries offer as an inducement to mining are varied both in their incidence and in their complications.  I felt, however, that we have a slightly different problem perhaps from theirs and that what we required here was a solution that would be simple for would-be investors in these enterprises to grasp and yet far reaching in its effect.  It is on that basis that I ask the Dáil to approve of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The basic principles of the Bill are simple, though I confess that in drafting these principles into legislative form, the wording becomes a trifle involved. These principles are three in number: first, as the whole purpose of the Bill is to act as an incentive, the benefit is given to new mining operations for obtaining non-bedded minerals, while at the same time giving existing operators the benefit of certain provisions from now on, and it will be noted that, in order to be eligible for relief, new mining operations must begin within the next three years, thus providing an inducement not to delay development unduly; secondly, the relief is confined to Irish companies and it will, I think, be conceded that it is realistic to restrict the concession to companies since it can scarcely be expected that persons would work non-bedded deposits of minerals on a scale of any magnitude without the protection of limited liability; and thirdly, the concession takes the simple form of exemption from tax on profits, for the first four years of development and thereafter 50 per cent. exemption for four years.</P>
    <P>Income-tax and corporation profits tax will, subject to certain modifications, <Col N="75" /> be assessed in the ordinary way as if the proposed legislation had not been passed.  The income-tax assessed for a year of assessment to which the legislation is to apply will, for the purpose of arriving at the amount which ranks for the total or partial relief, be reduced by income-tax on debenture interest, royalties and similar charges from which income-tax may be deducted and retained by the company in making payment of the interest, royalties, etc. to the persons entitled to receive them.  Income-tax on so much of the profits as represents the amount of the interest, etc., is essentially the liability, not of the mining company, but of the persons entitled to the interest, etc., and therefore cannot properly qualify for the relief.  The income-tax assessed, reduced by income-tax on the charges, is the amount of income-tax which the mining company would effectively bear were it not for the Bill; and such income-tax (called, in the Bill, the &ldquo;net income-tax&rdquo;) is the amount which ranks for total or partial relief. The amounts of corporation profits tax assessed for periods to which the legislation is to apply are the amounts of that tax which will qualify for total or partial relief under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is provided that dividends payable out of profits to which the Bill applies will be taxable to income-tax in the hands of the shareholders only to the extent, if any, to which income-tax has been suffered by the company for the periods out of the profits of which the dividends are payable.</P>
    <P>So much for new mining operations. The Bill is, however, concerned also with Irish companies which are already producing non-bedded minerals and, in so far as production by these companies has commenced within the recent or comparatively recent past, the companies will be granted a measure of relief.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might make some reference to the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 contains the main definitions which are necessary for the interpretation of the Bill.  The type of mine affected by the Bill is one from which non-bedded minerals are obtained.  The Schedule <Col N="76" /> lists 14 such minerals; and the Minister for Finance is being given power to add to the Schedule by Order. &ldquo;Existing mining operations&rdquo; is defined as meaning mining operations which, at any time during the three years ending on the 5th April next, have resulted in the production, on a commercial scale, of such minerals. In fixing that period of three years, I deliberately had regard to the fact that during the emergency it was perhaps necessary first to produce minerals on what I might term an emergency rather than a commercial scale.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;New mining operations&rdquo; are mining operations which (a) are not existing mining operations and (b) are, in the Revenue Commissioners' opinion, substantially distinct and separate from other mining operations.</P>
    <P>New mining operations may be carried out either by, say, companies already engaged in mining or by companies which will be concerned solely with new mining ventures To the extent that new mining operations are carried out upon it, any mine may rank as a &ldquo;qualifying mine&rdquo; under the Bill, that is, qualifying for the main benefits provided.</P>
    <P>There is provision, comparable with the normal provisions for income-tax appeals, for an appeal against an opinion of the Revenue Commissioners as to whether or not mining operations are substantially distinct and separate from any other mining operations.</P>
    <P>Section 2 makes the Bill applicable to the profits of an Irish company from the working of a &ldquo;qualifying mine&rdquo;, where the company commences to trade, in relation to the mine, within the period of three years beginning on the 6th April, 1956.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that, for income-tax purposes, the working of the mine shall be treated as a separate trade, and makes the further technical provision that corporation profits tax which, under the Bill, is not payable, shall be deemed to have been paid.</P>
    <P>Section 4 explains the method of computation of the &ldquo;net income-tax&rdquo;, that is, the income-tax which is to be eligible for relief.  Briefly, this will <Col N="77" /> consist of the income-tax on the mining profits, including the Schedule A tax on property owned and occupied for the purpose of the trade, after reduction of tax on &ldquo;charges&rdquo;, tax which the company can recover by deduction from the chargeants.  Therefore relief will not extend to such part of the profits as is referable to the charges, and the Revenue will accordingly get the full tax on any debenture interest, bond interest, etc. payable by the company.</P>
    <P>Section 5 and 6 define the income-tax relief and corporation profits tax relief respectively to be given in respect of the mining profits.  The &ldquo;net income-tax&rdquo; appropriate to four complete years dating from the commencement of the trade of mining, and one-half of the &ldquo;net income-tax&rdquo; appropriate to the next four complete years, will not be payable and in Section 6 the same general line is followed for corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that, in so far as dividends are paid out of the mining profits of any period as respects which relief is given under the Bill, the tax which the company may deduct from the dividends must be modified by reference to that relief.</P>
    <P>Section 8, 9 and 10 are technical sections, providing for an average rate of tax in computing certain repayments, for the termination of the relief after eight years and for obtaining the information necessary to administer the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11, which deals with existing companies, provides that a resident Irish company working an existing mine may be given relief, computed on the lines laid down in the case of new mining operations; but the relief in any case will extend only to any balance, as at the 6th April next, of a period of eight years reckoned from the date on which the company commenced to work the mine.  No relief will be given for any year or period prior to the 6th April next.  Thus, where a company has begun to work an existing mine on, say, the 6th April, 1952, it may be given relief for a total period of four years from the 6th April, 1956.  For those four years the <Col N="78" /> company may be granted relief to the extent of one-half of the income-tax and corporation profits tax which would otherwise be effectively borne by it.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that there is a provision to meet the case of an Irish company which begins to work a mine abandoned by another such company before the end of the full period for which the outgoing company could have claimed relief under the Bill.  In any such instance, the incoming company will be entitled to claim relief for any balance, reckoned from the date on which it commences to carry on the trade, of the total period for which its predecessor could have claimed relief, had it continued to trade.  It should be appreciated that this provision will apply whether the predecessor company was working an existing mine or was engaged in new mining operations.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to elaborate on the minerals specified in the Schedule to the Bill, but, of course, if any Deputy wishes to have any further details of these minerals or of their commercial uses, I will be happy to try to give the information desired. May I, however, mention that oil is not included, because, first, there is some doubt whether it, strictly speaking, comes within the geological definition of non-bedded ore deposits and, secondly, because I do not think this would be the appropriate form of tax concession, if tax concession were necessary to induce oil exploration or development.  Should it happily arise that there is any prospect of such exploration or development, I will then be prepared to consider if special tax treatment is necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>So much for the Bill.  May I now turn to the amendment in the name of Deputy Lemass and, in doing so, may I say that I do not understand its purpose?  If the Deputy merely wishes to obtain information, I shall, of course, be happy to give him all proper and appropriate information that is desirable.  But I would have thought that if that was his purpose there were other ways in which he could, adequately, have achieved it, such as by parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> In the first place, it should be clearly noted, as I have already explained, that this Bill is of general application. It does not relate to any particular mining property or to any particular mining company.  The company which has been incorporated to take a lease of the Avoca minerals has no better entitlement to the concessions under the Bill than has any other company. To secure any benefit under the Bill, St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Limited, as will any other company, will have to fulfil the terms and conditions that are laid down in it.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the amendment and its wording appear to rest on some presumption that the Government had an obligation to submit to the Dáil proposals in relation to the commercial development of the property at Avoca held under lease by Mianraí Teoranta. The provisions which deal with the making of lease on State minerals are clearly laid down by statute.  The relevant legislation is, as I am sure Deputy Lemass is well aware, since he introduced it and carried it through the Oireachtas, the Minerals Development Act of 1940.  Section 26 of that Act sets out clearly that if, in the opinion of the Minister, it is in the public interest that any State minerals should be granted by way of lease to any person, the Minister may demise such minerals to such person by way of lease for such term as the Minister shall think proper.  The Minister, in that context, is, of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to provide the manner in which the Minister shall exercise the power so given to him and it specifies certain conditions which are to be incorporated in every such lease and, of course, it also provides that the Minister for Finance is to be a party to such lease and shall, therefore, concur in the terms.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Lemass when he was introducing this section in that Bill did so because he realised that it would be quite impossible for commercial negotiations between State Departments and private interests to be brought to a proper conclusion if they were to be conducted in the full <Col N="80" /> glare of publicity before such negotiations were concluded.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I do not suggest that the Dáil should not be given at the appropriate time all the appropriate information.  That too, I may say, was also clearly envisaged by Deputy Lemass when he was introducing that same Bill, for, in Section 77, it is provided that there would be every six months a return of such mineral and prospecting leases laid on the table of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The fundamental weakness of the amendment, therefore, is that the terms of the mining lease have no relevance to the Bill.  The Bill stands on its own legs and should be judged on its own merits as an incentive to new mining enterprise.  At the same time, as I have already said, if the purpose of the amendment is to elicit information then I have no objection to enlarging on the statement made by the Tánaiste some months ago and to making available now the details that will be published in due course as provided in Section 77, and, in addition, giving other information, relevant to such statutory details, as is proper.</P>
    <P>The lease to St. Patrick's Copper Mines, Limited, was executed on the 3rd January, 1956, and demises copper, lead, zinc, pyrites and other minerals in an area of approximately 6,900 acres in County Wicklow.  It is for a term of 21 years from 1st October, 1955, and provides for rights to surrender in certain circumstances together with an option of renewal for a further period of 21 years.</P>
    <P>The company under the lease is bound to do all necessary and proper work for the proper exploration and development of the minerals and for that purpose to expend at least £180,000 or such further sums as the company considers necessary up to £450,000 within a period of one year from 1st October, 1955, or as soon thereafter as may be reasonable.  I might add that both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I were satisfied before the lease was signed that the company had available the necessary finances to enable it to honour this commitment.</P>
    <P>If the result of such exploration and development work so warrants, the <Col N="81" /> company has bound itself by the terms of the lease to build a concentrator of a capacity of 3,000 tons daily on the site and to expend on such erection a sum of approximately £1,500,000 and, further, to install plant and apparatus and to do works for the effective development and exploitation of the said minerals at an approximate cost of £750,000&mdash;these two items, therefore, making a total of £2,250,000.  The company has further bound itself in such working to employ approximately 500 men.</P>
    <P>When the company goes into commercial production, it is bound to recoup in full to the State, subject to a small offset in respect of stamp duty liability, the sum of £542,966.  That sum is the amount expended by Mianraí Teoranta on exploration and development at Avoca up to the 1st October last, as certified for the purposes of the lease by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in his capacity as auditor of the accounts of Mianraí. This amount is to be paid by means of an annual payment of 25 per cent. of operating profits and such payment is to be a first charge on such profits.</P>
    <P>The company is bound during the currency of the lease to pay, in addition, by way of royalty, an annual charge on the operating profits computed at 4 per cent. up to £350,000 and rising to 9 per cent. on profits in excess of £1,750,000.  These percentages which will accrue to the State are likewise a first charge on the profits.</P>
    <P>The company has bound itself to sell the products of the mine at the best price obtainable&mdash;for the ascertainment of which an elaborate formula is included in the lease&mdash;and to bring all the proceeds of sale to credit in the company's Irish bank.  If the working of the deposits becomes unprofitable and a temporary stoppage of commercial working therefore becomes necessary, the company is bound to pay a dead rent of £3,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>There is a further provision in the lease by virtue of which the company is bound to sell to the State, at the option of the Minister at prevailing market prices, up to 50 per cent. of the finished metallic products.  The lease contains a provision that any <Col N="82" /> default of agreement between the parties as to whether the erection of the concentrator is warranted or whether a stoppage of commercial working if such unfortunately occurs, has been justified&mdash;that these points, in particular, and indeed any other points of difference in the interpretation of the lease shall be submitted to an impartial arbitrator.  There are, of course, as well, the usual technical details with which it is, I think, unnecessary to burden the House.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the details that I have given to the House that the agreement made with this company is one of advantage to the country.  We have arranged by this deal that further exploration and development work, which will, undoubtedly, be very costly, will be carried out at no expense to the Exchequer, that it will be carried out expeditiously and efficiently by people experienced in this class of work and I may add that, in doing that, they will be employing more Irish labour than was employed by Mianraí in their exploration and development work.</P>
    <P>If, as we all hope, exploration by the new company shows that subsequent exploitation would be a commercial proposition (in the opinion &mdash;in the last analysis&mdash;of an independent arbitrator) then we will have recovered all the money which, through Mianraí, the State has spent on exploration at Avoca.  We will have obtained a substantial income through the percentage charge in lieu of royalty which I have mentioned; we have provided that we can get 50% of the finished minerals, should we need these minerals, and very substantial employment indeed which has been estimated to reach a figure of about 500 men will be given in the Avoca area.  There will obviously also be the additional subsidiary employment which will be given in transport, etc., arriving out of these activities.</P>
    <P>As I have said this Bill lays down the principles on which the concessions will be given.  They will be given to any company which qualifies within the terms of the Bill.  The amendment appears to me entirely irrelevant to the purpose of the Bill which is to <Col N="83" /> provide in a general way, and not merely for any single mining development, such an inducement as will bring private enterprise into this speculative field.</P>
    <P>If it is successful in doing that and if as a result it is found possible to raise minerals in commercial quantities, I suggest to the Dáil that the increase in our production that will follow, the aid that will be given to our balance of payments problem particularly in respect of our dollar payments and the employment that will be available at home will be all well worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the Dáil declines to give a Second Reading to the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) (Temporary Relief from Taxation) Bill, 1955 until it has received and approved the Government's full proposals for the commercial development of the mineral resources at Avoca, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that the amendment is not quite so irrelevant as the Minister suggested.  Before dealing with the matter to which the amendment refers, there are some observations which I think should be made on the Bill itself.  I agree that a revision of the existing system of taxing the profits of mining undertakings in this State is needed.  I suppose that could be said about the system of taxing industrial profits generally, but it is particularly the case in relation to mining ventures.  The system of taxing the profits of mining concerns here is that taken over from British legislation when this State was established in 1922.  It was not designed and did not operate to encourage or help Irish mineral development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British tax code in its application to the profits of mining concerns has since been very considerably amended and improved, but no corresponding changes were made here. Last year, a British Royal Commission <Col N="84" /> recommended some further easements in their code&mdash;recommendations which, I assume, will be acted upon by the British Government.  Most sensible people will, I feel sure, agree that changes in the taxing system require very careful consideration, particularly changes which are designed to act as economic incentives, first, to ensure that the changes adopted are effective in achieving the economic aims desired, and, secondly, to ensure that they are not such as to result in inequity in the treatment of taxpayers generally.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the provisions of this Bill were not the result of any examination of the system of taxing mining profits best suited to Irish circumstances and most likely to act as incentives to private people to engage in mining operations here.  The Minister has emphasised that this Bill is of general application and has urged that it should be considered not in relation to a particular project, but on its merits, as a measure designed to change tax laws.  That is a childish pretence.  Every Deputy knows that this Bill has resulted from a bargain with one group in relation to a particular undertaking.  There was no detailed consideration of the system of taxation which should exist and there is nothing logical about the changes in the tax code which the Minister is now proposing.  It resulted from protracted negotiations in which one party sought to get as much and the other party sought to give as little as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be that the proposals for changes in the law which have resulted from those negotiations are good, but no one can deny their origin.  Personally, I do not think they are good, and, if this Bill is to be considered on its merits as a tax measure, without reference to Avoca or to any other particular project, then I think it should be rejected.  I make that case even though, as I have already said, I am strongly of the opinion that the system of taxing mining profits here requires revision and that benefit would result from its intelligent revision.  I assume that, when the Canadian interests that are concerned with the Avoca minerals came to the Government to discuss the <Col N="85" /> concessions they needed, they referred to the Canadian system of taxing the profits of mining undertakings.  The Canadian federal tax law has got a logical basis.  It was designed to encourage the investment of capital in the development of Canadian minerals and it was designed intelligently to that end.  The Canadian tax law provides for total exemption from taxation during the first three years of production and then for a very generous depletion allowance equivalent to 33? per cent. of the profits for so long as operations are continued.  There is also a depletion allowance for the benefit of shareholders.  The whole purpose of the scheme of taxation operating there is to encourage the substantial investment of capital by the three years' tax free concession and then to permit of the recovery of the investment in a wasting asset by means of the depletion allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have had before him, as a possible basis for changes here, the Canadian tax position.  I am quite certain that the Canadian interests with whom he was negotiating would have agreed to accepting here the same system of taxation as that to which they were accustomed in Canada.  Instead of that, we get this proposal for four years' total exemption from taxation and four years during which the tax charge will be reduced by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, on the face of it, that system of taxing the profits of mining undertakings here appears to be designed to encourage the very type of development which is least desirable in our circumstances, designed to encourage raids upon Irish mineral resources by foreign financial interests with the idea of getting as much profit out of their operations as quickly as possible and then clearing out.</P>
    <P>On the merits of these proposals as a system of taxation, I would urge their rejection by the Dáil.  I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of taking back this Bill and so changing it that the tax concession will operate so long as production continues and will be framed so as to relate the concession to the volume of production. I am quite certain, and I say this with some reason, that the introduction <Col N="86" /> into our tax law of the more logical provisions of the Canadian tax code would be as attractive to the interests that are concerned with Avoca as the proposals of this Bill.  Apart altogether from the merits of these proposals or the contrasting merits of the Canadian federal tax arrangements, I would urge on the Minister&mdash; I would urge on the Government and on the Dáil&mdash;that changes of the law of this kind should be made after examination of Irish conditions generally, without reference to their reaction upon individual enterprises, made on their merits and not as a result of bargains with particular groups.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, no Irish interests at present engaged in mining operations here, or likely ever to become engaged in mining operations here, were consulted about the provisions of this Bill.  In so far as anyone outside the Government service was consulted about this Bill, it was the Canadian groups interested in Avoca only.  I am quite certain that if the Minister had taken the obvious step when he was proposing to make these changes of bringing into consultation Irish interests which may be affected by them, he would have produced a different Bill here.</P>
    <P>May I say&mdash;because I believe it to be true&mdash;that the alteration of the terms of this Bill on the lines I have indicated would not delay and certainly need not delay the exploration and development work now proceeding at Avoca by a single day?  Even if it is true that the bargain which has been made with the Canadian interests at Avoca must stand&mdash;that these tax arrangements must apply to them&mdash;I would urge that the general law which is to apply to all other mining concerns in this country or to any new concerns which may commence operating here should not be on this basis but should be more intelligently drafted on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the giving of these tax concessions only to companies which mine what are called here &ldquo;non-bedded&rdquo; minerals.  Why should this Bill not apply to coal-mining?  In the course of his remarks, the Minister said that the risk of working bedded <Col N="87" /> deposits&mdash;and, for practical purposes, when we use that term we mean coal&mdash; can be assessed more readily than the risks of working non-bedded deposits and that the extraction of these bedded deposits is a normal commercial operation. Whoever prepared the Minister's brief took that, no doubt, from some text-book published abroad, because it is not true so far as Irish conditions are concerned.  If the Minister had consulted the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce alone&mdash;apart altogether from commercial interests engaged in coal-mining operations here&mdash;he would have found out that, whatever may be true of coal-mining in other countries, the risks of coal-mining here&mdash;the risks of seams petering out, of having to incur a great deal of non-productive expenditure&mdash;are just as considerable if not more considerable than in the case of these non-bedded minerals.</P>
    <P>In my view, there is a far more urgent need to encourage the exploration of our coal measures and to facilitate new coal-mining ventures than there is to encourage activities in relation to the non-bedded minerals. This country is, I think, likely to face a fuel crisis in the very near future. Only a couple of weeks ago the British fuel authorities were forecasting a fuel crisis in Britain&mdash;inability to produce from their own resources enough fuel to keep their industrial activities at their present level.  They foresaw the possibility of nuclear power being available for industrial purposes but they pointed out that long before nuclear power would be available to them in sufficient volume, the fuel crisis&mdash;and that was the term they used &mdash;would have developed.  If that estimate of the position in Britain by the British fuel authorities is accurate, then we here are facing a crisis of greater magnitude than theirs.</P>
    <P>We are dependent very largely upon Britain for our supplies of solid fuel, and as soon as their crisis develops, it is possible that they will try to meet it by curtailing coal shipments abroad. As the House knows, we have not yet taken any positive measures to develop nuclear power for industrial purposes <Col N="88" /> here.  There are advantages also in encouraging mining activities for the winning of coal that do not exist in the case of other types of mining activities.  The whole of the product of the Irish coal mines is consumable within the country.  I have said that it is now, and certainly will in the future, be needed within the country.  The product of these other mines, these non-bedded mineral mines, will be exported from this country in a raw or semi-raw state, and apart from the immediate employment given in the winning of them, they will confer no other benefit on this country, particularly if they should be developed entirely by foreign capital for the profit of foreign shareholders.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Minister for the exclusion of coal mining from the Bill will not stand examination.  The risks of coal mining in this country are not less than the risks of any other kind of mining.  Must we wait until some foreign interest has concerned itself about the possibility of exploring and developing the coal resources of this country before the benefit of the Bill will be extended to those operations? I am glad that the Government changed its mind about the extension of these tax concessions to existing undertakings.  I had indicated here before the Christmas adjournment that the original intention of the Government to confine the concessions to new mining operations could not be justified. Whatever bargains were made with the Canadian interests concerned with Avoca cannot and should not allow us to be led into a position in which the tax code operates unfairly in respect of other interests.  The change of mind which the Government had is therefore welcome.</P>
    <P>I move this amendment because I think that the main matter to be discussed on this Bill is the arrangement which the Government has made for the commercial working of the Avoca minerals.  It is fully understood, I am sure, by every Deputy that this Bill is just a part of those arrangements, and is before the House at all because the negotiations which were undertaken resulted in an understanding <Col N="89" /> that these changes in our tax law would be made.  I feel that the Dáil should get the whole story.  I reject completely the Minister's contention that the Dáil is not entitled to be told in a very special manner the arrangement regarding Avoca&mdash;the leasing of minerals there to these Canadian interests stands in an entirely different light from the normal granting of leases for State minerals which is proceeding year in and year out.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;considerable information on the arrangements regarding Avoca not previously available to the public or members of the Dáil.  I want to comment on those details.  Some of them I learned to-day for the first time, and I may have something further to say later about them, but so far as the picture has been given to us of the position that will exist there, I have something to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> First of all, it is desirable that the House and the public should be reminded of the background of this development.  So far as this debate is concerned, the history of this Avoca development can be regarded as having started in 1947, with the introduction of the Minerals Development Act of that year.  Mianraí Teoranta, the State organisation responsible for mineral exploration activity, had been operating in Avoca before that, mainly for the purpose of producing the sulphur required by our fertiliser industry during the war years.  In 1947, I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, came here with that Bill, one of the main provisions of which was to provide a sum of £85,000 a year for seven years to enable Mianraí Teoranta to carry out mineral exploration activity, it being understood that its main effort would be concentrated in the Avoca district.  That sum was provided in 1947 and the work of exploring, by tunnelling and otherwise, the minerals in the Avoca area began.</P>
    <P>The second stage came after the change of Government in 1948, with the advent to office of the first Coalition, when that work stopped.  The Minister for Finance in the first Coalition, Deputy McGilligan, came to the Dáil to make his first Budget Statement on the 4th May, 1948 and in that Budget Statement he said&mdash;I am quoting his exact words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The scheme for exploration of mineral deposits, for which £85,000 is provided in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, will not be proceeded with....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every member of the Coalition Government of that day concurred in that decision.  At a recent dinner of the Wicklow Chamber of Commerce, the present Minister for Justice, who is sitting opposite me, is reported in the <i>Wicklow People</i> as having described the commercial development at Avoca as&mdash;and these are his words&mdash;&ldquo;the fruition of many years of hard work and earnest faith in the development of the Avoca mines.&rdquo;  So far as the first Coalition was concerned, the Government in which Deputy Everett was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, they had no faith whatever in <Col N="91" /> the possibilities of Avoca, and their decision was that there should be no work there.  That decision I know was taken initially by the then Minister for Finance, now Deputy McGilligan.  He communicated the decision to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey. Deputy Morrissey, as Minister, acted on that decision without consulting with the Board of Mianraí Teoranta, without making any investigations on the spot as to the potentialities of Avoca, without even opening the departmental file regarding the deposits there.</P>
    <P>However, the decision was one which produced some political difficulties for that Government and because of its political repercussions they were forced subsequently to reconsider it.  A conference was held&mdash;not in the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;but in the Department of the Taoiseach and under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach, and as the outcome of that conference the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Morrissey, was instructed to announce in the debate on the Estimate for that Department in July, 1948, that the Government was reconsidering the matter, as he said, &ldquo;in the light of additional information recently obtained&rdquo;.  There was no additional information obtained or even sought in the interval.  He said also that he expected that a decision would be taken in the near future.  It was not taken in the near future: it was taken one full year after that statement by Deputy Morrissey had been made here in the House, and it was not until July of 1949 that it was agreed that development and exploration work at Avoca should be resumed on a limited scale.  Even then that decision was not acted upon.  Even then the Minister for Finance, now Deputy McGilligan, succeeded in holding up the implementation of that decision for a further three months. It was not until September, 1949, that exploration work was resumed.</P>
    <P>That is the history of the Coalition Government's &ldquo;earnest faith&rdquo; in the commercial development of the Avoca minerals.  However, exploration work <Col N="92" /> was resumed.  It was accelerated during 1953 although some flooding difficulties were encountered in the workings and extended to include diamond drilling in the surrounding area and by the beginning of 1954 it was obvivous that a stage had been reached at which decisions on future commercial development had to be taken.  In February, 1954, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I formally asked the Board of Mianraí Teoranta to submit its proposals for the commercial working of the deposits.  Then came another change of Government and the present Government and the present Minister for Industry and Commerce became responsible for these matters.</P>
    <P>What happened after that I do not know.  I have been able to make certain assumptions from published statements and replies to Dáil questions but the full information is not available to me.  I know that the Board of Mianraí Teoranta advertised these mines in a number of foreign newspapers. I do not know if any effort was made to promote the formation of an Irish company to develop the deposits commercially or if any consideration was given to the practicability of developing these minerals as a State enterprise either by Mianraí Teoranta or by some other company set up for that purpose, or by State enterprise in partnership with Irish private commercial concerns.</P>
    <P>So far as I have been able to find out, no attempt was made to consider or explore the possibility of the development of these Avoca minerals by an Irish undertaking.  There were discussions with a number of foreign companies. Quite a number of concerns in other countries which noted the advertisement to which I have referred indicated an interest in the deposits and discussed the possibility of their participating in their development with the Board of Mianraí Teoranta and with the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Finally, some Canadian groups appeared upon the scene&mdash;I used the term &ldquo;groups&rdquo; deliberately because, so far as I have been able to discover, there was more than one group even though those two <Col N="93" /> groups may now have amalgamated their interests.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the other foreign companies that showed an interest in the development of these minerals were made aware that the Government was prepared to grant the tax concessions provided in this Bill. I do not think they were.  As I said, these concessions resulted from the negotiations which proceeded with the Canadian interests after it had been decided that the Canadian interests should have preference over the other foreign interests that had come forward. Finally, it was announced on the 15th September of last year by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the Government had decided to lease these minerals to the Canadian group.  The Canadian concern which is financing this undertaking is, I believe, the Mogul Mining Corporation of Toronto.</P>
    <P>I think I should make it quite clear that I am not criticising in the slightest degree the technical competence or financial standing of these Canadian interests.  They are clearly in a position to finance and develop the minerals. The Mogul Mining Corporation owns or controls a variety of mining properties in Canada.  Indeed I would say that if it was established that some foreign interest had to be associated with the development of Avoca I would just as soon have Canadian as any other.</P>
    <P>The details of the arrangement have been given to us here to-day by the Minister.  The minerals are to be leased to the Irish subsidiary of this Mogul Mining Corporation for 21 years with the option of renewal.  There is to be no tonnage royalty but the company is to pay from profits certain percentages to the Government.  I understood the Minister to say that these payments in lieu of royalties will amount to 4 per cent. of the profits if the profits are under £350,000 and 9 per cent. of the profits if the profits are over £1,750,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on a graduated scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the company is to invest in the undertaking approximately £2,250,000, <Col N="94" /> that they are planning to carry on operations at Avoca on a scale which will mean the mining of rock at a rate of 3,000 tons a day or 1,000,000 tons a year, that the operation will include the crushing of that rock, and its concentration by a flotation process, the concentrates to be exported for smelting elsewhere.  I assume they will be exported to Canada, where this Mogul Mining Corporation controls a large smelting works scheduled, I understand, to commence operations next year.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to put certain figures before the Dáil so that it will appreciate the magnitude of the operations which are involved here and the substantial sums of money that have to be taken into account before we turn to consider the question whether the method decided upon by the Government for the commercial working of these minerals is the best in the national interest.</P>
      <P>According to statistics which were published in Canada by the Mogul Mining Corporation in the newspapers there in connection with the share issues which they were planning, the Avoca rock averages about 1.12 per cent. copper, .16 per cent. lead, .053 per cent. zinc and 8.1 per cent. sulphur. In a statement published in the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i> on the 17th September, 1955, at the instance of this Mogul Mining Corporation, it was estimated that the whole operation will break even so far as the Mogul Mining Corporation is concerned with copper selling at 30 cents. per pound, that is, £240 per ton.</P>
      <P>I am not clear, I confess, as to the basis on which they calculated their operation costs.  I do not know, for example, whether the yield from the sales of the lead and zinc concentrates or the sulphur are being put against operating costs or whether that yield will be additional to whatever may be obtained from copper, but I assume that sales of lead, zinc and sulphur concentrates represent a possible additional revenue to the undertaking.  The whole economics of the operation is based upon copper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several times, as Minister, when discussing the possibilities of the commercial <Col N="95" /> development of Avoca, I made it clear that it depended completely upon the output of copper from the mineralised rock being sufficient to sustain the operation.  If the company achieves its target of producing 1,000,000 tons of rock per year, averaging 1.12 per cent. copper, there are theoretically 11,200 tons of copper. I understand that the process of extracting copper from the rock is not efficient enough to give 100 per cent. extraction and that an 80 per cent. extraction of the mineral is all that can be relied upon and that, therefore, the yield of copper from the operation is, shall we say, likely to be around 9,000 tons per year, and with copper selling at £240 per ton, the whole operation, so far as the Mogul Mining Corporation is concerned, will break even.  That is to say, the costs involved are clearly round £2,000,000 per year of which, on my calculation, about 10 per cent. will represent wages paid to workers at Avoca.</P>
    <P>For some time past the price of copper has been fluctuating between £390 and £400 per ton.  The price yesterday was £397 per ton.  If, therefore, Mogul Mining Corporation are correct in their estimate that these operations will break level with copper selling at £240 per ton, then it is clear that at present prices, assuming that these prices are maintained and that their output is at the rate of 3,000 tons per day as they are planning, the profits they will make will be somewhere between £1,300,000 and £1,400,000 per year tax free under this Bill.  In addition to the profits which they can hope to earn at the present price of copper, there will also be profits coming in from the sale of the lead, zinc and sulphur concentrates.</P>
    <P>A statement was published in the newspapers last week to the effect that the Silvermines Company which is doing a somewhat similar operation in County Tipperary sold its lead concentrates last year at an average price of £69 per ton.  The first question one must ask oneself is whether the price is likely to hold or what are the prospects of the price of copper slumping again as it did at various times before the war.  Nobody can, of course, <Col N="96" /> attempt to forecast what the future trend will be but there was published last week a review of non-ferrous metal prices by the British Metal Corporation. In that review it was emphasised that the demand for copper was rising, that shortage which was the basic element in the copper position and that the overall demand for copper had been underrated.  The other trade journals made similar forecasts and all the indications are that the price of copper is likely to remain high and that profits of the order I have indicated are likely to be earned by this concern.  The Mogul Mining Company we are told are investing in Avoca £2,000,000 or £2,500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever they are investing, they can hope to get with the scale of operations they are planning and the present price of copper not less than £5,000,000 in profits during the four years that they will be operating free of tax.  In other words, they can recover their total investment in the undertaking and, nevertheless, have a very substantial profit to show at the end of four years and the prospect of further profitable working in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Present indications are that the total supply of mineralised rock at Avoca is about 13,000,000 tons.  It is possible, and perhaps even probable, that the rock tonnage is larger than that but the Mogul Mining Corporation are <Col N="97" /> basing their plans on the assumption, according to the statements they published in Canada, that there are 13,000,000 tons of workable rock at Avoca.  They, therefore, can hope that by the time they have worked out the whole of the 13,000,000 ton deposit they will have extracted profits from the operation of round about £10,000,000, £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 in the aggregate; and that is after being taxed at the half rate during the second four years of operation and taxed at the full rate during the remaining five.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the agreement with the Mogul Mining Corporation provides for the assessment of the value of the Avoca products, so that the profits earned there will be credited to the St. Patrick's Mines, Ltd., the subsidiary of Mogul which will actually operate at Avoca.  That was no doubt a necessary safeguard. The whole of the money required for this operation is being raised in Canada.  There is no Government participation in the financing of the undertaking, and apparently no opportunity to private Irish investors to invest in the company is intended.</P>
    <P>The first action taken by the Mogul Mining Corporation, according to a statement published in this newspaper from which I have already quoted, the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail</i>, was to issue £3,500,000 in debentures; so highly are the profit prospects of this Avoca operation assessed in Canada that, according to this newspaper, the issue was&mdash;these are the words they used&mdash;&ldquo;over subscribed almost before the books opened to receive subscriptions&rdquo;. There was a subsequent reference in the <i>Financial Times</i> to an application made by the Mogul Mining Corporation to the Stock Exchange Committee at Toronto for a quotation for 5,000,000 $1 shares and that application was granted by the Toronto Exchange authorities.  It would appear from these announcements that the Mogul Mining Corporation is raising $8,500,000 from the Canadian public for investment in this undertaking.  In view of the indication given by the Minister of the total investment contemplated, it is not clear to what extent they are risking their own resources in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Now, the main question that arises here is, of course, the desirability of planning the development of these resources at Avoca in this particular way.  I do not want to debate at the moment, although it might relevantly be done, the main principles involved in the policy of attracting or inviting foreign capital into Irish developments. There are some obvious advantages and some obvious disadvantages in that course; but in my view each case has to be considered on its merits and, while it might be possible to lay down some general principles that would govern a decision, it would be unwise to tie oneself up by rules of thumb in a way that might prevent a particular proposal being considered in all its aspects.  The advantages of bringing in foreign capital for Irish industrial development are that it is likely to bring with it technical knowledge, information about production and marketing methods, skilled personnel, skilled executives and skilled technicians, and contact with international markets which Irish concerns might not easily establish.  These are, I think, the main advantages in inviting foreign capital into Irish development if we assume that there is no financial problem, that there is a choice and that the capital required for development is available from internal sources, or external sources, as we decide.</P>
    <P>But the disadvantages are considerable. In the first place the bringing-in of foreign capital means the sending-out of the country of the profits resulting from these operations and, as I see it, the main impediment to Irish economic progress at the present time is the fact that Irish industry and Irish agriculture between them are not now generating enough new capital to give our economy the buoyancy it requires; and we are not solving, or helping in the slightest to solve, that problem by allowing our development to be financed by foreign capital involving the transfer of the total profits to foreign shareholders.  It is reasonable to assume that foreign financial interests coming into this country will be concerned only with the prospect of profits here.  Should the prospect of profit peter out, should the profit prove to <Col N="99" /> be non-existent or unduly low, or should changing circumstances at any time make it impossible to continue to earn profits, then these people will get out again at once without any concern about the employment problems or the social problems they may leave behind them.  An Irish company directed by Irish nationals, who will have to continue living in this country whether the enterprise succeeds or fails, and continue meeting those who may have suffered by the failure of their enterprise, is far more likely to fight to keep the enterprise going over bad times, far more likely to endeavour to help it over a temporary slump and thereby give it a chance of survival.</P>
    <P>Finally, in so far as we decide to rely upon skilled foreign executives and technicians for our industrial development, then the chance of training our own people in these spheres, of giving them the knowledge and the technical competence which might lead to subsequent development, is reduced. Our experience has been that foreign-owned concerns operating here employ foreigners almost exclusively in their top executive posts and there is a limit beyond which no Irish employee will be promoted.  I do not want to mention any particular companies by name but I am sure no Deputy will have any difficulty finding out for himself that that is so in regard to some major industrial concerns here which are financed entirely by foreign capital.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not want to debate that general issue, but I do want to relate the advantages and disadvantages of using foreign capital for Irish development to the particular project which is under discussion, namely, the project of Avoca mineral development. The question I want to put to the Dáil is whether it was necessary that this Avoca development should be initiated under Canadian auspices and with the aid of Canadian finance and Canadian technical help or could it have been done in any other way which would have conferred greater ultimate benefit on this country?</P>
    <P>So far as finance is concerned, I do not think it would have been impossible to have raised here the money <Col N="100" /> required for the development of Avoca on the scale contemplated by the Canadian company.  I know that a mining venture of that kind would be regarded as a risky investment but, upon the basis of the information I have given here concerning the present strength of the copper market and the practicability of producing ore containing minerals in the percentages I have indicated at Avoca at the rate of 1,000,000 tons per year, together with these tax concessions now proposed in this Bill thrown in, there is no reason to think that that money could not have been raised; or, if there was a temporary reluctance on the part of Irish investors to subscribe the whole of it, then the answer is that the Industrial Credit Company was set up precisely to deal with that type of situation.  The answer is that the Industrial Credit Company was set up precisely to deal with that type of situation by investing in the shares of such an undertaking until public confidence in its future had been established when the shares could be sold to private investors on the stock market.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an expert in these matters of mining, but the inquiries I have made in relation to Avoca have not convinced me that any exceptional technical problem is involved, once the planning of the operation has been settled.  The plan for the actual working of the mine, the taking of the rock from underground and the location and design of the crushing and floatation plants are the important parts of the development and, after that, the remainder is largely routine. I understand that it is the intention of the Canadian company, at that stage, to use local personnel very largely to direct these routine operations.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to think that an Irish company, charged with the development of these minerals, could not have obtained, in the ordinary way of commercial operation, the technical advice needed from a firm of consulting engineers in Britain, Canada, the United States or any other part of the world.  There was, then, as I see it, no special problem in finance, and <Col N="101" /> there was no technical problem that could not have been solved.</P>
    <P>It may be that there is a marketing problem.  I do not know.  The conclusion to be taken from the quotations I have given from technical papers as to the strength of the copper market would seem to suggest that there would be no difficulty in disposing of the concentrates from Avoca to smelting companies at a known world price.  I understand that the intention of the Canadian company is that the copper concentrates from Avoca will be exported to Canada to the mills of the Mogul-controlled Smelting Company and will constitute about 25 per cent. of the ore going into their smelting works.  It is not one of the least of the advantages of the whole operation to the Mogul Mining Company that it will operate to give them an assurance of these supplies.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when it is proposed to bring in foreign capital to develop an Irish resource like the Avoca minerals the onus of proof that such is the only or the best way the development can be carried out rests on those who propose it.  Is there no other practical alternative method?  I think there is and I think that any one of the alternative courses that might be suggested would have conferred substantial additional benefits on this country from the development of Avoca.  So far as I am concerned, the commercial development of the Avoca minerals on an adequate scale was foremost in my mind in 1947 when I asked the Dáil to agree to provide £85,000 a year for exploratory work.  My belief is that any company with adequate finance could get the technical advice necessary to develop these minerals on a substantial scale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of it. I was aware that the Board of Mianraí Teoranta was advertising these mines but I did not know what measures the Minister was taking to explore the possibility of development.  I did not <Col N="102" /> feel it desirable that I should act as a promoter of a private group for that purpose.  I was convinced that proposals would come for development by a State company or by a State company allied in some way to private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The only criticism of the 1947 Act that I can recollect came from the Labour Party in the Dáil and Seanad. They objected to the proposal that the ultimate outcome should be commercial development by private interests.  The Minister can verify that by looking up the debate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The 1947 Act dealt with the Slievardagh Coal Mines as well and I had indicated my intention of offering that enterprise for sale to private interests but there was no critical word spoken, either here or in the Seanad, except by members of the Labour Party who objected to the general principle that mine development should be conducted through private enterprise.  My recollection of the nature of that debate had convinced me that the likelihood was that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce would come to the House with a proposition for development by a State company or by a State company in some way connected with an experienced private concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that that is what should be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I must say that I have no great confidence in State enterprise, particularly as regards mining operations.  The experience we had in Slievardagh convinced me that there are substantial reasons why a State undertaking cannot get the best results out of mining operations.  But that is not the only alternative.  I think that there are interests in this country, not without experience in mining, which could obtain the necessary money and technical advice to develop these Avoca minerals.  I do not think that they would come forward on their own.  If there was a desire on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to secure the development of the Avoca minerals by an Irish group, such a group could be got together.  It might have necessitated <Col N="103" /> some underwriting of capital commitments for a time and it might have required the same tax concessions that the Canadian interests have secured.</P>
      <P>That possibility must still surely be there.  If the development of Avoca by the Mogul Mining Corporation involved the commitment in that undertaking of Mogul Mining Corporation funds and nothing else, then one could understand their reluctance to let anyone else in.  But that is not the position.  This Canadian company, the Mogul Mining Corporation is, so far as one can find out, not involving only its own resources in Avoca.  It has gone to the Canadian stock market, to the Canadian public and sought subscriptions of the capital and got the subscriptions of the capital from Canadian private investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did they object to offering any part of the stock here?  Do they object now to putting any proportion of the stock in the St. Patrick's Mines, Limited, on the Irish stock market for Irish investors to take if they want to take it?  I find it hard to believe that they do.  Was the proposition put to them? Could it not be put to them now?  If the Government has so committed itself to them that their lease of the mine must stand, is it not possible to discuss with them, not as part of a bargain but as an arrangement which any foreign company would be wise to make, to associate Irish interests with their undertaking by inviting investment from private individuals here. The advantage to this country is that we would then have an assurance that there would not be a quick flitting out of Avoca, regardless of the social consequences of quitting there, if the profits should diminish or if the corporation should find it could use its resources more profitably in some other part of the world.  Tying in Irish interests would guarantee some continuity in Avoca, guarantee that some effort would be made to keep it going if times became difficult, and would help to ensure that out of these operations there would be an addition to Irish resources available for further investment in productive activities here.  The employment, all the advantages <Col N="104" /> that the Minister mentioned as being involved in this development, will be the same no matter who does it.  They will certainly be the same whether the capital is provided from Irish sources or from Canadian sources.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why these 5,000,000 dollar shares should be offered exclusively on the Canadian stock exchange?  If there is I am not aware of it.  If there is a reason, can we be told it?</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if the Mogul Mining Corporation is insisting that the whole of the investment in Avoca must be made by them, the whole of the profits to be earned at Avoca must redound to their benefit, then is it not possible to impose a condition that some part of these profits in excess of a certain agreed figure per year will be reinvested in this country?  That is not an unusual arrangement around the world.  Even the British Government, until recently at any rate, imposed an obligation upon American film companies that the profit earned from the showing of their films in England should, in part, be held in England for investment there.</P>
    <P>Could we not consider the possibility of imposing a similar condition upon these Canadian interests?  Is it not important in this instance that we should start off on the right foot?  If there is any prospect of substantial external investment in this country, should we not now make up our minds as to the conditions we will seek when inviting that investment?  It is probable, with the present price of copper, that there is a number of Irish mineralised areas now capable of profitable working which could not have been worked a couple of years ago at the price then prevailing.</P>
    <P>The interest which is now being shown in certain mineral resources in parts of the country is a consequence of the improvement in the non-ferrous metal market.  The substantial rise in price recorded last year&mdash;and the prospect is that this high price will continue and even go higher&mdash;will bring other interests in to put up proposals for financing mineral development here.  Should we not consider the possibility <Col N="105" /> of using that situation to greater national advantage than is being attempted at Avoca?  Can we not, at least, make it a condition that a certain proportion of the profits from this undertaking must be reinvested in this country, even though reinvested for the benefit of the foreign interests that started the operations?</P>
    <P>I do not know if these matters were considered by the Government.  I do not think they were and that is what I am concerned about in regard to the introduction of this Bill.  In fact, I am certain the origin of this Bill was a round-table discussion leading to a bargain with this one Canadian group. The Minister attempted to generalise the proposals because the Bill had to be of general application but behind this Bill there was no consideration of what is good policy for the country, what is likely to be of greatest benefit. There was merely the question of fulfilling to the letter the contract entered into with the Mogul Mining Corporation.</P>
    <P>We have not got many prospects in this country of establishing concerns capable of generating profits on the scale which may arise in Avoca.  A sum of £10,000,000, £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 is a big sum for this country, a big sum of money to contemplate being paid out, from the using up of Irish resources, to the Mogul Mining Corporation shareholders in Toronto. If we could possibly keep it here, if we could devise a method by which these minerals would be worked by a State organisation on a non-profit-making basis, providing funds year after year for investment in other Irish industrial possibilities, think of the enormous benefits that would accrue to this country.  If these ideas ever entered the mind of the Government, let them tell us why they rejected them.  Let them tell us why they are keeping to this one line, leasing these minerals to a foreign concern and allowing them to take out all the profit. If they can show there was good reason against any course other than the one they adopted, if they can convince the House they have considered every other course, let them say so.  I do not believe they did.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge on the <Col N="106" /> Government&mdash;I do not think it need involve any delay in Avoca&mdash;to take back this Bill for reconsideration.  I have no objection whatever to linking up this Canadian group with whatever plans are made in Avoca.  I think that, in view of the arrangement already made with them, they cannot now be excluded but I do think it is possible to get with them an arrangement which would be satisfactory to them and far more beneficial to the country than that which the Minister has outlined this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene for a few moments in connection with the Avoca project which has come before the House.  I must confess straight away I have little or no knowledge of mining.  I am more concerned, in the few words I have to say, with the general question of the development of industries or mining resources that we have and the means by which that development takes place. I am astounded at the disclosures that have been made in this House in connection with the Avoca Mining project.  It would seem to me as though this country is looked upon as something like the undeveloped countries in the Middle East&mdash;Iran, Iraq and these other places&mdash;where you have large foreign concerns prepared to explore mineral resources, mainly oil resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is that the natives of those countries are not capable of exploring mineral deposits.  Yet, despite the fact that they lack the business knowledge, know-how and technical experience of well-developed countries, these undeloped countries have insisted that whatever foreign concern was allowed the right to develop the resources would plough back 50 per cent. of their profits in other undertakings in those undeveloped countries.  The various <Col N="107" /> sultans in these backward areas have ensured that foreign concerns will not in any circumstances be allowed to take out more than 50 per cent. of the proved profits accruing from development work.  That is as far as oil is concerned.</P>
    <P>Here we have mineral deposits. Copper as it exists in County Wicklow is the subject under discussion at the moment.  I am subject to correction, but, as far as I can gather, we have now decided that a Canadian company will be allowed to operate here; they will put up all the capital; they will give a certain amount of employment in Ireland; they will be allowed to dig, mine and extract all the copper they need; they will send the copper to their smelting organisations in Canada and that raw material will be processed and utilised for the benefit of Canada.  The only benefit to this country will be the employment given to the ordinary Irish worker and, perhaps, to a limited number of technicians. Irish people will again be hewers of wood and drawers of water for foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>I am completely against inviting outside capitalists to this country, if they are to be given complete control of whatever industry they establish here. One might as well sell the country field by field to foreign nations and allow our people to get work in Ireland as do what is being done under this Bill.  The only argument that can be put forward and that will be used as the big stick&mdash;it will be used, probably, to criticise me for the remarks I am making&mdash;is that it creates employment in Ireland.  The trouble now is that everybody in this House is so anxious &mdash;rightly so&mdash;to give employment and to end emigration, that he is prepared to take the most desperate steps to do so, but there is such a thing as taking steps that will make the position, or could make the position, far worse in ten or 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>If the type of development takes place that outside capital and outside directors have complete control of industry, there is nothing in the world to prevent their packing up any time they like.  If that happens, they will <Col N="108" /> leave behind them a situation in which unemployment will be far worse than it was before they came.</P>
    <P>There are people on both sides of the House who have discovered by experience that in the development of mineral resources, coal mines and so forth, State enterprise and State controlled bodies are not the most suitable and do not get the best results. The idea is that the initial exploration should be carried out with State funds, but that the actual mining operations and practical working should be handed over to private enterprise. If that is the view, I suggest that it is not being carried out in this particular operation.  In this case, the part taken by private enterprise has been handed over completely to a foreign company.  I am not criticising that company as such or as to its financial soundness or technical knowledge. Deputy Lemass has pointed out that this Canadian company has offered shares to the extent of 5,000,000 dollars on the Canadian stock market to the ordinary residents of Canada.  Canadians are being asked to invest their dollars in Ireland so that they will reap profit out of the extraction of copper in Avoca.  If that statement of Deputy Lemass's is correct, it means that this development company in Canada is not utilising its own financial resources, but is appealing to the Canadian public to come in on a good thing.  The Canadians, evidently, are no fools, for, it is suggested, the issue was oversubscribed before opening.</P>
    <P>I will go this far with the Minister&mdash; if it is possible at this stage for him to make a further arrangement with this company, if they are prepared, as they seem to be, to seek capital outside their own resources, at least 50 per cent. of the capital required in the form of shares should be offered to the Irish people first and every Irish citizen should have the chance to invest his few pounds in a development in his own country.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years, we have seen our financial resources being invested in Britain in various securities, and so forth.  Here we have the peculiar arrangement of Canadians tripping <Col N="109" /> over each other to try to invest money in Ireland.  If it is not too late, the suggestion I have made should be adopted by the Government, and they should ensure that at least 50 per cent. of the shares that have been offered on the Canadian stock market should be made available in Ireland to enable the ordinary Irish citizen to invest in this enterprise.  If the Canadian man-in-the-street who is many thousands of miles from here considers that it is a fair proposition to invest his money, about which he thinks as much as any Irishman, in County Wicklow, surely there are thousands of Irish people who have just as much sense and who would do the same thing if given the opportunity.</P>

Is he opposing this effort to give employment? Fianna Fáil passed here the Undeveloped Areas Act, under which a foreigner could come in, go to the Gaeltacht to establish industries and be given better concessions than any of the local people.  Deputy McQuillan now says that the Wicklow mines are being used as a means to keep some Deputies in their seats.  By passing the Undeveloped Areas Act, Fianna <Col N="110" /> Fáil were making an effort to gain back the seats they had lost.  In Enniscorthy, from which I come, £50,000 of local capital was subscribed for the establishment of an industry but they got no concessions.  Under the Act passed by Fianna Fáil, foreign industrialists got numerous concessions. That is the real position; that is what is being done in Galway, Sligo and Castlebar.  We read in the papers every day where industries are being started.</P>

We hear the cry from the other side about emigration and unemployment.  Are Deputy Lemass and Deputy McQuillan helping to solve these problems by opposing this Bill? What these people do is to talk about emigration one day and oppose a measure to fight it the next.  I wonder <Col N="111" /> if the ex-Taoiseach agrees with Deputy Lemass; I wonder if they were in power now would they take the same opportunity to get the Canadians to develop these mines?  For 20 years Deputy Lemass sat on this side of the House as Minister and he did not look for the Canadians or the Americans to come over here and undertake this type of development.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that one must have experienced men to start work of this kind.  Every factory set up in this country had foreigners at the beginning&mdash;the leather factories and the sugar factories.

When something is done for the betterment of County Wicklow or any other county, shouts of abuse are hurled by Deputies on the opposite side to try to prevent people from coming in here to help develop the country and its resources.  They are trying to kill this thing in the same way as they tried to kill the sugar factory.

When the Opposition were in power their policy was to encourage industry, to bring in foreign capital to finance it and, on many occasions, foreign firms to run these concerns&mdash;sometimes, perhaps, not with the happiest results.  Nevertheless, it was a policy carried out by successive Irish Governments and, in the main, it has contributed largely to the industrial and commercial development of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the question of developing mines in County Wicklow the position is that the present Government has permitted a Canadian company to come here and engage in this undertaking.  I think it is very wrong <Col N="113" /> of the Opposition to question the possible profits, and so forth, which may be made by that company.  We all hope that that concern will be worked profitably because, if it is worked profitably, it will be to the benefit of this country as well as of the concessionaire company.</P>
    <P>We cannot have our cake and eat it. We cannot have mineral development in this country without putting down the capital ourselves or else inviting somebody to come in and do so.  We must do one of two things.  We must spend the money ourselves or permit somebody else to come in and run the risk as well as take the profit, because, no matter what anybody may say about mining, there is always an element of risk connected with it.  We in this country have not got any firm capable of carrying out large-scale mining development.  If there is such a firm I should be very glad to hear of it: I am not aware of any such firm. As a Government, we would have to get some of our civil servants or call in outside experts to set up a company and run it, without having either the technical or mining know-how to do it. Therefore, I think all sensible people in this country will welcome this development.  This is on the lines of bringing in outside capital to help this country to develop its natural resources.  At the same time, we must allow those people to have the profits to which their skill and their energy and their knowledge entitle them.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that in this building &mdash;above all, in Ireland&mdash;there should be people who would stand up and speak against a project which is endeavouring to carry out what is the life-long dream of many people, namely, the development of the natural mineral resources of this country.</P>

      <P>I must say I think it is a scandalous statement by Deputy Dockrell that anybody on this side of the House has spoken against the development of minerals in Avoca or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;against the project <Col N="114" /> of developing minerals.  The Deputy and his pal, Deputy O'Leary from Wexford, were on the same note.  We are not to be allowed to discuss here a proposition which has business, financial and social consequences for this country because Deputy Dockrell says that if we question it or ask questions we are against mineral development. Deputy O'Leary says that if we question it we are against the employment of 500 men.  If there is a proposal to employ 500 men in the development of the deposits at Avoca we are entitled to ask if the means by which it is proposed to develop them are the best for the country and for the people who may be employed in them.</P>
      <P>Let us take this thing calmly.  The situation is that the labourers whom the Minister for Finance proposes to hire&mdash;as Deputy Dockrell calls them&mdash; stand to gain about £1,750,000 a year, at the present rate of profits from copper, even if the price does not go up with the increase in the electrical industry, the atomic industry, and so on, in the next few years.  Five hundred persons will be employed and the company stand to gain £1,250,000 per annum.  Five hundred persons at £5 per week comes to one-eighth of a million pounds.  If they receive £10 per week they would cost £250,000.  Therefore, for every £5 that the company get in profit they will give a few shillings to the workers down in Wicklow and a few pence to the Minister for Finance.  Surely we are entitled to examine a proposition of that kind?</P>
      <P>Foreigners are not always as good at developing Irish industries of a risky nature as Irish controlled organisations, State or private.  The Shannon Scheme would have been left undeveloped for a long time if it had depended on the Americans who explored the Shannon basin and took all the levels as far back as 1912.  They were there for years in Shannon taking levels in the whole basin and the Shannon flow area&mdash;and nothing happened.</P>

It was not only a white elephant; it was a rotten elephant which we had to buy out, re-establish and develop.  It was down and out.  It had 2,500 acres of sugar beet per year going into it.  They tried to keep control in the hands of foreigners and to get their profits out of the machinery.  They had no idea of development, and Fianna Fáil had to come in and buy out the private interests which Fine Gael had installed down at Carlow and then develop the sugar industry in a real fashion.</P>

    <Title>National Loan, 1956. - Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Jack Lynch Mr. Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jack Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the indulgence of the House and of the Minister, when the Second Reading of this Bill was moved before the recess, Deputies were given the opportunity of studying the Bill with the explanatory memorandum until the House reassembled to-day.  It was obvious from the size of the Bill and from the various references back that it was a highly technical one, and therefore we are grateful to the Minister for giving us the facility of reading the Bill again for ourselves and meeting the various interests concerned.  As the Minister must know now, these interests are very many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of local government officers throughout the country in various aspects of local government administration has increased considerably <Col N="116" /> in the recent past.  Possibly in the past ten years the development of local government has been such that it is now so complex that I believe in the future some diffusion of authority and responsibility must be created in order to distinguish and differentiate between the control and responsibility of those local government officers in the various aspects of administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, as the Minister responsible, has, peculiarly enough, a very small degree of responsibility for the different types of officers who serve local authorities throughout the country.  The Minister for Health probably is responsible for more officers than the Minister for Local Government himself, and the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Education also enter the scene in different aspects of the administration of local authorities.  It is unfortunate, in a sense, that all the responsibility must now be thrown on the Minister for Local Government to try to establish a proper system of superannuation for officers who are paid from different Votes of the Central Fund and also paid out of purely local funds in almost every city, county and town in the country.  I believe that, no matter what the Minister tries to do or to attain in the passage of this Bill, there will, in the ultimate, be very many disgruntled officers in different spheres of our administration throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>I believe the time will come, and should come, when each Minister responsible for payment, or sanction of payment, of local officers' salaries should take responsibility himself and try to help not only these local officers but public representatives to know in what direction one might go in order to satisfy, and even to interpret, the different claims and the different difficulties that arise in local government officials' payment and superannuation.</P>
    <P>The interim between the adjournment of the Dáil before Christmas and its resumption here to-day is, as I said at the start, very much appreciated by Deputies, but nevertheless it may have been a blessing in disguise, inasmuch as most of us never realised how far-flung the effects of this Bill were going to be, because I am sure each Deputy <Col N="117" /> in the House has received representations from individuals and groups of individuals serving the local authorities in different categories over the past few months.  The Local Government Officials' Union has had interviews with the responsible officers of the Minister's Department, and in most cases its claims have not been satisfied, or rather promises to satisfy them have not been given.  It is for that reason that I am sure the Minister will be overburdened with problems affecting groups and individuals during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I crave his indulgence in that respect in so far as I, personally, am concerned, and I am sure that I am only one of many who have been given memoranda of hardships that are already in existence and have not been alleviated by the introduction of this Bill, at this stage, at any rate.  I feel that between now and the Committee Stage as a result of what the Minister will hear from me and other Deputies from each side of the House, he and his officers, and the officers of other Departments involved, will have to recast, to a large extent, the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The first type of officer to whom I will refer in the few words I am going to say are officers who were recruited at a late stage in their lives to local authorities in one sphere of administration or another.  These officers are men who helped to fight for the independence of this country.  Some of them approached me and put up what I thought was a very reasonable case, in so far as the reckoning of their pensionable service is concerned.  Men who shouldered arms or assisted in the fight for independence are, in my opinion, entitled to very special consideration. There are many men who, in their adolescence or in their early adult life, joined different branches of the forces who fought for freedom. Some of them spent many years either on active service or in such circumstances that they were unable to settle themselves in after life, while many of their friends and colleagues who did not take the same part in the fight for independence, either through economic stress or from conviction or for any <Col N="118" /> other reason, joined the public service and were able to reckon their services, while their friends were unable to do so, as pensionable for the purposes of superannuation.</P>
    <P>There are many men who, because of their nationalist outlook, were unable to take up positions in the local authorities which they might otherwise have done at a very early age.  For that reason, they are now debarred from taking advantage of reckoning what has been described as temporary service for superannuation and pension purposes.  I believe that the number of such men is now so small that it would not impose any undue burden, either on the Exchequer or the local authority to satisfy their claims to some extent at least.  Officers with 30 years' service or more are entitled, at the end of their service in public or local authorities, to have ten years added on.  Many of the men to whom I have made reference are men who, by reason of active service, or by reason of the consequence of active service in the movement for independence, were unable and will be unable to serve for 30 years before they will be compulsorily retired, and in such cases I suggest to the Minister that special consideration should be given, and that, where their service falls short of the statutory number of years, there should be some examination of their cases and some provision made in this Bill to do justice to men who genuinely and in the interests of their country were giving service in a much more important respect.  I ask the Minister between now and the Committee Stage to give these men his very generous and active consideration.</P>
    <P>There are various other types of officers to whom I would like to refer. In one respect, the next case I am going to make &mdash; that is the case of legal assistants in county law offices&mdash; is much akin to the case of the Old I.R.A. men to whom I have just referred.  In order to qualify for appointment, many of those officers who are giving very good service in county council law agents' offices throughout the country were obliged before they were qualified to enter that employment to have at least five <Col N="119" /> years' service in a law office.  Unfortunately, under the terms of this Bill, these men will be unable to take credit for the service that they gave outside the local authority for superannuation purposes, although that service was such that it assists local authority law officers in carrying out their different functions.</P>
    <P>I think it was under the 1926 Local Government Act and under the 1948 Act&mdash;which this Bill amends&mdash;that the local authority was given power to add years to service in special circumstances. This Bill which in its explanatory memorandum claims to be an improvement on the old Bill, actually puts such men in a worse position.  The Bill, in Section 13, I think, describes what the special circumstances are that will qualify persons to have years added to their service for superannuation purposes and it apparently limits that qualification to professional officers.  Unfortunately, legal clerks and legal assistants in county law offices are not considered officers and their type of service is not considered to be professional.  Therefore, although the Bill in its explanatory memorandum is claimed to be an advance and an improvement on existing legislation, so far as the definition given of people who can qualify for added service is concerned it has been very strictly confined so as to exclude such men as these.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether a constitutional issue could arise on this&mdash;that men who are serving under existing legislation which in effect is their contractual relationship with the State and the local authority will now be in a much worse position than they were before the passage of this Bill.  But at least it raises a moral issue, so far as this House and its different members are concerned.  Men who had been serving for years under legislation which could provide them with benefits that they might reasonably have looked forward to at the end of their service with local authorities are now, under the terms of this Bill, precluded from qualifying even for consideration for the bestowal of these benefits.  If necessary, on the Committee <Col N="120" /> Stage, I shall be able to give more details of how these men are affected and the particular technical issues involved, but at this stage I would suggest to the Minister and his advisers on the Bill that they should take cognisance of the matter raised, if by any chance it has escaped the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I do know that a case has been put up on more than one occasion, but, unfortunately, it was claimed that these were new appointments&mdash;what the term &ldquo;new apointments&rdquo; implies, I do not know&mdash;and that in so far as these law assistants or law officers' appointments were new appointments, they failed to merit consideration under this Bill and the officers could not relate their position back to existing legislation in order to prove that their condition or prospects had worsened.  If that is the case, if their prospects have worsened as a result of new legislation being introduced, I feel there is at least a moral obligation on us to ensure that these men who enter the local government service with professional and technical knowledge of a high degree and whose service we, in our different corporations and county councils, are glad to avail of will not be adversely affected by new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows personally that a good law clerk in any solicitor's office is a tremendous asset and I am sure it is obvious to everyone that those appointed to county council law agents' offices in recent years were chosen from among the best.  Some of them have been serving for upwards of ten years and many of them who served happily, in the belief that the special circumstances under which their superannuation would be increased and added years of service be given them for superannuation purposes now feel they are completely precluded from this benefit.  I shall not put it beyond that, except to say I hope I have made the point sufficiently clear and, if I have not, I shall do so on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill very properly rectifies an unfortunate situation that arose as a result of a recent case law.  The 1948 Act imposed on officers appointed after 1st April, 1948, the obligation of paying, <Col N="121" /> for superannuation purposes, 5 per cent. of their annual salaries by way of contribution.  Somewhere in that Act, it was provided that officers whose names were entered in a register of permanent employees would be considered to be permanent officers, provided that register was in existence on 1st April, 1948.</P>
    <P>In the Cork Corporation, there were very many local authority servants who had been serving for many years themselves as permanent employees, but, when it came to deciding whether or not this 5 per cent. of their salary should be demanded from them, the manager decided that they were not permanent employees, because their names were not entered on a permanent register.  These employees took their case, in the names of one or two of their members, to the Circuit Court.  It was appealed to the High Court and, I think, was taken on a case stated to the Supreme Court.  As concisely as I can say it, the decision of the Supreme Court was that, in so far as the Cork city manager did not maintain a register of permanent employees, these men were, therefore, not permanent employees and were subject to the obligation of paying 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation purposes, even though their employment extended in many cases up to 15, 20 and even 30 years before 1st April, 1948.</P>
    <P>This Bill happily rectifies that position and special provision is made to exclude these employees from the obligation to pay 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation purposes. The trouble is that, while this Bill now recognises the existing legislation was rightly interpreted, I suppose, in such a manner as to impose an unfair burden on these men and acknowledge their rights to be relieved from the payment of 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation purposes, nevertheless, it does not restore these payments to these men until such time as they will retire or, in the case of retired men, as soon as the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>That is a matter largely for the convenience of the local authority, I would say.  These men are paid <Col N="122" /> entirely out of rates&mdash;local funds. Nevertheless in so far as it has been admitted&mdash;I suggest to the Minister it is admitted in the Bill&mdash;that a wrong was done these men by the strict interpretation of the law, as it now stands and as it then stood, I suggest that the refund of those superannuation payments should be made not on retirement but as soon as the local authority can find it possible and convenient to make them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that other Deputies will speak on this topic from different aspects, but in so far as the admission is there that the 1948 Bill intended to preclude these men from the obligation of these payments, in so far as its terms did not carry out that expressed purpose, and in so far as this Bill now seeks to carry out that purpose, there is a moral obligation on us to ensure that to the extent to which local funds can meet the demand, the demands will be met at a much earlier date.</P>
    <P>There are a few other particular cases to which I will refer the Minister. Some of my colleagues will also have no doubt similar cases, but I will put one hardship very broadly to the Minister.  There are in Cork appointed water inspectors.  Many of them were recruited as a result of an advertisement which appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 20th January, 1948.  That was before the passage of the Superannuation Act, 1948, and certainly before the Act became operative.  They replied to that advertisement, dated 20th January, 1948, and were interviewed by a selection board on 18th February, 1948, but for one reason or another, their appointments were not sanctioned for a considerable period afterwards.</P>
    <P>Their permanent appointment was sanctioned as from a date subsequent to 1st April, 1948, and for that reason they find themselves obliged to pay 5 per cent. of their salaries towards superannuation at the end of their service.  It must be admitted that, when they took this matter up with two of the Minister's predecessors&mdash; Mr. T. J. Murphy and the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&mdash; some attempt to alleviate their position was made and £13 was added to their basic salaries in order in some <Col N="123" /> way to compensate for the 5 per cent. they had to pay.  Nevertheless, it only compensated them to a limited extent. At the time, I think the compensation came almost to 75 per cent., but, in the intervening years, that compensation gradually decreased.  I may as well add that the 5 per cent. was also deducted from the £13 as well.</P>
    <P>I feel that as the advertisement appeared on 20th January, 1948, as the interviews took place on 19th February, 1948, as sanction for their appointments was sought on 15th March, 1948, and as the contractual relationship between them and the local authority was complete they were entitled to receive the benefit of preclusion from the obligation to pay 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation purposes.</P>
    <P>It is significant that, in the case of other appointments advertised by the Cork Corporation on the same day&mdash; interviews for the filling of appointments of rent collectors were held on or about the same date&mdash;their permanent appointments were post-dated to a date prior to 1st April, 1948, and these rent collectors were precluded from the obligation of paying 5 per cent. of their salaries for superannuation. It is also significant, and I think this practically stops the Minister from denying their claim, that they were given increments during their temporary service, increments based on their permanent appointment, dated from a date prior to 1st April, 1948.  In that respect I suggest their contractual relationship was complete before 1st April, 1948, in so far as acknowledgment of their service was given prior to 1st April, 1948.  I suggest their case is complete from that point of view and they should be relieved from the obligation of paying these superannuation contributions.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to hog the whole debate to myself, but I suggest to the Minister that, so far as the three categories I have mentioned are concerned, inasmuch as they have a good case in law, possibly, and certainly morally, they should be given whatever benefits they seek under this current legislation.  I <Col N="124" /> have been reminded that there is still another category.  I refer to the men employed by the South Cork Board of Assistance.  Here, again, I sympathise with the Minister, since he is not the final authority; even if he should sanction increases in salary, he still has to deal with the Minister for Finance.  There are in St. Finbarr's Hospital a number of men whose length of service ranges from 10 to 20 years; their formal appointments were delayed to April, 1950.  If men are employed in a temporary capacity for 20 years, it is a reasonable assumption that their service must have been satisfactory.  If they fell short in any of their duties while serving in a temporary capacity, their dismissal is made all the easier for their superiors; evidently, they gave satisfactory service in that temporary capacity.  I am sure they gave such service as warranted whatever salaries they enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, as soon as the Superannuation Act was passed it was thought fit then, and only then, to sanction their appointment as permanent employees.  I suggest to the Minister that if 20 years' temporary service is not sufficient to judge the merits of a man's capabilities, there is something wrong in the standards whereby local authority services are measured.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the remarks I have made in relation to these men as well.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House any longer, but the Minister can rest assured that he will have to face up to many of the problems I have mentioned and many other problems to which my colleagues on both sides will advert in the course of this debate.  I sympathise with him in so far as it may be very difficult for him to estimate the weight any amendments he may be disposed to accept will carry.  He does not know whether he will open a floodgate of demands.  That is beside the point, if there is justice and merit in the applications; and cases should be treated in justice and on their merits.</P>
    <P>I hope that, before the Bill leaves the House, as much hardship as possible will be alleviated and that <Col N="125" /> there will be fewer disgruntled officers serving local authorities throughout the country as a result of the introduction of this Bill, the deliberations on it here and the amendments we all hope to see effected to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with two points expressed by Deputy Lynch.  I agree that, no matter what the Minister may do, somebody will be disgruntled. It is equally true that, no matter what we do with this Bill, it will not be the be-all and the end-all of local government legislation governing local authority employees. Secondly, I agree with Deputy Lynch that it would be more appropriate for us to concentrate on the Committee Stage of this measure and for that reason I have no intention of delaying the House this evening.</P>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, are pleased to be able to co-operate in securing the advantages offered in this Bill, particularly in Part III.  That part is of enormous importance to us, inasmuch as it covers a section of our community which, in the past, has been at the tail-end of all progressive legislation.  Part III deals with the road workers.  I am glad that provision is being made in this Bill for the betterment of these men by way of pension.  I know that some members may say that such provision is in operation in certain countries.  It is quite true that, under the 1947 Act, provision was made in relation to these men, but, at the same time, the responsibilities laid on them in order to qualify for the benefits conferred were much more severe than they are in this instance.  Many counties decided their employees were not entitled to the benefit of pensions under that Act at that time.  An assurance was given before Christmas that, with the co-operation of both sides, an endeavour would be made to have this matter framed in legislation by April.  That is one reason why it would be unfair for us to dwell at any undue length on it here to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lynch said, credit is due for the provisions in this Bill to help these particular categories which have suffered in relation to the 1947 Act. <Col N="126" /> That is true of the corporation workers in Cork.  What struck me very forcibly at the time was that, while the county and city managers, through their legal advisers, were prepared to spend an enormous amount of money in Circuit Courts and High Courts and Supreme Courts, were we to know the actual cost of some of these proceedings and compare it with the amount of money that would have been given to the men, I am sure we would find that, if the legal expenses had been saved and the men given their pensions, the results would have been far more advantageous to the men and to the rate-payers. Thanks to Providence, we are now taking the opportunity of remedying that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, as is every member of the Labour Party, that one of our colleagues who was constantly agitating, not only as a member of the Government, but in all the years in which he was a member of this House, for improved conditions, and particularly for the provisions in Part III of this Bill in relation to the road workers, is not with us here to-night.  I am speaking, of course, of our Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin.  If he is not here in person, I am sure that he is here in spirit to see that one of the important ideas of his political life should be put into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an attempt to try to rectify some of the anomalies and grievances that have arisen under the 1948 Act.  It has done so in a number of cases, but I am afraid there is still a large number that require rectification. There are a number of employees, 25 in all, of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee who were appointed since 1930 and before 1948. After two years' temporary service, they were made permanent employees and were taken off insurance stamps and so forth, but, when the 1948 Act came into operation, these men were forced to pay the contribution.  I believe that this is due to some clause in the 1948 Act, but I think it is very wrong and I think that these men have a reasonable source of grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can understand, there are only 25 men in the whole corporation <Col N="127" /> or vocational service in Dublin who are so affected.  There is parity between employees in the vocational service and in the corporation service, except for this one case.  There is also the point that, as these men have been taken off insurance stamps, under the Welfare Act, they should be pensionable. Why should they be treated, if they are pensionable, differently from any of the existing permanent employees under the 1948 Act?  I would be glad if the Minister would look into this matter and see if he could do something to rectify it.</P>
    <P>There is one point in this Bill in which I am very interested.  That is the question of providing for widows' pensions by deduction from the death gratuity or lump sum of the officer.  I think it is an interesting experiment and I congratulate the Minister on trying it out, whatever the effect may be. I wonder if he could give us some instances as to how it might work out in some particular cases.  I think the experiment is one that is worth trying and I congratulate him on it.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister regretted that he was unable to deal with existing pensioners, on the grounds that this matter had to be dealt with in a general way.  I am very sorry that he should take that view, because my experience is that that same attitude has held up help for a number of old people over a number of years.  There are a number of these old people whom I know myself, whom God has let live longer than they expected and who have to carry on for years on very small pensions because of the time at which they were pensioned.  They are not able to help themselves.  Most of their families have gone or have responsibilities of their own, and they are trying to manage on a very small amount.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider that point and to see if he could not bring in some legislation whereby local authorities would give these pensioners some further relief.</P>
    <P>I congratulate him on the Bill as a whole and I hope he will give attention to the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the many improvements in this Bill, but I want to say that there is a number of cases not included in it.  I am speaking now of pensioners who retired ten, 15 or 20 years ago on pensions of £200 a year.  £200 a year at that time could buy a reasonable supply of food, but that £200 has now depreciated to £75 and something should be done to help out the men and women who are existing on these small pensions.  I strongly express the hope that the Minister will see his way, if possible, before this Bill goes through, to give some consideration to these people who are now living on very small pensions and who cannot now buy half the foodstuffs they were able to buy when they came out on pension at first.</P>
      <P>There are other cases.  I have heard of the case of a pensioner, who is now 85 years of age and who came out on a pension of £100 a year, which was considered good at that time.  That pensioner is living in abject poverty at the moment and is depending on charity and relief.  It would be well if we would put him in a position where he could purchase the necessaries of life, without having to appeal to charity.  I think that a number of local authorities have passed resolutions that it should be left to local authorities themselves to deal with cases which they think deserving.  I implore the Minister to consider that point of view, but I cannot sit down without joining with the other Deputies in congratulating him on the contents of the Bill he has put before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support my colleague, Deputy Lynch, in the case he has put forward on behalf of Old I.R.A. men who have not sufficient service to entitle them to a full pension, or even to a fairly reasonable pension, and who will now be forced to retire at 65 years of age. Some of those men were employed temporarily by local authorities and the majority of them lost the best earning years of their lives by giving service to their country.  Surely it is reasonable to give them the benefit of adding up to ten years to their service for pensionable purposes.  I have one <Col N="129" /> case in mind of a member of the Cork Fire Brigade who gave service in 1920 as a substitute for his brother who was imprisoned for three years.  He gave temporary service on other different occasions afterwards and now he will have to retire at the age of 55 years. I understand that fire brigade men are supposed to retire at that age, instead of at 65, and I would press the Minister to give that man an extension of his service, so that he will get a reasonable pension to exist on.</P>
      <P>I should like very much to support Deputy Alfred Byrne's appeal for the pensioners of local authorities who have retired for some time and who are not able to exist on the pensions they receive.  I know of no body which is acting in any way humanely towards those people, except the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  Their men were being retired on very small pensions a good many years ago, and about 1947 they gave them pensions at the current rate.  This week, they have again given these men who had their full 40 years' service, two-thirds of the increase which the workers got.  If they had only 30 years' service, they got 50 per cent. of the recent increase given to the workers.  These people who have given service to the local authorities and who, as has been stated by Deputy Colley, have lived longer than the average span, are now in the position that they have not sufficient to live on and are dependent on relatives and other people to support them at present.  That should not happen in any Christian country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the question of the workers in the Cork Corporation who were forced to pay contributions because the manager did not keep a register, I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this amendment to exempt them from contributions. However, men who will be waiting for perhaps 30 years to complete their service should not be asked to leave the money they have paid for the past seven or eight years in the corporation funds.  After all, this Bill proves that it was never intended&mdash;and I have this from the officials of the Department at the time&mdash;under the 1948 Act that those people should be made to contribute. <Col N="130" /> Some of the officials of the Department at the time were very anxious that the case should be taken into court and they felt confident that the workers would win, but unfortunately we know the reverse happened because for the period of years concerned, they were not considered to be registered and, due to that legal quibble, these men were forced to pay money for seven or eight years.  It is suggested now in this Bill that they wait 25 or 30 years to have that money returned to them&mdash;the Minister did not even suggest putting in a new loan for them at 5 per cent.  To leave the matter thus and deprive them of their money for this length of time is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned the case of inspectors in the board of assistance who are regarded as temporary after 20 years' service and who, as we know, are reappointed every six months. When a nurse took an action in this connection, it was proved that she was entitled to pension for the whole period of her service.  These are grievances in connection with which we intend to bring in amendments on Committee Stage.  We will then have a better opportunity of discussing the question. There are many people who still have grievances and, I suppose, as Deputy Desmond says, no matter how perfect a Bill is, there will still be grievances.  However, this measure will do a lot of good for many people and we hope it will go through without undue delay.</P>

The case I have in mind and which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice may not be a frequent occurrence, but even so it might happen that a particular employee&mdash;I am referring now to road workers&mdash;might have a number of years just short of the qualifying number of days.</P>

I should like to join with Deputy Desmond in paying tribute to my Parliamentary Secretary, who unfortunately is not with me to-day, but who gave a considerable amount of his time and thought in the earlier stages to the preparation of this Bill.  As Deputy Lynch rightly pointed out, this Bill is really a technical Bill and a Committee Stage Bill, and I am sure the House will go into it very fully in Committee.</P>
      <P>I do not wish at this stage to make a very lengthy speech in reply to the many points raised.  I was glad of the intervention of Deputy Colley, because at one stage to-night, it looked very much like a Cork Bill.  I think all the speakers from both sides of the House represented constituencies in Cork, so the intervention of Deputy Colley and Deputy Alfred Byrne was appreciated. Deputy Lynch raised a number of points with which I should like to deal at some length, but, as the debate will be adjourned in a few moments, I think I should not go into them now.  I shall go into them on the next occasion on which I resume my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate, I was examining certain statements that were made by members supporting the Government, particularly those made by Deputy Dockrell and Deputy O'Leary.  Deputy O'Leary claimed that no word of explanation should be demanded from the Government because 500 men might be <Col N="132" /> employed in the Avoca mines.  Deputy Dockrell alleged that, because we asked certain questions about it, we were against the development of the Avoca minerals.  I pointed out that, as Deputy Lemass had said, the Canadian interest involved in this may have £1,300,000 or £1,400,000 profit per year for themselves for a great number of years, and, if they paid as much as £10 a week, which would be a lot for them to pay for a beginning, that would amount to £250,000; the Minister for Finance would get a few thousand pounds out of this 4 per cent. tax on profits and, if it goes up beyond the £350,000, he is to get 9 per cent. The proposition is that we will give £5 in profits to the groups who will develop, £1 or less to the workers involved and a few coppers or shillings to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell alleged that they should get this £5 out of every £6 because they took the risk.  When a copper mining company go into a virgin country that has never been explored and are merely relying on surface indications or electrically recorded indications or geological surveys previously carried out, they take a great risk, but there was £500,000 of the Irish people's money spent on exploring these mines.  A company having, as everybody has pointed out, the finest mining engineers in Canada, were not taking any risk when they could see the proved analysis of the Wicklow mines, when they knew that they had been developed for a great number of years and that in recent years £500,000 of the Irish people's money was spent on exploratory work, on proving that copper existed there and existed to the extent of the number of millions of tons that had been proved.  So that, from the Canadian group's point of view, there was no risk.  If the copper was there, if the proved analysis was there, richer than most of the copper mines being mined anywhere in the world at the present time, over 1.12 per cent., there was no risk involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances, when the mines had been proved and when the Government was prepared to see £10,000,000, £12,000,000 or £15,000,000 <Col N="133" /> profit being made on this in a few years, why did they not use some of these millions that can be made at the present price of copper, even if it goes no higher, to engage mining engineers, to buy equipment that would develop these mines and keep the profit for ourselves and, more important, over the years, insist that Irish people, Irish engineers, Irish analysts, Irish chemists were employed in the development of these mines?</P>
    <P>The difference between the Shannon scheme and the Avoca mineral works is this: the Americans, in 1912, spent a great many thousands of pounds in surveying the Shannon basin.  The first Dáil, in 1920, had a commission on water resources and they had the experience and the accounts of the American engineers for which the Americans paid and, when it came to 1924, when the Shannon scheme was put forward, the State had the benefit of the American report, plus the work that had been done by the Dáil Commission and they set up a State company, the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>There the process was American money used for exploration and Irish money put into a State company to develop.  Here we are putting £500,000 of Irish money into proving that the copper is in the Wicklow mines and are to hand over the benefit of that to a foreign company in which no Irish person is allowed to put a penny.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance and the Government were prepared to give the concessions to mineral companies that they propose to give in this Bill, why did they not offer those terms and conditions to Irish people?  Why did they sell the mining rights and the rights to the profits to a foreign company without giving the Irish people an opportunity of putting their pounds together to invest in these mines?  An explanation is demanded of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he comes back, and of all the other Ministers. If the Government were prepared to give these tax concessions to get Avoca developed it should have been announced and the offer should have been made to the Irish people <Col N="134" /> that if they put their money together they would get similar concessions.  But it was only when the bargain was signed and sealed that anybody knew these tax concessions were made available and given to foreign groups. The first Government announcement confined those benefits to the Canadian company.</P>
    <P>It was only afterwards they changed their mind because they saw they could not get away with giving these solely to Canadians without giving similar concessions to Irish concerns engaged in mineral exploration and development. But the mining rights of the Wicklow property, on which the Irish people had spent £500,000, were given to the Canadians and before anybody knew there were tax concessions.  I feel certain that if the Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce had put an advertisement in the Irish papers that they were prepared to grant these tax concessions&mdash;four years free of income-tax and a half of that again during the following four years&mdash;there would have been Irish groups who would have followed out the advice the Government gave on more than one occasion to bring back foreign assets in the shape of machinery to get the mines going.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General denied that the previous Coalition Government had cut out the Estimate for Mineral Exploration from the 1948 Budget.  In that year we had prepared the Book of Estimates before leaving office and there was a sum of £85,000 for mineral exploration.  That, as everybody knew, was to continue the exploration and the proving of the size of the body of copper and zinc and sulphur in Avoca. The Attorney-General, as I have said, denied that the first Coalition cut out that sum for development.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed further, I want to quote from the Attorney-General's speech in 1948, when he was the Minister for Finance.  At column 1,040 of Volume 110 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Finance is quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There will be no draw on the Vote for Athletics (£25,000).  A saving of £10,000,000 will result from dropping the special arrangements <Col N="135" /> for transfer of harvest workers.  The scheme for exploration of mineral deposits, for which £85,000 is provided in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, will not be proceeded with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the quotation for which the Attorney-General asked.  He has no shortage of impudence, because I have heard him time and again in the House deny that he made certain statements. He thought he might get away with it simply because the volume was not available.  That is a quotation which shows that, in the first year of the Coalition Government, one of their first steps was to cut out the £85,000 which was to have been spent on the exploration of the copper and zinc and sulphur in County Wicklow.  I am not surprised at the Attorney-General, but it does strike me as rather strange that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who used to threaten anybody who wanted to put a shilling into Irish industry that he should be put behind the thickest walled jail he could find, should go off to America and Canada looking for foreign capitalists, not to be put behind the thickest walls but to become the beneficiaries of tax concessions not available to Irish capitalists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell said the labourer is worthy of his hire.  So he is, whether he be a mining engineer or somebody with a pick and shovel in a mine shaft. We could get mining engineers skilled in digging out proved bodies of ore in Wicklow for very much less than £13,000,000 or £14,000,000 in the next few years.  If necessary, we could employ skilled engineers from other countries, and indeed we have plenty of Irishmen who could do the job of shifting a body of ore and who would not regard it a very big day's work. There are places in the country where over 1,000,000 tons of material are shifted in a year, so that taking out the rock at Avoca is not a very big job, once you know that you are going to get money for it.  I do not think there is any risk, either, about the future price of copper.  Certainly a great number of people would be prepared to invest a few hundred pounds in this <Col N="136" /> project, if only they thought they were going to get a few hundred pounds a year out of it.  This company hopes to get 100 per cent.  There are many people who put money into industries with no greater expectation than a 5 or 6 per cent. return.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell also said: &ldquo;We must spend the money ourselves or get the money from somebody.&rdquo;  Is not that a strange statement from people who have been always talking and prating throughout the country about bringing home our external assets and using them for productive purposes? He said we must spend the money ourselves or get the money from somebody.  We still have external assets which, if we can find a reproductive proposition of work for them, should be brought home in the form of machinery or in payment for skill.  The amount of money being raised for this mine is only a couple of million pounds.  We are sending £35,000,000 down the drain this year without very much increase in our capital assets and I think a very good alternative expenditure for some of the £35,000,000 we spent last year would have been to have put £2,000,000 in the form of imported machinery and skill into the Wicklow mines.</P>
    <P>Is it to safeguard the level of our external assets that we are now looking for foreigners to develop our resources?  Are we afraid to spend our external assets on machinery and the payment of skill to develop these mines and other similar projects?  Has the pendulum swung completely the other way, so far as Fine Gael and the Labour Party are concerned?  Whereas a short time ago they wanted to spend every penny of our foreign assets, they are now quite miserly about them and are prepared to give 100 per cent. to any foreigner who will come in here and who, by bringing money into the country, gives us the opportunity of avoiding the expenditure of our foreign assets.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have a better experience with this Avoca mine than we had with sugar.  When Fine Gael wanted sugar grown here, they employed another foreign company to come into this country.  They built a <Col N="137" /> factory down in Carlow.  Within a couple of years, it was on the point of shutting down.  The acreage of sugar beet had fallen to 2,500 which would not keep the factory going for more than a week or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to come and take it over.  We had to buy out the foreigners and put in Irish capital and use our foreign assets to buy foreign machinery.  We had to get the sugar factory on a basis that would give us our complete requirements and enable the farmers to get a market for up to 80,000 or 90,000 acres of beet.  I hope we are not going to have the same experience here.</P>
      <P>We know that these Canadians, being good businessmen, want to get any money they put into mining back into their pockets as quickly as possible.  If they had any idea that the price of copper was going to fall, they would very quickly expand their activities to take it out of the ground, hire the men to process it within a couple of years, if they could, and then leave the whole thing behind&mdash;leave us nothing but the dumps of extracted ore or the spoil of the extracted ore and a few thousand men looking to the Government for support.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when starting off with his speech, purported to give us the full facts of the Arklow development, but he certainly did not give them to us.  I hope that, in his reply, he will give some further information to enable not only the Deputies here but the people of the country to see whether this is the proper way to develop the Irish mines&mdash;not only Avoca but future Irish mines.  I think the points Deputy Lemass put to him demand an answer that will satisfy the people.  I am only sorry that the Tánaiste is not here, so that we could put other questions to him as to why he is backing the development of the Avoca mines in this particular fashion.</P>

      <P>Having heard the brilliant, educational outpouring of Deputy Aiken, I am compelled to ask a few questions.  When was it known, I would like to learn from the Minister, in connection with the recent survey of the Avoca area as mentioned by Deputy Aiken, that the survey carried out there was going to show the wonderful benefits which were mentioned to us here in this House to-night?  We will give Deputy Lemass credit for being a very clever businessman.  Is it only just now that he and Deputy Aiken have discovered or have been informed of what had been known from the survey?  We were informed that it was made quite clear from the survey that benefits untold lay hidden underneath the soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens to be exactly two years ago.  I listened very patiently to Deputy Aiken while he was speaking.  Why is it that Fianna Fáil waited for the hated and dreaded Coalition Government to do anything about it?  I am sure that Fianna Fáil have many influential and financially <Col N="139" /> well-to-do friends in this country.  I am sure they know many influential people in financial affairs who would have no trouble in putting their hands on sufficient capital to start&mdash;as Deputy Aiken seems to suggest we should have done&mdash;a mining company, to offer shares to the general public here and to do what he now says a foreign company are being asked to do.  We in the Labour Party have never advocated&mdash;except when all else has failed&mdash;the bringing here of what has been termed to-night &ldquo;a foreigner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like Deputy Aiken to know that we are looking at this matter from a different angle from the way he seems to look at it.  He contented himself with saying that the Irish people should have been offered shares, should have been offered the opportunity to put their money into what they thought was a gold mine.  Those of us in the Labour Party, at any rate, are interested, first and foremost, in seeing that the unfortunate man in the areas around Avoca, who is not in a position to put money into the industry, will, through the instrumentality of the moneys the Government have placed in the industry, see that, at the end of the week, he will, please God, get more than he has been getting at the present time and for some years past, unemployment assistance, and will get a decent wage.</P>
      <P>I do not mind what statement Deputy Aiken may make.  Apparently he found pleasure in quoting what a certain member of this House said in 1948, but if it were as inaccurate as the statement he made, that the Tánaiste had said that anyone who put 1/- in Irish industry should be behind bars, he does not deserve to have serious notice taken of him.  We do know that the Tánaiste never made such a statement, and we know quite well that he never would make such a statement. Deputy Aiken has been completely inaccurate in what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I believe that time is of vital importance, not just to this Government or to this House, but to the people in the areas who are <Col N="140" /> looking for a decent standard of living, which can only be given by full employment.  If the Irish industrialists about whom we have heard so much&mdash;people who, mark you, are shaken up a bit now when they find the possibility of interference with their nest eggs secured for 30 years in certain industries&mdash;have failed to avail of the benefits rightly offered them by Deputy Lemass in 1952 under the Undeveloped Areas Bill which we supported, then, after four years, there is nothing left for us to do, except to bring in even foreigners to keep our Irish people employed at home.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with this Bill.  It might be better if we did not have to depend on a foreign company, but, at any rate, considering this survey that has been spoken of by Deputy Aiken and the wonderful benefits which might be given, I am surprised and amazed that a Deputy of his ability and initiative did not succeed in the last two years in getting what apparently he was so anxious to get&mdash; Irish companies to go into Avoca.  We, at any rate, are concerned not so much with those who are going into Avoca, but with the fact that, thanks be to God, the men in the area will secure a decent livelihood from the work given to them there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Desmond seems to consider that Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was in some way lacking in his efforts to attain the maximum possible development of these deposits in Avoca.  I must remind Deputy Desmond again that when Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had originally provided for a substantial scheme amounting to £85,000 per annum for the exploration of mineral resources in the Estimates for 1947-48, the then Minister for Finance of the incoming Government came along, and, in May, 1948, announced that &ldquo;the scheme for the exploration of mineral deposits for which £85,000 is provided in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce will not be proceeded with.&rdquo;  That is column 1041, 4th May, 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No standstill Order, no <Col N="142" /> control of profits, no Prices Advisory Body, no exploitation of labour, in those honeyed phrases.  The Tánaiste has been in West Germany; he has been in London.  He is now in the United States.  Before he started to cover Europe and then cross the Atlantic, we were told that an arrangement had been come to with the Swedes by which Swedish capital was to be invested in this country.  I am surprised that the speculators and <i>entrepreneurs</i> of the whole world are not hastening hither, if they heed the words of the Tánaiste that there is no limitation of profits and apparently no limitation to the credulity of those who represent this country and who are making arrangements with foreign capitalists for the development of our resources.</P>
      <P>I may remind Deputy Desmond that it was under Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, that a measure passed through the Oireachtas, called the Control of Manufactures Act, under which, unless a company for special reasons received a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, no new company was to be allowed to function here, unless at least 51 per cent. of the capital was Irish.  As Deputy Lemass has reminded the House, the company set up under the special legislation introduced and passed through the Oireachtas for that purpose&mdash;Mianraí Teoranta&mdash;had been asked in April, 1954, to submit their proposals, and up to £500,000 had been expended in the exploitation and testing out of these mineral resources in Avoca, so that to that extent it is no longer a question of speculative enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five hundred thousand pounds of Irish money has been spent in exploiting and testing the resources of the area.  We know roughly, and it has been published in the Irish newspapers as far back as last September, what these resources consist of, what the percentage of ore amounts to, and we have estimates of the total tonnage capable of exploitation.  It has even been suggested that not alone should work be provided over the period suggested in the official statements of 21 years, with a further lease for another 21, but that the area to be exploited <Col N="143" /> is so large and the tonnage so great that the work might continue for perhaps 50 years or more.</P>
    <P>It is from that point of view that the House has to regard the arrangement that has been entered into and which the Minister for Finance seemed to try at first to brush aside.  It is quite clear &mdash;from the statements that were issued in September last, in which it was admitted that these tax concessions were given as part of the arrangement with the Canadian Finance and Mining Corporation&mdash;that that arrangement was the origin and basis of the present Bill.  We know, as has been pointed out during this debate, that copper is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity in the world market.  It is likely to become even more important and more valuable in the future. Moreover, the arrangement that is now being entered into not alone binds the existing Government but binds their successors over the period.  Whoever they may be they will not be able to escape these commitments.  It is only right, therefore, that the House and the country should properly appreciate what the balance sheet is in this particular transaction.</P>
    <P>When the original statement was published, about the 14th September last, it was stated that the tax concessions would apply only to new mining enterprises.  When the legislation is introduced and the Bill circulated we find that it is applicable to existing enterprises.  I should like to know, if in the meantime the Government has changed its mind in a very important particular and given existing companies the benefit of this valuable concession, why it should be confined to one particular form of mining company? Why, for example, should mining companies like the Castlecomer collieries not be entitled to the tax concession if some other mining company, employing, perhaps less labour and perhaps less important generally in our economy, is going to get the benefit of the concession because the Government has changed its mind in the meantime?</P>
    <P>No reply has been vouchsafed to the very pertinent questions addressed <Col N="144" /> to the Minister by Deputy Lemass in the first place as to whether the existing company, Mianraí Teoranta, received any direction to pursue and search for technical assistance and, if necessary, managerial and executive ability to enable them to undertake the task of continuing the work that they had carried on with such success over a period of years.  We have to assume if Mianraí Teoranta were able &mdash;though we must admit they had not the technical experience or knowledge of some of these foreign mining experts&mdash;to exploit the Avoca mines and work them even in an experimental and exploratory way over a period of years since 1948, it surely should have been possible, considering the stage technical enterprise had then reached and the knowledge that we had, for Mianraí Teoranta, to secure technical experts and managers if necessary from other countries to enable them to carry out exploitation on a commercial scale.</P>
    <P>After all copper, as has been reiterated in this debate, is one of the most valuable minerals in the world at the present time.  Moreover, we have schemes of technical assistance, we have the deputy leader of the Government going to West Germany, to London and New York and other American cities seeking foreign capital. It is an extraordinary thing that it did not strike the Government, when discussing this matter, that it ought to be possible to get the necessary technical advice and if necessary the technical managers to enable either a State-sponsored company or at least a native Irish enterprise to take up the work where it had been stopped in 1954.</P>

      <P>If proposals giving special tax remission or special tax <Col N="145" /> exemption to particular classes or sections of the Irish people were introduced here, we know what unfavourable comment would be aroused and what a sense of bitter disappointment there would be for those who could not claim membership of these classes, but in this case the remission or exemption is not being given to any particular class of Irish citizens but to foreigners over a long period of time.  If the Government can afford to give these concessions to a corporation of the magnitude and resources of the one that has been mentioned here this evening by Deputy Lemass, one would not blame Irish industrialists for asking whether they, in their turn, should not be considered by the Minister particularly when the leader of his Party boasts at the annual Ard Fheis that Fine Gael is the Party of lower taxation, and says that whatever else it may stand for, it stands for lower taxation. Irish industrialists surely have the right to ask why they should not be given some of the crumbs of tax relief while foreigners are getting such a huge concession.</P>
      <P>It is no doubt legal and constitutional&mdash;I am sure the Attorney-General will be able to prove it&mdash;for us to lease these mineral rights to this foreign corporation over a long period of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is certainly an extraordinary reflection on our position that on the very same day that we are asking our people to subscribe £20,000,000 which the Minister for <Col N="146" /> Finance tells us is required largely for purposes of national development&mdash;and we hope he will be successful in getting the money for these purposes&mdash; that we should be actually discussing in this House legislation giving huge concessions and exemptions to foreign capitalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Another reason why the Dáil should give the most serious attention to this matter is that, once the present legislation is passed&mdash; presumably a great many of us are not likely to be alive in 21 years' time&mdash; we are not likely to have any other opportunity of examining the details of the transaction upon which this legislation is based.  This is the last chance Dáil Éireann, which is supposed to be responsible to the Irish people, has of safeguarding the national interests and, in particular, of safeguarding the national purse and the Irish taxpayer. This is the last opportunity this House will have, once this legislation is passed, of any reconsideration or any modification of the scheme which the Minister for Finance was good enough to outline to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if Deputies expressed their views frankly and honestly on this Bill, they would certainly be of one mind in believing that Irish capital and Irish money, as well as Irish brains and enterprise, ought to be associated with the project to the utmost extent and that the Government is failing in its duty, unless it can show our people that, for some hitherto incomprehensible reason, it was not possible to secure that our people should be associated in a close way with this particular enterprise in that they should have an interest in it.  As Deputy Lemass said, the fact of their having that interest, financial and otherwise, would at least have meant that, should the times alter, for reasons which we cannot see now, and should it appear that the industry was <Col N="148" /> not likely to thrive as had been hoped, at least the interest of the Irish people, their direct interest in the industry, would have meant that every effort would have been made to keep it going.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been following the trend of events elsewhere know that, in the other part of this country, one of the difficulties that has arisen&mdash; it has been referred to previously by the publicists of that part of the country, speaking on economic matters &mdash;is that even when English manufacturers come there with special concessions and special advantages, immediately they have exploited these concessions and advantages to the full, they just turn tail and leave the area completely.  There is no safeguard to ensure that, if this financial corporation finds, as has been suggested during the course of this debate, that it is more profitable to turn their attention and resources elsewhere, they will not without consulting the Government, except to the absolute extent to which they are legally bound, leave the country or will not be at the loss of a dollar more than they find to be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has taken place under very peculiar circumstances. Deputy McQuillan feels that we are in a position with regard to the Avoca deposits comparable with the position in connection with the millions of tons of oil bubbling up all round the world.  He wonders why we should not have all the resources to develop this peculiar raw material which, after many years, has been discovered to exist in our territory.</P>
      <P>Actually, the subject for discussion is a piece of legislation to give tax concessions, not to the Mogul Mining Corporation or the Irish company associated with it, but to anybody who will develop certain types of minerals in this country and, more particularly, new developments of the mining type. Deputy Lemass said we should refuse to discuss this piece of general legislation, until the details had been produced to the House.  I did not hear all Deputy Lemass's remarks but I read what I missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He indicated that the tax law we inherited <Col N="149" /> from England in respect of mining ventures is bad and that there should be some change.  He suggests a couple of changes&mdash;changes of detail &mdash;which could be discussed on Committee Stage.  The legislation generally he accepts.  He wants to have it tied up in order to have some mischief done and put daydreams in the head of Deputy McQuillan that there are vast undeveloped resources in this country and that the foreigner is going to get the best of it.  That is dragging a red herring across an ordinary piece of legislation which is intended to try to develop mining in this country&mdash;a development which has been sadly lacking. If it received any attention from Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce we certainly have not had any great results, beneficial to the country, from any sort of consideration he ever gave to any proposal towards that end.</P>
    <P>We come then to this Avoca matter and into that there are thrown the usual misleading, untruthful statements with regard to my Budget of 1948.  It is said that I stopped mineral development.  There was no mineral development.  I do not think this is a difference with a distinction: there was mineral exploration.  For what purpose? Mainly to develop Slieveardagh; and on 25th May, 1948, on the Final Stages of the Financial Resolutions of that year, Deputy Lemass agreed that, as far as Slievardagh was concerned, the money was practically wasted; and the concern was eventually advertised and sold at the best price that could be got for it.</P>
    <P>Then Avoca was dealt with.  What were the prospects held out with regard to Avoca?  Deputy Childers, in that debate, spoke of the viewpoint of the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, with regard to mineral development here.  I am quoting now from the unrevised edition of the Parliamentary Debates of the 25th May, 1948: when it comes to the revised edition, the columns may change a bit.  Deputy Childers said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I had a professional position in the industrial world of this country, I had occasion to read various reports on mineral development <Col N="150" /> and I quite accept what the former Taoiseach said, with much regret, that he had found that on the whole the geological surveys by the British Government had proved more accurate than he thought and that the optimistic expectation of the Fianna Fáil Government as to mineral development had not been realised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the first chilling effect with regard to mineral development in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass produced a piece of legislation here in 1947 with regard to mineral development.  There are many quotations in this speech of mine from him: if he likes, I can give the whole of them, but I want to paraphrase; I put it as a paraphrase that evening and got no denial from the Deputy. What he said was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Look!  we are spending £85,000 for a number of years.  We expect to carry on for seven years.  At the end of that, we will know whether there are any minerals in this country worth developing or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he added he thought most people would be disappointed with the results of that exploration.  Am I right?</P>

Here is what it comes to: we would be able to find what resources there were here for development in the country in the seven years and we might hold any minerals we might find as strategic reserves.  But the whole issue was that there was not any hope in the Deputy's voice when he spoke about mineral exploration; he was quizzed about it many times and, with the background of what the ex-Taoiseach said, that he personally had found as a result of the British geologists' reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reference to the British geologists will be found at column 2037 of Volume 110 of the Official Report.

      <P>Deputy Lemass said that we would know at the end of seven years where we were and we might have some minerals we could hold as stragetic reserves in case of another war.  There is certainly nothing in that debate to lift anybody's heart.  I came to that £85,000.  I thought it would be badly spent money.  Deputy MacEntee had intervened in the debate and I remember <Col N="152" /> referring to his remarks and saying nobody would spend much in this country as a result of what the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, and Deputy Lemass, ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, had said.  But Deputy MacEntee had different views. He talked about the magnificent reports that had come in.  I referred to them.  The references will be found in column 2085 of this debate.  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...I do not think anybody who comes here to work Avoca or any other mines will ever have imposed upon him the sort of confidence trick that would certainly be put upon him if he were to go by the phrase used by Deputy MacEntee in the Dáil. Deputy MacEntee gave a highly-coloured version of a report about deposits in Avoca.  He never told this House that there were three reports, two of them very unsatisfying.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I went on to speak about these: one was from an English professor; he condemned the whole business.  Is that not right?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had spent £500 on foot of that report, he would not have got £1 in return.  The second was a Swede; his report was also very unsatisfying.  The third was not so bad; I described the suggestion that one could publish a prospectus and look for the loan of public money on such reports as just so much nonsense to anybody who had read the reports.  I said I did not want to go too deeply into the Avoca business.  I did not want to speak too much about it at the time because there was a possibility being worked out.  Later I said:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;We have other plans with regard to Avoca.  I do not believe it is worth while spending this £85,000 a year in the way in which Deputy Lemass outlined in October, 1947&mdash;so that in the end we could get a picture of the mineral resources and see whether there was something we could exploit, and then exploit and hold them as a strategic reserve and <Col N="153" /> later make up our minds as to whether the thing was commercially workable or not.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked for nearly an hour to-night.  Will he give me 20 minutes without any interruption, except when he wants to contradict me if I am quoting him wrongly; I give him a free field for interruption there.  The Deputy says I chucked this £85,000.  I did, because I did not think the money should be spent in that way.  Do not forget the picture I had to face in May, 1948.  I had before me Deputy Lemass's shocking bargain with the Argentine in relation to wheat which cost the country £2,500,000.  I will put before this assembly three or four things which would, I think, have made any prudent person suspicious of anything Deputy Lemass had his hands in.  One was the Argentine wheat bargain made the day before he left office, made certainly 48 hours before he left office.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that there is so much annoyance over mineral development in Avoca.  I did decide that we would do without the <Col N="156" /> £85,000 for the scheme that Deputy Lemass had.  I had at that time all the experience that I have mentioned of schemes in which Deputy Lemass was the chief mover or one of the accomplices.  We decided that the money should not be spent that way. I said that there was a possibility of a scheme with regard to Avoca being worked out.  Deputy Lemass purports to give an historical account of all this matter.  He said that there was a meeting held in the Taoiseach's room, but that Industry and Commerce was not there and that the minerals board was not there.</P>
      <P>The meeting was, in fact, held in the Council Chamber, and, as far as my memory goes, it was one of the biggest meetings we had.  All the Ministers were invited, but I do not remember if they were all present.  Representatives of Industry and Commerce were there and the whole Minerals Board was there.  In addition to that, we had two of the three people who had written on the whole matter, notably Professor Jones.  After long examination, we did make up our minds to find out the extent of the mineralised area, and, having agreed that we had not got full information from the three condemnatory reports, we decided that we would go on the plan of localising the area mineralised.  Having got that information, we gave the money.  The money was given year by year.</P>

      <P>There was no stop put to the work at Avoca.  We got work done, kept people in employment and got the area explored and got away from the business of general mineral exploration.  We got the mineralised area properly located.  We got data that people could rely on and that could be put into a prospectus.  That information was obtained from people of independent judgment who could not be regarded as wishing to develop resources, simply because they were Irish resources.</P>
      <P>What happened after that?  All this was made known by advertisements in the newspapers.  These advertisements were put in by Mianraí Teoranta. The Board of Mianraí Teoranta was established by Deputy Lemass and most of the personnel of that board were appointed by him. That board was set up an as independent body, independent of the various Government Departments.  They published these advertisements in a certain way and the present developments have arisen from that.  The people who sat over here for 20 years had no plan for the development of the mineral resources of Avoca, except to spend £85,000 a year, to see if there were minerals there.</P>
      <P>It is not really befitting that they should speak of a development that has taken place after careful preparation of the whole matter and after a great company, the Mogul Mining Company, have decided to put their capacity for working and their special experience into the developments here. You can ask why was there no Irish money invested here?  What Irish person would subscribe a &ldquo;fiver&rdquo; after reading what was said in the Dáil Debates by the ex-Taoiseach and by Deputy Lemass?  No one would have dared to float £100 loan in the face of these things.  When we had the development of the area cautiously worked out and got the reports, even then, when the advertisements were put in the newspapers, what response was there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy now, once you have hooked a certain person, to suggest that you could have imposed more stringent conditions.  We could have been left with that area derelict without a person <Col N="158" /> working in it.  Even if their worst prognostications turned out to be true and minerals were taken out of this country and processed elsewhere that might have been done at home, if that were the case we still will get employment here for a number as high as 500 people during the development time. We will get all our money spent in prospecting paid back to us and get royalties based upon the profits made, I think that is a good bargain.  Whether it is good or bad it should not lie in the mouth of those who for 20 years did nothing about this development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I changed a scheme from mineral exploration to mineral development and spent the money in keeping people in employment, and if there is any fruit coming from this development it is from the money we spent from 1948 and not from the nonsensical expenditure between Slievardagh, which went down <Col N="160" /> the drain, and the bit that went on Avoca under the auspices of Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>Some points were brought in in regard to the details of the Bill. Deputy O'Leary talked about the milling venture in this country.  Deputy Lemass is very keen on having certain conditions imposed on those who put their capital into this country and somebody mentioned, I think it was with a certain amount of admiration for Deputy Lemass, the Control of Manufactures Act which he introduced. I do not think that there is anything that has been more universally condemned over the last five or six years than that Act.  It has been regarded as an Act that impeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You do not need to get rid of it.  As long as there are lawyers in this country they can find about 20 loopholes in it and only for that the Act would have been a very definite handicap in the development of this country.  Does the Deputy agree that we might impose upon the Mogul Mining Company the financial control that was imposed upon Rank when he came into the milling situation in Limerick?  Would the Deputy like the mining company to get away with as much as Rank got away with? Would he like us to have another Rank situation developing here in respect of minerals?  Apparently not.</P>

      <P>If the Rank system of financing and all that Rank was allowed to do is good, can we apply it to this company?  If it is bad, will the Deputy tell us it was bad and ask us to avoid at least that particular type of financing?  We are also told there is going to be limited employment for nationals here.  Limited employment&mdash; who says so?  Where did the Deputy or any of his colleagues get that view? Will the Deputy again suggest that we should let this new company have the same policy in regard to the employment <Col N="161" /> of nationals or aliens as the cement company had?  Was there any time when the cement company was asked to see that after some time the technicians would be replaced by Irish technicans?  Does the Deputy not know well that as a result of his ambiguous letter to that company we got into a certain amount of trouble with the cement concern and were faced with the difficulty that if they withdraw the keymen&mdash;and they were not our nationals&mdash;cement processing might have stopped for a considerable time?</P>
      <P>Do not forget&mdash;the Deputy may have forgotten it&mdash;that when the Shannon scheme was inaugurated here&mdash;it was a definite procedure that all the German technicians that came in here had to educate those who would replace them, and those who were to replace them were Irish nationals.  The same procedure was adopted with regard to the sugar beet factory.  Now the Deputy who let the cement business go along as it liked to go in regard to the employment of national or alien is wondering whether we, in respect of this company, will impose the limitations which he should have imposed upon the cement company if he thought at the time.  The Deputy has said the Bill should be criticised in some detail.  Let us wait for the details. The Deputy has got as much detail in this connection as has ever been given in connection with any of these developments at this earlier stage.  If he heard anything to-night that reacts on the legislation he may clamour about the scheme.  That can be discussed later and will be discussed.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this debate on the last occasion, I mentioned that the E.S.B. were obliged to provide supply to every rural householder, where the capital cost did not exceed 16 times the revenue derived from the annual fixed charge.  In 1951, that ratio was extended to 20 to 1 and in September, 1952, the ratio was again extended to 24 to 1.  The present position is that the board will provide supply to any householder, where the capital cost does not exceed 24 times the revenue derivable from the annual fixed charge, and in any case where it does not exceed 24 times the revenue, the supply is put in without any extra special charge.</P>
      <P>I think this was a great concession. It eased the charges on a very large number of rural consumers.  Had the board insisted, as they might have done, on retaining a 16 to 1 ratio, it would have meant that a very large number of consumers would have been put into the category of those who would have to pay the special fixed charges.</P>
      <P>As it is 24 to 1, revenue works out at 4.2 per cent.  The board expect a return from the rural householder of only 4.2 per cent.  They may get a lesser return in some cases, but they are prepared to go to the extreme limit of supplying any rural householder with electric light and power, where they will get a return of only 4.2 per cent.  Sinking fund and interest charges alone amount to 5.5 per cent. and where the board put on this extra special fixed charge, they calculate the amount which the householder has to pay on the basis of only 4.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan, when moving the motion, mentioned that, after a certain number of years, these householders who were obliged to pay the special fixed charge had paid for the wiring and that they were still obliged <Col N="163" /> to pay for many years&mdash;for ever, you might say&mdash;although in a certain number of years they would pay for the complete cost of wiring and bringing the poles to their houses.  As I have stated, the basis on which that charge is computed is still only 4.2 per cent. so that the charge does not meet even the sinking fund charge, depreciation and redemption of capital.  There is no allowance made in the extra special charge for either depreciation or redemption of capital.  Therefore, there is no question of the person having ever paid for that extra amount.  The charge is just put on to meet the ordinary charges and in fact it does not meet the charges.</P>
    <P>If allowance were made for the special fixed charge to take in capital costs, such as depreciation, apart from sinking fund charges and redemption of capital, the charge which the board would be obliged to put on would be so heavy that any householder who would not be entitled to get supply at the normal fixed charge would not take the current.  He could not afford to take it, because, instead of paying 4.2 per cent., which would mean possibly, in some cases, 10/- per two-monthly period and in other cases, £1 per two-monthly period, the householder would be compelled to pay possibly 30/- or £3 per two-monthly period, which would put the cost outside his capacity altogether.  By giving supply at the lower rate of 4.2 per cent., which is based on the normal fixed charge ratio of 24 to 1, supply is brought within the reach of most people, no matter how isolated they may be.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was thrown out towards the close of the debate on the last occasion that had the Government not withdrawn the £250,000 subsidy which they had been giving to the board, the board would now be in a position to abolish all these fixed charges.  The Deputy who made that suggestion had been in charge of my Department for many years and, as far as I know, had never made any suggestion to the board that they should abolish these fixed charges.  He was the person who instructed the board originally about the fixed <Col N="164" /> charges and, again, I admit, he was the person who extended the ratio to 20 to 1 and to 24 to 1.  But the Deputy at that time did not make any suggestion to the board that they should abolish these charges and he took it that it was only just and fair that that extra special charge should be made in certain cases to make the rural electrification scheme reasonably economic. Without that, it could not have been faced at all.</P>
    <P>Another point is that, if these extra special charges were removed, the only people who would have to pay the piper would be the rural consumers already connected or those who will be connected in future and I understand&mdash; and I have been supplied with data&mdash; that that would amount to anything up to 10 per cent. on the general body of rural consumers.</P>

It would also mean that people in newly-developed areas who have already agreed might not be too agreeable when they saw this new 10 per cent. charge clapped on to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to suggest to Deputy McQuillan that he would leave this motion until the scheme is completed.  All we can do at the moment is give a very rough figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy McQuillan agrees with me that the best approach to this can be made when the final figures are available.  That will be the time for a review of the charges.  I feel the House would much prefer that the E.S.B. should not receive any subsidy in future.  I think Deputies will agree that we would all much prefer that any of these boards should not be paid subsidies.  The E.S.B. are now an independent body, paying their way, and I do not think the House would be anxious to resume subsidising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural electrification scheme is progressing very satisfactorily and very quickly.  It could happen, if the board were to take on this extra burden, that it might slow down the work and the progress of the scheme would suffer.  Deputy McQuillan paid <Col N="166" /> a great tribute to the board and I feel sure that in this motion he did not intend to hamper the board or to slow up the progress of the rural electrification scheme.  I think we all see that it is much better to have an independent board than one which is depending on our subsidies.</P>
    <P>Now that Deputy McQuillan has heard me, I feel he will agree that it would be much better to defer consideration of his motion until the scheme is completed and until final figures are available.  At that time we will be able to go into the case fully and see what would be the actual cost of remitting these extra charges.  It would have been a different matter had it been the case that the board were making money by imposing these extra charges&mdash;that they were gaining something out of rural electrification through these charges.  As I pointed out earlier, the basis of these is only 4.2 per cent. and the sinking fund charges and others amount to 5.5 per cent., so that the board are really giving a very considerable concession at the present time to rural consumers. There are many cases such as those cited by Deputy McQuillan.  The whole thing can be reviewed when the scheme is completed and I feel sure that the special charges will be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say only a few words on this matter.  I should like to say that the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary is in my view illogical and nonsensical.  I suppose it was the best case he could make. He said these charges existed when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce. Does he not know that there has been a fundamental change in the scheme since that time and that the subsidy previously given from the Exchequer towards the capital cost of rural electrification has been abolished? These extra charges arose out of the situation in which there was a decision that there should be no loss shown on the board's revenue account because of rural electrification.  This Government have piled loss after loss on the board.  They have abolished the capital subsidy and made the E.S.B. carry the whole of the uneconomical element <Col N="167" /> in rural electrification.  They have made the E.S.B. repay the subsidy already given and made the board carry that charge on the revenue account.  Now the Government having swallowed the camel are talking about this gnat, this minor item of the additional charges imposed upon a small minority of rural dwellers.</P>
      <P>Let me give the Parliamentary Secretary some of the history attached to this matter.  When the scheme was started the E.S.B. carried out trial developments in a number of areas and as a result they reported to the Government as to the charges which would have to be imposed on rural dwellers to give them electricity without loss to the E.S.B.  On the basis of those charges it was decided that rural electrification was impossible&mdash;that the charges were so high only a very small minority of rural dwellers would be prepared to accept supply.  The Government of the day, at my instance, took a decision that the charge to rural dwellers for electricity should be on the basis of the then existing rural tariff of the E.S.B. and the board were requested to revise the finances of the scheme on the basis of that decision. The rural electrification scheme which was submitted to the Dáil and approved by the Dáil was based on these two principles: (1) That the E.S.B. should not lose anything over rural electrification and (2) that the uneconomic element would be carried by the capital subsidy, and (3) that where the capital cost of giving supply in any case exceeded 16 times the fixed charge revenue, this extra charge would operate.  But that is all gone now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Not entirely. Why do you not carry your history a bit further?  Who gave the E.S.B. power in 1953 to raise their charges?  You did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To anybody who is capable of grasping the facts, I will explain <Col N="168" /> the situation.  The rural tariff is a two-part system of making rural dwellers pay for electricity: (1) A fixed charge, based upon the valuation of the house, the income from which is designed to meet the capital cost of connecting with the network; (2) A charge based on the actual current consumed, a charge per unit.  Once the capital charge of bringing the network there has been ascertained, the cost is known and fixed for all time.  There can be no subsequent variation of that. Variations in the unit cost of current do not enter into this.  We are dealing with the capital cost of bringing the supply to the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the board's revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision taken by the Government of the day, and approved by the Dáil, was that the rural electrification scheme should not involve any loss to the E.S.B.&mdash;should not involve any additional charge upon the general revenue of the board.  Last year, the Government decided to tear that whole scheme up.  They decided to abolish the subsidy&mdash;to make the board pay retrospectively the amount already received by way of subsidy and to carry the whole cost.  They put a charge of £250,000 per year on the board's revenue by reason of the retrospective application of that decision. Now they argue that the board must not carry a loss in respect of rural electrification, merely to justify imposing this meagre and mean extra charge upon a very small minority of rural dwellers.</P>
      <P>Every rural dweller now given an electricity supply involves a loss to the board.  Is that not so?  The loss is big or small according to the actual cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no increase whatsoever in the charge to the rural consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The loss is on the E.S.B. and it will mount year after year until it is £1,000,000 per year. Deputy McGilligan has only to put his head on his hands and he will be asleep in a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude taken by the Parliamentary Secretary is immoral. Why should the E.S.B. supply one rural dweller with electricity at a loss and refuse to supply the other unless he pays something towards the minimisation of the loss?  Where is this 24 to 1 ratio?  Why not say to the board: &ldquo;Your job is to give a supply of electricity at a uniform rate of charge to every rural dweller and carry the cost.&rdquo;  That is what you decided last year.  Why not now?</P>
      <P>The logical consequence of the abolition of the subsidy would have been the abolition of the extra charge.  If the Government had done that they might have got more general approval to abolish the subsidy.  Once you decided that electricity consumers generally in towns and countryside should bear the whole cost of the uneconomic rural electrification supply, the case for an extra charge disappeared. There is no justification for it.  So far as I am concerned, I will give an undertaking that if ever again I become Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I will abolish it forthwith as unjustifiable and immoral. I hope Deputy McQuillan will put this amendment to the House and divide the House on it because it is entirely wrong to maintain that extra charge in the circumstances in which the subsidy was abolished.  How much would it cost?  Is it not a mere bagatelle in relation to the charges you put on the E.S.B. last year by abolishing the subsidy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This pretence that we can only get a rough estimate is nonsense. If you telephone the E.S.B. now they can tell you the exact amount that came in last year in respect of extra charges and they can give you the estimate for this year, too.  I say that the only reason why the Parliamentary Secretary will not name the <Col N="170" /> amount is because he is ashamed to do so.  The amount is so small, in relation to the charges they put on the E.S.B., that he would not humiliate his Government by mentioning them.</P>

      <P>No.  This talk of 10 per cent. extra charge on rural consumers is all nonsense?  It would not be noticed in the accounts of the E.S.B. if it were abolished.  The accountant could hardly work it down to a percentage so that the Parliamentary Secretary could understand what the difference would be in total revenue. Have a bit of common sense, and get rid of it.  It is the last remnant of the original rural electrification scheme.</P>

      <P>This has been described as &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;, &ldquo;meagre&rdquo; and &ldquo;mean&rdquo;.  Deputy Lemass is responsible for all the charges that call for these three adjectives.  The subsidy does not matter one way or the other.  I do not know whether I should say this in praise of them or in derogation of them but the fact is that the E.S.B. poked their fingers into Deputy Lemass's eye in 1953 when they got him to increase the charges.  Why did he increase them?  He increased them because he thought the E.S.B. were going to run into difficulties.  The result was that the E.S.B. became enormously wealthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, in a moment. Deputy Lemass knows very well that the E.S.B. got leave to increase their charges from him.  The result was that what they called their surplus revenue &mdash;they never make a profit: they are not supposed to&mdash;piled up to an enormous amount so that they had a bigger amount of money on reserve and for contingency than ever before. They put more money against renewals than they ever thought they would be able to do.</P>
      <P>When we abolished the subsidy last year, the E.S.B. were full of lamentations because, looking back statistically, there would probably be three or four seasons in which the E.S.B. would not do as well as it had done. It wants wet weather in certain seasons and at other times it wants dry weather.  The Deputy was full of lamentations.  Everybody spoke.  The prospects were desperate.  If we took away the subsidy, the E.S.B. would lose money.  They are well able to meet this charge.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass used the adjectives &ldquo;meagre&rdquo;, &ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;. He fixed the special charges.  He allowed the board to do it.  When he says the circumstances have changed, I say they have not as far as that is concerned.  Not one penny extra has been charged to the rural dweller in respect of electricity in the rural areas. Is that not right?  They are well able to finance it and carry it, without a subsidy of 50 per cent.  The situation of the E.S.B. is very well able to bear this charge, and I do not think that this charge matters very much at all. Do not forget, when voting for this, that legislation must hang on what is aimed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to go further back into history.  When the electricity legislation was being carried through this House, the great fear expressed was that it was not going to be economic. All the technicians and non-technicians in Fianna Fáil feared outside this House that the thing was going to collapse as a white elephant&mdash;I need not do more than repeat the phrase that was driving the people to a high state of frenzy.  Inside this House the fear that was bruited around was that <Col N="172" /> Dublin was going to be made the whipping-boy of the whole country, that we were going to take over a whole lot of uneconomic stations right through the provincial areas and that all the costs of the acquisition would be laid on Dublin.  The result was that against my will, because I had to meet all these fatuous objections, there was buried somewhere in the legislation a phrase that the E.S.B. would have to fix their charges in such a way that they met their expenditure and nothing more.  They were not supposed to make a profit and they should not have surplus revenue.  If they had, they should have a surplus account.  They should not try to charge any inhabitant in one area, that is defined as a transformer station area, the expense of bringing electricity to another area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

Was it not that people in an area getting a subvention up to a certain amount were not going to be asked to pay extra to bring electricity supply to people on the outskirts?</P>

      <P>I tell you that there is.  In the section that dealt with the <Col N="173" /> fixing of a charge there is a phrase that says that the expenses of giving electricity to people in one area are not to be charged on the people of another area.  If Deputy McQuillan carries his motion, he will be a sorry man because it may have effects he does not desire.  One would want to know an area to get any proper idea of the effect, but take an area where there are a lot of houses on the outskirts; remember that the people inside the area are benefiting by the rural area subvention and the people on the outskirts are paying a certain charge, but if those people paying the special charge have the special charge abolished, which is what this motion means, it is going to be spread on their neighbours.</P>

After the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks I must go on what I have already remarked, that is, that reduction in the special charges spread over the whole body of electricity consumers would not make any great difference; but a reduction in the special charges in certain areas, if they have to be levied off the other rural consumers in those areas, would mean a big difference.  What you may be doing, and I suggest you are doing, if you abolish those special charges, which is what the resolution requests, is that you may have to spread it over the people in the rural area.</P>

I have suggested to the Tánaiste before he went abroad that this might easily disappear, because there is no reason why you should stop at a certain point and say: &ldquo;Up to that point we will give a subvention and beyond that we will ask the people to pay.&rdquo;  The only thing is this: watch how far you are going if you are going to put any limitation or ceiling with regard to the valuation of premises.

I wonder will the last Deputy who has spoken go down and tell the people down the country the reason they cannot do it or why they reduced the subsidy.  I agree with Deputy Lemass.  The very point he made when he was speaking was, why should one section of the people in my constituency avail fully of electrification and why should a number of other people who just missed the rural electrification scheme be penalised? Why should they pay these extra special charges?  I think that is morally wrong.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Attorney General has just said it was going to upset the whole ecenomy of the E..SB. if these special charges are abolished.  I am going to put it to the Government&mdash;why do they not now restore the subsidy?  Is it right that a number of people in my constituency have to pay these extra charges in the rural electrification area?  These people are not the owners of big houses, as the last speaker tried to make out; they are owners of small houses, most of them small farmers and most of them have to manage with the candle and oil still, as a result of the decision of the E.S.B. I have asked a number of question in this House about these special charges and in the case of those I have been dealing with for the past two years in County Dublin, the extra charges have gone up.</P>

We are concerned with the small people who cannot go on paying these extra charges for all time.  I hold there is an obligation on this Dáil to be at least impartial and just to these people.  I go further and say, irrespective of this motion, that the whole thing was wrong and that it should never have been allowed to go ahead.  The last speaker said there would be extra charges on A. and B. and C.  I do not see how that can be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The records of this House will show that I have put down numerous questions and I have also put questions to the E.S.B. on this, and I hold that it is completely wrong for the Dáil to uphold a matter of this kind.  Deputy Lemass says it is morally wrong; I believe it is morally wrong, and I think it is wrong for any Government to hold the view that these people should pay extra charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Burke referred to what the position was and what the position is now.  The position is that there were extra charges before there was any change in the E.S.B. finances. As a person who went out and canvassed all round a rural area to get people to take E.S.B. light and power into their houses, I know that at that time the small house down the long lane had to pay extra charges under Fianna Fáil.  All that is wrong is that, because we are now in power, something that is unpleasant must be revolted against by Deputy Burke and the people must be championed.  Will Deputy Burke say now, were the extra charges there before we came into power or were they not?  Of course, they were.</P>
      <P>The position has been explained by the Attorney-General.  The E.S.B. is not allowed to make a profit, but the E.S.B. had made a profit which was referred to as surplus revenue and as a result it was in a position to stand on its own feet.  There has been no talk of the E.S.B. official who went down the long lane and measured the distance across the field to the nearest supply and decided what would be the cost of bringing the supply to the consumer who would have to bear the charge, whatever Government was in power.  Does Deputy Burke not understand that?  Perhaps he would prefer to go up drainpipes after votes Deputy Burke must stand up as the saviour of the down-trodden and it is not fair or just, because, as long as he stands up for the down-trodden he will get votes and get them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very much in favour of having the special charge done away with.  The E.S.B. is reaching into the worst areas now.  In the beginning they chose the better areas &mdash;areas which were more convenient and more accessible&mdash;but the situation to-day is different.  At the present stage of development of the E.S.B., they are reaching into areas which are backward and we find that there are more special charges coming into operation now than heretofore.  That cannot be denied and if one wishes to find out the true position, I am sure he will get the information from the E.S.B.  It is true to say that more special charges are being imposed now than at any other time for the reasons I have mentioned.  As I have said, the E.S.B. are getting into the more backward areas, where houses are more scattered and are far away from the main lines.</P>
      <P>Therefore, whatever the rights or wrongs of the special charge were up to now, if we want to supply these people&mdash;they are the people in the poorer districts of our country&mdash;and give them the same facilities enjoyed by the majority of the people in the rest of the country, we must do away with the special charge.  Otherwise, the backward areas will now have to pay over and above or help to subsidise the better-off areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> If, as was suggested, the E.S.B. were to be subsidised by the Government they could more readily do that and now is the time that subsidisation by the Government is really and truly necessary.  We have reached the stage where the areas which are to be done, or are being done, are the areas where the people cannot afford to pay.  Therefore, a subsidy is very necessary indeed.</P>
    <P>I am certainly, for the reasons I have mentioned, very much in favour of doing away with the special charge.  If necessary, in order to counteract any loss there may be to the E.S.B., I would suggest that the subsidy be reintroduced in order to supply Gaeltacht areas and areas along the western seaboard where the E.S.B. by imposing their special charges now admit it is uneconomic to go into these areas to supply the householders there. The position in future years will be that there will be, especially in the West of Ireland, areas left out, because the people, no matter how small the special charge may be, will not be able to afford to pay it.</P>

      <P>The E.S.B. is now going into the most uneconomic districts.  What happens, when the E.S.B. comes into part of a county, is that a survey is made and the most economic and best paying areas, as far as the E.S.B. is concerned, are picked first.</P>

      <P>If the special charge is not increased, if the charge remains the same, but if the number of cases where it is applied increases, then you will have fewer applications for the E.S.B. supply.  You find that, five years ago, the best areas were taken, developed and supplied.  Four years ago the next best areas were taken, developed and supplied.  Three years ago the next best areas were taken, developed and supplied.  At the present time and in the future the dregs will be taken.  That is why not only must we do away with the special <Col N="182" /> charge but we can make a very strong case for reintroducing a subsidy.  I would advise the Government to study the matter very closely and carefully and see to it that no section of the community, especially the poorer sections, are left without supply.</P>

      <P>As usual, the Opposition is trying to mislead the country on this matter.  Anyone who has any experience of rural electrification knows quite well that this special charge has always existed since 1947.

      <P>That is not the position. That was there all the time. The subsidy has nothing to do with it. What happened was that the increase allowed in 1953 by Fianna Fáil put the E.S.B. in the position that they had profits.  The Government last year were able to take away the subsidy and leave the E.S.B. in the position of being able to work on their own without any subsidy from the State&mdash;which was a very good thing.  It has been pointed out clearly, according to the present legislation, that if those extra charges are brought in at the same level the additional amount of money it will cost to install light will have to be spread over the particular area.  It will not be spread over the country as a whole.  In that way it will lean very heavily on those people.  The subsidy has nothing to do with the matter but it is a grand thing for Fianna Fáil to stand up and request that the subsidy be put back and that everything will be right.  The charges were there all the time and the giving back of the subsidy will not put the situation right.</P>

      <P>I want to support this motion.  I am surprised at the attitude of the Government Benches. It is not a question of who was responsible for putting on this charge originally or who was not.  The question is, who is going to take it off? The present Government, particularly the Labour section, were committed to <Col N="183" /> subsidisation.  Everyone will agree that rural electrification was one of the greatest boons conferred on this country by Fianna Fáil.  The present Government came in here committed to subsidisation in order to keep down the cost of living.  I should like to hear Deputy Tully on this question of rural electrification.</P>

      <P>The one thing which mitigates against its general acceptance is the rather difficult charge known as a fixed charge.  That is further aggravated in some cases by a special charge where a separate transformer has to be erected on the fringe of a development area to accommodate two or three houses.  The least one would expect, when the Government found the E.S.B. was making a profit, was that, instead of withdrawing the subsidy, they would have gone to the E.S.B. and said: &ldquo;Now that you are showing a profit we want you to apply this subsidy to the removal of the special charges which are prohibiting some people from getting the benefit of the E.S.B. service.&rdquo;  Is that not a very simple thing to do?  People who stand up here and say that the subsidy has nothing to do with it are either pretending they do not see that point or are too dense to see it.  Goodness knows, that was one opportunity given to the present Government to try to redeem itself in some little way in relation to the promise to keep down the cost of living.  The Government could have applied that subsidy, which was already there, to the E.S.B. and asked that body, in return, to reduce its charges.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the Government Benches get up now and tell the House that the subsidy has nothing to do with it.  Surely the Labour members of the Government, particularly those who pretend to have the interests of the rural workers at heart, should at least try to assert their influence, if they have any, with the Government and ask them to put back that subsidy and say to the E.S.B: &ldquo;Rural electrification is the greatest boon in the rural areas.  Will you please remove your fixed charges, so that every family will be in a position to take advantage of rural electrification?&rdquo; There are people who will never enjoy that amenity now, if the charges are not reduced.  Everybody knows that.</P>
      <P>Remember, there is an obligation on the Government, irrespective of what Party or Parties constitute it, to ensure that rural electrification is ultimately extended to every district and every hillside.  If the charges are going to be doubled, as they are at the moment in some cases, in order to extend rural electrification to certain houses on the fringes of a development area, then there will be thousands of people in the poorest sections of our community and in the most isolated districts who will never enjoy that amenity.  Would the Government, even at this stage, not consider reintroducing the subsidy and applying it in the way I suggest?  That is all that is embodied in this motion.  It is a simple issue and it is one which would redeem at least one of the many pledges the present Government has failed to keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the purpose of introducing a motion such as this at this time, remembering that the people who are supporting it so vigorously now were those who formed the Government <Col N="185" /> when these charges were first imposed and, later still, when these charges were increased.  I would rather imagine that responsible Deputies, as all Deputies here should be, or try to be, would regard the E.S.B. as the business-like concern it is and would regard it further as a concern prepared to devote its abilities and its energies towards the provision of electricity for the whole country, given sufficient time in which to do that.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with the view-point of Deputy Cunningham, since I come from a somewhat similar constituency; I can sympathise with his view-point that rural electrification must in time, and in the shortest possible time, be extended, not alone to every townland and village but to every isolated cottage and hamlet in the glen or on the hillside.  All that, however, will take time and will involve considerable capital outlay.  I do not for a moment accept the argument, and I do not think that those who advance it do so seriously, that the withdrawal of the subsidy of £250,000 in 1955 has anything whatever to do with the imposition of these charges or their continuance. Those charges have been there in part since 1947; they have been at their present rate since 1953.</P>
      <P>To test the sincerity of those who support this motion, I should like to know what action was taken, either individually or collectively, in 1947, or between then and 1953, and again in 1953, or since, to move the powers of Industry and Commerce which at that time allowed these charges to operate and to be not alone continued but increased by the E.S.B.?  What did Deputy Burke, for instance, do in 1953 when this happened?  Did he with the same vigour and with anything like the same anxiety and solicitude for the people of County Dublin approach Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the time of the imposition of these charges, and say, with the same apparent degree of sincerity that actuated his speech here to-night: &ldquo;Mr. Minister, you are not being fair to the people of my constituency in County Dublin?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there has been no change in these charges since this Government came into power and, as the Parliamentary <Col N="186" /> Secretary outlined the position here to-night, I, for one, see nothing wrong economically with the percentage of outlay claimed by the E.S.B. and their present ratio of charges.  I concede straightaway that these charges will prevent isolated householders from accepting the amenity of rural electrification at the moment.  Let us, however, look at this whole question of rural electrification from a national point of view. Let us not be influenced by the possible channel of voting power in any particular village or townland at the next general election, which may or may not have got the benefit of rural electrification by that time.  Let us rather look forward to the time when the E.S.B. will have devoted its time, abilities, energies and capital outlay towards providing the amenity of rural electrification for the people in the more easily accessible areas first; and, when that shall have been done, let us look forward to the time when the further capital outlay necessary will be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>Can we not then look forward to the time when the E.S.B., with its then surplus revenue, will be able to provide the necessary capital for the transformers and other equipment essential for supplying the hamlets and cottages in the isolated districts?  In our deliberation on their activities let us rather urge the E.S.B. to pursue their work with the same vigour as they are now pursuing it and with the same competence they are now devoting to that work, so that, in time, with less outlay, they will have surplus revenue to meet the requirements of people who may be denied this amenity for some time.  That is all I would ask of this House in its deliberations on this motion.  I would ask the mover of the motion to look upon it from that same national point of view and I would ask all the Parties in this House to reach a time of day or night, as the case may be, when a stoppage will be made to trying to seize upon aspects of certain national concerns for Party gains.</P>

      <P>Do not ask the people to believe that the subsidy withdrawal is in any way connected with these charges.  It might be more accurate to say that the restoration of the subsidy, in part or in whole, might enable the board to make more immediate concessions in relation to these charges, but do not try to make the point that the charges are the result of the withdrawal of the subsidy, because they are not.</P>

So far are they removed from quarrelling with it that the latest communication I have had from my constituency is one asking me to use my good endeavours to persuade the Government to set up a television station.  I would far rather try to further the living conditions of our people than to try to turn a national undertaking into a matter for political aspiration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker started off pretty well when he said that the E.S.B. was set up by Act of Parliament to produce electricity and to distribute it on a business-like basis. However, when the Government of the day wanted to confer on the rural areas the benefits which the E.S.B. had conferred on the urbanised areas, <Col N="188" /> the E.S.B. examined the proposition and reported back that they could not popularise these services on the same basis as they had been heretofore supplying electricity and that it would be a most impossible undertaking to attempt to supply electricity to the rural areas as a business proposition on the basis on which they were financed by the Acts passed in this House.</P>
      <P>When asked to say what additional finances the national Parliament should give, they indicated that the figure was 50 per cent.  That 50 per cent. was granted by this House.  A change of Government has since taken place and the extraordinary step has been taken of basing the finances of rural electricity back on the general working of the E.S.B.  Now we come to the effect of the elimination of the subsidy on the service.  Deputy McGilligan has said that the special charge was so insignificant that he believed that, if it was wiped out, the effect would not be noticed in the E.S.B. accounts.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should adopt Deputy McGilligan's proposition in that regard.  Deputy McGilligan has been Minister for Industry and Commerce and he should know a good deal about the finances of the E.S.B.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, he had intimate contact with the E.S.B.  Would it be possible to get the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the matter on the basis of the proposition put up by the Attorney General?</P>

      <P>I do not know if he did, but I prefer to make my appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary on the proposition as put forward by the Attorney-General rather than on something Deputy Lemass may have said.  If he would accept the Attorney General's proposition that these special charges are so insignificant that they would make no difference to the accounts of the E.S.B., it would put an end to all this argument.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said a number of times that they make no difference.  I put a question to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="189" /> last year with regard to a particular case.  It was the case of a consumer who was given the service in an area being supplied and who was then being asked to pay a special charge. Fortunately for him he had the undertaking in writing signed by an official of the E.S.B. to give him the service without a special charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the details of that case as well as anybody else.  Two or three other people were going to take the supply and they backed out.  If they had taken it, there would not be any attempt to make him pay the special charge, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The significant thing is that the E.S.B. did not change its operation, until the subsidy had been withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>And because the E.S.B. was not too sure that there was not the element of a written contract in the agreement with this particular consumer, they changed their ways. The E.S.B. were forced to re-examine the position of these special charges as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The second proposition of the Attorney General is that, if the subsidy is withdrawn, the E.S.B. will have to deal with a new position in the case of a number of these areas. He said that in certain areas a few spurs have to be left out because special charges have to be made and if these special charges are to be wiped out, the cost of supplying electricity to the people in these spurs will have to be borne by their neighbours in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept or reject the proposition made by the Attorney General that these spurs would have to be <Col N="190" /> relieved at the expense of their neighbours? Does the Parliamentary Secretary accept that proposition of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary wants to have it both ways.  He wants to interrupt me and, at the same time, when I put a question to him on his interruption, he will not answer me.  It would be just as well if the Parliamentary Secretary would let me make my remarks and if there is anything wrong with them, he can deal with them on some other occasion, if not on this particular motion.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General says that if these excepted spurs are now to be brought in on the same basis as their neighbours, they can only be brought in at the expense of their neighbours. If that proposition of the Attorney General is true, then it is an extraordinary attitude on the part of the E.S.B. and on the part of the Government to inflict these charges on the relatively restricted number of consumers in a particular area, when all those who have been supplied in rural Ireland with the electricity supply as a result of rural electrification are not now to be mulcted in the same way as a result of the withdrawal of the subsidy in general.  If the Attorney General can make a case to impose upon the limited number of consumers in a particular area the cost in connection with the few excepted spurs, surely, in principle, that must be applied to the general body of rural consumers who have been supplied by means of the subsidy.  Now that the subsidy is being withdrawn, they should also be made to bear the cost represented by the 50 per cent. subsidy which had been paid by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Attorney General really meant what he said.  I do not believe that he had considered it very deeply and I am certain, if he thinks twice about it, he will know his case will not bear any examination.  We stand on the case made by Deputy Lemass.  So many of us would not have spoken, and certainly I would not have <Col N="191" /> spoken, if the obvious sense of the proposition put up from this side of the House had been accepted or, if not, if the Parliamentary Secretary at least had said: &ldquo;We will consider it anew in view of the new position.&rdquo;  The position as it is now must certainly strengthen the case.  The Parliamentary Secretary represents a constituency that is very largely rural and he should know that rural electrification has been taken by the people in rural Ireland to mean what its name suggests. If the E.S.B. engineers go into a district, the sensible thing to do is to supply all the people in that area and not do what we are told they now propose to do, that is, serve the people who are on the main line of supply and tell the others: &ldquo;We will finish up the main job, and, next year or the year after, we will come back and serve the rest.&rdquo;</P>

I want to give him a case in which 100 per cent. of the consumers of the area have accepted. There are no objectors, no people hanging back, but among the consumers there is a number of spurs, a number of places sticking out that require extra poles and lines.  These people are also acceptors, acceptors on <Col N="192" /> the common basis but not on the basis of supplying a spur.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know whether the engineers say to these people: &ldquo;We cannot supply you now because the financing of the rural electrification scheme does not permit us to do it, but we will come back in the sweet by and by&rdquo;?</P>

Deputy Lemass has pointed out that, with the abolition of the subsidy, the general body of rural consumers have got their supply on a basis that was not originally contemplated and because the Government and the E.S.B. are not seeking to recover from these now supplied consumers the cost of half that subsidy, we say to him that he should treat these exceptional spurs in each of the areas on the same basis. Surely there is reason, cogency and substance in that argument?</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, the Attorney General, has said that the cost is so small as to be insignificant and to make no difference to the general accounts of the E.S.B.  If the Attorney General, who must know something about the E.S.B., is able to tell the Parliament of the nation that this figure is so insignificant, why have all this argument in Dáil Éireann about it?  Why not accept the Attorney General's proposition that it is a mere bagatelle&mdash;those are his own words? Is Dáil Éireann going to decide, in spite of the fact that the cost represents a mere bagatelle, to inflict a special charge on some of the people living in the remotest and most backward parts of the country?</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 9th February, 1956.</P>

      <P>Irish wheat when purchased by the miller from the farmer contains in a normal year a moisture content of 21.5 per cent. approximately.  The wheat has therefore to be dried down to a condition suitable for milling into flour and this entails a loss in weight of 7 per cent. to 9 per cent. on average.</P>

    <P>Figures for 1954-55 have not yet been received from the millers.</P>
    <P>The average moisture content of imported wheat ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent. and as wheat is milled at a moisture content of 16.5 per cent. moisture had to added to imported wheat to bring it up to this figure.</P>

      <P>The answers to the various parts of the question are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  (<i>a</i>)  262 gallons, under average conditions of salt and curd content of the butter.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)  293 gallons.</P>
      <P>(2)  Under average working conditions at creameries, the figures are 210 gallons and 17 gallons respectively.  Where &ldquo;break-water&rdquo; is added during the process of manufacture of the butter, the latter figure is increased proportionately.</P>
      <P>(3)  112 gallons on average but the figure can vary, depending on the composition (fat, salt, water content etc.) of the cheese.</P>
      <P>(4)  1.7 lb. on average but the figure can vary from 0 lb. for unsalted butter to 2.24 lb. for mildly salted butter.</P>
      <P>(5)  The average price paid by creameries in 1954 for the butter fat contained in milk supplies was equivalent to 18.66 pence per gallon of the whole-milk supplied.</P>
      <P>The separated milk is, of course, generally returned free of charge to the suppliers.  Where the separated milk is retained at the creamery, it is paid for separately and in such cases the average price of the whole-milk was increased to 20.9 pence per gallon. Buttermilk is not normally returned to milk suppliers and its value cannot, therefore, be assessed in terms of a milk price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The moisture content of the bulk of the wheat grown in this country varies between 20 per cent. and 25 per cent.  In exceptional circumstances the moisture content may be above or below these figures.  It is not possible, however, to quote an average figure for moisture content in Irish wheat because of variations in weather conditions during the harvest period and in methods of harvesting.</P>
      <P>As a general rule the moisture content of English wheat is lower than that of Irish wheat.</P>
