      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a formal Bill which, as I indicated yesterday, has been introduced, following the statement I made, to confirm the Imposition of Duties Order which I announced yesterday in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>A great number of people who read the papers this morning, who listened to the wireless last night and who had voted a couple of years ago in the expectation of better times, lower prices and lower taxation must have been wondering what hit them.  It is very important for the future of this nation that we should all know what has hit us.  I do not believe for one moment that the reason for this very big addition to our taxation and the great increase in the costs of the articles affected by these Orders was because the Minister for Finance, any member of the Government or any Deputy supporting the Government wanted deliberately to reduce the standard of life of our people.  It was not because the members of the Coalition Government thought the people were living too well that these <Col N="1734" /> taxes were imposed.  It was not because the Minister for Finance wanted to put a hairshirt on the people unnecessarily or to whip them with scorpions that these taxes were introduced.  They were introduced because the Government, in my opinion, had only one alternative, and they decided that it would be more difficult to face that alternative than to face the series of taxes on these articles.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Government went for a loan of £20,000,000.  They got £8,000,000 from the people.  The Minister for Finance pointed out that there was no hope of raising the money from the people in this year for the list of capital projects which he had outlined in the Budget.  There was no hope of getting it by voluntary savings and the alternative that the Minister had to this procedure of cutting down on the list of capital projects and adding taxes was to have compulsory seizing of savings or to raise the money by another method which, in fact, would mean compulsory savings and a depreciation of the currency.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, instead of introducing this third Budget in the financial year, might have brought forward a Bill, similar to the Bill which the British Parliament passed in the early part of the war, forcing our people to list their foreign investments and compelling them to sell them to the Government or to the Central Bank for Irish currency.  That would have been an alternative.  Another alternative, or portion of that same alternative of compulsory seizing of savings, would have been to introduce a Bill compelling the Central Bank and the ordinary commercial banks to surrender their foreign assets for Irish currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I do not believe this particular approach is the correct one in our circumstances.  It is better than nothing.  It is very much better than doing nothing and it is very much better than continuing the play-acting that we have been at for the last ten or 11 years.  There are, however, other alternatives which can be taken in due course.  We have to <Col N="1735" /> submit to this procedure to-day because the other alternative is not open immediately and the situation is so bad that something drastic requires to be done immediately.  This situation did not arise suddenly in these last few weeks.  This situation in which our people are consuming more than they are producing had its beginnings away back in 1947.  At that time there was a similar situation, though perhaps not as dramatic.  We had still more reserves of savings then than we have to-day but when the smouldering embers of inflation tended to burst into flame in 1947 action was taken by the then Government to stamp out these fires before they burst into flames and consumed our people.  Unfortunately, there were people then who, instead of helping the Government to stamp out the embers, threw oil on the embers at that time and in a year or so later when they got control started out deliberately to inflate the currency in order to avoid political difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday in the speech he read to the House said many wise things with which I agree wholeheartedly.  We tried to say those same things as best we could in 1947 and to get the people to listen to them.  Unfortunately the people did not listen to us then and it is now going to cost them and our children very dearly for not having done so because we had not as a people the wisdom to act from 1947 onwards on the very wise advice that the Minister for Finance gave us in portions of his speech yesterday.</P>
    <P>Inflation can come in other ways than by creating currency.  When the Government deliberately raises money by loan, by forced loans from the banks, and by foreign loans and spends that money on the ordinary current expenses of the State, it is bound to result in inflationary pressures. We are suffering to-day from inflationary pressures because the Government from 1948 to 1951 and the Government from 1954 to date, raised all the money it could by these means and spent them for the normal purposes of the State.  The volume of the money, therefore, in the hands of <Col N="1736" /> the people increased at a greater rate than production increased and that brings troubles in its train.</P>
    <P>I remember a Minister for Finance who was a member of the Coalition, stating that there was no evidence of inflation when prices were not rising, that there could be no inflation in such circumstances.  I pointed out then that a rise in prices inevitably followed inflation in a closed economy but that in an open economy such as ours, where surplus money can not only chase the goods within the country but can seek them out at the ends of the earth and have them imported, another symptom of inflation would arise and that is that we would have a deficit in our balance of payments.  The deficit in our balance of payments caused by inflationary pressures here was pretty high in 1947.  It was £20,000,000.</P>
    <P>To decrease that deficit, we introduced a Supplementary Budget.  We were told, when we pointed out the dangers to the national interest of the dissipation of our foreign reserves, that we wanted to give cheap money to &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; so that he could murder the Mau Maus and build houses for the British people.  There are gentlemen in this Chamber at the moment who denounced us then for not seizing this money, this money invested and held in England at ½ per cent., and distributing it here for various purposes rather than raise loans at the 2½ per cent. at which we were then borrowing money from the people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister for Finance has introduced this third Budget in this calendar year in order that certain of our reserves, reserves still to the good, should be kept in Britain for the support of &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; fighting the Mau Maus, or any group of people in any part of the world. The Minister for Finance has introduced this series of import duties in order to protect our foreign reserves so that the nation can progress with the certainty that is has something to fall back on on a rainy day.  He has introduced this third Budget too, as I said in the beginning, to avoid the alternative I outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> Our situation to-day is serious, but there are no grounds for despair.  Our great trouble is that affairs have been handled by people who were too optimistic as to the rate of progress we could make in this Twenty-Six Counties in our circumstances; and it is the over-optimists who have now become the super pessimists overnight.  Now there is a reasonable rhythm in human affairs.  There is also a reasonable rhythm in the increase in national production.  Back in what were called the booming 20's in the United States of America, the Americans at that time were able to increase national output by about 3 per cent. per annum. Three per cent. per annum was the maximum despite all the equipment installed in the factories and being purchased by the farmers.  During the last war that percentage was increased because the Government prevailed upon the people to save.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They got their people to save on non-essentials and they got them to work very much harder than they had worked before, and we all know the Americans' reputation for work.  By the beginning of the 1940's too industrial equipment had improved considerably in America.  In our circumstances we can expect a rate of progress nearer to the American standards of the 1920's rather than the American standards of the 1940's. Perhaps we can do better.  We can certainly do better if our people generally are put to work with more efficient machines and under the most efficient management.  But we cannot expect in our circumstances the fantastic rate of progress that was demanded of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1946-47 and in 1951, 1952 and 1953.  People must make up their minds that that fantastic rate of development is physically impossible.  Many people who have half read many of the modern economists believe that what Keynes said was not what he did say; Keynes said that what is physically possible is financially possible.  Now many people seem to think that what Keynes said was that what is physically desirable is financially possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> If we were to enter into a competition in this House, there are many members on this side of the House who could beat any of the Coalition members hollow in their desire for an immediate improvement in the standard of life for our people.  But we have got to realise that in our circumstances we are, by and large, lucky to have made the progress we did make since 1932.  Not only did we in Fianna Fáil have physical obstacles to overcome but we also had to overcome the greatest obstacle of all to co-operative effort in order to achieve reasonable progress, and that was pure ignorance on the part of people who should have known better, ignorance particularly of this vital question of finance.  Now we have tried to educate our people and I say deliberately that, although the Coalition Government must have cost the taxpayers a few hundred millions to keep them in office, a few hundred millions more that it would have taken to keep a reasonable Government making steady progress in office, that expenditure has been worth while if we have seen the last, and heard the last, of all the fallacies that have been enunciated here in relation to finance.</P>
    <P>We must realise that we started the industrial race very late in the industrial life of the world.  We were held down and industry was discouraged. When Fianna Fáil came in in 1932, we found what we knew before, that there was little or no knowledge of industrial management among our people. They were very well versed in how to import goods and how to distribute them, and they did that efficiently and well, but few of them knew how to make goods under a roof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, they built Guinness, Jacobs and Harland and Wolffs, which was not bad going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Over centuries; let the Minister not forget that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister for Agriculture and what I said do not really conflict.  I said that very few of them knew how to produce goods under a roof.  Guinness did, Jacobs did and Harland and Wolffs did, but the rest <Col N="1739" /> you could count on the fingers of your two hands.  By and large, in 1932, our people had no industrial skill.  We had not the managers; we had not the skilled experienced engineers and the other scientists who were necessary to produce goods under a roof in the modern world and, indeed, in the open in modern times.</P>
      <P>In coming back into Government after 20 years&mdash;it struck me at any rate &mdash;that, whereas in 1932, there was this great dearth of Irishmen who knew business methods, management methods and who were skilled in industrial progress, from 1932 onwards, during the 1930's and during the war and afterwards, we had been increasing our skill in these matters.  By the end of that period if we wanted to get advice on any industrial project, we could get as good advice by calling a few Irishmen together as we could by taking in foreigners.</P>
      <P>The sugar factory, as Deputies well know, was started in the 1930's by giving the concern over to foreigners.  By 1945, the factories were staffed almost 100 per cent. from engineers and management down to workmen, by Irish citizens and they were able to take the first, second and fifth places in the efficient production of sugar in the sugar beet factories of the world.  In 1932, when we wanted to get some knowledge of turf, we had to send for Germans and by 1945 foreigners were coming in here to see turf being produced and used efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity of going ahead in the future if we realise the limitations there must necessarily be to industrial progress.  We must realise that we were lucky to have got out in the Twenty-Six Counties from under the British heel at the time we did.  If we had not got out at that period, in my belief we would not have 2,800,000 in this part of the country at the present time.  We might have had the 800,000, without the 2,000,000.  Our people have got to realise that slow as has been our progress in relation to our desires, we would have been 1,000 imes worse off if we had not got some <Col N="1740" /> control over our affairs in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>We must realise, too, in looking at this subject that what has happened in an agricultural country has happened in many parts of the world.  When large families on a farm cannot get work, they go to the nearest industrial city to look for work.  In America, you have industrial centres like Michigan, Chicago and Detroit, but here the industrial cities to which our small farmers go are across the water.  That movement is not peculiar either to America or to here, but is taking place all over the world, wherever farm machinery has improved and wherever the standards of life in the cities have increased in relation to the standard of life on the smaller farms.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that these tendencies are there and we must not despair of the future simply because they make themselves evident here.  We have got to realise that it is a world tendency which we have got to face and make the most of it in our circumstances in the interests of our people.  The great reason for our people emigrating to England or America is that the rate of industrial development is too slow.  There is a rate of development in regard to agricultural production, but except in a rather limited number of agricultural products the output per man hour is more than keeping pace with the demand for goods</P>
    <P>In our circumstances, we must do all we can to increase our capital development in industry and agriculture.  We must do it at the greatest possible rate and we must not be deterred from doing it because certain people complain and denounce every person who puts a penny in an Irish industry as a racketeer.  If we are to get our people to put their money into Irish industries, we must do them the honour of recognising that their investment in Irish industries is not only profitable to themselves but honourable to themselves. Certain people have over the years denounced Irish people who put their money into Irish industries as racketeers and they are now searching the world looking for foreigners to <Col N="1741" /> come in here to invest and they do not call them racketeers.  When the Minister for Finance, back in 1955, announced with a great flourish of trumpets that he had told the banks not to increase their interest charges and had agreed with them that those who had £25,000 and upwards in the banks should get a greater deposit rate in order to keep the money within the Irish banking system, I pointed out that in my opinion his action was wrong and was not what was demanded. The Minister did not take my advice at that time but I want to repeat it now.</P>
    <P>My belief it that the most urgent demand at the moment is that the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank and with the commercial banks, should arrange, not that there should be an over-all restriction of credit but that there should be a selective distribution of credit along lines that would increase production in the shortest possible time.  The British Government at that time did something to have a selective distribution of credit, in 1955.  That is what is required here&mdash;not an over-all restriction but a selective distribution, to people who are going to use the money to produce more from the land or to produce more from the factories. A purely deflationary movement here is the wrong approach.  It is likely to create a lot of over-pessimism in regard to the future and we should be careful before embarking on it to any great extent.</P>
    <P>Now, this movement of the Minister's is, of course, a deflationary movement; it is to take money out of circulation. Remember that it will cause a lot of headaches.  There are many people affected by these lists of goods.  The increase in prices which will occur, not only the tax which the Minister collects but the normal percentage which the shopkeeper will add on that percentage, will mean an extra burden. If the Department of Finance collects £60 on £100 or 5/- on a few shillings expenditure, the shopkeeper will add his profit on to the 5/- which the Minister for Finance has charged him. On that account, if there were an alternative, it should be pursued, <Col N="1742" /> because it is a double hardship on people to pay the Minister for Finance 5/- and then have to pay an additional profit on that 5/- to the shopkeeper. The goods which are subject to this 60 per cent. duty will increase in price by more than twice, in a lot of cases, before they reach the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, and the people also, must realise that, extentsive as is this list of new taxes, this new list plus the list of levies imposed a few months ago, affects only 18 per cent. of our imports.  Even if the taxes had the effect of cutting out the whole 18 per cent., the whole £36,000,000 worth of goods affected by these levies, they still would not fill the gap.  Last year our adverse balance of trade was well over £30,000,000.  This year it is running much higher.</P>

      <P>We are running at about the same rate of deficit as last year, but we are running down stocks.  The Minister for Finance did not give the figure, but he pointed out that one of the reasons why the imports were less than last year was that we had imported less wheat, less tobacco and less sugar.  We are running down the stocks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What I say is that the Deputy is misquoting me.  If I may say this in clarification, there is no doubt that stocks were run down in the first half of 1956, just as there is no doubt that stocks were built up in 1955 over the average as well.  One is an over-average one way, the other is an over-average the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to exaggerate the situation.  What I want to do is to get the facts and try, if we can, to draw the proper conclusions from them.  My point is that, even if these levies were so effective as to cut out all the goods affected by them, it would not right the situation.  If they cut out, and the Minister's figures are approximately right, we would about balance but we would have no surplus and we would still be in the situation that the Minister for Finance, having on his list of capital projects £37,000,000 worth&mdash;he now thinks he can get £20,000,000&mdash;could hardly raise the other £17,000,000 just on the basis of cutting out this list of goods.  It is fantastic to think that this list of goods would be completely wiped out, <Col N="1744" /> absolutely fantastic.  People will get all these various commodities.  Indeed, many people must get them in order to keep going.  Many of these levies affect all classes of small manufacturers and small people who use these goods for production and they must get them.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Minister for Finance expects that all the motor cars and all the other goods affected by these levies will be cut out.  His estimate was very much lower than 100 per cent. effectiveness of these duties.  So, looking at this situation calmly, great as are the hardships that will be imposed on the section of the community who import, sell and use the classes of goods in these two lists, it will not do the trick of balancing our payments.  The lists affect only 18 per cent. of the commodities that we import and, if they are reduced by 20, 25, 33 per cent., it still requires a very big effort to get rid of the adverse balance of payments that has still to be faced.  The question is, how can we do it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I believe that we should make certain that the Government shows the right example and I hope the Minister for Finance is not going to have another few millions to give to the civil servants for nothing, in order to touch off another round of inflation.  In my belief, if there was one single time in the Government policy that was more effective than others to touch off the inflationary trend that we have had in the last couple of years, it was that unnecessary £1,000,000 odd that was given to the civil servants without either legal or moral compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even the Tánaiste, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is running around the country at the moment talking about the increase in wages, that the disability that C.I.E. is suffering from is the increase in fuel prices and the increase in wage levels.  He is going to other places and doing the same thing.  If I wanted to parse the phrases in his speech introducing this Bill, I could show that the Minister for Finance is doing exactly the same thing.  The Government set the headline. <Col N="1745" /> They gave this £1,000,000 without any compulsion and when the people saw that the Government had £1,000,000 to give away for no compelling reason, they saw no reason why they should not try to compensate themselves for the increase in the cost of living and they did it and that is a large part of this inflationary trend.</P>

      <P>I repeat that if there was one thing that the Government did more than another to touch off the inflationary trend two years ago, it was this unnecessary gift of £1,000,000 to the civil servants and in the long run it did the civil servants no good.  There are many of them who got £10, £20 or £30 and, if they want a new car, they will pay another couple of hundred pounds on it now or, if they want to take a ride in a bus, it will cost them very much more than it did before they got this gift.</P>
      <P>When the Government gave this gift to the civil servants, every trade unionist in the country said: &ldquo;We will have to get something too,&rdquo; and they got it and the Government are now complaining that the wage rates are too high, that there is more personal income than there are goods being produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture wants to talk to the Minister for Finance, I wish he would have the courtesy to take him out and talk to him.

      <P>The second great mistake that the Government made was this: they had told the people that they could reduce prices back to the 1951 level.  When they came in and could not carry out that promise they indicated that they were going to allow and encourage an increase in wages and salaries to compensate for the increase in prices.  Now they complain that the wage and salary levels are too high for the production.  They are, but they would not have been half as high, the people would have been more content to accept a reasonable standard of living in 1954, if the truth and the facts had been told and if they had not been encouraged to expect miracles.  They are being compelled now to face a very big decrease in the standard of life simply because the Government would not encourage them &mdash;and in fact did the reverse&mdash;to accept a reasonable standard in 1954.</P>
      <P>Our people would have been prepared to accept a reasonable standard of life, what the country could afford, in 1948 and in 1954, if they had been told the truth.  They were not told the truth.  It was represented to them that all this business of increasing the standard of life, of lowering prices, was as simple as rolling off a log.  If it was as simple as that, why should the people not demand an immediate doubling of their standard of life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture can say that my policy to meet this situation is not to put on these levies, but to soak the Civil Service.  He can say it till Tibb's eve, but I am only saying to the Civil servants and others in public what I have said in private.  When I was negotiating with them for some years as Minister for Finance, I told them that they would have to accept a standard of life in keeping with the standard of life our people could afford <Col N="1747" /> and that, if this nation wanted to progress, we could not tax people who were very much worse off than they in order to put them on a standard very much higher than we could afford.  I should like to see every civil servant in the country, as well as every other person, living at twice the present standard of life, but if we are ever to reach that stage, we must make steady, reasonable, and persistent progress within our competence to that end.  If we try to jump a 20-foot river when we can only jump ten, we get into the middle of it.  The Coalition Government have landed us in the middle of the river they thought they could jump but could not.</P>

We are, at this stage in our history, imposing these taxes and cutting down from £37,000,000 to £20,000,000 or less for capital development because the Minister for Finance cannot find the money.  It is argued that not only should the Minister for Finance find the money, but that the people should find the money with which to pay him that money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is compelled now to reduce capital expenditure and to increase taxation on these commodities, because he is short of money.  He is short of money because the people have not got it to give to him.  They would have had very much more money to pay the Minister for Finance and to pay everybody else, if the Minister for Agriculture had not got his head in the Department of Agriculture.  In 1955, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget speech, adverted to the fact that in 1954 we had a very good year in our balance of payments and he showed that one of the reasons for that was that we had such a bumper harvest of wheat.  We had not to import as much wheat in 1954 as we had in 1953.  Feeding stuffs were something the same. In 1954, we had to import less because in 1953 we had had a good harvest. However, whatever it is, it is in the Budget speech of 1955, that one of the reasons for the improvement in the balance of payments was that our wheat production was so good that we had not to import so much.  If the Minister denies that, I will get the quotation.  The Minister for Finance is wiser than the Minister for Agriculture in certain ways.</P>
      <P>We have taken steps in the last couple of years to discourage the production of wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture objects to soaking the Civil Service but he did not object to soaking the farmers to the extent of 12/6 a barrel.  If the Minister for Agriculture wants to tell me what is in the document he is waving, I shall be delighted to listen to it.</P>

      <P>Now that the Deputy has invited me, I will read it.  It is dated 22nd January, 1954, and is written by Mr. Muiris Ó Muimhneacháin:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to refer to the memoranda dated the 18th instant submitted by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, relative <Col N="1749" /> to policy in regard to the growing of wheat and to inform you that the Government at a meeting held to-day decided.</P>
    <P>(1)  that the general aim of policy in regard to the growing of wheat should be to secure an annual mill intake of about 300,000 tons of dried native wheat; and</P>
    <P>(2)  that the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Finance should consult together immediately with a view to</P>
    <P>(a)  finding solutions of the problems concerning transport, drying, storage and finance that are likely to arise in connection with the disposal of home-grown wheat of the 1954 crop; and</P>
    <P>(b)  ensuring that adequate facilities will be provided on a permanent basis to handle, in future years, an annual crop of the magnitude represented by a mill intake of 300,000 tons of dried native wheat.</P>
    <P>It was hoped that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would submit, for the information of the Government, a memorandum which he had received from Grain Importers (Eire) Limited concerning policy in regard to the growing of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was, I think, a direction to the Government of which the Deputy was a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

We got it in floods when he came in and had to deal with it.  Let him cut out that sort of talk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the average rate of production in this country of wheat had been around a ton per acre&mdash;it has been a bit less, but a ton of wheat per acre is bigger than average&mdash;450,000 acres would have been required to produce 300,000 tons of dried wheat plus the ordinary seed required to sow 450,000 acres.  The Minister for Agriculture did not soak the civil servants, but he soaked the farmers to the extent of reducing the acreage of wheat at a time when it was urgently necessary that we should grow all the wheat we could in order to get out of these difficulties.</P>
      <P>All this fuss and bother is to reduce the import of a number of commodities by £5,000,000.  We consume about £18,000,000 worth of wheat in the year, and if we are to cut out wheat growing altogether, we will have to have a list like this, but four or five times the size of it, in order to save the money to purchase wheat.  The Minister for Agriculture and others like him have tried to lead the country into the belief that you cannot have wheat and good grass and other crops at the same time.  He always has denounced the growing of wheat and he has made a fetish of grass.  What I want to see is plenty of good grass, and good wheat, and it is on the good wheat farms that you get the good grass.  Where there is nothing but a collection of weeds, which are green for a couple of months of the year, that is called a grass farm in this country and the many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, not only from the point of view of our balance of payments in relation to the purchase of wheat, that wheat should be encouraged instead of being discouraged, and that, if necessary, the civil servants should have been soaked instead of the farmers.  It is important that the farmers should be encouraged to produce in our circumstances every ounce of wheat they can.  The more <Col N="1751" /> wheat they produce the fewer of these type of taxes we will have to pay.  The people who will suffer from this list can thank the Minister for Agriculture for portion of it.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to mouth about &ldquo;one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough.&rdquo;  What we want is to have those things done and the Government to take the steps necessary in order to encourage them to be done.  We do not want that sort of stuff mouthed as it was from 1948 to 1951 when 500,000 acres went out of tillage.  While the Minister for Agriculture was prating about &ldquo;one more acre under the plough,&rdquo; 500,000 acres went out from under the plough, and there were fewer cows and fewer sows. The same thing has happened since the Minister for Agriculture came back again.  Do not let us forget that.  The people who will have to pay all these taxes can realise that one of the reasons and one of the major causes for it is the fact that, since 1947, we have not had a steady, persistent agricultural development programme.</P>
    <P>In 1948, the present Minister for Agriculture, as one of his first actions threw out the lime subsidy.  He has been pedalling around the country on one wheel ever since talking about the fact that there was no ground limestone when he came in.  It is true there was no ground limestone a few years before that in any part of the world.  It was a new development.  But when the war was over and it became known you could grind raw limestone to a fineness that would do as much good as burnt limestone, we took steps to ensure that it would be produced in this country, and we had in the Estimates a subsidy for ground limestone as well as for burnt limestone. The first action of the Minister for Agriculture was to cut those out in 1948.  The Minister has been cycling around since on the one-wheeled bicycle and the 4-inch nail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And he has been cycling around from 1948 to 1951 watching 500,000 acres going out from under the <Col N="1752" /> plough and into poor grass.  If it had gone into good grass, I would not mind.  If it had gone back into grass, limed and fertilised to the maximum extent, and if it had been farmed properly, we would be very much better off than we are at the moment. What we want to do is to make certain that the land that is tilled is tilled well and that the land in grass is well cared for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government now cannot afford a couple of hundred pounds for houses but they have spent twice that much on some of the worst land in the country that would not in a million years yield 200 pence not alone the £200 spent on it.</P>

You cannot get away from the fact that this country has been suffering from misdirection by the Department of Agriculture between 1948 and 1951 and <Col N="1753" /> between 1954 to date and we are putting on these taxes simply because the Government went galloping around to improve the worst lands in the country, instead of taking advantage of the scientific knowledge at their disposal to improve the production on the lands which have already been drained.</P>

      <P>It was represented then that the £40,000,000 which we got from American aid would have to be spent anyway and that reclaiming the swamps would be as good a way of spending it as any other.  They were, however, spending the money of the Irish people and the people should have got the last farthing's worth of profit out of it.  Instead, the Minister for Agriculture put over-emphasis on long-term drainage and on improvement of the worst land in the country rather than on the immediate improvement of good and fairly good lands which were already drained.  It is for that reason that we have not had any real progress in agricultural production from 1947 to date.  I believe that our agricultural production increase could have been somewhat in keeping with the increase in other countries in Europe.  We could have done as well as the British with a 50 per cent. increase, but our increase has been nil because we have the present Minister for Agriculture galloping around and cycling around on one wheel to the worst bogs in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope our people will bear this lesson in mind.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested as a solution of our difficulties that we should have a ten-year plan.  So far as I am concerned, that is out.  What we want to do is to improve things as quickly as possible and to see what there is to be done instead of wasting time for the next couple of years trying to make plans for what can only be a completely unpredictable future.  What we will do in two years' time depends on what we are going to do next year and what we are going to do next year depends on what lead the Government will give the country in the next few months.  It is urgent that we should get going now and while, as I say, I do not believe in the approach of the Minister for Finance to this whole financial problem, I think that what he has done is much better than doing nothing at all.</P>
      <P>Much as I regret the waste of effort and the loss of time and money and of our external assets over the last few years, I think in the long run it is good for this country, if not only the members of the Coalition Government but the people are brought to a realisation of the basic facts of finance and economics and to a realisation that if we do not produce what we consume or do not produce sufficient to pay for all we consume, we cannot have a higher standard of living, unless we live at the expense of the people's savings or on loans.  The Government has done both in the past five or six years.  The people must learn that they have to live within their incomes and they must be encouraged to save.  If there is to be any possibility of development, it cannot come by encouraging the people to live by foreign loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest development is that of foreign investments.  In that matter, it is a fact that every £1 of foreign investments brought into this country will eventually appear in the external assets of our banks.  People should realise that that is the financial effect <Col N="1755" /> of investments of that nature.  The people who have been prating so much about leaving our external assets in England at a ½ per cent. are now selling portions of our country by way of foreign investments and they should realise that, in doing so, they are merely creating external assets in England.  Few people seem to realise that, but that is the financial truth of the matter.  Every penny of foreign money invested here is in fact an increase in the external assets.  If we had had no external assets and had spent them on acquiring this equipment and the technical know-how for these developments, it would have been much better for the country in the long run.</P>
    <P>As our leader pointed out yesterday, it is a disastrous business to go for foreign loans and I hope that the Government will not be so crazy and disloyal to the interests of our people as to look for these foreign loans.  We must stand on our own feet and our people can do it and, if necessary, they can go without and would be prepared to do so in the interests of the development of the country.  I believe our people have learned a lesson but it has been an expensive lesson.  It will, please God, be a lesson worth the money it has cost.</P>

No. 2, he said the Government&mdash;that is, the inter-Party Government&mdash;was wrong in saying that they would reduce the cost of living and then allowing wages to rise to meet any increase that they were unable to prevent.  That is his second proposition. His third was that the Government was wrong in making Dillon Minister for Agriculture.</P>

To hear him for the last hour and a half, one would think that he was the prophet Jeremiah proclaiming a flood and warning us to abandon hope and take to our prayers.  Now he is as gay as a thrush when he has got it all of his chest and feels that his work is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, I am doing my best to show him the customary courtesy of debate, namely, to make some observations on his speech before I start making my own.  I am in great difficulty indeed in trying to find material <Col N="1757" /> out of that last hour and a half on which to make civil comment.  Deputy Aiken charged this Government with having the fault of over-optimism. Certainly nobody could charge him with that fault after listening to him for the last hour and a half.  Mark you, if there is to be a fault and one is responsible for the welfare of one's own neighbours and one's country, I would respectfully suggest to the House that it is better to err on the side of optimism rather than on the side of pessimism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about gross agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>But the net is the important thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to it in a moment.  Observe the instruments employed by the U.S.A. which incite the admiration of Deputy Aiken. Savings: I think we are exhorting our people to save.  Is not that one of the devices we are at present employing to resolve the problems that at present confront us?  Working harder: I think it is true to say that I was down in Ballinasloe on Friday night, addressing Macra na Feirme and saying to that body: &ldquo;Listen boys, the solution to our present problems is that we should work harder on the land and save as much as we can.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Improvement of industrial equipment is the third thing that incites Deputy Aiken's admiration in contemplation of the Americans.  Will anyone deny that we have very materially improved the equipment of the agricultural industry here in the last nine years?  If Deputy Aiken would cease looking back a quarter of a century to what was happening in the U.S.A. and concentrate his attention on what is being done in his own country to-day he would find to his amazement that the very things that make him an admirer of the U.S.A. 25 years ago are the very things that are being done to-day by his own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that our agricultural production has not improved and there is no use blathering about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He will agree with me <Col N="1759" /> that the Government is promoting saving, exhorting the people to work harder and improving the equipment of the agricultural industry.  He says the levies are deflationary.  I am trying to follow the points he made.  I want to suggest to the House&mdash;I think it is an important thing to keep under constant attention&mdash;that the levies are designed primarily to persuade people to postpone their purchases of the articles described.  The ideal operation of these levies would be if everybody could get along for the time being without any of the commodities mentioned. The ideal would be if everybody could get along for the time being, and for a strictly limited period, without importing any of these things or paying any tax upon them.</P>
      <P>Now, we could prohibit all these items altogether, but it is because we take cognisance of the fact that rigid prohibitions may work great hardships that we do not take that step.  But one must put on a levy which will discourage everybody from using these things, unless it is absolutely essential that he should, so that we may reduce the gap.  Surely, that is a sensible way of going about it.  Surely it is sensible to find out the things that we can do without and then make it as inconvenient as possible, short of absolute prohibition, to bring these things in until such time as we can afford them.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I am being unduly controversial when I recall to mind that, when I was listening to Deputy Aiken here this morning wailing about the awful catastrophe of the adverse balance of payments, my mind went back to the day when he was thundering forth from the place wherein I am now standing the theme that this country would be much better off if all the ships were sunk at the bottom of the sea and we had no external trade at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that I said what the Minister for Agriculture has stated. We were here in the middle of a war. We were being threatened that if we did not come into the war we would be starved into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's very anxiety shows that he is experiencing certain qualms of conscience about the consistency of the various representations he made to the House from time to time.  I do not deny for a moment that consistency is the bugbear of small minds and in this matter the Deputy has a mind as big as a mountain. He can change it, and wisely change it, in the intervening years. The proposition the Deputy put forward fills me with amazement and dismay. He said that in 1947 we were threatened with inflation.  That is an astonishing proposition when you call to mind that, in 1947, we had fewer cattle in this country than at any time since the Famine.  We had fewer sheep than at any time since the Famine.  We had fewer pigs than at any time since the Famine and the land of the country was in such a state of dereliction that <Col N="1761" /> a new disease had appeared called aphosphorosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was discovered on the high veldt of South Africa and was unknown in Ireland.  A stage was reached where our land had become so deficient in phosphates that cattle grazing upon it were developing a condition characteristic of the high veldt of South Africa and dying of starvation.  Were we threatened with inflation when there was waiting the work to do to restore that land to fertility and restore our capacity to provide employment for the people leaving the country in unprecedented multitudes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a minute.  I want to recall this.  The Deputy says that they in Fianna Fáil were rebuked for seeking to build up our reserves in Great Britain in 1947. Does Deputy Aiken forget what happened the reserves we built up through sweat and tears in Great Britain 18 months later?  We woke up one morning and found one-third of them had been swept away for which we got nothing at all.  We went to bed on a Monday night with £520,000,000 in Great Britain and we woke up on Tuesday morning to discover we had less than £400,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in this situation, we cannot get consistency of attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny the difficulty. I will ask Deputy Aiken not to go away.  Would he sit down for a minute?  I think the Deputy ought to have that civility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put it to the House&mdash;I cannot put it to the Deputy now as he has gone&mdash;that what we have got to do is to try to proceed on lines of rational prudence to provide for our <Col N="1762" /> people in their own country a reasonable standard of living.  Am I unjust if I recall to this House the fact that in every census since 1847 there was a reduction in the population of this country and then the inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 and for the first time in 100 years, the decline in the population in this country appeared to be arrested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You will do it now, I suppose.  Of course, it is not true. Emigration increased every year from 1947 on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a simple fact.  Is is true or false?  A census was taken every five years for 100 years. Every five years that census showed the population of Ireland had gone down for 19 quinquennia and then the inter-Party Government came in in 1948 and embarked upon what Deputy Aiken said was a course of conduct of reckless expenditure, improving the lot of our people instead of building up reserves.  The 20th census was taken and for the first time in a century the downward trend in the population of this country appeared to have stopped.  We had recorded for the first time in a century that what were called the vanishing Irish were beginning to grow again in our own country, not as fast as we would wish them to grow but at least to grow instead of dwindle.  Then there was another census in 1956.  We had had the blessings of the 1952 Budget.  We had 1953 and 1954 and then Fianna Fáil went out of office.  Then we had another census taken in 1956, when lo and behold, the trend of the previous century was restored.  Not only was the natural increase being swept away but a few of the existing population were going as well.  I pointed out that that fact is capable of more interpretations than one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I tried to extend to Deputy Aiken the courtesy of a comment on what he said, &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; as I thought it to be.  Here is my speech and here is what I intended to say.  It <Col N="1763" /> was written before I came in.  Here is what I wrote while Deputy Aiken was talking.  I am not one of those who believe that Dáil Éireann is a contemptible institution.  I think debate is good.  I think those people who talk about Dáil Éireann being too emphatic and violent are all daft.  We have the best conducted deliberative Assembly in the world.  We are not afraid to say what we mean and then when decisions are taken, we can abide by them; and that is what I intend to do to-day, to match our policy against the Fianna Fáil policy.  That is why I wanted to hear from Fianna Fáil what was their policy. I thought Deputy Aiken was going to tell us their policy for the situation that at present confronts us.</P>
      <P>I ask the Dáil if I unfairly paraphrase what Deputy Aiken said this morning.  I do not think I have&mdash;and I think it is &ldquo;tripe&rdquo; and I think it makes no contribution to the solution of the problems with which we have been confronted.  Remember this, that we are told on this side of the House that the monolithic mind of Fianna Fáil has resolved on certain weighty policies to resolve these problems. Come now, who from Fianna Fáil&mdash; and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to do it to-day&mdash;will reconcile for me Deputy Lemass's programme of £100,000,000 capital expenditure to be financed by the joint stock banks and Deputy MacEntee's and Deputy Aiken's lamentations over the excessive investment of the inter-Party Government?</P>

      <P>Amen.  On the other side, we have Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken.  I want an explanation of that, because I am not the only person in this country who asks himself the reason why.  Unlike the Light Brigade, it is not my duty not to ask the <Col N="1765" /> reason why.  In a deliberative assembly, it is my duty, as it is the duty of Deputies on the other side of the House, to ask the reason why. Fianna Fáil asked us the reason why; and, having given fair and courteous consideration to Deputy Aiken's speech this morning, I want to deal with the problems we have before us and the methods by which we propose resolutely to resolve them.</P>
      <P>Might I first draw the attention of this House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to the fact that, to judge from much that is said in this House, one would imagine that Ireland alone, in a world riding upon a storm of prosperity, was in the trough of despond&mdash;is that an unfair interpretation of what the Opposition has had to say?&mdash;that we, by our improvidence, we by our indifference to sound finance, we, by our criminal disregard of their wise cautionary tales, have got ourselves into a sea of sorrow in which no one but a fool would find himself involved. Have they forgotten?  Have they forgotten that Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, France, Italy, Spain, Australia and New Zealand are all struggling at this time with balance of payments problems?  There are only two countries in Europe free of them &mdash;one is Western Germany and the other, I think, is Portugal.  With the exception of those two, all the others are confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Were they all guilty of the same follies alleged against this Government, or are they all different?  Is our case in Ireland identical with the case in Great Britain?  Is Great Britain in balance of payments difficulty?  I think she is.  Is Ireland in those difficulties? I think she is.  Are the circumstances in Great Britain the same as the circumstances here?  I think they are not.  I think that in Great Britain their problem is over-full employment and that over-full employment is having its reaction on us here, because it is creating a vacuum that is drawing our people out of good employment in Ireland into industrial employment in Great Britain.  I see them go; I have seen young men and young women with £6 or £7 a week in rural Ireland, leave their jobs and go to work in London, <Col N="1766" /> Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester. Every one of us knows that.  What can we do about it?</P>
    <P>I say that one of the most cherished freedoms that a free people could enjoy is the right to come or go, to live within the jurisdiction of a Government or leave it, as they wish.  Is it proposed that we should forbid them to go?  Certainly, I will never forbid them to go and no Government of which I am a member will ever seek to abridge that most precious sovereign freedom of a free man, that is, to travel whither his inclination leads him to go.  I should like to see conditions here of a character which would induce the majority of our people to prefer them to anything they could find abroad.  There is no use in our deluding ourselves by imagining that anything we can provide here in our circumstances is going to provide a superior alternative in the eyes of some of our people to what life in London, Birmingham or Manchester can offer. They like it there&mdash;and, listen, when we are all getting so blooming virtuous about it, how many of us in this House can say that when we were one and 20, we did not do what they are doing now?  I went to America.  I worked in America; I worked in London.  How many Deputies have not a similar story to tell?  It is when you are past 50 that adventuring abroad begins to look to you as if it were a crime and evidence of wicked irresponsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We proposed certain policies for correcting the balance of payments and I want to dwell a moment on these.  We are charged occasionally that we are not sufficiently harsh and ruthless in what we undertake to do, that if we have to increase a burden we think too long.  Is that a crime?  I always thought, in the words of Tom Kettle, that the State in action was a splendid spectacle, that it was the great human conspiracy against hunger and poverty, loneliness and want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we to be rebuked if we are chary or cautious before we impose a burden lest we unnecessarily aggravate the difficulties of the people for whom we are responsible?  I think we would be false to our trust, as those responsible for the great human conspiracy against loneliness and want, poverty and distress, <Col N="1768" /> if we were not solicitous before imposing a burden.  Look at the members opposite, like birds in a cage, twittering to one another now, in good cheer.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise to the Opposition that these measures for restricting imports are a purely transitory palliative measure for an immediate problem.  They are of no value in the long-term resolution of the problems of this nation.  They are put on purely as a transitory measure to deal with an immediate emergency, with the active desire in the heart of every member of the Government to get them off as soon as it is possibly practicable to do so. Does the Opposition understand that because it is important that they should?  Let them not rivet their attention on these long lists.  They do not matter a damn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  no.  They are formidable and we do not deny that they caused us long and anxious thought before we put them on even for a week or for a day but what the Minister for Finance said, and what everybody else has said, is that these are put on as an emergency measure to deal with an immediate situation.  They have no relevance to the long-term plan because the long-term plan is one of production and not of restriction.  That is what is wrong with Fianna Fáil; that they are obsessed with the idea that the way to solve our problems is to shrink, like Alice in Wonderland, by eating the mystic mushroom, to so small a size that we can slip through any keyhole.</P>
      <P>Our belief is that if the economy of this country is to endure, it must be based on a policy of expansion, to employ more and more of our own people in their own country and to provide a greater and greater quantity of products which we can profitably export wherewith to import those commodities which a rising standard of living for our own people would induce them to want to buy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that end, then, we have put our hand to the task of expanding agricultural production because, so far as we can see, the only enduring prospect <Col N="1769" /> of sustained increased earnings by exports for our people is the land and unless we get it from the land there is no other source from which we can get it.  We have not got in this country coal or oil or iron or any other of the great natural resources with which other countries are endowed.  Our practically solitary natural resource is 12,000,000 acres of arable land and it is from that and from the people who live and get their living on it that we must ultimately get the exportable surplus with which to purchase the higher standard of living that we aspire to procure for our people in town, city and country.</P>

      <P>In order to provide the increased output from the land, I want to ask the Deputies of this House is there or is there not required capital investment in the land?  I believe there is.  Now I am charged with feeling undue solicitude for the poorer quality land of this country.  I make no apology for that.  I was brought up in the congested areas of Ireland and I knew from personal experience that drainage, and what we know in this day as the rehabilitation of land, extended from the big house to the demesne wall and it was done at a penny a day by my people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I wrong when I, as Minister for Agriculture, am disposing of the resources of this country, to say that the amenity that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers provided for the landlords of this country at a penny <Col N="1770" /> a day shall be brought out beyond the demesne wall on to the lands of the small tenants who hung on to their land when Lord Lucan and his kind were trying to drive them off?  I did say that the amenity that the men of 1847 brought to the landlords in their land should now be made available to their grandsons and great-grandsons out of capital investment through the land rehabilitation programme.  I do not think I was wrong.  I would do it again to-morrow, and, please God, we will do plenty of it yet.  Fianna Fáil told us that we ought to leave out that land, that it was not fit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; as the first step. My answer to that is: No.  I believed that the poor people who made it possible for us to have our land at all were as much entitled to that amenity as those who held land in the richest counties, and I went to Castlebar and pinned on the wall of the house where the Land League was founded a memorial to Michael Davitt dedicating the land project to his memory. Michael Davitt would have turned in his grave if he heard it said that a project dedicated to his name was first to be reserved to those who held more than 100 acres east of the Shannon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let me deal with the economics <Col N="1771" /> of this.  I believed that putting money in land in the ownership of our people, whether they were poor farmers or whether they were rich farmers, would result in increased production and potentially increased exports.  The other case was made, that I should stop all big farmers from having access to the land project, and I refused to do that.  I said: &ldquo;I do not care who owns the land.  So long as the money goes into the land and for the improvement of the land, that is in the interest of the national estate&rdquo;, and I insisted on large and small being taken in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the good land that is getting priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are all being treated on the basis of absolute equality, wherever rehabilitation is required.  Without reference to whether the land is in the hands of a large farmer or a small farmer, it is done in strict rotation.  Is that an equitable and democratic way to proceed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is rambling.  He does not know whether he is inside or outside now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We, therefore, propose investment in housing, in land rehabilitation, in farm buildings, in forestry, in turf development, in electricity development.  They are all directed towards increased production.  Now, the orthodox side of Deputy MacEntee will rise up in horror at the suggestion that investment in housing is directed towards increased production and there is not the slightest doubt that there is some substance in his orthodox approach.  It is true that capital investment in housing does not produce a return adequate to finance the outlay, but we believe that it is a contribution to the whole social pattern of the country, without which it is impossible to get increased production, to provide decent living conditions for our own people.  Let us get down to it; let us get down to it crudely and harshly. Increased investment in decent housing is an increased investment, not in the salvation of more calves from mortality, but in the salvation of children from mortality.</P>

    <Col N="1772" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at him.  I am not finding fault with any Party in this House for a failure to feel enthusiastic about housing, but I merely said that we did believe and continue to believe in capital investment for increased production in housing, in land rehabilitation, in farm buildings, in forestry, in turf development and in electricity development.  Several of these manifestly contribute to increased production&mdash;housing, not so obviously until we come to examine the philosophy which justifies the expenditure.  But now, when I come to talk of housing, which is expenditure of savings on construction, I am bound to add that in our present circumstances to be taking the corners off trunk-roads, to be ironing the surfaces and turning them into autobahns is daft.  I think the local authorities ought to give a lead or ought to follow suggestions being made to them that that sort of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; ought to stop during a period when every penny we can save is required for more urgent work.  That is why the Minister for Finance speaks about taking all capital projects and putting them in their correct priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are lots of things we should like to do.  There are lots of esplanades we should like to build, lots of blue lagoons we should like to dig, lots of autobahns we should like to construct, but there is a time and place, and, with our resources at full stretch, the present time is not the time, and there can be no criticism of the Minister for Finance for saying that some of these things should be postponed.  They may be very good in themselves, but they are things without which we can get along and they ought to be postponed. I do not think we ought to postpone improving the condition of a man and his wife and five children living in one tenement room in Dublin.  I think he ought to get a house and we ought to tax our resources to the very limit to ensure that he does, and I make no apology to the most orthodox economist in Ireland or abroad for telling him that if he does not like that, he can <Col N="1773" /> lump it, because that is what we are going to do.</P>
    <P>Now, let us get down to tin tacks.  I say that the purpose of our policy was increased production.  Is it true or is it false?  I will quote from the Central Statistics Office Publication on the Trend of Output.  On February 3rd, there is a table setting out the output of cattle with the changes in stocks over the past 20 years&mdash;from 1936 to 1955.  Is it true or is it false that the total output of cattle in 1955&mdash;measured by that criterion&mdash;was 1,048,000 head, the highest figure ever recorded since statistics were kept in Ireland?  Is that true or is it false?  It is true.  Does it not represent increased production?</P>

      <P>I am coming to agricultural production.  Here is the long-term solution of our problem: increased agricultural production.  I want to give Deputies the figures for gross agricultural production.  I am excluding turf because I do not think turf is properly described as an agricultural product.  I think it would be more advantageous to my argument if I included turf, but I do not think it would be fair to do so.  In our circumstances, turf is becoming more of an industrial product than an agricultural product. I am, therefore, excluding turf and including changes in stock from year to year.  I take 1938-39 as the base year and that is 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will ask the House, in reason and without getting cross, to face the fact <Col N="1775" /> that, when we took over in 1948, the point of departure from which we had to start was the situation then obtaining. Naturally, I say that situation was the consequence of 16 years of Fianna Fáil.  But let us leave out of consideration whose fault it was. Fianna Fáil says is was the fault of the war, the fault of the economic war, the fault of a whole lot of things but that it was not their fault.  Let us leave all that out.  Whosoever's fault it was, in 1947, when we had to take over, the fact was that in February, 1948, we had fewer cattle, we had fewer sheep, we had fewer pigs and the land was in a state of greater dereliction than it had been for a century.  It was from that point of departure we had to start.</P>

But a wet year does not stop a cow calving, and in any case 1947 was wet in August, September, October and November, and the cows all had their calves by then.  Whoever saw a ewe having lambs in November?  Nobody but a lunatic ewe with a daft ram. Is not that so?  A pig will have bonhams whether it is raining or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A sow.  I was not suggesting <Col N="1776" /> a boar would have them.  A sow will have bonhams whether it is dry or wet and, if she makes up her mind to have bonhams, she does not ask whether it is dry or wet; and if she makes up her mind to have them, you have to go out to her whether it is dry or wet.  While I do not underestimate the difficulties of the harvest, I remember the absurd picture of the poor old ladies going out with umbrellas trying to save the corn but instead they were only tripping us up. That was the time when the Leader was telling all the people to rush out to the cornfields.  We had worse weather in 1954 and we got in all the corn without any old ladies because we went about it in a sensible way.  I do not deny it was a difficult harvest, but remember no grass failed to grow because of the heavy rain in 1947.  You can exaggerate the impact of the bad weather in the autumn of 1947 on the gross output in that year.</P>

      <P>How many cattle and sheep died that year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not die in the middle of the rain.  They may have died the following year because of fluke or parasites.  Since we came into office we have provided the remedy for the fluke and the parasites.  We were losing 80,000 cattle per annum while Fianna Fáil were in office.  That has been brought down now to 10,000, and somebody is responsible for that.  In 1947, the gross agricultural production was 87.8.  That is where we had to start from.  In 1948, it was 98.5.  In 1949, 108.1.  In 1950, 103, down 5 per cent.  In 1951, 100.7; 1952, 105.7; 1953, 111.5; 1954, 112.4; 1955, 116.2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask you to make the calculation yourselves.  Will you subtract 87.8 from 116.2?  I think you will get an answer of approximately 28.4.  If that is not an increase of 32 per cent. plus over the 1947 production, I am not able to add.  I do not want to suggest to anybody that we should sit down and rest on our oars and enjoy complacency, but there is no use going out to the farmers and saying all the efforts made in the last ten years produced nothing.  Nothing is more discouraging than to say to people who <Col N="1777" /> have done their best that they did nothing, and to say to them: &ldquo;You are becoming a joke before the whole of Europe.  You are the only farmers in Europe who have achieved nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all cod.  Our farmers, with a far worse point of departure and with relatively little help, have achieved an increase in gross production of 32 per cent. plus over the last nine years.  Remember that the Marshall Aid we got was a drop in the bucket compared to what the Dutch and Danes got.  The Dutch got half of the total cost of the complete eradication of bovine T.B. in the Netherlands from Marshall Aid by way of free grant.  The Danes got millions.  What did our farmers get?  Comparatively speaking, a drop in the bucket.  Yet, with it, they have achieved that result. I do not know if Deputy Aiken wants the net output.  I do not know if Deputy Aiken wants me to read it?</P>

      <P>Listening to some Deputies one would think that the dairy farmers had shut up shop, and we were in a state of dereliction.  How many Deputies are aware of the fact that in the first six months of this year the deliveries of milk to the creameries of this country were a record for all time?  They have in fact been 113,900,000 gallons, and that is a figure that has never been exceeded.  That I am happy to say is largely produced from the improved grass growing on the land of Ireland, as a result of the experiments that were inaugurated in 1948 and carried on ever since.</P>

You will not get any more chances to talk about Dillon's yellow butter.  We shall wait and see what the position is in the next six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are in this grave and anxious situation some elements of relief.  I want now to come to the figures for cattle exports.  The figures for total cattle exports leave no cause for anxiety.  The fact is that in the first six months of 1954, there were 355,581 cattle exported.  There is no doubt whatever that in 1955 the price of fat cattle went up to £9 a cwt. in the Dublin market, and no doubt that quite abnormal exports took place, that year, and more power to the elbow of the farmers who were able to take advantage of that situation.  I did say in Dáil Éireann at that time that fat cattle were fetching £9 per cwt. in the Dublin Cattle Market but that as Minister for Agriculture I was issuing the warning that that could not go on. As a result of that increase in price the total exports of cattle rose from 355,000 to 403,000 and an interesting fact was that 27,000 cattle had gone out in the form of carcase meat as against 71,000 in 1954.  Because of the extraordinary price that fat cattle were making on the Dublin market the exports of live cattle had gone up to 347,000 in 1955 as compared with 261,000 in 1954.  In the first six months of this year the total exports of cattle were 364,000 or 9,000 more than in 1954.  The January enumeration shows that we have 80,000 more cattle in the country to-day than in January, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and Deputy Aiken set out to make the case that some of our trade difficulties at present were due to the failure in the production of wheat and excessive purchases of wheat.  We can get the record there.  I <Col N="1780" /> read out for Deputy Aiken this morning a decision taken by his own Government that the total output of wheat from Irish land was to be restricted to the production of the equivalent of 300,000 tons of dried wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Not restricted surely. That was the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the exquisite finesse of the mind of the Leader of the Opposition.  To explain the difference between a proposed restricted output of wheat and the fixing of a target for it is a subtlety that evades me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The position is that you set that target yourselves. Now you could do one of two things: you could introduce tillage inspectors and give every farmer his quota of wheat, and I think that was Deputy Corry's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or you could reduce the price from 80/-, at which it stood, to something which bore a closer relation to relative prices in other spheres of agricultural production.  I was opposed to letting loose on the farmers a whole army of inspectors again to count their acreage of wheat and I believe that the price we have given is a fair and equitable price.  The proof of that is that the acreage of wheat is being grown and it is highly likely that next year, as a result of the recession in the price of cattle, fat cattle in particular, we are liable to have an even greater acreage of wheat.</P>

In 1948-1950 we imported an annual average quantity of 3,700,000 cwt.; and in the three-year period 1951-1953 we imported an annual average of 5,344,000 cwt.

What I am concerned about is not so much the past as the future; and what I am trying to tell the House is what our policy is for dealing with the future.  Our policy is to increase production.  I am suggesting that our policy for increased production has produced in 1955 the greatest output of cattle ever recorded.  It has produced in the first six months of this year the greatest intake of creamery milk ever recorded since statistics were first taken.  I am going to make a prophecy now and I will stand or fall by its fulfilment or failure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mark this one well: we shall have a greater acreage of barley in this country in this year than was ever recorded before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Mark that: we shall have a greater acreage of barley than we have ever had before.  It is the purpose and policy of this Government to substitute for imported coarse grains, coarse feeding grains grown on our own land.  The Deputy had 16 years in which to do that, and he did not do it.  Why did he not do it? Because he had not available to him the variety of barley that made that practicable.  Will the Deputy deny that in 1948 we introduced these varieties of barley, in the form of Herta, Ymer and Fryga?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind who imported it.  We now have that variety of barley.  I cannot promise this to the House, but I am hoping that for the last four months of this year we will not use any imported coarse grain at all.  If that proves true, it will be the first time in the history of this country, since boats began to call here, that we can over a period of four months use no imported coarse grains at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is increased production. Could I get Deputies to help me in this way: I have announced in Dáil Éireann, informed every county committee of agriculture and repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> at meetings all over the country that there is now a fixed minimum price for grade A pigs of 235/- per cwt. delivered to the factory for any quantity of grade A pigs.  Would Deputies help me to get that knowledge over to the farmers because I am told that, at a meeting of the Kilkenny agricultural committee recently, a well-informed and sensible man was heard to say, within the last week, that the essential requirement was to provide a guaranteed minimum price for grade A pigs?  That price was guaranteed three months ago and it is now in operation.  I made it a minimum price because I wanted the farmers to get anything extra they could get, and they have been getting <Col N="1783" /> more than the minimum price.  It does not matter how many pigs they bring to the factory; be it 1,000,000, 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 they cannot get less than 235/- per cwt. for every pig of grade A quality.  Will Deputies help me to get increased production by making that known to the farmers because that will help to restore our balance of payments?</P>
      <P>I wonder am I too harsh if I am constrained to say that, listening to Fianna Fáil talking, the Fianna Fáil policy is largely one of hullabaloo. When you ask them to come down to practical proposals, Deputy Lemass says one thing; Deputy MacEntee says something else; Deputy Aiken says something else; and the Leader of the Opposition says a fourth thing.  And, then, on top of that <i>Pravda</i> comes out the following morning and says a fifth thing.  &ldquo;You pays your money and you takes your choice.&rdquo;  If anybody does not like what the Leader of the Opposition says: &ldquo;Ah, but look at what Deputy Lemass said in Cork.  £100,000,000: Employment for everybody: Let agriculture go to hell: We will do it all through industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If anybody does not like that: &ldquo;Look at what Deputy Aiken says: Put your nose in the land: Abolish the land project and, instead of putting the drainage machine on the land, put your nose in the land.&rdquo; If you do not like Aiken and you do not like Lemass and you want to convert somebody below in College Green: &ldquo;Look at what Mr. MacEntee says: Starve 'em out: Tie 'em down: Put the steam roller over them and, when they come out the other side, they will be flattened for evermore.&rdquo;  If that is not popular down in the country: &ldquo;Look at what the Leader said&rdquo; because he managed to say all three things simultaneously.  But, if somebody says: &ldquo;Well, he was not quite up to form&rdquo; the hand will go around to the hip pocket and out will come <i>Pravda</i> and you can say: &ldquo;Well, look at what young de Valera said.&rdquo;  Now, you must find amongst one of the five <Col N="1784" /> of them something that will please you and that is the solidarity of Fianna Fáil, which is the hope of the Irish nation.  I frankly confess that I regard myself as a resourceful and experienced debater, but I am damned if I can take on all five of them at the same time without at least seeming to contradict myself, because they have a nostrum for every taste.</P>
      <P>I have a very simple, practical proposal to make.  I have dealt with milk. I hope we will be able to do much more in the future through phosphate, potash and lime on the land of Ireland. No matter what Government is in office, two-thirds of the land will be under grass.  It is the most important crop we have got.  The greatest natural asset with which God endowed this nation was an annual rainfall of 42 inches, if we use it; and, to use it to the best advantage, we should use it to grow grass with phosphate, potash and lime.</P>
      <P>To hear people talking you would think rain was the affliction and bane of the Irish people.  It is the greatest natural asset that we have 42 inches of annual rainfall equitably distributed over the 12 months of the year.  Does the House realise that, with the exception of Ireland, a part of Great Britain and a very restricted area in the Middle West of America, there is no other country in the whole world which has what we have, 42 inches of rain equitably distributed over the 12 months of the year?  There is no agricultural country in the world which if you asked the people what asset would they most long for but would answer: &ldquo;42 inches of rain equitably distributed over the 12 months of the year&rdquo;.  We have the Gulf Stream climate.  We have the live stock and the market for it beside us and our sole contribution need be phosphate, potash and lime to get from the land of Ireland an evergrowing output of saleable produce which we are eminently equipped to produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me speak of sheep.  People are prone to forget them.  Our sheep population has gone up from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 and over in the past nine years and is steadily rising.  Every sheep we have to-day is in my <Col N="1785" /> judgment worth about 1¼ of the sheep we had ten years ago because it is improved in quality both as to mutton and wool.  I have spoken of our policy in regard to increasing the acreage of barley and I now want to speak of our policy for increasing forestry.  I think it has been made abundantly clear to the House that the programme provided for is based on 15,000 acres at present being planted with an annual increment of 2,500 acres until we reach 25,000 acres with a subsequent review as to what the national requirements are as from that period forward.  That is a very large capital investment.  It is already producing vast employment and will produce we hope, but unfortunately after protracted delay, a substantial revenue.  We have got to keep within our resources and adjust our investment even in that sphere to the resources available to us.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to another very significant fact and that is the June trade figures.  I want to say at once that in one respect the June trade figures were a bitter disappointment to me.  I confidently anticipated that, once the levies had two or three months to operate, they would produce results in the June imports but they did not.  The imports in June went up by £400,000. I think that was a bitter disappointment and something that rightly puts us on our guard and warns us that more resolute measures must be taken in order to get the trend in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that it is the firm resolve of this Government to continue with such measures until the trend is restored, whatever measures may be required, but we will be neither fussed, bluffed nor tricked into doing anything to the detriment of our people which is unnecessary.  The June figures had that element in them which disappointed me.  Everybody's attention was rivetted on that figure of an increase in our imports, and rightly so, but when full weight is given to that deplorable development, let us recall that in the same month exports had gone up by £1,750,000 in a month when cattle were making £6 a cwt. on the Dublin market in comparison with the <Col N="1786" /> month of June, 1955, when cattle were making £9 a cwt. on the Dublin market. Does the House see the significance of that?</P>
    <P>The volume of our exports must have gone up quite dramatically for their value was up £1,750,000.  If we had got a reduction of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in imports, which I had hoped for, do you see where we would be going?  We would have improved the adverse trade balance by close on £4,000,000 a month and if we could have kept that up for the remaining seven months of the year, our problems would be very much reduced in their proportion.  But we did not succeed in bringing down imports as we hoped to do and that is why we are here to-day on the business upon which we are now engaged, for that we have got to do.</P>
    <P>That is only a temporary phase designed to meet the situation while exports are coming up.  If they were not coming up, we would have grave cause for anxiety.  We have no grounds for complacency but let us at least ask ourselves whether the trend appears to be right.  There is more milk delivered to the creameries than ever before; more cattle are being produced than ever before and there are more sheep in the country than at any time for 50 years of better quality, both as regards the meat and wool.  There is a guaranteed minimum price for pigs of grade A quality to ensure that there will be all the production we can get. There is a guaranteed minimum price for barley to ensure that everyone may grow it preferably to be fed on one's own holding and if it is grown in excess of that, then the guaranteed market is available&mdash;not less than 40/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>There is an expanding realisation on the part of farmers everywhere of the need for the increased use of phosphates, potash and lime.  There is agreement on all sides that, anxious as we are to press forward, we must not fall into the disastrous mistake of trying to travel faster than our resources will allow.  There is a decision agreed among us all that no project that is in itself good should be abandoned but that there should be a hierarchy established of the priorities <Col N="1787" /> so that that which is essential should be done first and that which is good, but without which we can do for the present, should be postponed.</P>
    <P>There is a firm resolution that the balance of payments shall be restored; that the measures requisite to that will be taken here and now and that for the long term there shall be an output from the land adequate to provide all our people who wish to live here with a steadily rising standard of living.  Is that not a saner approach to our problem than a crying of universal woe?  Is it not saner to realise that we are confronted with problems not peculiar to this country but which are common to Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand and is it not vital to us to recognise that, though our problems may be common, the appropriate remedies may be radically different?</P>
    <P>We started this morning with wails, lamentations and warnings of despair. Let us mark this mid-day hour with no clarion cry of complacency, but with the clear knowledge that we have on our hands as formidable a problem as that confronting Great Britain, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark, Norway, Australia or New Zealand and that the Government of this country is giving as good or better a lead, in the honest belief that the Irish people can master this problem and&mdash;without losing their head or dissolving into a panic onslaught on the welfare of our own people&mdash;we shall rescue this country from the danger on the one hand of panic and on the other from a negligence that would precipitate us all into a situation, if our external resources were utterly dissipated, in which unemployment and suffering would be truly formidable and we, the nation, would be left without the instruments to resolve it.</P>
    <P>I think ours is the better way.  We shall do whatever is necessary, and all that is necessary, to see that the economy of this country is sustained, developed and maintained for the benefit of all our people, but we shall be neither frightened nor bluffed, jeered nor jibed into courses of conduct which, in our own past experience, <Col N="1788" /> resulted in nothing but disaster to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate this morning has largely ranged over agriculture and I feel that to a large extent that was desirable.  I think the House should be indebted to the Minister for his very comprehensive survey of the agricultural position, a comprehensive survey which was delivered, as usual, with great brilliancy and which was a tribute to the Minister.  I am inclined to agree&mdash;so far as I have been able to check on it&mdash;with the views expressed by the Minister in regard to the increase in agricultural production.  I think that his assessment of the increase is the correct one.  Unfortunately, this has not been fully appreciated in the country and I think it is necessary that it should be emphasised more than it has been.</P>
      <P>However, while it was useful that our discussion should range over the agricultural sphere, we have to get back now to the actual issues before the House.  There are three main problems facing our economy.  First, there is the question of the adverse balance of trade; secondly, the abnormally high and damaging rate of unemployment and emigration; and, thirdly, the increasing prices.  Those are, in brief, the three main problems that face our economy, problems which are only to some extent related to each other, problems which will not be dealt with, I think, by emergency measures.  Emergency measures undoubtedly are essential in present circumstances to deal with the adverse balance of trade. We need two completely separate approaches to these questions.  We need the short term approach, the approach which the Bill before the House is intended to take in regard to the adverse balance of payments; but, quite apart from the short term approach, we need a long term economic development policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the country generally will be disappointed in the approach of the Government and of the Opposition on that score.  There is a feeling abroad, a feeling which is fairly justified, that the country has been drifting without <Col N="1789" /> a policy, without a concerted or consecutive policy and that that drift has been taking place not merely for the last year or two but very nearly since the State was set up.  The problems that face the country at the moment, which have been highlighted by the adverse balance of trade, could serve a useful purpose if they could bring about a recognition, on the part of different political Parties here, of the essential need to formulate and implement a consecutive long term development programme, which is a thing we have never had.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, in speaking this morning, was rather contradictory in regard to that.  On the one hand, he said that what we needed was a long term agricultural policy which would be pursued consecutively.  A few minutes later, he said that he was against any long term economic development plan.  Of course, in a country such as ours, the long term agricultural plan must be the basis of any long term economic planning we may wish to undertake.  Therefore, Deputy Aiken seems to have been rather contradictory in his approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>In so far as the long term approach to our problems is concerned, I do not think that this debate has contributed anything.  There has been no indication of a long term policy either on the part of the Government or on the part of the Opposition.  The nearest attempt which we had, the nearest thing to a long term approach, a concerted approach, was the speech which we had to-day from the Minister for Agriculture in regard to agriculture; but I think that the future of agriculture will depend largely upon the availability of capital for its development. There is a certain contradiction between the wishes and the hopes expressed by the Minister and the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>Increased production in agriculture will require, undoubtedly, hard work, but it will also require increased credit facilities to ensure the additional investment necessary in agriculture. Unless credits are available, that additional investment in agriculture will not be possible and the hopes of <Col N="1790" /> the Minister will ultimately be shattered.  It seems, therefore, to me that, from a long term point of view, any agricultural plan which is formulated must envisage at the same time the provision of credit facilities which will ensure a much higher rate of investment in agriculture than there has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister has urged this morning the increased use of fertilisers.  I think we use a smaller amount of fertilisers on our land than practically any other country in Europe.  Obviously, we need a much higher rate of fertilisation of the land.  That cannot be achieved unless the agricultural community have the credits necessary in order to be able to invest in their lands.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is urging a higher rate of investment in the land, a higher rate of production from the land, we have a credit squeeze being applied on the other side by the banks and that credit squeeze is, if you like, in direct opposition to the policy which the Government and the Minister for Agriculture are advocating.  A credit squeeze is incompatible with an increased rate of investment in the land and increased production.  That applies, not merely to the agricultural sector of our economy, but to the industrial sector as well.</P>
    <P>I should like in that connection to remind the House of the views expressed by the Taoiseach, in 1953, in a booklet entitled &ldquo;Blueprint for Prosperity,&rdquo; which is a reproduction of a speech made by the Taoiseach.  It would be useful if we now put into practice the policies which he advocated then in regard to the approach of the banks.  Referring to the banking system, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present time it is purely a monopoly, although it has the appearance of being a private enterprise system.  It reacts entirely in its policy to the policy from time to time pursued in Britain, a policy which is dictated by the British Government for British purposes related entirely to conditions in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The British Government induced <Col N="1791" /> the British banks to raise the bank rate and withdraw credit for the purpose of creating unemployment and discouraging production over a wide field of British industry in order to divert both capital and men to armament and their heavy industries. The Irish banks applied the same policy here where conditions are quite different, where there is no rearmament and very little heavy industry.  The results combined with the Government's Budget impositions, have been deplorable.  A system such as this cannot continue. Irish banking institutions can only flourish on Irish prosperity.  At any rate they cannot continue to be used to take the savings of the Irish people to bolster up an outside economy, however vital the prosperity of that economy is to our external trading.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to this because it seems to me that at the present time the same problem is arising, but, while the requirements of our economy, the requirements of increased production and increased employment, all involve additional investment and additional credit facilities, the banking system is pursuing a policy which can only lead to the opposite results, a policy which, to a large extent, I think, has been influenced by events in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture quite properly pointed out this morning, there is absolutely no relationship between the problems which exist in Britain and the problems which exist here.  The causes of these problems are entirely different.  Britain suffers <Col N="1792" /> from overfull employment; we suffer from chronic underemployment.  Britain suffers from overdevelopment and the policy of the British Government is to slow down the rate of investment in Britain.  The measures taken there are being taken with that end in view.  It is perfectly ridiculous that we should seek to apply the same type of deflationary measures as are being applied in Britain.</P>
    <P>To that extent, I welcome the approach of the Minister for Finance in the measures he has brought before the House.  These are direct measures intended to reduce the volume of unnecessary imports.  That is, in my view, the proper approach to the present situation, but I think that, to a certain extent, while that approach is being pursued by him now, we have not escaped the evils of the purely deflationary approach which was pursued earlier in the year and which is still being pursued by our banking system.</P>
    <P>One of the chief difficulties in dealing with the immediate problems that confront us arises from the fact that the remedies necessary to correct an adverse balance of trade are in direct conflict with the remedies necessary to ensure a higher rate of employment and in that way to reduce emigration at the same time.  As I pointed out last night, it is essential, therefore, to bear in mind that purely monetary measures, restriction of credit, and so on, will result in a reduced rate of investment rather than in a reduced rate of consumption.  It is well recognised that if the aim is purely to reduce consumption and not to interfere with the rate of investment, that result can only be achieved by direct measures, that the pursuit of an inflationary policy or a credit restriction policy will primarily reduce the rate of investment rather than the rate of consumption.  I think that that is an important fact to bear in mind in the present situation.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in a debate of this kind, and indeed, in dealing with economic questions generally in the political sphere here, is the complete misuse that is frequently made of different terms.  Deputy Aiken this <Col N="1793" /> morning talked at length about an inflationary situation, about inflation. I think the Minister for Finance also talked a good deal in the course of his speech yesterday about inflation.  What do we understand by inflation?  I said a few minutes ago that we are trying to cope with three different problems.</P>
    <P>There is, firstly, the inadequacy of exports resulting from inadequate protection largely combined with an excess of imports.  I do not think that that can be described as inflation.  The fact that for one reason or another we have failed to produce enough or have failed to export enough does not arise from inflation.  That is one of the problems.  Problem No. 2 is underemployment and emigration.  I do not think that that can be described as inflation.  It seems to me to be the very opposite.  Problem No. 3 is that of increasing prices.  There you can begin to talk of inflationary pressures but I do not think that the term &ldquo;inflation&rdquo; is a term which can properly be used to describe the present situation.  I think it is not at all as simple as that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increase in prices or the loss in value or purchasing power of money, I think we have to recognise that there is very little we can do about it.  It arises from two different factors.  One factor is that outside prices have gone up.  Prices of raw materials have gone up.  We have little or no control over those.  The other factor arises from increasing wages and increasing taxation, increasing State expenditure, if you like.  I think that there is very little we can do about that either.  These are not new trends.  They are trends that affect not only this country but trends that affect practically every country in the world.  There has been a tendency since the beginning of the century, and particularly since the first world war, for living standards to improve.  I think that is desirable.  Improvements in living standards involve improvement in wages and involve an improvement in social services and, obviously, these improvements in wages and social services involve higher production costs in the end.  These are more or less inevitable developments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> Another factor which I think is often overlooked in assessing increased expenditure and, also in appreciating the cause for the lack of savings, arises from the fact that human nature being what it is, whenever some new device makes its appearance, whether it be a wireless set, an electric mixer, an electric washing machine, an electric iron, an electric cooker, a new kind of nylon stockings&mdash;whenever new appliances make their appearance on the markets of the world, people tend to want them and tend finally to acquire them.  These are all inevitable processes in our social evolution but, of course, these processes have economic results.  I do not think that we can complain about them nor do I think that we can stop them.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, I think we should take those as more or less inevitable and rather welcome developments in our social and economic evolution.  It is commonplace for workers in America to own motor cars.  It is commonplace for farm labourers to own motor cars. Ultimately it will become commonplace here and there is no use wringing our hands in despair and saying it is gross extravagance and that the country cannot afford it.  The country, sooner or later, will have to afford it.  We should turn our attention to how best we can gear up our economy to increase production to meet these requirements. That brings me back to what I think is the kernel of the problem here, the lack of any kind of economic development programme.  I do not think we even appreciate the full extent of the problems that confront us.  We are trying to brush them aside.  We are inclined to deal with them from day to day without ever getting down to a realistic appraisal of the extent of the problems that we have to face up to in order to find solutions for them.</P>
    <P>There is one matter, which to my mind, is extremely urgent and upon which there has been, I think an unhealthy silence, certainly on the part of the Government and I think also on the part of the Opposition.  If the present financial policies are pursued, if the present credit squeeze is pursued, it is inevitable that by this winter we will face as high an unemployment rate as in 1953.  The Taoiseach and <Col N="1795" /> members of the Opposition spoke at great length last night of the evils of emigration.  We all know that a high rate of unemployment means a high rate of emigration.  Accordingly, we are facing into the situation, where with employment which is beginning to mount up already, we will, before the end of the year, have a much higher rate of emigration.</P>
    <P>I believe that the credit squeeze policy, which is admittedly responsible for the increasing rate of unemployment and the increasing rate of emigration, is not necessary in the facts of our economy.  Not only is it not necessary but it is damaging so far as the aim is to increase production and increase investment.  I do not know to what extent the Government has been in touch with the commercial banks with regard to their credit policy, but I certainly strongly urge upon the Minister for Finance to give a very clear indication to our commercial banks that the operation of a credit squeeze policy such as has been operating in recent months is damaging to our economy and is completely opposed to Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, and both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken talked of the terrible results that would flow from a devaluation of our currency.  I am not aware that anybody has suggested that our currency should be devalued.  I am not aware that we have any control of our own currency.  I am not aware that we stand now as we did in 1949 faced with the risk of seeing our currency devalued now by us but by the collapse of the British economy and, in that situation, we shall have the doubtful pleasure of seeing some £400,000,000 of our money invested in England lose its value overnight, not through any action of ours but by reason of economic difficulties that face the British economy.</P>
    <P>It is complete nonsense to suggest that we have any influence over the value of the £ sterling or that our economic problems here in any way affect the value of sterling.  Therefore, I do not really know whether the references by some Deputies to the depreciation <Col N="1796" /> of our currency were made out of sheer ignorance of the facts of the situation or merely to try to cause alarm.</P>
    <P>References have also been made by Deputies to our sterling assets.  Many of the figures quoted are, I think, somewhat misleading.  The position is that we have still invested in Britain between £400,000,000 and £500,000,000. The commercial banks, according to the last returns, increased their holdings of sterling investments from February of this year when they stood at £219,000,000 to £223,000,000 by April of this year.  It is worth remembering that, with all this outcry about disinvestment, if we turn to the commercial banking returns, we will see that there was an actual increase of holdings of sterling assets by our commercial banking system of no less than £4,000,000 in a period of three months of this year.</P>
    <P>Our Central Bank, which distinguishes itself by not holding one penny invested in Ireland, holds some £70,000,000 in British Government securities.  Our Government holds somewhere in the region of £30,000,000. There are no records of the amounts of private investment.  I think it is probably reasonable to suggest that it is between £100,000,000 and £150,000,000, but, as I say, there are no records available.  If those figures are approximately correct, our sterling assets are now somewhere between £450,000,000 and £470,000,000.</P>
    <P>In passing, let me again draw attention to what, to my mind, is a complete indictment of the attitude of our commercial banks and of our banking system generally.  According to the last returns published by the Central Bank, our commercial banks have £104.3 million invested in British Government securities as against £18.4 million invested in Irish Government securities.  Those figures, in my view, are a complete indictment of the attitude of our banking system here.</P>
    <P>I should again like to say that if at any stage the Government think it desirable to take steps to ensure that our commercial banking system will invest a higher percentage of their investments in Irish Government securities, or in other Irish securities, the <Col N="1797" /> Government will have the complete support of a large section of the people in the country in taking steps to ensure that result.</P>
    <P>I dealt last night with a number of the issues that arise on this discussion and I do not wish to repeat them.  I should like just to make one or two remarks in regard to some of the statements made by Deputy Aiken.  Like Deputy MacEntee and the Taoiseach last night, Deputy Aiken seemed to take some pride in our economic achievements in the past.  I do not think we should allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of inertia or complacency as to progress in the past.</P>
    <P>On the whole, looking back upon our economic history, I think it is an indictment of ourselves since we have taken control of our own affairs here. The mere fact that, some 35 years afterwards, we still have the same problems&mdash;we still have a fall in population and we are still unable to provide employment for our people&mdash;is an indictment of the economic reorganisation of the country for which, to a large extent, successive Governments have been responsible.</P>
    <P>I welcome one statement made by Deputy Aiken.  He said that he would be opposed to the pursuit of a completely deflationary policy.  I welcome that statement because it shows that as far as he is concerned he has apparently been converted from views which he held before.  Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee were both the advocates of the pursuit of a deflationary policy in 1952.  They pursued a deflationary policy with a vengeance and with disastrous results to our economy then and even now.  I am glad that even if the pursuit of these policies had disastrous results, at least Deputy Aiken has now been converted from the viewpoint which he held then. I hope his conversion is a genuine and lasting one and that he will in future eschew the pursuit of deflationary policies which can only result in high unemployment and reduced production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious debate and it is rather a pity that Deputy MacBride did not devote a little time to looking up data in the library instead <Col N="1798" /> of accepting as infallible all the statements made by the Minister for Agriculture to-day.  He refers to deflation, but we cannot be much more deflated than we are.  Up to 1948, when the Government of which Deputy MacBride was a member assumed office, the amount borrowed for 25 long years by both the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, as they were then, and the Fianna Fáil Government, who followed them, resulted in our having to find £4,000,000 a year for the service of the National Debt.  In 1952, after three and a half years of the pursuit of Deputy MacBride's deflationary policy, we found that those people had borrowed some £72,000,000 odd and that the service of the National Debt had increased from £4,000,000 in 1948 to £10,000,000 in 1952. I asked a question here about a month ago and I was told it is now £13,000,000, which means that the people of this country must find £13,000,000 a year to pay the interest on what we borrowed before the people can spend one penny on anything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said last night we are £36,000,000 on the wrong end.  We have been borrowing anything from £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 a year over the past few years.  I have seen nothing in any proposals made by the Minister for Finance to put an end to that.  The Minister for Finance went to the people a few months ago and asked them for £20,000,000.  They said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  It is the same as if you were calling into a bank manager every couple of months for a few pounds; the day comes when he says: &ldquo;I will give you no more.&rdquo;  The people of this country have informed the Minister for Finance and the Government that they will give them no more money.  Therefore, the Minister has decided on a new scheme: (1) to prevent people from spending any money and (2) under which nobody can borrow a shilling except the Government.  If the Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, E.S.B., C.I.E. want money, they cannot borrow it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would this Government get out decently or are they waiting to get such a kick in Cork that they will have to get out?  They can get no money; <Col N="1799" /> they cannot run this country.  We heard pious resolutions here about housing. What is the position in which they have placed local authorities in connection with housing?  You apply to the county council now for a loan and they tell you: &ldquo;No; you must try the building societies.  If the building societies and the bank do not consider you eligible to borrow from them, you are to come back to the county council and the county council will give it to you out of the ratepayers' pocket&rdquo; and I do not know who will pay them back.  I do not know how many houses will be built under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the Minister for Agriculture got his figures.  I wonder is it a special pair of spectacles the Department have provided for him, because here are the figures from the Central Statistics Office: Live stock, milch cows, a reduction of 5,540; in-calf heifers, a reduction of 12,674; bulls, a reduction of 1,652; other cattle&mdash;three-year-olds and upwards, a reduction of 34,902; two-year-olds and under three, a reduction of 1,391.  Then you have an increase of 24,000 yearlings and 11,000 calves.  I do not know whether the Minister and his Department have a new plan for the production of calves without cows, but if you have a reduction this year of 18,000 between cows and in-calf heifers, how can you increase the number of calves you had last year?</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of more production and I should like to give this House a resumé of his activities as Minister for Agriculture.  In wheat, there is a reduction of 128,362 acres, or 26.4 per cent. in 12 months.  That means that the Minister for Finance had to export £3,483,000 of our money to pay the foreigner for wheat which should have been grown at home.  We did grow 358,006 acres of wheat last year.  If we take the normal yield from that to be 358,000 tons, in order to increase production and to induce the farmer, the Minister taxed that wheat to the extent of 12/6 a bag&mdash;£5 a ton. For that wheat which they did grow last year, the farmers got £1,790,000 less.  In all, the income of the farmers on wheat alone was reduced last year, <Col N="1800" /> by this angel of increased production, by £5,273,000.</P>
    <P>It is so, down along the line.  The farmers grew 213,000 acres of barley. The Minister for Finance taxed that by £4 per ton, the difference between 48/- and 40/- a barrel.  He collected off the farmer in that manner, giving not the Minister a figure of £2 a cwt., but 30/- a cwt., £2,275,000.  The farmers got that much less for their barley because of the pronouncements made by that Minister for Agriculture from time to time.  He once told us: &ldquo;Beet has gone up the spout after wheat, and God speed the day&rdquo;.  As soon as the farmers found that gentleman restored to his perch over there, they dropped their acreage of beet by 25.4 per cent. &mdash;by 18,779 acres.</P>
    <P>That drop in the acreage of beet had very wide ramifications.  At 12 tons of beet to the acre, it meant a loss of 225,348 tons of beet, valued at the factories at £1,500,000.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made a statement here yesterday about the losses of C.I.E.  For 70 per cent. of their total freight, C.I.E. depend on the sugar factories.  When beet production went down by the amount I have stated, the income C.I.E. derived from the sugar company went down by approximately 25 per cent.  That is why it became necessary for the Minister to come here yesterday seeking £1,000,000 to assist C.I.E.</P>
    <P>On those three items alone, the farmers' income last year fell by something like £8,500,000.  I shall not go into the figures for cattle; I am dealing with one item alone for which Government policy has been directly responsible. Government policy has been directly responsible for a drop of 80,000 acres of tillage since they came into office.  They have been responsible for a drop of over £7,000,000 in the farmers' income.</P>
    <P>There is another little activity to which I should like to make allusion at this stage.  We hear a lot from time to time about subsidies.  They tell us on the other side of the House that they maintain subsidies when we would not. The Minister for Industry and Commerce found a new way of finding subsidies for flour.  When the late Minister <Col N="1801" /> for Agriculture, God rest his soul, left office, the economic price of bran and pollard, largely used in pig production, was £20 a ton.  Since then, this benevolent Government cut the price of the Irish farmers' wheat by £5 a ton, which means that the economic price of bran and pollard to-day should be around £18 a ton.  Last March, when introducing his Estimate, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a statement as to where he found the money to subsidise flour.  He said that, in September, 1954, the price of bran and pollard was £20 a ton.  By increasing that price to the price of imported bran and pollard, we got a figure of £24 10s. per ton in October, 1954, and of £26 a ton in January, 1955.  In that manner, the millers collected £170,000 to go towards the flour subsidy.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested in that statement in view of a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture when a deputation went to him regarding the price of feeding barley.  He told the deputation: &ldquo;The small farmer in the west with 10 acres and a wife and six children feeds pigs.  Am I going to increase the price of barley for the big farmers growing it, the big farmers with the two motor cars?  I am not.&rdquo; That was the statement made to us when we went to the Minister for Agriculture for an increased price for feeding barley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the price of feeding barley and comparing that now with the attitude of this Minister for Agriculture of ours in allowing the Minister for Industry and Commerce to increase the price of bran and pollard from its economic price of £18 a ton to what is being charged to-day, £27 10s. a ton.  That is £9 10s. a ton increase in price over and above the economic price of the article.  Is it any wonder that that contribution to increased production by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave us a reduction in pigs for breeding of 19,757, or 19.8 per cent., and other pigs <Col N="1802" /> totalling 159,476, or a total of 16.6 per cent. reduction?</P>
      <P>Let us have a look at it.  The Minister for Social Welfare, some two months ago, in reply to an Adjournment Debate, informed us that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had collected from the pig feeders of this country, from September, 1954, to February, 1956, the enormous sum of £617,000&mdash;taxes to be paid by the pig feeders.  Is it any wonder when you tax production, when you tax wheat to the extent of 12/6 a bag, when you tax feeding barley to the extent of £4 a ton, when you force an uneconomic price for beet by refusing to allow the sugar company to increase the price to an economic level and when you tax the man who feeds the pig, the poor, small farmer in the west with ten acres and the wife and six children, for whom the Minister for Agriculture's heart bled and from whom he has now extracted, in 15 short months, £617,000 in income-tax, because he dared to feed pigs, that production of pigs is cut by roughly 20 per cent., because of the activities of the gentleman who acted the playboy for an hour and a half to-day, telling us about increased production and how he was going to achieve it?  Those are the steps he took to achieve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that we have an adverse balance of payments when we have to send £1,500,00 out of the country for the sugar which should be produced here on the land as beet and which should be turned into sugar in our own factories?  That would get a reduction of £1,000,000 in C.I.E.'s deficit, in freight charges alone.  Is it any wonder that we have an adverse balance of payments when we sent out £3,500,000 for foreign wheat and the method by which we did it was to tax the Irish farmer who dared to produce it, £5 a ton?  Those are the things which count and this Minister for Agriculture had the impertinence to stand up here for over an hour to-day telling us about increased production on the land.  Where did he find it?  It was not in wheat, in beet, or in barley; it was not in pigs and it was not in in-calf heifers.  I have given the figures here, which I got from the official <Col N="1803" /> statistics, for each one of those.  Those are the results of his activities.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister for Finance, this genius who, in one year and a half, has converted this country from a country where, at any rate, a Government loan was never refused until he took it up.  I should like to hear from him what example he is going to set the people in regard to saving.  That is the first thing they will look for.  He is compelling the people to save, whether they like it or not, and any fellow now with money must put it in the stocking, unless he is going to lend it to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing I can say about the Bill is that it is seeking to compel everybody to save except the Minister.  The Minister is preventing everybody saving and he is also preventing everybody borrowing.  In my <Col N="1805" /> opinion, that will lead to a far greater volume of unemployment than we have at present.  Business people have been held up because of the Minister's activities in squeezing credit.  Business people now find that they cannot carry on as matters stand.  The agricultural community cannot stand the strain any longer.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to continue despite the fact that the people of this country have given him a very definite decision that they will give him no more money?  After all, he applied for a loan and he got £8,000,000 out of £20,000,000.  I think the banks kept that because of what was due to them.  Now he says he will go for another loan.  He has got a better plan this time.  C.I.E. is to be prevented from borrowing; the E.S.B. is to be prevented from borrowing; the fellow who wants to build his house is to be prevented from borrowing.  He is preventing them all from borrowing, so that the banks will have nobody to whom they can give the money except the Minister.</P>

      <P>Because of the importance of this discussion I had hoped we would have heard some serious views expressed, but the extraordinary fact is that, so far, although it is now 2.45 p.m., the Opposition have only put up two speakers, Deputy Corry, who is going away, and Deputy Aiken, who spent a long time telling us about everything except the matters that are of importance, not only to the members of this House, but to the people outside. The Leader of the Opposition waxed vehemently&mdash;I might say eloquently&mdash;in this House last night in relation to the whole position.  Their whole theme, apparently, is that everything would be all right but for the fact that all the honest people are in the Opposition and all the dishonest people and opportunists are on the <Col N="1806" /> Government side.  They go further and make it quite clear, both here and to the people outside, that, had they been in Government, this policy, and perhaps an even more stringent policy than that which the Government is adopting, would be in operation.  It would be all right then; there would be nothing wrong with it and the people would not object.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had a lot of talk the other day and we will answer him now.  We, in the Labour Party, are entitled to make a full comparison between the policy of this Government and the policy of the Opposition when they were in Government. Deputy de Valera made certain suggestions here yesterday evening and he was followed by Deputy Aiken. We are convinced that there is one outstanding difference in the recommendations of this Government to meet the present financial difficulties and the recommendations which were put into operation during the term of the previous Government.  That is that, even though the Government have been striving to get more revenue in and even though they are determined to cut down luxury spending, if it can be termed as such, at least nobody can say&mdash;least of all speakers on the Fianna Fáil side&mdash;that they have adopted what was adopted in 1952 by Fianna Fáil&mdash;the slashing of the food subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy O'Malley apparently was lonesome because of the absence of some of us here in the House the other day, I can assure him that we are not wasting our time here and we do not intend to waste our time when it comes to making a comparison between what was said in the Press at that time and what may be said now. In spite of the lamentations of prominent Opposition speakers last week and Press publications that made it quite clear to the people that the introduction of these new levies meant that the Government were going to increase the price of bread and increase the price of tobacco, it is quite obvious that, when the Minister <Col N="1807" /> for Finance announced his intentions to the House here, the reaction was a bit upsetting to the Opposition members.</P>
    <P>We are quite satisfied that, if difficulties are to be met, we must be prepared to face up to those difficulties, but there must be some differentiation between the main basic problem of the cost of essential foodstuffs and the items contained in the list before us which are to be subject to the increased levies announced by the Minister this evening.  While all of us are interested in what the Minister had to say I believe from the point of view of the position in which we find ourselves that there are certain questions which must be answered.  It is not a question of which are the best people to have in power; our attention must be directed to some of the weaknesses in our national economy.  I consider that it is more essential to try to improve the fabric of our economy in this country rather than waste time in endeavouring to see which set of politicians might be better than another.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding statements of the Minister related to the question of imports and of exports.  While we can see, at this stage, the possibility that reduced imports may of necessity affect employment here particularly amongst dock workers and others, we will have to face that problem.  We will have to be prepared to consider whether in the over-all picture we are prepared to say that it is vital that we should reduce certain imports even if it may tend to show its effects in employment in certain respects.  Nevertheless, I think that as we go along and consider this picture that the improvement effected in other respects might be such that we might be able to close the leak that has been opened in employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say that it was essential that everyone should show an increase of 10 per cent. in output. That, I believe, is the whole problem and in that regard I would like to draw the Minister's attention to some matters.  From whom does the Minister suggest that we should get that 10 per <Col N="1808" /> cent. increase in output?  Let us first of all consider what has been discussed at length in this House this morning, namely, the question of agricultural output in so far as it relates to the adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, as the Minister stated, that through savings, compulsory savings as it were, we accumulated during the period of two world wars considerable amounts of money by way of external assets.  We know that if it had been possible for people to spend that money during those periods our reserves might not be in the strong position in which they are. Nevertheless, the fact is that we have these holdings and we cannot forget that in discussing this problem.  We have this deficit of £25,000,000 in 1955 and that is a big problem with which we have to deal.</P>
    <P>The main question is that of exports against imports and we know that in future this is going to be a more serious and a graver problem in so far as the market which is open to us is more highly competitive than it had been.  That position had been referred to by the Minister for Agriculture when he drew attention to a point omitted by Deputy Aiken.  That was that our investments had shown a very serious depreciation overnight.  The question according to Deputy Aiken is whether we should keep our reserves in Great Britain as large and as high as they are.  We know what happened when the pound was devalued in Britain in 1948.  That is something which we will have to try and solve.</P>
    <P>At the present time, we may be a little removed from it.  What the Minister stated is a matter of great importance also&mdash;that this year while, owing to the import levies, imports had shown at least some small reduction, there had not been an increase in production.  I think it is tragic at this stage that there has been a decline in exports to the extent of approximately £4.5 million notwithstanding the efforts of the Government in relation to agriculture. I believe that Deputy Aiken should have concentrated more on what will be the policy of the Opposition Party in relation to agriculture. Whatever about Deputy Corry, some statement from Deputy <Col N="1809" /> Aiken on this matter might have been well worth listening to.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, Deputy Corry has told us that as a result of the action of the present Minister for Agriculture the poor farmers have suffered.  Deputy Corry, however, made no mention whatever of the statements made by so-called important agriculturists down the country when they suggested or advocated that farmers should withdraw their savings from the Irish banks and invest them in Britain.  According to Deputy Corry the farmers have nothing in the banks. People down the country say they have the money in the banks but the Deputy argues that they should not co-operate with this Government.  As long as we get that type of treachery, we cannot hope to get increased production from agriculture.</P>
    <P>The levies announced by the Minister yesterday are aimed to meet the present situation.  The imposition of these levies may affect employment, but we shall have to try to meet any difficulties that may arise.  The fact is, however, that over the past years our farming industry has not given us the return that it should give.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I replied to the Deputy's question on the 14th June, I have obtained a copy of the detailed prospectus of the proposed sale of some of the Killarney Lakes and adjoining lands.  I have also discussed the matter with a deputation <Col N="1810" /> from the Killarney Tourist Development Company.  I understand that the Company is endeavouring to raise funds for the purchase of the property, or some of it.</P>
      <P>I observe from the prospectus that the lower and middle lakes are offered for sale as portion of the Kenmare estate.  From documents which came into the possession of the Commissioners of Public Works when the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park was taken over by the State, it appears that the ownership of the bed and soil of, and of the fishing rights on, the two lakes in question as well as the ownership of the Upper Lake and the Long Range was, since about 1748, the subject of dispute between the Earls of Kenmare and the Herberts (the predecessors to the Minister for Finance in the title to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park).  It is necessary, therefore, to make it clear that the State has never waived or abandoned any right or title which their predecessors in title, the Herberts, possessed or enjoyed in the lakes.</P>
      <P>The Government are giving careful consideration to the question of how best to ensure that the property is not exploited to the national detriment. This might require action either under existing legislation, or, possibly, under new legislation.  Consideration is being given to the question whether a Bill applying, not merely to Killarney, but generally to our natural beauty spots and tourist amenities, would be the appropriate method of dealing with the matter.  I can, in any event, repeat the assurance which I gave to the Deputy on the 14th June last, namely, that the Government will see that the national interests are not prejudiced by any sale.</P>

      <P>Provision is made in the Votes of the Department of Education for the payment of grants to periodicals published wholly in Irish and to newspapers publishing current news in Irish.  The publications in question and the grants payable are, as far as provincial periodicals go:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Periodicals&mdash;<i>Inniu:</i> £148 10s. per weekly issue; <i>Feasta:</i> £150 per monthly issue; <i>Comhar:</i> £150 per monthly issue; <i>An tUltach:</i> £15 per monthly issue; <i>Ar Aghaidh:</i> £15 per monthly issue; <i>Tír na nOg:</i> a grant per monthly issue which shall not exceed £136 or the difference between the cost of production and receipts, whichever is the lesser; <i>Galvia:</i> £130 in respect of annual edition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Newspapers&mdash;A sum of £304 is provided for grants to newspapers, published in the Gaeltacht or in adjoining areas, which circulate in the Gaeltacht and publish at least two columns of current news in Irish weekly.  No grant is paid in respect of the first one and a half columns; a <Col N="1812" /> rate of 30/- per column is paid in respect of matter exceeding one and a half but not exceeding three columns and the rate per column in respect of the excess over three columns is 40/-. Three newspapers, <i>The Derry People, The People's Press and The Connacht Tribune</i>, are at present participating in the scheme and the amount of the grant in each case depends on the extent to which matter in Irish is published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will summon a conference of representatives of the creamery industry, farmers' organisations and the veterinary profession, with a view to co-ordinating the efforts of all concerned in the eradication of T.B. from cattle in the general testing areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that prior to, and since, the start in September, 1954, of the bovine T.B. eradication scheme there have been frequent discussions on the scheme with the veterinary profession, creamery industry and representative farming and live-stock interests.  These discussions have proved most helpful, and I am glad to avail of this opportunity to express my thanks for the support afforded by these bodies. There has, however, been no demand for a general conference on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the number of pasteurising plants installed is sufficient and is he aware that the pasteurisation of this skim milk is an absolute prerequisite and will he urge upon the creamery industry to expedite the installation of those plants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question really arises out of question 15.  I have tried to make it as clear as I possibly can that I attach the highest possible importance to the installation of plants.  We are giving a 50 per cent. free grant to any creamery who will install such plant and I am hoping by example to get the co-operative dairying industry to adopt this policy on a voluntary basis. All the creameries associated with the Dairy Disposal Board, I think, have been equipped but the Deputy appreciates the difficulty that if one tries to force small co-operative societies into development of this character, one is liable to elicit the complaint that one is seeking to drive them into bankruptcy. The Deputy may rest assured that I attach the highest importance to the early installation of plants of this kind and any suggestion he has to make to me to expedite this on a <Col N="1828" /> voluntary basis, I will value very highly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assume that, when the Minister saw the groups to which I refer in the question, he saw them individually?  Would it not be far better to call a general conference, because the groups mentioned are, in the main, the participating bodies, and try to hammer out some agreed scheme by which he would commit all to participate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that we had, in fact, achieved that purpose. There have been, I think, meetings between certain individuals of these groups.  I certainly do not exclude the Deputy's proposal and I will examine it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the tabular statement circulated in the Official Report in accordance with the reply to his question on 5th July from which it will be seen that the reply to the first part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;; as to the second part I understand from the board that the provisional allocations of fishing boats already made by the board do not include boats for ports in the Deputy's constituency.  I am informed, however, that applicants from that area who are in a position to comply with the board's rules and regulations governing boat issues will receive every consideration in connection with any further allocations that may be made in the present financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Gaeltacht boat scheme has not been very long in operation and that it takes something from six to ten months to provide a boat for allocation under the scheme.  Already one boat has been allocated and another is ready for allocation. I will be most certainly prepared to receive a deputation of Deputies from Waterford or, if it facilitates the Deputies or the local interests, I would be prepared personally to go to the constituency and discuss the matter with the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that, even though the Gaeltacht scheme for the distribution of boats is new, judging by the number of boats allocated to my constituency, steps should be taken to see that Helvick is given consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to draw attention to one point.  We all realise the importance of agriculture in relation to the problems that exist at the present time.  Referring, therefore, to the points mentioned by the Minister in his statement yesterday, in relation to a 10 per cent. increase in output, the question arises: from whom is the 10 per cent. expected?  First of all, is it expected from the agricultural workers? Already we know from the questions answered in this House that, even in the last 12 months, the number of agricultural workers employed in the Twenty-Six Counties has decreased. We understand, of course, full well that they have been replaced to a large extent by machinery.  Therefore, I believe that the agricultural workers must be excluded from this request for 10 per cent., and if there is to be a 10 per cent. increase in agriculture, it must be brought about by the farmer through the utilisation of the machinery that he now has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain degree, that machinery &mdash;and we all agree with it&mdash;has been <Col N="1836" /> one of the factors in showing increased imports over the last couple of years. We understand that and we appreciate the importance of agricultural machinery in relation to agriculture. Therefore, that 10 per cent. increase in relation to agriculture at least must be pinned to those responsible in that respect.</P>
    <P>Then what of the industrial workers? Does the Minister expect a 10 per cent. increase from them?  Statistics will guide us, irrespective of the fact that Deputy de Valera this morning pooh-poohed the advantages of statistics, because apparently they did not suit him.  It has been proved from statistical returns that industrial output in relation to manpower, in relation to workers in industry, since the end of the war period, since 1949, has greatly increased.  Therefore, if we have these problems at the present time in relation to the financial deficit that shows itself very much, I maintain that the industrial workers are not at fault.</P>
    <P>Then the question arises: what of the industrialists themselves?  That is a matter we do not know of, whether the industrialists, as employers, are in a position to show greater output by improving their manufacturing methods in their factories and workshops.  That is a matter for them.  It is not a matter for me to complain about, because I am not in a position to say whether there is room for such improvement. If there is room for that 10 per cent. improvement in relation to the industrialist group, then that matter will be tackled.</P>
    <P>There is another section, and I wonder did the Minister include them in expecting a 10 per cent increase&mdash;or should it be a decrease, perhaps?  It all depends on the way we approach this point.  I refer to the commercial banks.  If we want a 10 per cent. increase in production&mdash;which, as we know, is so vitally important&mdash;we cannot forget the fact that the commercial banks are expected to play their part. Notwithstanding the statement so often made by many people, that, even in the past 12 months, the advances given by the banks were enormous, nevertheless there are certain views held in relation to the banking position, <Col N="1837" /> in relation to the deficit, and I think it is well the Minister should let us know where we stand.</P>
    <P>He stated yesterday evening here that banks lost last year, through our adverse trade balance, £50,000,000 of their own reserves, or roughly two-thirds. Of course, we cannot forget that many of those banks have their headquarters in Britain and if they lose on one side, if they lose in a branch office as it were, I wonder how they stand in relation to their business on the other side.  That is of doubtful quality&mdash; doubtful as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated&mdash;and he got the wholehearted support of Deputy de Valera at the time&mdash;that in case any of us may be mentioning this terrible suggestion of ours, he wants to have us understand that most or all of this money invested abroad is the property of individuals and therefore it would be heinous on our part to make any suggestions which would interfere with the rights of individuals.  We have no intention of doing that.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question in relation to our adverse trade balance. What are the rates allowed by the banks on deposits, what are the rates charged by the banks in respect of overdrafts and loans?  What amount of the balance becomes the property of the banks and how much of that money is invested abroad?  It is fantastic to tell us that that money is sacred inasmuch as it is the property of individuals.  We know that there is a percentage of it that is the property of individuals.  The Minister would not be in a position to give us the figures. It is no use to say that practically every penny of it is the property of individuals. We know that it is not.  It is essential to draw attention to these few points so that the commercial banks may realise their responsibility to the State and their position in relation to our overall economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the issue of a Government loan of £20,000,000. Deputy Corry, in particular, and Deputy Aiken drew attention to the fact that in respect of the last Government loan only £8,000,000 was subscribed by the public and that the rest <Col N="1838" /> had to be underwritten by the banks and by the Government.  The Minister made it quite clear that it is intended at the most opportune moment to float a loan and that he is anxious, as we all are, that the general investing public will subscribe to the utmost to that loan rather than that we should depend on the banks or the State.</P>
    <P>Again it is essential to draw attention to one point omitted by the Minister.  Last year the banks did act as underwriters and helped to close the gap.  But, for every penny that the banks invested they received interest at the same rate as that received by the private investor.  They are not acting for the love of this country. They are getting the last penny out of their investment and are doing very well by it.  In relation to the total amount of money invested by the various banking concerns in these loans, the banks are getting the same return for their money as the private individual who may be in a position to invest only a few hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that we agree with the Minister in regard to the desirability of inaugurating a savings campaign but, again, I should like to know what is the intention in that direction.  Will it be a case of advising the people to save and leaving it to themselves to invest through the banks or will they be advised as far as possible to channel their savings through State organisations?  If they invest in the commercial banks they will get one per cent. or 1½ per cent. and there is no guarantee that portion of that money will not be reinvested in foreign securities whereas, people should understand that for every penny they invest in the Post Office Savings Bank or other State organisations, much more benefit accrues to them and to the State.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that that may not fit in with some people's ideas.  It certainly does not fit in with the ideas of some people outside this House.  We are told that it is dangerous and we are told by supporters of certain Deputies down the country that every time we draw attention to such a matter we are trying to rob the poor old farmer, as Deputy Corry would describe him, of every pound he has in <Col N="1839" /> the bank.  It has been suggested that my drawing attention to this problem means that we are going to do something that will be disastrous for the country.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party and the Government fail to understand that while a large part of the financial problems confronting us arise in some respects from conditions outside this country, they are also caused by the problems in relation to the financial provisions of this State.  The Minister did not tell us, in relation to the adverse balance and in relation to the problems confronting local authorities, that quite a large slice of our debts are debts that must be paid by us under our present system to the commercial banks in respect of the provision of money for housing, sewerage, water supplies or other important measures, national or local, that it is essential to carry out.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party want to make it clear that we give full credit to this Government for trying to curb expenditure on commodities that people can do without, and we give credit to the Government in spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition wants to make it clear that nobody on this side of the House is honest.  It is well that this House and the people outside it should understand that in the measures taken last March and at the present time this Government did not find it suitable to slash the food subsidies as the Opposition did when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>I believe, and we of the Labour Party believe, that the Government in extending the items affected by the levies, have acted wisely and sensibly. We do not believe and never have believed that there was any need for panic, as some people outside and some people inside this House would suggest.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera drew attention yesterday evening to the choice that there was many years ago.  He referred to the question of labourers' cottages. Many of us know a great deal, thanks be to God, about the inside of a labourer's cottage.  We know what our people are prepared to do.  It is time that people who indulge in wishful <Col N="1840" /> thinking realised that unless sacrifices are evenly distributed the people within the four walls of the cottages will have every reason to complain as well. At least, it must be said in favour of the Government that the fact that they have not interfered with food subsidies has helped the occupants of these cottages.  It is encouraging to these people to know that the Government is acting realistically in trying to solve the financial problems without interfering with their normal life.</P>
    <P>As I tried to explain last March, in the debate on the levies that were then introduced, it is not sufficient to hope for an even balancing of our accounts at the end of the year as a result of the imposition of these levies.  If we just wait and hope, another expedient will have to be adopted for the ensuing 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture was fair in sizing up the policy of his Department in relation to agriculture.  However, unless and until the majority of our agriculturists realise that it would be far more beneficial financially to them to be better agriculturists and to be more interested in agriculture and less interested in politics and unless they are prepared to divorce themselves from the coat tails of any political Party and, through their organisations, to co-operate with the Government or the Department of Agriculture in relation to the problems affecting their industry, they will not flourish as they should.  However, if they are prepared to co-operate, they will have our support.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, no matter what Deputy Corry may mention in relation to the impositions to which he has tried to draw attention here of a couple of hundred thousand pounds one way or another in relation to sugar and other items making up the agricultural problems, we are entitled to say that we in the inter-Party Government agreed unanimously to give effect to our desire for the provision of millions of pounds of money to improve agriculture.  All Parties comprising this inter-Party Government were unanimous in believing that it was essential to provide money for land reclamation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> I am not taking credit from Fianna Fáil that when they were in Government they were anxious to provide money for agriculture because each Government did its utmost for agriculture within the ambit of its political programme.  However, at this stage, it would be far better for us to be honest with the agriculturists and to say: &ldquo;We are doing our part.  The people are doing their part by indirectly having to pay back the money that has been borrowed for the improvement of the agricultural industry.  That being so, will agriculture face its problems and its responsibility by co-operating with whatever Government is in power and, if possible, by producing the 10 per cent. extra the Minister has mentioned?&rdquo; If that can be done and if less politics are brought into agriculture, then, please God, whatever Government may be in office will not in future be faced with this problem of imposing levies or reducing imports in order to balance an economy which, in itself, shows cracks year after year in this country of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement yesterday on what has been described as his third Budget has come as a shock to the country.  It has come as a shock not so much for what is in it as the signs of its futility to deal with the problems with which we are faced.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has come as a shock because it has come too late.  Listening to the Minister's statement and thinking over what he hopes to get from these yields&mdash;a paltry £5,000,000 adjustment in the adverse trade balance and some £3,000,000 in taxation&mdash;everybody realises that this will not go any distance towards solving the problem with which we are confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally, the cause of the problem is simple.  One of the real difficulties we face is a lack of capital. That lack of capital has been particularly marked over the past 18 months and has been emphasised by the flop of the last Government loan.  I assert and I know that there has been a continuous outflow of capital from this country over the past 18 months.  There has been continuous investment of Irish savings in British industrial securities <Col N="1842" /> over the past 18 months and the outflow of capital from this State has never been higher than it has been in the past 18 months.  Any city stockbroker will tell the Minister that.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for it?  The fundamental reason is lack of confidence. It is the old problem that when a man, for instance, went to a bank some few years ago, he got certain advances not on what he had but on his reputation for work, on his skill and ability to do the job he was doing and on the trust and confidence of the banker in him. The banker then gave him the money he required.  In the very same way, the reason the State cannot now get the money it requires for capital development and, to a lesser extent, why Irish industry cannot get the capital it requires for further development is that the people have no confidence in the Government.  They have no confidence in investing their savings either in Government loans under the present Government or in Irish industry.  That is the reason there has been this drain of capital from the country in recent times.</P>
    <P>We have a freak Government.  Just as the French peasant, in the face of Coalition Governments and money losing its value, tried to collect every golden louis and put it in the sock and bury it under the hearth against inflation and the state to which their Governments brought them, so, too, our people no longer trust our Irish institutions, in view of the continuous loss in the value of money and do not trust the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>There is one thing about freaks: their lives are generally short.  You read occasionally in papers about a chicken being hatched out with four legs or a calf being born with two heads.  They do not live long.  We had to listen to the greatest freak in this Coalition Government for the past hour and a half trying to convince the people that Irish agriculture is at its zenith, trying to convince the people, against the statement by the Minister for Finance, that everything in agriculture is lovely and that because Dillon is at the head nothing can go wrong.  He would not concede that Irish agriculture has been in a state of <Col N="1843" /> stagnancy under his leadership.  He will not concede what the Minister set out when introducing his latest Budget, that is, that we had an overall decline of 2 per cent. in Irish agriculture. He will not concede that in every individual branch of Irish agriculture on which his dead hand has fallen, the nation has suffered and that we are recognised by all and sundry to be in the doldrums as far as agriculture is concerned, and, in particular, as far as agricultural exports are concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us examine some of his achievements. Let us take, in particular, the branches of agriculture that affect the small farmers in our community.  The days are gone now when we were to drown the British in eggs and choke them with butter.  Whether it is that when Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, was engaged in that campaign he did in fact drown all the British consumers of eggs and choke up the British purchasers of butter, the position now is that our egg industry, which was a very valuable export industry, has virtually disappeared, as have butter exports. Breeding sows have declined from January, 1954, to January, 1955, by 15.5 per cent.  The overall decline in pigs in the country during that period was 14.4 per cent.  In 1956, breeding sows declined by 9.6 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no Dillons left there now.  I want to tell the Minister that the problem we face in regard to the outflow of capital is due to the lack of confidence in the Government. Confusion has arisen because of different members of the Government <Col N="1845" /> speaking with different voices as to the problems the nation has to face, some of them pretending there is no problem, others pretending we were never better off and others still pretending that this is a temporary situation that can be overcome by taking very simple steps.  It can be seen, therefore, that there is no leadership for the people and the people have no chance to realise the serious situation which the Minister insists is there.</P>
      <P>I do not know what effect the Minister thinks his levies will have on unemployment and on the cost of living. I think he concedes in his statement that it will affect both.  I do not know &mdash;although the Minister and his colleagues assure us they have given a great deal of thought to this&mdash;whether they realise what the effect of these measures will be on the ordinary worker and his family.</P>
      <P>We can ask the people to tighten their belts if they understand that this problem is as serious as the Minister for Finance assures the House and the country that it is, but can we assume that the Minister is speaking for all his colleagues when we hear the speech of Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, here to-day who assures us that all is well and will even deny the statistics that have been produced by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, when they do not suit him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to the tales of woe from these benches but the greatest tales of woe that have come into the House are the Minister's own speech and that of the Taoiseach last night.  We are told now that we can never achieve British standards in this country.  We had both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture wringing their hands about the unfortunate fate of the Irish people.  We have no goal that we can ever achieve to bring our standard of living up to that of the British.  The only thing we have left, according to the Taoiseach last night, is our Irish heritage and the people are supposed to come back to that from Birmingham, Liverpool and London.  I suppose it is to continue the Irish heritage that the Government are importing free of tax, gentlemen <Col N="1846" /> like Joe Loss and Shan Wilkinson to people around the country attending dance-halls.  It is a poor inducement to hold out to the people for the future to assure them that they can never achieve the standards enjoyed by their brothers and sisters who go across to work for the Birmingham Small Arms Company or to work in any of the other British slums.  The only thing that is held out to them now by the Taoiseach is that we have a heritage here and we should preserve it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can get his own colleagues to assure their constituents that they can agree with him as to the position as he states it to be, if he can get them to assure the people as a whole that what he and the Taoiseach state is true, that this nation as a nation must make sacrifices to meet the grave situation in which we find ourselves, then he might expect to get some results, but if his colleagues are trying to have it both ways we cannot expect our people to meet the situation as it should be met.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what will happen to the housing programme throughout the country.  He has told us that Dublin and Cork can forget about a loan for the moment to finance their housing programme, that they are out of the queue.  It would appear now that the loan preserve is to be kept solely by the Government and for the Government, but I am concerned with Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Housing Acts as they affect housing in my county.  I am also concerned with the question of financing loans for housing there, and the position is that we can get no money.  The Minister suggests that we should make other arrangements.  Other arrangements might perhaps have been made 12 or 18 months ago before the Sweetman squeeze came on but I cannot see where a local authority like my local authority can get money that formerly came out of the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of providing our people with houses that are so necessary for them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister can give us an indication as to where local authorities like mine will get funds to meet the situation <Col N="1847" /> I would be very glad.  We have borrowed from our bank to the full extent of our statutory sanction.  From the Minister's speech, I take it that Dublin and Cork are being thrown overboard, and when we are told that £5,000,000 will be saved in Government expenditure I should like to know how that saving will be made.</P>

      <P>Since the debate opened yesterday we have had four speeches from the Opposition&mdash;from Deputy de Valera, Deputy Aiken, Deputy Corry and Deputy Moran.  I do not propose to deal at all with the irresponsible statements, to which this House has become so used, of the last two Deputies, except to say this in relation to one remark made by Deputy Moran.  The <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> is now published, and if the Deputy looks at it he will find that the normal revision that goes on after provisional figures are issued shows that the initial estimate of the 2 per cent. change in gross agricultural output has now been revised by the Statistics Office to .2 per cent.  It is only right that I would put the accurate figure on record.  Members of the House will be aware that such figures are varied from time to time on recheck and that the variation which may be revealed by the recheck does not, in any way, reflect on the Central Statistics Office or its methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1848" /> Deputy de Valera, when speaking after I had made my introductory statement yesterday, having got himself worked into a frenzy of fury, or perhaps it was an apparent frenzy of fury, about the procedure to be adopted &mdash;a frenzy or an apparent frenzy that arose because of a breakdown in what his own Whips had told him&mdash;proceeded then to make a few comments on my statement or on the measures I proposed. The only real comment he made on them at all was in relation to what I said in conclusion.  Time and time again the members of the Opposition have shouted that the Government were not taking action and that the Government would not take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I indicated that, if needs be, the Government would take further action.  If Deputy de Valera were sincere in suggesting in his earlier criticism that the Government did not take action in time I would have thought he would welcome wholeheartedly my suggestion yesterday.  In fact his attitude yesterday was that it would be all wrong for the Government to take further action during the Dáil recess.  I want to make it clear that it was solely because of my anxiety to announce the measures I did announce yesterday to the Dáil that, with the co-operation of the Opposition&mdash;let me say immediately that I am appreciative of the co-operation I received&mdash;the Dáil did not conclude its business last week.</P>
    <P>That enabled me to make this announcement to the Dáil yesterday. If the Dáil is in session I believe the appropriate place to make any announcement of national importance is in the Dáil, but I do not say that if the Dáil is in recess announcements should await the normal resumption of the House.  I made it clear that, as far as we are concerned, all we were doing was carrying out the normal functions of the Government.  All I referred to was that the Government would take such further steps as they might consider necessary in pursuance of their statutory powers.  I do not suggest in any way that the Government would take any steps in excess of those powers and, of course, no steps <Col N="1849" /> in excess of the statutory powers vested in the Government will be taken.  Let me say to the Opposition, clearly and categorically, that if, in the opinion of the Government, it becomes necessary to take any further measures to safeguard our economy, then the Government will take such measures.  If the Opposition wish at that stage to recall the Dáil to discuss such measures we shall be very glad to fall in with their wishes.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but it would be well to have this matter clarified since it has been referred to.  I assume the measures which the Minister refers to are measures of the type and the magnitude which he has just taken.  I assume there will not be any steps taken&mdash;I do not want to suggest there is any likelihood that such steps would be taken, but we want to be quite clear about it&mdash;such as the altering of our parity without recalling the Dáil.  I presume that would have to be done by legislation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are anxious to maintain, to do our utmost to maintain, the value of our currency.  I want to go further and say that so far as the Government is involved we are not concerned at any political embarrassment that may be caused in any way, by any measures that have to be taken. If ever in the future, measures have to be taken to protect that we would take them regardless of any temporary political embarrassment that might be caused.  As I said last week, in reply to Deputy MacEntee, we believe in putting the nation before any Party composing the Government.</P>
      <P>The measures that have to be taken in relation to the balance of payments are measures of the type that the Government took yesterday.  I hope that the people, following the lead of the Government, will make it unnecessary to take any further measures, but I would be lacking in my duty if I did not say that if measures were necessary the Government would not fail to take them.  Apart from that, Deputy de Valera yesterday had little comment, except to make it clear beyond question, what many of us thought was the case for some time, that in so far as he was concerned he was motivated more by hate of this Government than anything else.</P>

He also suggested the compulsory seizure of the Central Bank legal tender note fund.</P>

There are times when he approaches reality and other times when that reality seems to have flown far away.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;other speakers we had to-day on that side of the House.  Deputy Aiken mentioned those two alternatives and threw them aside, and to my view correctly, but he produced no other alternative whatever for our immediate problems.  I would say this, however, that he has, as clearly as anyone could, shown that he was totally opposed to the policy that was put forward last November by Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Aiken was at great pains to make it clear that he <Col N="1852" /> did not accept the semi-Keynesian view put forward by Deputy Lemass, speaking in Clery's Restaurant in November last.</P>
      <P>I must confess I find myself agreeing with Deputy Aiken in that respect, but I think it is a bit thick for the Opposition, who are always prating about unity, not to make up their own minds about what financial policy they wish to put before the people.  They have two fundamentally different approaches to the problem, one put forward by Deputy Lemass and the other by Deputy Aiken, and I am grateful to Deputy Aiken for making it clear that there is that schism, that split, in the Opposition on a matter of that importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister read it very carefully and the two are totally irreconcilable.  Let us know which is the policy of the Party opposite.  The people would like to know what the policy of the Party opposite is in relation to the times of 1956.  The Government has put its policy clearly on the table and it was clearly explained by me in relation to these matters yesterday.  We made our policy clear and if the Opposition has a different policy the people are entitled to know what that policy is and they should not be misled by one leading member of the Opposition taking one line, and another taking another line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a suggestion, and I see it was referred to in one of the newspapers this morning, that the measures which I announced yesterday were nothing like adequate.  The comment made in that newspaper was that when I was confronted with a trade gap of £94,000,000 and a gap in the overall balance of £36,000,000, all I did was to introduce levies calculated to reduce imports &ldquo;by the truly imperial sum of £3,500,000&rdquo;.  That comment was repeated in a slightly different way by another speaker to-day and shows a complete misconception of the whole position.  The imposition of the levies last March, and yesterday, were calculated <Col N="1853" /> to reduce imports in respect of the articles which were covered.  The impositions that were made yesterday will have that direct effect on those articles.  It must be remembered at the same time that such effect is in addition to, and on top of, the effect that the March levies will have for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater effect than the direct effect.  The indirect effect of the measures announced yesterday will be far more than the direct effect itself, the effect, for example, of ensuring that the additional proceeds of the levies imposed will be utilized for capital account and that, therefore, to that extent there will not be an inflationary credit situation created; the effect of the reduction of £5,000,000 in Government expenditure and, again, similar results flowing from that effect, and in addition, the direct effect of the reduction I indicated in newsprint imports.  There are these and other things.  It is quite futile to suggest that the effect would be confined to one measure, and one measure alone, when the whole purpose of my statement was to make it clear that these are a series of measures all calculated to tie in and have a composite effect rather than an individual one.</P>
    <P>But the greatest effect of all on our balance of payments would be a revival of savings, back to previous figures. In 1955, excluding the value of the change in the number of live stock on farms, personal savings were approximately £17,000,000.  In 1954, they were £38.4 million.  A revival to the 1954 figure would have more direct effect than anything else on our balance of payments situation, and it is the one fundamental thing upon which we must all make sure that we pin our hopes.  It is because we wish, amongst other things, to create an atmosphere in which the savings drive would continue, intensify and accelerate, and in which savings could be satisfactorily guarded, that the picture was put in that setting.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back to-day on what transpired in other years, but I do want to make this point very briefly. Deputy Aiken suggested that foreign <Col N="1854" /> loans caused inflation.  Foreign loans cause inflation, if they come at a different period to or in excess of the capital goods coming in on foot of them.  The basic difference between that conception and the practice of the last Government is that we are proposing a very, very limited foreign borrowing this year&mdash;very little indeed. My predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, utilized the proceeds of foreign borrowing&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want to open this debate on that basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference entirely is whether the borrowing is done at the time that capital goods are brought in or whether it is not.  In the present circumstances, it is entirely wrong for Deputy Aiken to suggest that the very limited foreign borrowing to which he referred could have inflationary results such as he suggested.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride made some references to the banks and to external assets, as did Deputy Desmond.  I did not quite follow one figure Deputy MacBride mentioned.  He referred to an increase of £4,000,000 in external assets.  If the Deputy examines the composite figures in relation to the increase in net external assets and gross external assets of the commercial banks in March, 1956, he will find that that increase arose solely because during that month sterling assets from departmental funds to the extent of approximately £5,750,000 were sold for the purpose of making good underwriting commitments on the National Loan.  The effect of such a sale of departmental funds' sterling assets must be that they flow into the commercial banks for the moment.  To assess the exact position, therefore, Deputy MacBride should have&mdash;he may not have been aware of the facts&mdash; deducted the amount to which I referred and he would have found that, far from an increase in that month, there was a further decrease.</P>

      <P>Quite so, but it is not the figures relevant to the commercial banks alone that must be considered.  It is the figures in relation to the external assets held by the commercial banks on the one hand and by departmental funds on the other. What happened was that there was a decrease in the sterling assets held by departmental funds in that period, which was offset by a smaller rise in the commercial banks, merely because of the sale of the securities passing through the commercial banks.</P>
      <P>I think also that Deputy MacBride omitted to mention that the British Government securities that are held by them are held not merely in respect of their liabilities here but in respect of their liabilities elsewhere as well, and that they cover their liabilities in respect of deposits in the branches in Britain of the banks.  They hold also, in addition to the Irish Government securities to which the Deputy referred, £14,000,000 worth of Irish municipal stocks and, of course, I need hardly go into the question of the £150,000,000 they have advanced here.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, I think that a good deal of the discussion in relation to bank holdings is out-of-date discussion. At one stage, the criticism there was of the commercial banks&mdash;criticism to which the Taoiseach referred in 1952-53 &mdash;was relevant and was justified, but the ratios are entirely different now. We must relate ourselves to the facts of 1956, and in 1956 the proportion of Irish deposits invested in Ireland, whether it is as cash, Exchequer bills, other bills, advances, or investments, is approximately 70 per cent.  That proportion is not sufficiently brought out. That was not the case some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The margin there is a very different margin from what it was some years ago.  Then, the percentage was nothing like that, but when we consider this problem in the light of the suggestions made by <Col N="1856" /> Deputy Desmond, we must remember that there is a fundamental basis upon which the banking system must be built.  We could have credit creation. I endeavoured yesterday to the best of my ability to show how such credit creation at the present moment would disorganise very much more our balance of payments problems; disorganise it very much more indeed.</P>
      <P>We must accept, and all Parties in this House I think do accept, that we want to get far more productive capital investment in industry and agriculture. The way we have to get that is to increase the personal savings of our own people.  If the personal savings of our own people are increased and are employed in Irish agriculture and industry, that will not create a balance of payments problem.  That would not mean the inflationary problems that at the present moment other methods would create.  That, I think, would be accepted by everyone in this House.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday, therefore, the policy of the Government, and of any Government in control in the future, must be to step up personal savings so that these personal savings can be employed in a productive way to increase our standard of life in the future.  If we do not do that and if we utilise our external reserves for more consumption in this way, we will fall further and further behind in the race between countries for better standards of living.  The more underdeveloped a country is, the more it must set aside from current consumption for further productive investment, because, if it does not do so, it will not succeed in catching up on those countries which have got a greater start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That must be the basis upon which our economy will be built.  If it is not, all we are going to do is to create further balance of payment problems in the immediate future and we will have no real solution.  Our solution must be considered from two angles.  I agree with Deputy MacBride that it must be considered from the immediate angle and these measures which I have introduced are merely dealing with the immediate angle alone.  We must consider it from the longer angle as well. <Col N="1857" /> What I stated in the House yesterday and to-day is that we cannot await the outcome of a long-term plan; that we cannot await the outcome of a long-term policy.  The need is immediate and if the immediate need is not met by an increase of say 10 per cent. in output in production of every form then we are merely going to go on living on our existing reserves and on our external capital and making the problem worse and worse.  Nothing except an immediate grappling with that problem on that basis can assist us towards a solution in the near future.  There must be consideration for the years ahead as well but the immediate need is being dealt with in this Bill and it is one that cannot brook delay.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the proceedings in the House when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking and to some of the things&mdash;not indeed very controversial&mdash;that have just been said by the Minister for Finance, but, particularly having regard to the attitude taken by the Minister for Agriculture towards the Opposition this morning, I feel that there are some matters that should be made clear.  We feel that our economic stability is in danger.  One hesitates to use the word crisis, and certainly one would not say that the ship was on the rocks, but we feel that the ship is at any rate drifting on a lee shore.  It is, therefore, the duty, not merely of the captain and crew, but of those who might be described as passengers, to do nothing that will interfere with the Government in the measures which they are taking to deal with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means to say that we will cooperate with the Government to the extent of our ability and to the full <Col N="1858" /> extent of any responsibilities we may have in this House in the measures that have been suggested; but that is not to say that we believe that these are the best that could be devised or that they will be in themselves sufficient to rectify the position.  We feel it necessary to say that for this reason. When the Minister introduced his Budget in 1955 and, again when he introduced his Budget in 1956, I, at any rate, having full knowledge of the problems with which he was confronted, felt that the Minister was endeavouring to do his best.  We accordingly were, shall we say, reserved in our criticisms of the measures which he was putting before the House.  Unfortunately, that attitude on our part, by which we endeavoured to assist the Minister in his approach to his problems, our endeavour to discuss the economic position of the country in as an objective way as was possible, was misrepresented. The people were told that the budgetary measures had the support of Fianna Fáil and the Opposition and that we could not do better.</P>
    <P>The measures which the Minister put before the House yesterday are being accepted by us in the belief that these, in the present circumstances, are the best that he can do&mdash;or rather that he can persuade his colleagues to do&mdash;in grappling with the situation.  The Minister has, however, in the course of his statement yesterday mentioned one or two matters about which we have grave doubts.  Certainly we view with great disquietude any proposal to borrow abroad.  We have had one experience of that already, that is when the United States loan was raised.</P>
    <P>I have consistently held the view that that loan was unnecessary, certainly unnecessary on the terms upon which it was raised and certainly unnecessary in regard to its currency.  I, therefore, having regard to the speech of the Minister for Agriculture here this morning, view with alarm&mdash;I cannot say that I speak for everybody; I have not consulted anybody&mdash;any proposal to borrow abroad in order to enable the Government to get out of its own political difficulties.  I say that because of what happened in regard to the <Col N="1859" /> Marshall Aid loan.  We borrowed $128,000,000 from the American people. This is how that $128,000,000 was disposed of according to the Minister for Agriculture, who spoke here this morning.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from Volume 130, columns 382 and 383 of the Official Report.  The then Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;How often has it been repeated that Marshall Aid was spent on maize, wheat and commodities of that kind?  What the heck else could you spend it on?  Let the truth now be told.  The Deputies of this House know what our principal problem was in the years of Marshall Aid&mdash;to get the dollars spent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and his colleagues succeeded in getting the dollars spent. The problem of those who have succeeded Deputy Dillon is how to repay those dollars and that will be the problem confronting those who succeed him in the future too.  The Marshall Aid loan, according to Deputy Dillon was spent on maize, wheat and commodities of that kind.  &ldquo;I spent,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;$5,000,000 on wheat in one afternoon.&rdquo;  There were $128,000,000 borrowed and dissipated in that way in a short space of two years.  What has the country to show for it?  Those dollars were spent as follows:&mdash; $77,000,000 on foreign wheat and corn; $35,000,000 on tobacco; $4,000,000 on motor vehicles and only $6,000,000 on a new plant and equipment.  The Minister for Agriculture has described that as productive investment.  We do not want any more expenditure of that kind financed by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Now I have sufficient faith, even though he is an opponent of mine, in the Minister for Finance and I believe that, as long as he is there, that kind of thing will not happen again.  But there is the danger that, once some of his colleagues get the bit in their teeth, as happened in relation to the Marshall Aid loan in the middle of 1950, the Minister for Finance will have only one option&mdash;to get out, if he happens to be there.  Therefore, so far as I am concerned, while I happen to be one of <Col N="1860" /> those who are on the ship, even though I have no responsibility for steering or directing its policy, I shall do nothing to interfere with the captain and the crew who have charge of the ship at the moment.  I shall do nothing to make their task more difficult and will try to impress on the people the statement which the Minister for Finance made yesterday to the effect that this position is not a self-righting position and that the Government will have to take drastic measures to deal with it. But I do not want to be taken, on this occasion, at any rate, as endorsing any proposal to borrow abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to our reduction in expenditure on capital and current account.  May I suggest to him that as a further measure the Government should reconsider its attitude towards what has been described as the Capital Budget?  I believe that one of the reasons why we are in this grave and serious position is because we have year in and year out borrowed for purposes which should properly have been financed out of current revenue, out of current taxation.  As the leader of the Opposition said yesterday we have in fact put our hand on the brake and kept our foot on the accelerator.  But that simile is to my mind only half applicable: what we have done by this device of the Capital Budget has been to discard the brake altogether and keep our foot on the accelerator.  We have, therefore, involved ourselves first of all in heavy commitments in regard to the moneys which we have raised by borrowing to defray expenses, that should have been met, year in and year out, out of the ordinary income of the State, met as it accrued from day to day; and not by mortgaging the future of the State and of the people as has happened in recent years.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, among the other measures which the Minister may have to take, he should reconsider the position in relation to the Capital Budget.  I am firmly convinced that we cannot continue to meet expenses of a kind which arise year after year in the same form out of borrowed money.  We can only secure financial stability if we meet these expenses out <Col N="1861" /> of current taxation and if we impress upon our people that very hard fact that, if they want these services and if they want these social amenities, then the cost of them must be taken out of the current incomes of the people.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to talk on this occasion because I take perhaps a more pessimistic view of the situation than does the Minister for Finance.  I think that the measures which he will have to take in order to correct the tendency of latter years will have to be even perhaps more drastic than those which he is now taking.  I say that with no desire to overpaint the picture and with no desire to press him on more earnestly than he himself is inclined to go.  He is the judge.  He has the information at his disposal which is not at the disposal of those who sit on this side of the House.  But I feel that this situation has got so far out of hand that it will take even stronger measures than the Minister has outlined to retrieve the situation.</P>

      <P>There is no question whatever of any external borrowing to get the Government out of its difficulties. What I am contemplating will be, as I said, of strictly limited operation: approximately £2,000,000, not for the State but for one of the analogous bodies&mdash;that £2,000,000 representing approximately the amount of capital goods that that body would bring in. In effect, it is not borrowing really. Perhaps a better way to put it would be to describe it as rather external borrowing, a deferred payment for the capital goods coming in.  It is not contemplated at all that it would be a State operation.</P>

My only view in respect of these things is a simple one&mdash;that anything one does, particularly in relation to economics, must be flexible, that it <Col N="1862" /> must be judged by the particular needs of the moment, and that it is in relation to the existing needs at any particular point of time that problems should be judged rather than by reference to fixed ideas of the past.  I propose in relation to our existing economic position, and what I see of it in the future, to judge it as far as I possibly can with a flexible mind.</P>

      <P>In reference to the suggestion of a ten-years' programme, I mentioned last night that a certain programme was adumbrated in the White Paper presented by the then Minister for External Affairs entitled &ldquo;The European Recovery Programme&rdquo; in December, 1948, and it was stated with reference to agriculture that it was expected that production would be increased by 1952-53 to the extent of 98 per cent. in the case of bacon, 39 per cent. in the case of poultry and game, 7 per cent. in the case of beef and mutton, 109 per cent. in the case of eggs, and 20 per cent. in the case of butter.  The Minister for Finance has corrected the figure given as to agricultural output for last year by telling us that, instead of a decrease of 2 per cent., there was, according to the latest figure from the Statistics Office, a decrease of decimal 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The important point from the national view is that while our net output in 1938-39 stood at a base figure of 100, in 1950 it was 100.7, in 1951 it was 103.4, in 1952, 107.5, in 1953, 107.4, in 1954, 109.4, and in 1955 the provisional figure was 109, so I think it is generally agreed that our agricultural output has gone up by roughly 10 per cent. since pre-war, and in the case of live stock and live-stock products, the figure is 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> Deputy Desmond referred to the agricultural industry, and I do not think his remarks were particularly helpful.  While the figures I have just mentioned may indicate that results have not been as good as we could have wished, there is another side to the picture, and that is that the economy of this country, as I have been stating in the Dáil for the last year and a half or two years, has been carried by the agricultural community and by the level of agricultural production and exports that we have had. I find, according to the table in the <i>Statistical Survey</i>, that the proportion of agricultural exports to agricultural output was almost 40 per cent. in 1953, and in 1954 it was 38 per cent.; and although there was a significant rise in the standard of living of the non-agricultural as well as the agricultural community, running into many millions of pounds, we still have the rather happy position that we had these large agricultural exports, which we only wish could have been larger but whose importance and the value of the work behind them nobody need decry.</P>
    <P>We have to regard agriculture as an industry in a special category, where the planning arrangements which may take place either in the O.E.E.C. or in any other sphere of, let us say, industrial activity may not apply.  Farming is a way of life.  It is not really a way to make riches, and it has generally been admitted that it is only during wars that the agricultural community could recoup themselves for past losses and get any kind of reasonably decent livelihood from their labours.  While we have been asking agriculturists to do more and to produce more, we must not forget that costs of production have gone up.  The agriculturist is not in the position, as we learned a number of years ago in our student days, of the business man who can close down and alter the rhythm of his production to suit market demands.  The farmer keeps on, and, if he has a good year or a number of good years, it is more than likely he will have lean years to follow.</P>
    <P>In 1947, the proportion of his net output attributable to the materials he had to purchase in his business, feeding <Col N="1865" /> stuffs, fertilisers and seeds, according to Table 57 in the <i>Statistical Survey</i>, was 10 per cent.  In 1949, it had risen to 15½ per cent. and, in 1954, it was 20 per cent.  It was estimated in 1952 that the farming industry was using, between superphosphate, potash and ammonia, less than 400,000 tons per year and that the optimum figure which could be usefully utilised on our land was about 1,200,000 tons.  It was ascertained also that in regard to limestone the requirements of the land came to 12.4 million tons.  That was apart from the annual spread which would be required.  Those were the arrears which had to be made up.  It is stated by the Emigration Commission that the use of fertilisers among our farmers is the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture tells us about the land project and that the value to the farmers who have been able to benefit by it comes to £10 per acre, if there are almost 700,000 acres reclaimed, that should mean an addition to their output of about £7,000,000.  When the Land Project was introduced, we felt that the results, perhaps even better results, could have been achieved on a lesser expenditure and on a less extravagant scheme.  What we failed to find from the Minister for Agriculture to our satisfaction is whether any survey has been made of the work done, whether there has been any follow-up and what is the extent to which fertilisers and lime, for example, have been applied.</P>
    <P>When I ask the Minister for Agriculture for particulars in regard to specific areas or specific groups of farms, he waves me airily aside, telling me that, where there were whins before, there is now agricultural production. The point is whether we are getting the optimum production that we are entitled to, considering the large volume of expenditure and whether expenditure on this and on agricultural development generally is achieving the purpose that presumably the Government and the authorities have in mind.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the best results, we must have organisation, and, on the Vote for the Minister's Department, I urged that the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1866" /> should shed itself of some of its responsibility.  If we want to get back to the spirit of former days and try to get a real national effort in connection with agriculture, surely we cannot depend upon the officials of the Department of Agriculture, or any other body of officials, no matter how devoted they may be.  It is necessary, and the Minister for Finance emphasised it, to get the full co-operation of agriculturel organisations.  He emphasised that we must get the co-operation of the public.</P>
    <P>We do not know whether any survey has been made of the needs of the smaller farms to the position of which special attention has been given in the Report on Emigration to which the Taoiseach referred.  If we want to maintain the population upon the smaller farms which, as the report points out, carry on a more intensive and more desired form of agriculture, than some of the larger farms, we have to give some incentives.  We have to have a type of organisation that will reach down to the smaller farms so that the farmers will have confidence in it, and be part of the economy, so to speak, a type of organisation that will be able to help them in their problems of providing capital, marketing their produce in the most economical way and getting the necessary advice that can be obtained for them through research and through other sources.</P>
    <P>It is very noticeable that no reference was made by the Minister for Finance to the industrial position.  Last year, the Taoiseach told us that about £80,000,000 additional capital had been put into the transportable goods industries between 1946 and 1952.  We are spending large sums on organisations for the development of exports and the encouragement of tourism, and the question is whether we are getting results commensurate with that expenditure, or whether greater efforts cannot be made in the existing situation to try to secure a greater foothold for our produce in the United States of America and greater advantages to our economy by our contacts with that country.  Our exports to the United States are only about one-seventh of what we import, and surely with the tremendous population of Irish extraction that we have there, it ought to be <Col N="1867" /> possible to build up a much larger market for our produce than appears to be the case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the home market, the proposals of the Minister for Finance which we have just been discussing will certainly raise the question in the minds of many of the Irish public, particularly the housewives, whether the Government is taking sufficient steps to see that costs of production are being kept down, and the consumer protected.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints one hears, when one refers to the need for exports and the imperative necessity for building up our industrial exports, is the charge that Irish goods can be obtained more cheaply in London than in Dublin.  I read a statement by a manufacturer lately, in which it was stated that so far as the home market is concerned, it was comparatively easy for the manufacturer to deal with his costing problem, because apparently the consumer comes at the end of the queue; but the moment the question of the export market arises, the question of costings becomes a very serious and very significant matter.  We know that if the prices of products could be reduced by 10, 15 or 20 per cent. there would be a much better chance of getting a stronger foothold in the foreign market and increasing our exports.</P>
    <P>We have an organisation which is supposed to deal with that matter. The Tánaiste has so many activities&mdash; as have had all Ministers for Industry and Commerce&mdash;that I do not think he can give this matter the attention it deserves.  Particular stress has been laid upon the necessity for better management, better relations between employers and their employees and the necessity for bringing our industrial organisation into line with modern requirements.</P>
    <P>In connection with the proposals for which the Minister for Finance has just received sanction, I wonder whether any action is being taken by the Government, in consultation with industrial interests, to see that costs will not soar as a result of any interest taking advantage of the present situation. <Col N="1868" /> On the contrary, with the opportunities they now have&mdash;as I stated already when we were discussing these levies in March last&mdash;Irish manufacturers and providers ought to be able to give our people the best value in regard to price.  If it is not possible for their prices to compete exactly with the possible prices of imported articles, it is our duty to see that, in quality and finish, they are satisfactory and that our people do not feel, when the home manufactured article replaces the foreign one, that they are being placed at any disadvantage either in regard to price or quality.</P>
    <P>One of the points that is forgotten in connection with the investment programme&mdash;and it has been referred to in the course of this debate&mdash;is that high capital investment seems necessarily to involve heavy exports, heavy demands for raw materials.  It involves greater leisure, greater spending and greater consumption by those who benefit from it.  One feels that the dependence on imports or on the production of durable goods even at home creates a certain instability and it is very noticeable in connection with the cost-of-living index figure.  I do not know how many items are on that index figure at the present time, but it has been expanded out of all proportion, to include goods and services that have arisen through the creation of new demands and the forcing of them upon the public through publicity and so on as to the needs they think they have for the purchase of these goods.</P>
    <P>In connection with our agricultural industry, surely we can all admit that there is nothing of more importance than proper nutrition of the population, nothing more fundamental than proper nutrition, giving our people the best food.  Yet it is noticeable that, over the years, far less has been spent on food proportionately and far more on articles which I think come under the category of durable goods.  For example, in the <i>Statistical Survey</i>, we find that, taking the 1938 prices as applying to the present time, the expenditure on food increased by over £6,000,000 or by one-eighth; the expenditure on clothing increased by £3.7 <Col N="1869" /> million, nearly a quarter; the expenditure on fuel and light increased by only about one-tenth; while the expenditure on alcoholic beverages and tobacco went up by nearly a quarter, by almost £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of other goods, whatever categories that classification may cover, no less than £15.3 million was spent, an increase since pre-war of 80 per cent. in pre-war money values.  Of course, it is a much greater increase, an increase of up to four times, if we take the present values of money.</P>
    <P>It is not alone the category of other goods but other services which has increased very substantially, by another £12,000,000.  Therefore, it is not in regard to food, not in regard to clothing and certainly not in regard to fuel and light, that the very heavy expenditures are apparent: it is more in connection with other items and particularly those under the heading of other goods and services, that we have this vast increase in expenditures while we have not had a corresponding increase in savings, at any rate in recent years.  It seems to me that we have to take, in our planning for the future, the basis of the productivity of the worker and the output that he gives us, which should determine&mdash;and we hope would determine&mdash;his remuneration, which should increase naturally if our economy were progressive.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us last year&mdash;he is not vouchsafing any information this year&mdash;that there had been a slight increase in output per worker for 1954, only a fractional one.  We do not know what the position has been over the years or whether output has been related in any of the available statistics to earnings, which seem to have kept pace with the cost of living and surpassed it at all stages since 1948.</P>
    <P>If we do not accept the productivity of the worker in industrial employment as the basis for remuneration&mdash;and that is rather difficult if the position is, as referred to by the Taoiseach last year, that less than one-fourth of our national income is attributable to industrial production&mdash;we should adopt the basis which would seem to be proper to an agricultural country, that is, the standard of living and the cost-of-living index that the agricultural <Col N="1870" /> population would consider reasonable for their needs or, if you like, the prices they get for the food they produce, the net return they get having regard to their expenditure and the capital they invest in the land.</P>
    <P>We must adopt one or the other of these bases.  We have been trying to reconcile or perhaps assimilate rural standards with urban standards, when, as Deputy Aiken pointed out, even under a regular and progressive and agreed development policy for agriculture, it would take some years in the normal course before we could provide the agricultural population with all the amenities and services that we would wish.  If the urban population think that, through the ballot box or through political Parties or otherwise, they will secure higher services from the State, a better standard of living, and so on, where so many people are reaping benefits and are anxious to take more out of the pool, it is difficult for the agricultural community to learn the lesson, even if they are patriotic, as we hope they are, that, in the general national interest, they should put their shoulder even more firmly to the wheel and get a higher return and higher production from the soil.</P>
    <P>We have to persuade agriculturists that we are interested in them, that we want to help them, that we realise that their industry is in a special category, that it provides very little more than a reasonable living, even in good times, judging by present urban standards, for even the best of the farming community.  It is only natural that the agricultural community should try to get all the services and amenities that the urban and non-agricultural sections are providing for themselves out of the national pool because they happen to be in a position in Dáil Éireann to secure them.</P>
    <P>The great majority of the farmers, particularly the younger generation, are fully alive to the necessity of improving their methods.  When the doctrine is preached to them and when they are told that attempts to cling to old methods and traditions in farming practice will not solve present-day problems, we will find ready and willing listeners who fully appreciate the <Col N="1871" /> position from their point of view; but, if our lessons, our advice and our anxiety to show them goodwill and to co-operate with them could be accompanied by a significant gesture in the way of reducing their costs and in the way of doing still more to ensure that the land is properly manured and limed and by taking steps, through organisations, to see that Government policy is carried out to the letter and to get the co-operation of farmers, we could hope for better results.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, there is a growing feeling among the younger farmers that they should be entrusted with more responsibility.  I wonder if the time has not come to pick a group of men of practical experience, business capacity and ability, to take up some of these schemes, who, by their association with farming life, would be able to get, though their personal influence and efforts and organisational work more of the results that we would all like to secure.</P>
    <P>Agriculture never got full value out of the co-operative movement.  The co-operative movement proceeded a certain distance in the way of setting up the co-operative creameries and to a certain extent providing for the farmer his requirements in the way of fertilisers and seeds and, to a limited extent, in taking his produce, but there were many things that the co-operative movement could have done in showing farmers what could be done.  What is being done at present in Johnstown Castle and in the agricultural colleges has been often referred to as the type of work that should be done on experimental farms throughout the country. That surely could be done through the co-operative organisations, if they were geared up to meet present-day requirements and if, as I am sure they would, they would give their full co-operation in the national effort.</P>
    <P>The wealth from agriculture is clear profit to the nation, whereas in the manufacturing industries proper, as I have already said, a great deal of material has to be imported and on the basis of these imported articles a standard of living is established that cannot <Col N="1872" /> be justified by the real situation of our people and from which we may have to retreat at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the report of the Commission on Emigration and pointed out that it had been printed. That was news to many on this side of the House because we had been under the impression&mdash;I had been, at any rate &mdash;that some nice ethical problem had arisen which had not been resolved.  If it has been resolved, that is all to the good, and we will not have the trouble, in future, of an expenditure of 12/6. The Taoiseach has reminded us we can have the printed report and we will not have to wade through the typewritten copies of the report which we were given some two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us last year also that the report was being examined. I do not know whether he expects us to take that very seriously, in view of the issues that have arisen regarding the recommendations in the report as to decentralisation, for example,&mdash;the possible decentralisation of Government services, at any rate, and the building up of other centres of population, for, as example, the City of Cork, the southern capital, which has staged such a splendid Tostal festival and which boasts such progressive and able citizens.  They would naturally like to feel, if there is a question of decentraliastion of economic and industrial activities, that they would be particularly in the picture and, as I have stated often in this House, towns like Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway, with their ports and their hinterland are particularly suitable for development and for trying to divert as much as possible of the new activities which tend to concentrate in Dublin to those towns.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated last year that he thought&mdash;unfortunately the publication of the Census Report has shown that his anticipation was very far removed from reality&mdash;that the long term tendency of a reduction in the male population in agriculture had been arrested.  I think we can all agree with the commission that it is the desire for the improvement in material standards that makes our young people emigrate.  There are, of <Col N="1873" /> course, other factors and one, I think, is the weakening of community life in the more out-of-the-way rural areas. When the rural population of young people falls below a certain figure, when the boys go to a ceilí and do not find sufficient girl partners there, as has been happening for years past, that is a very unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>When the commission made their report, they recommended to the Government that they should encourage and initiate economic and social activities favourable to increased population. We know that if the Government were going to take that recommendation very seriously, it might cost a great deal of money and a great deal of effort in the way of development of social activities which the Government might not consider its proper function, but I notice with interest that the report states that, since the Famine&mdash; which always has been my belief&mdash;the marriage rate had fallen from about eight&mdash;I think it is eight per 1,000&mdash; before the Famine, to 5 per 1,000&mdash;the comparative figures are eight and five in any case&mdash;20 years after the Famine and that there were influences at work in that period that stopped up the natural rhythm of rural life.  It would be very interesting to know just what these influences were, but I believe that the sharpening and the realisation of community feeling and the love of home and country, which the report suggests should be inculcated into our young people, might do something, though it might not do everything to restore rural life and revitalise it.</P>
    <P>The commission said that almost all the influences which determine population growth are matters which probably depend on personal decisions. That is quite true, but in the case of the rural community we have a great many farmers and a great many spinsters in the farmhouses who did not get married because, for some reason or other, the opportunities were not there.  In my opinion&mdash;and some of the criticisms regarding our educational system that have been made recently have, perhaps, a good kernel of truth &mdash;their minds were not directed at an early stage to marriage as they would have been across the water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1874" /> The first thing that strikes one when one looks at these population statistics is the comparatively early age of marriage in Great Britain and in the Six Counties, as compared with ours.  I think one of the reasons for that is that the moment the young person goes out to employment in these areas in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, from that moment he, and, I suppose, she, makes up his or her mind that the next step, and an early step, must be marriage.  In our rural households, that is not quite the situation, in the same way as the tendency may be to hoard their savings, as has been pointed out, rather than invest them&mdash; when they could be invested far more profitably&mdash;in their own land, in their own farms, and keep them deposited in the bank for a rainy day or for dowries that have to be paid.</P>
    <P>In some way, farmers are often slow to take these decisions.  There is the household situation.  There is the patriarchal background, if you like, and the individual does not feel himself quite as free to make this personal decision because of the responsibilities upon him and the tradition of the farm and the rural household, but if the position is that we have had this decline in the marriage rate going on right down through the Famine, it is, of course, very hard to root it out. However, I think that in the same way as, through co-operative effort and organisation, we could build up our production, we could also give these social amenities and give a certain glamour, a certain life and a certain social intercourse to the rural communities which, perhaps, does not exist at present.  It is true that the motor car has made this difference, that the tendency is to get away to the seaside or to a hurling match or to some other function.</P>
    <P>A combined effort might be made to have parish festivals and parish assemblies in connection with the Young Farmers' Clubs or the Irish Countrywomen's Association or any other association in all parishes.  The people could be got to see that it is what they have themselves and what has come down to them that distinguishes us as a nation and that <Col N="1875" /> when tourists and educated foreigners come to this country it is not to see a Dublin that is very little different externally from an English provincial city but to see the life of the people, to see our own customs, our own festivities, our own social gatherings and our own sports meetings in the natural habitat of the people in the Irish countryside.  That is what maintains the life and tradition of the nation more than anything else.  It certainly has a powerful influence as we all know in keeping our young people at home if they feel they have the outlet and that measure of social life.</P>
    <P>The commission dealt with the necessity, to which the Taoiseach has referred, of developing our agriculture as the primary and fundamental means of developing our economy, our production and our wealth.  It is said that only on the basis of a resolution&mdash;and I think we can all agree with this&mdash; never yet exhibited to develop the economy freely and a ready acceptance of the sacrifices which this would involve, can we deal with this question of emigration.  We are all very ready to give advice.  We are all very ready to tell the other man what he should do but it is another thing when it comes to giving practical example and accepting the sacrifice which is necessary if we are to get results&mdash; results which we in public life must also bear in mind and do our share to achieve.  It is not always realised that people are affected by example.  The hurler on the ditch is not the man who gets results; it is the man of idealism and enthusiasm and spirit.  The unselfish worker who goes down amongst the people will get them to respond. It is because I feel this is largely a social question and one which should be dealt with from the social point of view that I stress it here.  In that way we will get other results, more effective and more relevant to our economic needs.</P>
    <P>The necessity for giving all possible encouragement to the smaller farms is envisaged by the report of the commission when it points out that the gross output from the smaller farms is nearly twice as much as on the very <Col N="1876" /> large ones of over 200 acres, relatively speaking.  There are substantially more cows, far more cattle, fewer sheep and more pigs.  Of course, there is a great deal more poultry.  Even since the time the commission has examined this question, the position has moved more unfavourably I think to the smaller farms because the products which were associated in particular with their economy&mdash;poultry, eggs, pigs, bacon&mdash; have not been doing so well and the present position regarding them is rather uncertain.  The commission suggested that special efforts ought to be made to improve the grassland on these farms, to encourage more cows and more pigs and to try and get back to the traditional economy of the small holding which was characterised by a large cow population.</P>
    <P>The commission also dealt with the necessity for giving special care and attention to what are called subsistence farms.  In that connection they went on to make what was one of their most important recommendations, namely, that as far as possible schemes of drainage, afforestation and land reclamation should be worked conjointly with the economy of the small farms and that, in fact, as a counter to the migration which has been such a strong feature for generations past of life in the West of Ireland, there should be a national scheme even at a heavy expenditure of £5,000,000 to £6,000,000 a year by which a large number of families&mdash;they mentioned a figure of 50,000&mdash;could look forward to supplementary earnings for half the year. The estimate was £100 for the half year.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 420 they went on to say that if the scheme were too large, too costly, a pilot scheme should be undertaken of 5 to 10 per cent. of the holdings in these congested areas and that, by the expenditure of between £250,000 and £500,000 per year their suggestions and their proposals could be tried out on a smaller scale.  Having regard to the expenditure on forestry, land reclamation and land improvement work, I think it was not by any means extravagant of the commission to suggest that a fairly large pilot scheme should be established.  I am quite sure that, in the hands of enthusiastic <Col N="1877" /> men with the necessary technical knowledge and business capacity to which I have already referred, the time would come when we would be able to settle new homesteads, new villages and perhaps even new towns on some of these schemes.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a shortage of rural labour in some areas of the country but in these areas, whereas the families only migrated for a season before, the danger is that, with the high wages and good employment on the atomic stations, on the big constructional works and even perhaps in the motor or armament factories, they will take their families, as they have been doing, across to England with them.  Therefore, even with our best endeavours we may not succeed in holding them but at any rate it would show the people generally that there was some inspiration and some vision in the approach to the problems if we could get a large scheme of this kind which would aim simply at resettling a compartively large population of several score families in their own neighbourhood on reclaimed land and showing them under expert advice and supervision what could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should like to echo the opinions given from this side of the House to-day. In the first place, we do not know the full facts regarding the situation. We can only assume from what has been said that it is very grave indeed and those of us who have administrative experience must take the risk of being exposed to the adjurations of Deputy MacBride or others who may charge us with trying to cause alarm.  There is no necessity whatever to cause alarm or panic but what is necessary is to make certain, as Deputy MacEntee has emphasised, that the steps that are being taken will be effective and that we shall not be coming back taking in a few months' time other steps which may still not be effective.  The important thing is to take steps in very good time.</P>
    <P>We do not know whether the proposals put before the House represent the whole of what the best advice the Government can get in this matter <Col N="1878" /> would offer and would suggest as being necessary.  What is necessary may not always be practicable, but what would be very dangerous would be that in a deteriorating situation any time would be lost in taking steps which could have been taken before and that there would be a consequent and unnecessary loss in the meantime.</P>
    <P>It is not a matter for the Government or for us in the long run.  It is for the forces outside this House and for public opinion to determine in the time to come whether the steps that are being taken are sufficient.  If they are not steps that will give confidence that the situation is being grappled vigorously and thoroughly by the Government then we will not have the results because, as the Minister for Finance said, the psychological approach is most important.  The country realises that the situation is serious.  The people must also be made to realise&mdash;and it is to the Government they must look for leadership&mdash;that the steps that are being taken are sufficient, that they will be effective and will give the necessary results.</P>
    <P>For some time past I have had the same qualms as the Minister referred to regarding savings and whether we can get by publicity the necessary results that we would wish in that regard.  Unless there is a thorough plan, a thorough organisation throughout the country such as there has been in Great Britain for years past, unless it is in the factories and in the workshops and unless it is brought into touch with the farms it is very difficult to accomplish the work which in the long run can best be done, if it is feasible, by personal canvass, so to speak, and by personal contact with the public.  You send out a circular or you put up a poster but it is not quite the same thing as if you have somebody who goes to the factory, to a place like Guinness's, Jacob's, Ford's, Dunlop's or any of these big firms and organises the workers there to contribute a share of their savings and to signify that they are prepared to do that as part of their contribution to the national effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's Estimate generally gives an opportunity <Col N="1879" /> to survey Government policy for the previous 12 months.  On this occasion the Taoiseach decided to devote most of his opening speech to the grave problem of emigration which has been brought to the notice of the country generally through the recent preliminary census report.  Although the Taoiseach's main theme was emigration he failed to hold out much hope to this House or to the people outside it that the Government had any policy or plans ready to try to ease that problem.</P>
      <P>My summing up of his speech would be that the portions of it which dealt with emigration were purely and simply long quotations taken from the Report of the Commission on Emigration which was set up in 1948.  He quoted <i>ad lib.</i> from this very useful report. As a matter of fact, I felt that when he devoted so much time to quoting sections of the report, he must have been of the opinion that the majority of Deputies had not read it at all.  I got the impression that he was utilising the occasion to give Deputies an opportunity of hearing at least portions of the report.</P>
      <P>The fact is that it was a sheer waste of time for the Taoiseach to pick out paragraphs from that report, a copy of which was made available to each Deputy some time ago.  As I have said, quotations from the report formed a major portion of the Taoiseach's speech.  The remainder was divided up.  In one portion, he dealt severely with the people who dare, at this stage, to criticise Party politics.  He spent quite a lot of time dealing with the people who have the audacity to criticise the present Party political setup. The third part of his speech was devoted to telling us what had been accomplished in this country over the past 35 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the three aspects of the Taoiseach's speech.  He gave us his opinion on emigration as taken from the report of the commission; he dared the people of the country to criticise Party politics; and thirdly, he told us of the achievements of the different Governments here over the past 35 years.  As I said at the outset, he held <Col N="1880" /> out no hope whatsoever that this Government have any long-term policy in mind or any clear idea of how to tackle this major problem.  I shall take the last portion of his speech first.  He dealt with the achievements over the past 35 years.  I should be the last person in this House to deny that much good has been achieved by the various Governments.  There is no doubt whatever about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not start it.  As far as Deputy Roddy is concerned, I know he did not take me as being in the least discourteous to him.  The Taoiseach should listen to what his own Deputies say.  He dealt with the achievements of the different Governments and I think I am entitled, as a member of the House, to criticise his statement and to point out the omissions. Somebody must point out the omissions to the Government.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach dealt with the accomplishments of the past 35 years. Let us see what they were in the field of emigration.  In the past 35 years, 750,000 people, mostly youth, have fled from this fertile, undeveloped, semi-populated land.  This is a greater exodus than ever took place under the harsh rule of an alien Administration. When the British were here, they were blamed for driving the Irish people out of the country.  When the British themselves were driven out, the people still continued to go, but the fact that they continued to go in even greater numbers since the British went out led us to change our time.  Now we have decided that the people go for different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some go across, the Taoiseach said, fired by missionary zeal.  That is quite <Col N="1881" /> true.  Others, according to the Taoiseach, are fired with the spirit of adventure; more are attracted by the bright lights and amusements across the water.  That, to my mind, conveys the Taoiseach's impressions of the reasons why the people leave this country.  We are never short of excuses here to hide our own political shortcomings and to hide or cover up the fact that there has been no planned effort to put into operation here an economy that would enable the majority of our emigrants to live here.</P>
    <P>The greatest shock in years to people in very responsible positions was the recent census report.  The implications of that report stunned not only political leaders but the leaders of thought outside this House.  So stunning was that report that the Taoiseach felt it was his duty to make it the theme of his speech on this Estimate. His statement yesterday was: &ldquo;To-day, emigration is our greatest challenge.&rdquo; To emphasise how much of a shock this emigration business has been to the Taoiseach and to the Government, I should like to quote briefly from the Taoiseach's statement when introducing this Estimate a short 12 months ago.  At column 1090 of Volume 152 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach, referring to emigration, is reported as having said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is only a myth that the Irish are vanishing; for over a generation the Irish population has remained stationary and, particularly in recent years, has been enjoying a progressively increasing standard of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said the suggestion that the Irish were vanishing was only a myth.  I do not think I need comment much further on that statement, in view of the calamitous situation revealed by the census figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

      <P>If emigration continues at its present rate, I have very grave doubts if there will be many Irishmen left here in 50 years.  There will be a lot of strangers living in this country.  The Deputy from Cork may treat emigration as a joke, but if he does, he has another guess coming to him.  The situation disclosed in that census report shows that the people are emigrating, vanishing, if you like, from this country.  It shows that the rate of emigration was greater in the past five years than in any similar period in the past 50 years.  If that is not a cause for worry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the inducements.  The Taoiseach's remarks a short 12 months ago only go to show how little contact he has had with the situation in Ireland, although he is the Taoiseach.  It shows how little he, and the Government are in touch with the problems in rural Ireland; how little the Government know about the train services of C.I.E. which are packed with young people from the West of Ireland and it shows how few visits they pay to Westland Row Station, or to Dún Laoghaire, to see these people on their way to embark on the boats, day after day.  I say the Taoiseach and the Government have been completely out of touch with the problem of emigration in spite of the fact that they had the full resources of the Civil Service at their disposal, which reaches into every corner of the State and which, through the Garda Síochána and the Department of Social Welfare, would be able to notify them as to how many people were leaving and from where they were leaving.  The Taoiseach was so little in touch with the situation that he had to say it was only a myth that the Irish are vanishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" /> Perhaps I should quote him further on the opening of his Estimate last year.  This quotation should show the House how little in touch he has been. In column 1106, Volume 152, in the Official Report he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In recent years growing doubts have been cast on the previously held view that emigration was a bad thing in itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Taoiseach's statement just 12 months ago and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy O'Donovan, less than two years ago, made a statement, for which he was brought to book last night, in connection with the question of emigration, on a motion which was being discussed in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to embarrass the Parliamentary Secretary at this stage.  I thing he is pretty embarrassed by some of his colleagues at the present time.  Twelve months ago, the Taoiseach said there were growing doubts that emigration was a bad thing in itself.  As far as I can see, emigration was an evil thing, a horrible thing and a most undesirable thing, under the British Government, but it may not be such a bad thing now that our own Government is allowing them to go out in greater numbers, in fact, helping them out.</P>
      <P>I hope I will be forgiven if I give one last quotation from the Taoiseach's opening speech last year, especially in view of the fact that the Taoiseach was so anxious last year to point out that I had failed to give the views I held to the House last year.  In the same column of the same volume, the Taoiseach says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The reports of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems which were received last year are at present being examined by the Departments concerned, and when this examination is completed we will, I hope, be in a better position to assess the problem and the means of dealing with it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report has been in the hands of <Col N="1884" /> the Government for two years and all we know about what the Government thinks is that the Taoiseach on his Estimate comes in here and quotes lumps out of it and proceeds to say that there is no real recommendation in it, no policy that the Government can pursue.  Of course there are first class recommendations, but the point is: Will the Government have the courage to follow up any of these recommendations?</P>
    <P>What is the position?  The Taoiseach dwelt on the achievements of the last 35 years&mdash;a dwindling population, with the cream leaving the country, fleeing from it, at the present time, as from a plague; an agricultural output that has not increased since the end of the war, in spite of the aid of modern machinery, which is so freely available at present; an industrial arm that is weak and forever looking for protection in the form of tariffs or quotas, protection from virile and efficient competitors outside the State.  We have a transport system that is in a hopeless mess but retribution in that respect is being staved off by the setting up of a commission.  That period of grace will not last very long.</P>
    <P>Added to all that, and apart from the serious problem with regard to our balance of payments, we have what, to my mind, is still worse, at the present time: the tightening of credit and a shortage of finance that is threatening to cripple our already limited capital development programme.  In a nutshell, after 35 years of self-government we have a tired and dispirited nation gradually sinking into a coma.  While this is going on, we have frank appeals made to the few who are left, to save more and spend less.  We have a third Budget brought in inside six months, imposing restrictions on the importation of a multitude of goods of minor importance.  The idea of these duties is to help ease our balance of payments and we are solemnly warned by the Minister for Finance that he might have to give us further punishment.</P>
    <P>Apart from the hairshirt that Fianna Fáil put on in 1932, there is now a hair trousers on the public and an overcoat of the same material as well.  While we are putting restrictions on nylons, <Col N="1885" /> mouse-traps, buttons, and so forth, we have shiploads of grain and foodstuffs coming into our major ports from abroad, coming in from the four corners of the earth.  That grain and food could be, and should be, produced on the land in Ireland.  We have the sight, over the past few years, of ships loaded down with American and British coal, unloading at our docks, coal which was to be sold at fantastic prices at a later stage, while Bord na Móna close down their bogs in the many parts of the country and the E.S.B. prepare to curtail their generating programme.  That is the position.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach feels I am wrong in suggesting that Bord na Móna have closed down the bogs, I will refer him to decisions taken on a number of occasions over the past eight years with a view to semi-automatic produced turf. The production of that turf gave first-class employment, and it was a native fuel that could be used.  We have the exhortation to the people to produce more here in Ireland and to use what can be produced in Ireland.  But the Government of the country, and the Dáil itself, are the first to set the bad example by using foreign fuel to heat the very establishment where the laws are made.  We tell commercial firms: &ldquo;Why not use peat?  Why not use turf?&rdquo; but when it comes to setting the example, the Oireachtas are not satisfied with peat.  No; they must have a foreign fuel to heat this establishment. That may be only a minor matter, but it is a matter in regard to which the public may say: &ldquo;How are we to believe in any Government or Governments which exhort us to do certain things, when those Governments themselves will not set the example?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have to-day listened to the Minister for Agriculture in great form telling us what he has done for agriculture.  According to him anything that was of benefit to this country started in 1948 when he became Minister for Agriculture.  Of course, he was very careful to point out that this terrible worry of inflation, rising prices and the problem of balance of payments that exist here are all only part of an international <Col N="1886" /> situation.  He said that Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark and Spain had these troubles and that only West Germany and some other country had not these problems.  It is grand to be able to put your view across to the public in the way in which the Minister is able to do it.  For years, he has succeeded in putting his views across, but I think the day has come when his views on matters of finance will not be seriously listened to by the Irish public.</P>
    <P>He has suggested that the same illness is apparent here in Ireland as in the European countries and in Britain. Superficially, it would appear that we have the same illnesses of inflation and problems in regard to trade; but underneath the superficial exterior, the problem in Ireland is much deeper than that.  The tragedy is that we are applying the same remedies as &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; is applying now.  We are applying the same remedies to the illnesses which beset us here.  I read some place recently a very apt statement on this matter by a well-known observer of the economy of this country.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir Anthony Eden's reducing diet for the obesity of &lsquo;John Bull&rsquo; is not going to be a cure for Caitlín Ní Houlihan's malnutrition.  It is a blood transfusion that the girl needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is very true.  I have no objection whatever to the restrictions imposed by the Bill introduced here yesterday by the Minister for Finance, but I have a very strong objection to the other measures which are not disclosed to this House&mdash;the restrictions on credit for worthy purposes, the behind-the-scenes grip that has been placed on money by the banking concerns of this country who will not release money to-day or to-morrow to any responsible citizens of the State, no matter how desirable the projects may be to which that money may be put.</P>
    <P>There is a complete tightening up.  I do not know who gave the directions. I should like to find out.  I should like to find out if we have reached the stage when the Government themselves have no power whatever to interfere and that the bankers have taken this <Col N="1887" /> step of restricting credit on orders direct from London.  Some of our key advisers on financial matters have been in very close touch with the London financial people over the past few weeks.  I wonder what was going on behind the scenes?  I wonder what was the reason why some of our experts had to hasten to London within the past couple of months for consultations with financial experts of the British Government?</P>
    <P>I do not want to say much more about that aspect here because I feel it would be necessary to go into too much detail and I do not think that would be justifiable at this stage. However, I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the Government that, in trying to prevent the people overspending, as they say they are, on imported goods, that they ensure there is no restriction of money or credit for useful development purposes.</P>
    <P>We have disclosed in the statement of the Minister for Finance that a gap of £5,000,000 will possibly have to be met in respect of the completion of the capital development programme for the coming year.  It would appear that the Government are tied to the idea that capital development in this country must be financed from savings alone. We are so far behind in capital development that the savings of the people are insufficient to put into operation a capital development programme that would, even in ten years' time, get the number of people into employment that Deputy MacBride, Deputy Lemass and others say should be employed.  Does anybody seriously suggest we will get 10,000 people per year put into new jobs with a limited capital development programme of £37,500,000 or £43,000,000?</P>
    <P>When the money for capital development purposes is not available, it is a much more serious matter than the question of the balance of payments.  If we have not the money for the capital development programme, our balance of payments position is bound to get worse in the years to come.  If we are not able to produce more goods here, then we are bound to have adverse <Col N="1888" /> balances; whereas if we could produce more goods, we would have more money for capital development.  I am not going into any detail in this.  I am not an expert on finance and I have never posed as such; but it strikes me as rather peculiar that every time the pound note in the British Treasury gets a slight chill, the Irish pound note immediately suffers from double pneumonia.</P>
    <P>I have painted a very gloomy picture, and I have done so on purpose. It is often essential to see the worst side of things and to see how black things really can be.  It is a question, if you like, of the darkness coming before the dawn.  The crisis that faces us at the present moment has not come overnight.  It did not come in the last six months; it did not come in the last three years purely as a result of the present Government.  The picture, as it is painted to us here in the Minister's Budget statement, has been unfolding itself over the past 15 or 20 years.  It is not the fault of any one Government in the State.  Each Government has been doing its best to cure the position according to its views and according to its own lights.</P>
    <P>The position is that each Government on its part, and the people, have gone on hoping that things would change whenever the different Governments took office.  I repeat that their hopes in that direction have not been realised.  It would appear that the more Governments have changed, the more they have remained the same in this country, as far as their policies are concerned.  For years, as a nation, we have shown an unfortunate and extraordinary ability&mdash;or perhaps I should say an extraordinary capacity&mdash;to sidetrack realities and to console ourselves with the thought that things could be worse, with the result that we have stumbled aimlessly and blindly along until we have reached the crisis which is facing the nation to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputies might say that things are bad, but they are not as bad as I am trying to paint them, and it is all right for me personally to criticise.  I agree it is easy to criticise, but I want to say also that I have made proposals on many occasions since I came into <Col N="1889" /> this House in 1948; proposals that have in many respects been recommended by very responsible groups of people outside, but these proposals were never taken seriously.  Some of the proposals I made here have now been made by the Commission on Emigration, but when I made similar proposals and put them before the Government, they were merely sneered at.</P>
    <P>I feel that this question of emigration, particularly as I see it in the West and the congested districts, has been a very real one for years past and it has been a very real one indeed for Deputies in those areas.  Some time ago, I put down a motion asking the Government to take steps to deal with it and the Taoiseach's reply was to describe me as a professional wailer. So far as emigration is concerned, the Taoiseach can expect nothing from me when he says things like that.  He can expect nothing from me but harsh words, and I hope he is able to take it.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Agriculture to-day telling us that there are more cattle to-day in Ireland than at any time since statistics came into operation. It is extraordinary that at the very moment when our cattle population has reached its highest, the population of our country has reached its lowest point in Irish history.  To-day there seems to be glorification of the bullock and the emigrant ship for Irishmen.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Lands speaking here this afternoon quoted one of the reports of the Commission on Emigration dealing with the output from small farms.  The findings of that commission were that the greatest output came from the small farms.  The output from these farms was greater than the output from the farms of 200 acres and upwards. <Col N="1890" /> We are all dependent on agriculture. It is the only industry we have in the country to enable us to meet the present situation, but what steps are the Government taking to ensure that the land is being utilised to its fullest extent?  The best land in this country is held in farms of from 300 to 1,000 acres, and, in the majority of cases, that land is not being utilised for the benefit of the nation, or even for the benefit of the owners themselves.</P>
      <P>We have these people with these large acreages of land and yet we find that the small farmers of the West are producing more per acre than these large land holders.  In those circumstances, we find that those large land holders are getting the same facilities and privileges as are being given to the farmer or congest with a £5 valuation. The solution to that type of problem is that large tracts of land which are being allowed to go waste should be taken over and distributed amongst these small farmers so as to give holdings of a minimum of 40 acres. That would be giving the land to the people who are prepared to work it and the commission has reported and Dr. Lucey has stated in a report, that if the land was properly divided, a further 30,000 holdings could be established with a minimum of 40 acres each&mdash;30,000 holdings with families of four per house.  We can all quickly realise what that would mean for the benefit of the nation.</P>
      <P>It is time that there was a limit put to the amount of land which any man can hold in the country.  I am not going to suggest a figure, but I do say that there should be a limit to the amount of arable land which any one man can hold and the land over that limit should be taken over&mdash;of course the owners would be paid for it&mdash;and given to the small farmers who will work it and produce from it. Undoubtedly you would have an outcry from the vested interests in Meath and elsewhere if that was done, but I am convinced that it will have to be done eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard people here and outside talking about co-operation.  These people say that the small farmers should co-operate, but these people are <Col N="1891" /> not going to get away with that.  So far as the congests are concerned, no matter what co-operation they have amongst themselves, they will still be living in a rural slum.  We have the Taoiseach and other members of the Government telling us that the people are leaving the West of Ireland for social purposes.  They are fortunate in that they are able to point to one or two cases where people in good jobs have emigrated, but the fact is that the people are leaving the West of Ireland because they cannot get a living there.  I would love to see one of these Ministers going down to a congested area and making that type of statement there.</P>
    <P>I have said that, according to their lights, every Government does its best. This is a democracy and, if we examine what a democracy means, we will find that it is very simple.  Where there are only two major Parties, there is no room for both Parties on the right of the line.  Now there cannot be any proper progress made where the two major Parties in any democracy are of the same way of thinking.  In this country, our two major Parties are conservative Parties, whether they like it or not.</P>

      <P>Prior to 1922, there was never any apparent difference between the revolutionaries on economic and social principles.  Then came the split on the Treaty and the aftermath of the Civil War.  Next came the formation of our political Parties, Parties almost identical with those we have to-day.  The formation of these Parties was based on acceptance, or otherwise, of the Treaty to a great extent.  Time has healed the terrible scars and bitterness of that period and the issue of the Treaty is something that is best forgotten.  The ranks have closed now and all are at one in relation to the solution of the Border problem and the means to achieve it; but, despite the fact that the ranks have closed, an artificial difference has been fostered over the years between the two groups, an artificial difference <Col N="1892" /> on matters of social and economic importance, and that artificial difference enables the Parties to-day to maintain their separate identities.  As a result of that, in recent years, we have seen what almost amounts to the setting up of political dynasties.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his opening speech criticised severely those of us who have the temerity to criticise Party politics here.  I am not worried about what the Taoiseach said in that regard.  I am personally in favour of Party politics where there is the fundamental difference in the policies of the Parties. I should not like to see this House full of Independent Deputies and I do not think that day will ever come.  I suggest, in all sincerity, that we will have to get a change of mind in the two major Parties with regard to their programmes.</P>
      <P>Ireland is facing a very dark hour as far as its economy and, perhaps, as far as its political freedom is concerned, because of the possible collapse of that economy.  It is apparent, listening to the speeches made here, to both Deputies and the general public outside the House that no particular Party here has produced a policy or a programme which will meet the situation. As a matter of fact, my feeling is that the Opposition at the moment do not want to take power, and I do not blame them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I say that, I am not saying it from a Party point of view.  The Opposition would not like to have to face the serious problems that beset the country at the moment and the Government equally cannot be too happy in their appointment at the present time.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture to-day sounding off again on this question of criticising those who disagree with the Party set-up here.  I want to ask a question and I want someone wiser than I am to answer it.  I want someone to tell me where the major Parties here differ fundamentally in their approach to agriculture.  I want to know where the major Parties differ fundamentally in their approach to the most important part of agriculture, mainly the land rester' <Col N="1893" /> distribution programme and the ending of congestion?  Where do they differ?  I should like someone to tell me where do the major Parties differ in their policy or methods in relation to the expansion of our industrial arm.</P>
      <P>While, for instance, we depend to-day to a great extent on our cattle trade to keep us in a position to pay for our imports, we had over the past 30 years an opportunity of providing an industry from the soil, an industry which would rival the cattle trade in importance, namely, the manufacture of Irish whiskey.  Scotch whiskey on the American market last year was worth over £42,000,000.  Irish whiskey was worth less than £300,000.  Now everything that goes into the manufacture of whiskey is grown in the country and comes from the land.  A £10,000,000 sale of whiskey outside this country would be worth more than £40,000,000 of cattle because of the employment it would give in the growing of barley, the distillation of the whiskey and in the distributive trade.</P>
      <P>What have we done?  When has any Government had the wisdom and the foresight to tackle that industry while the Scotch wiped our eye over the past 30 years?  Its importance would have been greater than the cattle trade.  But neither major Party had the courage to say to the big distillers: &ldquo;Gentlemen, if you do not do your duty and expand the distilling industry, we will do it ourselves and put you out of business.&rdquo;  Because of the major Parties' worship at the so-called shrine of private enterprise, the alleged sacred freedom of the individual to do what he likes, we have allowed a couple of these major distilling companies to sneer at the very seat of Government by their refusal to expand an industry that could be of the greatest importance to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party here can undoubtedly point to greater achievements, perhaps, than their opposite numbers in the field of social services and industrial developments.  They may have, too, not just a slight difference of degree in their approach to these problems. I am trying to find out from somebody if there is any fundamental difference in their approach to the problems. <Col N="1894" /> I can see none, and all I can say is that between them they have set up an artificial pretence that there is a fundamental difference between them in their social and economic principles. Their pretence, built up over the years, has helped to bedevil politics in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>I am only quoting the Government when I say that, according to the Taoiseach, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman, we face a really serious crisis.  If things get worse in Britain &mdash;and I think that they are bound to, in spite of the efforts being made by the present Government&mdash;what are we going to have?  We are going to have here a reduction in the capital development programme, and a reduction in the money the local authorities are going to spend.  That means that men already are being left off in rural Ireland, and they are heading for the emigrant ship.  Irishmen in England working in factories who will probably be dismissed very shortly will meet the outgoing emigrants.  That will be a nice kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>Has the Government given any consideration to the problems likely to face this country, problems even more serious if our youth who have fled this country for the past ten or 15 years are forced to come back as a result of depression there?  Have we any long-term plans to meet emergency situations like that, or have we displayed our usual capacity for side-tracking that nasty issue and deciding &ldquo;Hope for the best; perhaps it will never happen at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that there is an immediate solution to the problem of emigration or that it can be solved overnight with a flick of the fingers&mdash;nobody in this House or outside it is foolish enough to suggest that &mdash;but there is no spark of inspiration, no striking approach to our problems by the Government or by the Opposition that would halt intending emigrants in their tracks with the hope that they could stay at home with a sense of security and that they could get employment.  Any outside student of politics to-day would be hard put to find any difference in the mentality, outlook or programme of the major Parties in this country to-day on <Col N="1895" /> economic and social matters.  Until that is brought home and sinks deeply into the minds of the Irish people, there is little or no hope of dealing realistically with the problems that have to be faced and solved.  It may be too late when that feeling or realisation sinks home into the minds of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The only hope I see now lies in the formation of a national Government, composed of all Parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only alternative to that I can see in a few years' time is a dictatorship, which would be an infinitely worse form of Government than a national Government ever could be.  I have no personal love for a national Government as such, but we face a national emergency that calls for the loyal co-operation and help of all, and for the expert guidance of the best brains in all Parties working together and having responsibility at the same time.  I know that my words will probably fall on deaf ears, as far as this House is concerned.  Perhaps years of monotonous, soul-destroying obedience to the Party Whips has sapped the political spirit of many of the Deputies of this House.  I say that as far as real politics are concerned at the moment loyalty to the country should come before loyalty to any single political Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to put this in a practical way, I believe that you must have this close co-operation between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for a limited period. There is nobody suggesting that a national Government should be there for all time.  There should be a national Government for a period of three to five years, and, at the end of that period, we could have a fresh approach to economic and social problems, and men in this House would be in a position to sort themselves out purely on their views as to how economic and social problems should be tackled.  We could have a two-Party system in this country then&mdash;one conservative, one progressive&mdash;and let the people choose whichever Government they liked, <Col N="1896" /> depending on the situation that obtained in the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Taoiseach feels that in an emergency like this the help of all Parties in this House is essential he can take one immediate step.  I suggest that the Taoiseach should invite the President of Ireland to address this House.  Under the Constitution, the President has power to address this House and he has power to appeal here in this Chamber for the unity for which he has been appealing outside this House.  At various public meetings, he has suggested that the past should be forgotten and that close co-operation should exist.  I urge the Taoiseach to invite the President to come here and make that plea to the leaders and the major political figures on both sides of the House.  If that step is taken by the President, the ranks will close in rural Ireland amongst the ordinary people, and the remaining scars will be forgotten and the sores will be healed, if the differences that exist at the top level in this House are smoothed out beforehand.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say on this Estimate, except to point out that I presume that there will be a vote on it.  If I have the opportunity of casting a vote, I am going to vote against the Taoiseach's Estimate because the Taoiseach selected emigration as the topic of his statement.  My vote will be cast against the Taoiseach for his inept approach to the very serious problem which he himself described as a challenge to the nation.  My vote in that regard will bear little weight, but I want to have on the records of this House my deep disappointment with the lack of a programme or a policy over the past two years on the part of the present Government in the matter of facing up to the major problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>If this Government feel to-morrow morning like going to the country and if they are beaten, I do not suggest that the present Opposition are in a position at the moment to produce a concrete long-term plan to meet emigration. I want to make that clear.  I <Col N="1897" /> want to repeat what I have already said.  In the crisis facing us with the life blood of this nation pouring out from our ports week after week all over the country, a truce should be called to the Party political warfare for a period of three to five years and a national Government should be formed.  If that step is taken the people who are leaving will pause, think and say that there is hope at least that they can stay and work in Ireland.</P>

      <P>No.  What I have to say on the immediate issue was said yesterday.  &ldquo;The bridge broke down and they all fell in; we'll find good ground at the bottom, said Brian O'Lynn.&rdquo;  I do hope that we have found good ground before we have reached the bottom and that the country also will have found good ground before we have reached the bottom.  I have had two very refreshing experiences in my life.  One was when I listened to the members of the present Government on the opposite <Col N="1898" /> side when they declared their allegiance to the Constitution and their allegiance to the Republic.  I have had another very satisfactory experience within the past few days.  I heard people speaking from these benches with voices that could only suggest to me the rake's recovery.</P>
      <P>On these benches, when those members sat here, we had doctrines preached that were quite the reverse of the doctrines I have had to listen to for the past few days.  &ldquo;Brian O'Lynn&rdquo; came into my mind as I thought of my younger days when I heard that old song or rhyme.  Another thought came into my mind reminding me of my young days when I remembered how I used to have laboriously to write on the copy book this sentence: &ldquo;Experience keepeth a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that school is a dear one, but if we get fools to learn before it is too late, as Deputy Aiken said to-day, it may in the long run be worth the price.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance spoke of the serious situation with which we have to deal.  My criticism of the Government in connection with that was that the different members of the Government, even in this crisis, when the co-operation and support of the people as a whole was required, could not be got to talk to the people in the way they would be respected.</P>
      <P>To-day I listened to the Minister for Agriculture speaking again in the old strain.  I suggested that in regard to some of the other members of the Government the Taoiseach should take them by the ears.  I did not mean physically, of course, but I suggest to him to put a gobán on the mouth of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a dairying district and I know what a gobán is and why it is put in the mouth of a <Col N="1899" /> calf.  A gobán needs to be put on the Minister for Agriculture when he talks, as he talked to-day, about the uselessness of foreign assets.  We are asking the people to save.  Why should the people save to keep assets that are suggested to be of no value?  They are either of value or they are not.  We used to be told by a gentleman before the election&mdash;a gentleman who has not appeared in this debate&mdash;that there was £20,000,000 to be saved in economies. We used to hear from that gentleman, too, of the useless paper which was being secured for our produce during the war.  Now let us, at least on this important matter, try to get down to realities and give up the nonsense spoken in the past.</P>
      <P>Why are these measures which will impose considerable hardship on our people being introduced, if the foreign assets which have been depleted are of no value?  Surely, any of us who have given any thought to the matter know the value that they have, that as long as they exist they are there to help out the national economy, to enable us to get in from outside the things that are necessary for the preservation of our standard of living here.  Is that a fact or is it not?  If it is not a fact, then the whole thing is nonsense.  If it is a fact, surely the members of the Government ought to be trying to get the people to realise it.</P>
      <P>We know perfectly well that the present situation is caused by the fact that our foreign assets are being depleted at such a rate that, if it were allowed to continue, we would be in the position that in future we could import only the equivalent of what we export.  At the present time, that would mean cutting down our imports from some £200,000,000 odd to £110,000,000 odd.</P>
      <P>These millions were used to purchase products which were used here in this country in one way or another.  The main trouble about them was that they were not being used as savings should have been used, past savings: they were being frittered away in consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that successive Governments here have had as their <Col N="1900" /> aim the building up of foreign assets. That is not so.  What we have in mind &mdash;and what I hope any sensible people in the present Government have in mind&mdash;is the use of those assets as savings should be used, for productive purposes, that is, for capital purposes that will be productive.  We never said that assets should be built up with savings if those savings could have been used here immediately for productive purposes.</P>
    <P>The banks have been blamed because we have had external assets.  How are those assets built up?  They were built up because of the goods which the stranger, the outsider, had received from us or for the services which we had rendered to him.  That is how our foreign assets were built up.  Mostly they were built up in Britain during war periods.  These assets are simply the £'s which were given by the British for the goods and the services which we rendered to them.  They can only be brought home by our getting back goods and services in return for them.</P>
    <P>We had to-day an instance of what happens.  There was an increase of some £4,000,000, that was referred to by one of the Deputies, in the external assets of the banks.  Of course, the Minister for Finance was able to point out afterwards how that was built up, that there were assets already in Britain with a different ownership, belonging to the Government or Government Departments, and the moment these were sold they were still British and they were turned into British pounds.  They were external assets, they were a claim by us on British goods and services.</P>
    <P>Now, a small bit of clear thinking on a matter of this sort should make us realise that the existence of these assets represents a claim for goods and services on strangers, to be rendered to us.  Surely these are of value.  If you have claims on somebody, that they will render services and goods to you when you want them, surely these are valuable.  If you have such claims on a person, are you going to fritter away those claims by using them for trifling purposes?  Or are you going to use those claims in order to build up your economy so that it <Col N="1901" /> may be so productive as to give your people a higher standard of living?</P>
    <P>For goodness' sake, can we get an end to this nonsense of saying those assets are of no value?  It is true they are external.  It is true the value of the British £ can be changed, but there is no way, unless you bring them in and waste them, in which you can deal with that situation&mdash;no way that I know of, anyhow.  They are claims in terms of pounds, on Britain mainly, and those claims can be realised only, as I have said already, by giving us the goods and services.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too much time on this.  We have spoken about it already.  I have mentioned this matter because I wish, in the national interest, that at this stage we would have members of the Government facing the realities and trying to get our people to face them also.  Not every person in the country whose support is required for this effort knows things as the Government ought to know them; they think only of accounts as if you had them in a bank, you draw on them and that is all about it, and you can change your accounts, and so on.  You cannot do that with external assets.  If the Government sells them, they go to the commercial banks; if a private individual sells his interests over there, they also make their appearance in some other form as an external asset.  The only way in which they can be realised is by bringing them in, in goods and services. That ought to make the people realise their value.</P>
    <P>I really wished to point out this evening that this Vote is one on which the Opposition has an opportunity of criticising the Government in all its Departments and of showing its dissatisfaction with the conduct of affairs. We have done what no political Party has done yet in this House until we came here.  On two or three separate occasions since the present Government came into office we here have deliberately supported the Governeven though we could have made a great deal of political capital against them if we had been looking for popularity on that basis.  We supported them at a time when there was <Col N="1902" /> a question of force being used&mdash;improperly, as we thought, or unwisely, as we thought&mdash;and the result of our support has been that the threat that was there has largely been eliminated. We supported the Government when they brought in this first set of levies and again we have supported them on the basis that we felt the national interest was so important and the matter so important that it would be wrong for us to do otherwise much as we are anxious to get that Government out.  Yes, we were asked a few minutes ago whether we were willing to take office.  We took office before and we saw the nation through crises before&mdash; and if the responsibility is given to us, we are willing to do it again.  As far as that is concerned, let there be no doubt about it.  Let there be no doubt about that issue.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether your term will be long or short.  I have had sufficient experience of it myself to know that it is not a bed of roses to be in the Government.  However, many in this House came into public life for national purposes, not because they were keen on politics.  They came in for national purposes to do certain work which they thought was in the interest of this nation&mdash;and they are still here in this House in that same spirit.</P>
    <P>When the first Coalition was formed I expressed a fear.  Perhaps the terms in which I expressed it might have been somewhat too strong, but I thought that it would be a disaster for this country to see that type of Government formed.  I hope that there will be nobody here in this country in the future who will be able to look back and say that I was right.  There was a member of Fine Gael, God rest him, who, before he died, seemed to feel the same as I felt about it.</P>
    <P>I believe that a good deal of our present misfortune is directly due to the attitude that was taken up by members of the different Parties in the Government some years ago.  As I said last night, they preached a demoralising doctrine to our people. They made the people think that savings were of no use, that thrift was foolishness, that external assets had <Col N="1903" /> better be dissipated any way at all. &ldquo;To eat, drink and be merry,&rdquo; was the philosophy of life.  They taught a philosophy of Hedonism when, of all things, our people should have been taught, in those days in which, having emerged from a long period of trouble of one kind or another, we were getting into the clear, that the essential thing for our people was to be energetic, to be industrious, to be thrifty. The doctrines they taught were quite the opposite and they got into power, in my opinion, by false pretences and it was false pretences that was the very beginning of original sin.  It was false pretences that tempted poor Mother Eve at the start.</P>

      <P>We are throwing our weight in because that is the way in which we believe co-operation can best be given in national work through this House.  People have been talking about unity.  The required unity is in this House if every Deputy in it, whatever side he belongs to, feels that he has a responsibility to work for the nation.  We are fulfilling our duty.  We do not agree with the Government. There is a situation and there are certain proposals for dealing with it.  I do not know whether these would be the proposals but I do know that unless imports were restricted we would again have a deficit in the balance of payments and another £36,000,000 or so, perhaps more, of our external assets dissipated.  The consequences of that <Col N="1904" /> I know also.  If I wanted to talk from these benches as the Taoiseach spoke in 1952 or as many of the Ministers about him spoke, about the hardships and so on, I might express doubts as to their effectiveness, as to the ultimate results of these measures but I am not doing that; our members are not doing that, because we believe that the matter is much too serious to be dealt with in that way by any responsible member of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture to-day was talking about our ullagoning.  It is not we who are doing any ullagoning. We have seen the picture.  We know it.  We believe that this nation, properly led, as I said last night, can get out of this situation and as far as we can co-operate in getting the nation out of this situation, we mean to do it.  It can be done.  I do believe that we have found ground before we have reached the bottom.  I do believe that we have learned a very important lesson.</P>
      <P>I would have liked to have seen members of the Labour Party participating in this debate because they have their part to play in this important matter and I do not think it should be left to a sort of plaudit by them to the Minister for Finance when he had finished his statement.  We ought to hear, before this debate ends, how far the Labour Party and its members will co-operate in this effort or will they go out and use it for political purposes and point to the people who may have to suffer, indeed, who will have to suffer, as a result of these measures, that these are done by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be frank here with the people of the country.  This situation does demand the active co-operation of all public representatives.  Will we get it? Will we have, as I pointed out last night, a hand grabbing for the brake and a foot stamping on the accelerator?  Which will it be?  Let the members of the Labour Party come along and take their share.  They are members of the Government.  Do they want to have it both ways?  Do they want to throw the blame for all this on some conservative members of Fine Gael or, as they would put it, on <Col N="1905" /> some conservative members of Fianna Fáil?</P>
    <P>I hope that we will get the national effort that is necessary and that we will have the people here speaking in one voice to the people of our country and telling them that we have of necessity to live within our means, that if we want to have progress in the future, we must save.  In other words, we must produce more than we consume and the more we want to consume and the more we want to save the more we will have to produce.  It ought to be the business of the administrative authority here to try to devise ways and means so that this extra production will be secured.</P>
    <P>We have had some talk from members of this House on the need for a long-term plan and the need for agreement and now we have another Deputy, who was not so very long ago associated with the same group, the same person talking about differences being essential.  I think it is a great thing for the country that we should have got agreement upon certain fundamental things.  Thanks be to God, we have got agreement upon our fundamental law.  And with that as a basis, we have a firm foundation for our political life.</P>
    <P>On account of the challenge that we have had no policy, that no Party has had a policy, I think I should review the situation to show that as far as we are concerned we have had a policy from the beginning.  That policy had three or four primary aims.  The first was to secure the unity and independence of our country.  We have worked for that day in and day out.  We did not say it was going to be done in three weeks, or in three months, or in six months.  We knew how difficult the task was, but we did have a determination to use every opportunity to secure that fundamental aim.</P>
    <P>I could, of course, devote all the time that would be reasonable here talking about this problem of the partition of our country, pointing out that no matter what basis we take it on&mdash;the will of the governed or any other basis&mdash;there is no basis in justice for the present partition of our country. <Col N="1906" /> To know that and to believe that just men would hold with you in that is not of itself going to give any solution, and, if we rule out a solution by force, the only solution, a solution which has been accepted and is common to the members of the Government and to our own side of the House, one which I believe now is generally accepted in the greater part of the country, is that we have to try to bring about the unity of our country by trying as best we can to get people of just minds to see it as it is, the wrongness of it, and to try to get our fellow countrymen who differ from us to long, as we long, to be working together with us in the interests of the nation which many of them are proud to call, and call with us, their nation. Many of them are proud to say that they are Irishmen and they do that best when they are in company with people of other nations.  We want them to do it at home with us, to say that they are brother Irishmen with us, and that they are going to work with us for the exaltation of this grand old land which we hold in common.</P>
    <P>We have a common aim then in that matter and we have, in so far as the present conditions are concerned, a common policy and we mean to proceed&mdash;if we were in office, we would proceed on that line&mdash;and we hope and expect that the present Government will proceed in the same way.  That was one of our problems and one of our aims.</P>
    <P>The next aim we had was to try to secure the restoration of our language. Now, it is not sufficient to give lip service to that aim.  There is nothing so demoralising in a people as to be giving lip-service to an aim which they are not taking any effective steps to implement.  Is it true to say that effective steps are not being taken towards the restoration of the language?  I do not say that is true at all.  I believe that over the years, notwithstanding criticism from outside, steps have been taken which make it very much easier for those who are living in the country to-day to know the language to-day, to acquire a spoken knowledge of it, than existed years ago.  I withheld criticism <Col N="1907" /> which I could very easily have made as to the slowness of the Government that came into office talking about what they were going to do for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>A Ministry was to be set up.  I have, over the years, given a great deal of attention to the problem.  I know its difficulties and I know that nothing is easier than to set up an organisation or to set up machinery.  It is the getting of effective work from the machinery that matters.  After a couple of years of waiting, we have got it set up and we hope, now it has been set up, that it will get to work rapidly and that we will not have another two years spent in some other organising of machinery.</P>
    <P>There was a period here when I thought the responsibility was going to be that of the Minister for Local Government.  We were led to understand so.  On one or two occasions, I tried to find out whose the responsibility was, but now we have the responsibility fixed.  I know the responsibility that will be given to the Minister for Education in the holding of the two posts and I feel that any one of these posts is sufficient to occupy the full-time energies of any individual.</P>

      <P>As long as it is a decent interruption, I do not mind.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his final remarks, quoted the Holy Father to us and one of the things he laid stress on was the failure of certain people to see what was done and only to point to what was not done.  There was a whole campaign here against Fianna Fáil by some of the gentlemen who have spoken recently in this debate and it was all founded on the basis of going down and picking out a couple of houses, dilapidated houses, in which some people were still living, photographing these houses and taking the photographs throughout the country, showing them in cinemas and saying: &ldquo;This is Fianna Fáil for you.&rdquo;  They did precisely the thing that the Taoiseach quoted the Holy Father as speaking against.</P>
      <P>Nothing is easier than to point to what is not done.  If you want to see whether progress has or has not been made, you have to point to the things that have been done as well as to the things that have not been done.  It is to the things that need to be done at any particular time you should address yourself.  I am all at one with the Taoiseach in that, but let the Taoiseach not be telling us we are temporising in that matter.  For a full time Minister, going at it with all his endeavours, it is a difficult problem, a very difficult problem, and even after a time at it, he might not be able to show very extraordinary results.  But at least let us have an assurance that the effort will be made and made energetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it was not to criticise the Government on that that I started.  I started to try to indicate that there were definite aims and a definite programme. Again, let us say that as far as both sides of the House are concerned, <Col N="1909" /> we are genuinely not giving lip-service to it but are genuinely desirous to restore the language and that we will do that by trying to take practical measures towards that end.  It is a very difficult thing to get the people who are very fluent in a language which is able to supply their needs generally to use another language. Anybody who has learned another language knows that.  Therefore, it will be difficult to get our people, even those who have learned it at school, to speak the language. They will never learn to do it, unless we have a definite policy of insisting on spoken Irish and the teaching of it. They will never do it unless we have a definite policy of insisting on the spoken Irish in the teaching of it.</P>
    <P>I tried when I was Taoiseach to get our Department to set itself to bring in oral examinations in the secondary school.  Again, I know the difficulties. I was a teacher in a secondary school. I have a fair idea of the difficulties that are involved.  However, if we are serious about restoring the language as the spoken language we must have it as a basis of the teaching in the elementary schools and we must also have it in the secondary schools.  If we do not, we are again doing something like what I said in connection with the measures towards righting our economy: we will be accelerating and at the same time putting on the brake. If we are serious, we must not do things of that sort.</P>
    <P>We had that as an object.  The other members of the House, I would say, have it as an object.  Let us all earnestly try to reach our objective. Every day that it is deferred means increasing the difficulty.  Let us be serious then about these objectives.  I believe we are.  I know the distractions of government, the thousand and one things that members of the Government are pressed with from day to day.  I know how hard it is to get after these things.  That is the value of having some one person, if you are going to make it a Ministry, devoted to that job.</P>
    <P>There are two main difficulties. There is the difficulty of co-ordinating <Col N="1910" /> it with education because undoubtedly the language side has two main aspects &mdash;(i) the preservation of the language in the Gaeltacht and (ii) pressure in the schools and educational establishments. One belongs ordinarily to the Minister for Education and therefore I can see the natural desire which exists to try and co-ordinate them at some level.  Let us have some one person who will be responsible to this House for that work.</P>
    <P>It it well worth while explaining the next objective to the people of the country so that we will not have members of this House going out and pretending that each of the Parties in this House is just fooling about, chasing our tail like a dog without having any idea of where we are going or what we are doing.  We had as the next main objective to try to provide in this land of ours a livelihood for as large a population as it was possible for it to contain in reasonable comfort.  That was and is the aim.  The means of achieving it are different matters.  Back in 1917, emigration was one of the topics that I had to speak about at that particular period.  I pointed out then as can be pointed out to-day that of all the civilised peoples of Europe we were the only nation that was losing its population, the only nation where not merely was the natural increase being lost but more to the good.  I was talking then in relation to 80 years ago and I pointed out that we had reduced in population to half of what it was then.  To remedy that situation, once we had achieved the political freedom which it was necessary to have in order to be able to adopt policies, the main thing was to get after that matter.</P>
    <P>How did we do it?  The most obvious way of trying to deal with the deflation of population of that kind was to try to build up our industries here.  We set out to do it.  Unfortunately, the other trend, the trend from the land to industrial centres, more than counterbalanced the advantage that was gained by building up our industries. However, do not forget that if these industries had not been built up the trend would have been there none the less and that at least we have salvaged <Col N="1911" /> that number by that policy.  Before the last war began there was increasing hope because we were getting bit by bit our people to be enterprising, to build up industries, and so on, and we were, bit by bit, cutting in on this problem of emigration.  Then the war came and the inducements across the water were too great and the trend of emigration began again.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what basis the Taoiseach said&mdash;I forget the precise words used either by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance; I think it was the Taoiseach said it because it was on the question of emigration&mdash; that it is vain to think that this country, with our limited resources, can achieve the material comfort that is achieved outside, that we could not hope to have here conditions from the material point of view which would be sufficient to retain our people.  I should like to know on what basis the Taoiseach was thinking.  I know he set off the spiritual as against the material advantages and, on that, I am all with him but I am not so sure that we need go altogether to the purely spiritual advantages.  After all, the standards of life, if there is any sense in them at all, depend upon living conditions. Is the Taoiseach going to tell us that the living conditions we knew of in some of the industrial centres in England&mdash;and some later information that came to me suggests they are still very bad&mdash;are much better than the conditions which a number of people left in this country?  I do not think they are.</P>
    <P>I should like also to say, because it is well that our people should realise it, that you cannot estimate the value of the life you will get in these places simply by the money return you will get.  You have to take the two sides of your account.  If you take the extra costs from the extra remuneration, I wonder very much whether in real terms, when you come down to it, the number of people who have emigrated would not find they were better off materially at home.  I should like to give it consideration but I know that if you take and compare the national incomes <Col N="1912" /> or something of that sort they would not give you anything like a true picture.  In the case of Britain you will have in the national income the lords of manors, industrial magnates, and so on.  You would have to take a cross section of the community if you were to get anything realistic before you would get anything like a decent picture of the situation.</P>
    <P>However, we have gone a certain distance in the building up of our industries.  I hope that one of the things that will be done by the Government under present conditions is to use levies as if they were protective measures, and, under the cover of them, try and shelter nascent industries here.  Again, there is the question of machinery and certain raw materials but, in some cases, these levies can be used as protective measures to enable expansion to take place in our home industries in so far as competitive foreign goods are concerned.  I think that in this connection we should be very careful.</P>
    <P>I do not like a system of licences and I know that in conditions like the present it would be extremely difficult to work it, but much as I am anxious about external assets, if I saw the proportion remaining was being used for capital or productive purposes I would make an exception.  It is quite different from goods for immediate consumption.  However, there may be angles to that I do not see at the moment but I do think we have a great deal further to go.  If anybody talks to me on that I will admit the cream has been skimmed off.  We have included the most immediate things that can be considered but if we examine the import lists carefully, we will find that there are still a number of things that can be produced at home on reasonably economic terms and we ought to get after these.</P>
    <P>There are members of the Government who sneered long ago when we spoke of this policy of the building up of our industries and the general policy of self-support and self-reliance.  We were sneered at and we were told: &ldquo;Yes, Fianna Fáil want to grow oranges and tea.&rdquo;  Of course, we never <Col N="1913" /> wanted to do anything of the kind but we did say that we should try, on account of its general value to the country, building up our industries even though, with world competition and possible dumping from outside, and so on, they might not be able to be absolutely on competitive terms.  I had hoped the Government would continue along that line.</P>
    <P>Again, as far as the building of our industries is concerned, agreement has been reached at last and before we have got to the bottom, we have got common ground there that it is desirable for the wellbeing of the people of this country to build up our industries so as to be self-supporting and so that, by doing that, we will be less dependent on external assets, that we will have produced at home things we will export in order to buy other commodities. We have had agreement on that but it has not solved the problem.</P>
    <P>The present Government, when they were in opposition, were constantly attacking us about this question of emigration.  There was no use in pointing out that certain improvements were being effected and that certain progress was being made.  It used to be said from this side of the House, when the Government members were over here, that there was emigration which was only equivalent to that of 1847.  The curious thing about it is that when the figures came to be known and when the present Government came into office, the figures showed that emigration had increased. It was some 10,000 I think in 1947. They came into office in 1948; it crept up to 28,000, then to 34,000 and, on the last basis on which the Central Statistics Office could rely, it had gone up to 41,000, and it was during our term of office, we are told, that emigration reached its present appalling dimensions&mdash;because they are appalling.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that one of the most serious problems from the point of view of this country is to try to get some method by which we can stem that flowing out of our lifeblood. The young, the active, the energetic, the enterprising are being lured away from us.  The support and education of these up to that stage is on the community. <Col N="1914" /> By this emigration we are being left with an altogether unbalanced population, with an old age group and a young age group altogether in disproportion to the active elements of the community.</P>
    <P>If anybody can find any way other than those we have been suggesting to try to deal with that problem, we will hail them as we would have hailed in the past anybody who had an effective solution, for instance, to Partition. Again, we can only get at that by working along the lines that seem to promise success.  We tried to build up industries and to have decent homes for our country.  The Minister for Agriculture and myself do not agree very often but one of the things on which I do agree with him is that the money that was spent, so long as it was within our means in providing decent homes for this country, was money well spent.  If we want our people to live decent lives, if we want to have a decent society here, the basis of it is the home, the house in which the family dwells.  In providing that, we are not merely providing the basis for a good social system but we are also providing one of the ways in which we can help to stem, to some extent anyway, emigration.</P>
    <P>We tried to put some stop to the movement from the land towards the cities by improving the countryside, by providing greater amenities for our people.  Rural electrification was started with that idea mainly in mind of trying to give to the people of the countryside some of the amenities which the people in the cities enjoyed.</P>
    <P>We would like to see running water in the homes as well as electric light. We would like to see proper sanitation in the countryside and, as a social measure and as a health measure, that is one of the things to which any Government that had the welfare of the people and a decent standard of life for them in mind, would devote themselves.  We had been doing it and we would have continued to do it if we were in office.  I have not the figures to know to what extent it has been continued by the present Government but, in any case, I do not think any <Col N="1915" /> member of the Government would deny, no matter how conservative he was, that money spent in that way&mdash; again if we could afford it&mdash;would be well spent.  We must, however, at every step ask ourselves what we can afford.</P>
    <P>It is not for want of a plan that that work is not being done and we do not want a three-year plan, a five-year, a ten-year or a 20-year plan if we have the determination to use every possible opportunity to proceed along those lines.  We did have that plan and we did have that drive towards it but, as I have said many times during this speech, we had to take account of our means and to take care that we should not, by overstepping ourselves in a direction like that, prevent ourselves from using such resources as we had for productive purposes which would ultimately be able to support all these enterprises.  We had a plan and I believe the present Government, even though they did not write it on paper, have that plan too.</P>
    <P>We did have a plan in regard to the settlement of the land.  The Constitution, in some of its directive articles and in some of its mandatory articles, indicates what our social policy should be&mdash;the policy that is now implicitly being accepted, since the Constitution is accepted, by any Government that comes into office.</P>
    <P>We set out to try to plant upon the land of this country as many families as could, so to speak, fit.  You cannot go round as has been suggested, and cut up every piece of land into 40 acre portions and suggest that everybody should have one of these portions. Some of the larger farms give more employment, support more families than if they were divided up.  Some are badly used and the Government have power in such cases, if that serves the best interests of the community, to step in and divide such farms.  As I said, you cannot just go in and divide every piece of land into 40 acres or so, You have got to be systematic.</P>
    <P>If the Land Commission and the Ministry for Lands do their duty and <Col N="1916" /> try to cater for the economic needs of farming generally, they can in that way try to meet the point that has been made that more people should be settled upon the land.  Unfortunately time and circumstances are again working more or less against us.  I was one of those who had the idea that we could get a large number of small farms&mdash;smaller than the amount that ultimately would prove to be serviceable&mdash;and do intensive work upon them as is done in other countries with teeming populations.  However, the whole of the modern trend has been against that, and it is extremely difficult to combine small farming with economic farming.  Again, nobody is able to devise a method by which small farming could be effectively joined up with proper economy&mdash;a competitive economy in those difficult times.  We have to depend upon agriculture to buy us the things that are required in the industrial line.</P>
    <P>We must depend upon agriculture to provide us with the exports which will enable us to provide for the necessary imports.  If we are to succeed in this nation we must get out and fight economically; we must work hard economically, work intelligently economically, in industry as well as on the land.  If we are going to survive in this competitive world, we must go energetically and fight in it.  If we take the passive stand and shrug our shoulders and say: &ldquo;Do not mind&rdquo;, we will get nowhere.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for us to think that our people are not able to hold their own in the battle of life just as well as other people.  I used to hear members of the present Government, particularly the Attorney-General, say we could never get anywhere.  We can never have anything until we begin. We had to begin, and if we are to survive in this world of competition and conflict we must gird ourselves for that fight.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to the point of fundamental education.  I have often wondered, when people had to face, in the defence of our country, hand to hand fighting, what preparation they had made, how the young people had <Col N="1917" /> to be nerved, how they had to be trained and exercised so that they might be able to survive in such conflicts. That was not done by softening the young people.  I am afraid that the moral fibre of our whole nation is being destroyed by wrong ideas about education.</P>
    <P>One wants to make the child's life as happy as possible, but happiness does not consist in not doing anything. Happiness for the adult and the child is when the child is occupied in a way in which it is interested.  I have seen some examples of it in some of the schools.  We are weakening the moral fibre of the whole nation by the way in which young children are being taught, being dealt with rather than taught, in the schools.  I am not, I hope, hard in nature.  I have some experience of children.  I know what they are like and I know they can acquire very bad habits by being allowed to loll and just not to have anything in the nature of real work.</P>
    <P>The grit and the good habits necessary for the young, in order that they may be able to fight for their place in a competitive world, are not being put into them.  Instead, they are being softened and dealt with in a way which is bound to have disastrous consequences in later life.  Unfortunately, some of our young people do not know what is is to have control of themselves, to learn to have control of their wills and deny themselves some of the things they might want immediately. The gospel of work is essential.  I have lived through a generation in which we had to work and we are still just as energetic, most of us, to go through it as the people who did not have to do it.  I do not think it was then the question merely of survival of some, while others fell by the way.  Reasonable competition is a thing people have got to become accustomed to at an early age; they must become accustomed to habits that will enable them to hold their own in such competition. We used to hear people talking about the interest that was taken in the results of examinations and that there were people who strived to do things. If we want this nation to survive we will have to begin at the beginning and the beginning is the school.  That is <Col N="1918" /> only by way of a side issue, aside from my main purpose.</P>
    <P>The main purpose now is to try to show that there was here a definite plan, a definite purpose, a thing through which when every day decisions had to be taken, you asked yourself was that decision leading in the right direction or not.  We did not put it with so many acres of a target, or a target in this direction or that.  Every day it was there and I hope&mdash;and I believe the members of the Government are intelligent people; whatever I say about them, they have a certain amount of intelligence anyway&mdash;that they are intelligent enough to have a target in front of them every day and that they know exactly what is to be done and should know where they are going.  I hope, anyway, that during our term of office that was the case. It certainly was the case on the part of the Ministers who had to deal with the economic side of affairs and the Ministers who had to deal with the cultural side.  They had this definitely before them.</P>
    <P>We have then an answer to those who say there was no plan and that it would be good to get some common plans that would not be changed with changing Governments.  These fundamental plans and purposes were there. It is true that the plans may have had to be modified from time to time as certain obstacles may have appeared on the scene and had to be overcome, or avoided and so on, but there was the fundamental purpose and the fundamental plan.  We built the houses and we helped to induce the development of rural electrification and we had a definite purpose of making country life more attractive.  We also had the idea, and we went a certain distance with it before the war, of trying to have parish halls established.  These were intended to do what was suggested by some speaker here to-day, provide the social intercourse which is a natural prelude to marriage.  We tried to do that and we hope that that idea is being continued.  It would be better, of course, if the local communities themselves set out to provide these things directly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> A short while ago I was in Inchicore and we heard that when the workers learnt that a chapel was required there they provided it themselves in less than a week.  That sort of co-operative effort on the part of the local people to provide local amenities will save the State from having, all the time, to look after and act in a paternalistic fashion towards every group in the community.  The people can do a tremendous amount to help themselves but we are prepared to assist in that way in making conditions in the rural areas more attractive.</P>
    <P>We have, as I have said, to make up our minds that we are going to enter into the competitive spheres and test ourselves out particularly against people of other countries.  Holland had a big colonial empire at one period and it had advantages that we have not got but it, a small country, built up a great air service.  We set out to build an air service too.  We knew it would bring us into competition with other people but we must do it if we are to get employment for our people that they will otherwise seek elsewhere. We will have to enter into these competitive spheres.  We set up a shipping industry.  We said that if other small nations can maintain a proper mercantile marine, such as the Norwegians and the Greeks, why should not we do so?  We felt it would be of advantage to us in times of crisis, and we started out to do that.</P>
    <P>I had a hope many years ago&mdash;and I am afraid my hopes die very hard&mdash;to see a flourishing fishing industry in this country.  When we came into office first, I had a hope that, with the sea around us, we would be able to do what the Norwegians and others had been able to do&mdash;that we would be able to go over the Seven Seas, if necessary, enter into competition and find that valuable food which human beings want and which, as the earth gets more and more populated, becomes more and more valuable.  I admit that our efforts have not succeeded so far but I have not despaired yet that we will be able to get that industry and be able to hold our own against other people in it.  If not, we might as well <Col N="1920" /> give up.  If we are not able to face competition there is no hope for us, but I do believe that we will be able to do it.  Our people have got to the top in other countries and you will find them in every country to which they have gone.  They have got the brains and if there is the proper incentive they have the ability and the stamina to get results.</P>
    <P>We have not got the vast territory of the United States, with its very great variety.  It is about 100 times the size of this country and we have not got all of its possibilities but we have the fundamental things necessary for a decent human existence.  I wish we could get our people&mdash;but I am afraid there is a bit of a dream about this, for the present&mdash;to set out to have a way of life of their own and to set their own values on the things of life.  It would be following along the line which other people have gone.  Some of the great nations of the world have grown up, grown prosperous and then disappeared because stronger people, hardier people who have had to face a harder initial experience have beaten them in the contest.</P>
    <P>If we have the right fibre to get us to face the competition necessary when we do go into the international field, and if we have the wisdom in our own land to have our own way of life, we can, in this country, have as happy an existence as they have in any other country.  But we will want to have a few preachers about to preach against this doctrine of Hedonism which is the only doctrine abroad with us to-day. Life does not consist merely in pleasures of the type that are common; one can have a very happy existence in modest circumstances if there is something of the intellectual in that life.</P>
    <P>I often think of the books which we had in school; a lot of the stuff in some of them was perhaps a little bit too difficult for children and certainly they had national ideals quite different from ours.  But they taught us to have regard for certain fundamental things. One of the earliest things we learned was that life was real and life was earnest and that the grave was not the goal.  If we have these things in mind, <Col N="1921" /> we have here the essentials for a decent existence.  We can provide the food, the clothing and the shelter which are the fundamental things for any existence. We have the means to provide them at home.  I know how people will go over to the sort of existence they have in other countries, and that it is very hard to get them to value what they have.  Unfortunately, that is human.  We set little value on the gifts and goods we possess.  The things we have not are the things we always desire.  The hills far off appear green to us.  We always&mdash;I suppose it is part of human nature&mdash;strive to get happiness in the far off.  We can, if we have the right outlook on life, get happiness here at home; but we must provide the certain economic foundation for that happiness.</P>
    <P>I believe that we in Fianna Fáil and, I hope, the members of the present Government, do seek that happiness and see that that can be done.  The Taoiseach has rightly stressed this problem of emigration.  Whether he brought it in as a red herring to divert us from criticism of the Government or not, does not matter to me.  It is an important national question, and I am glad to think that we are at one in this House and that we do not need any artificial regimentation into coalitions or anything of that sort in order that we should agree upon it.  I think I have kept the House, perhaps, too long already but I do want to assure some of those who think that we were working about in a haphazard manner when we were in office, and suggesting also that the present Government are doing the same, that only stupid people would behave in that manner, that there were objectives, that ways were thought out to secure them and that, so far as we have not secured them, these will be the targets and the aims for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The one permanent hope for the future lies, as has been stressed so often&mdash;indeed there is danger of the word being used simply in a parrot-like fashion and regarded as having no meaning&mdash;in increased production; and the immediate place to get that increased production and the immediate place to get results is on the land.  I know you will not get it overnight, <Col N="1922" /> but you can very quickly step up the volume of production from our land.  It is quite true to say that, with the competition of chilled meat from the Argentine the same competition made things pretty difficult back in 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try not to take up much more of the time of the House.  I would not have entered into that long talk at all were it not for the suggestions that there was no planning, no proper thought as to the problem or the lines we should take in order to try and get a solution of the problem.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the immediate thing to concentrate upon&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;concentrate&rdquo; I do not mean to say we should neglect the other things&mdash; was that we should give enegetic attention to getting more from our land. The Minister for Agriculture seemed to be satisfied to-day.  I do not think that anybody else is.  We cannot be satisfied with the condition of our agriculture to-day.  I am not saying that our farmers are idle or that they are de serving of attack or reproach in any way; but we do want to get a combined effort from the farmers to get more out of our land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the foundation of that is the right amount of tillage and the right treatment of pasture, and that both of these, under present conditions, mean that the soil has to get the nourishment which is required and the additional constituents which are necessary.  We are short of lime to the extent of 12,000,000 tons and the present output is not sufficient to meet the annual need.  We have arrears <Col N="1923" /> 12,000,000 tons to make up.  There is no production at the present moment that is facing towards that.  I will admit that there has been a gradual increase towards it, but we are very far from the amount that is necessary if we are to treat our land properly.</P>
    <P>We must get lime for the land.  We must have the right amount of cultivation because, unless there is, you will not get the best pasture.  We want to have the pasture treated properly. Thanks be to goodness, we have not to-day to meet the fallacy that the more tillage you had the fewer cattle you would have.  That is gone and we had not to meet the fallacy that you cannot grow good wheat in this country. We know now that we can, and the question is how much we can grow.  If we have a balance of payments position like the present, surely it is not going to be suggested that what, under ordinary circumstances, might be regarded as a fair target would be the target for that situation? Surely everything that can be done to do without foreign imports should be done?  The land is one of the places on which we can do it.  I was delighted to hear we were to have so much barley as was suggested.  That is splendid.  I hope we will have the pigs and so on to use it and the other animals to which it might properly be fed.</P>
    <P>Let us, then, concentrate on trying to get our farming right.  That brings me to the question to ask the Taoiseach what has happened to the Institute of Agriculture.  I thought we were being blamed for not going ahead with that some few years ago.  I thought there were some proposals put forward.  You will never get unanimity in this world on anything.  There will always be people who, for one reason or another, will have objections to something.  We have to work in the general national interest, in the interest of the greatest number and, so far as we can see it, in the interest of the common good.  I would like to know whether the criticisms and so on have put the Government off this project altogether; or are the present circumstances such that you cannot have it?  I do not <Col N="1924" /> think it cuts across the present position in the slightest.  I think quite the contrary.  To provide the economic teaching and scientific knowledge which is necessary for the improvement of our agriculture is one of the fundamental things that should be set going.  Before the Dáil adjourns, I would like to hear from the Taoiseach what is happening that project.  Is it dead?  Is it in Limbo?</P>
    <P>Next to that, there is the question of trying to make a sound proposition of our fisheries.  Is it beyond the possibilities of our people to get over the difficulties in this matter?  We are an island nation and we surely ought to be able to face the sea in modern conditions as well as other people.  Our men have done it in the past when facing the sea was a much different thing from what it is to-day.  Is it too much to hope that there will be a concentrated effort towards improving the fisheries and doing that in a way which will enable us to stand up against competition, because we will have to do that if we are going to expand? We will have to face up to the fact that we must meet any competition that comes.  Is it impossible therefore for us to build up this industry which has such an export potentiality?</P>
    <P>I appeal to Labour to help us in our efforts.  In modern times, a trade union movement occupies in every society in which it exists a predominant position.  It has responsibilities placed on it now which it did not have in the past.  If there is to be a strike in the bakery trade, for instance, who will suffer most?  Surely it is the other sections of the community, and other members of trade unions are within that community who are going to suffer for the want of bread.  Is it not necessary, therefore, that there should be some co-ordination at the top and that the various elements of the trade union movement should be got to a realisation that they have a most important part to play in the welfare of the community as a whole and of course trade unions themselves are included in the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the representatives of the Labour Party speaking in <Col N="1925" /> this debate because they are of fundamental importance in the future welfare of our country.  I have been put down by the Labour people over recent years as an old conservative. There is no truth in that.  In the circumstances in which I was brought up, I was much nearer to Labour and the needs of Labour and the life of the labouring people and the small farmers than I was to other classes of the community.  I have never lost that realisation of the needs of Labour and the small farmers and I have always worked to try to help the working classes and the small farmers in the struggle between the various classes.  I think that the working community are entitled to their fair share, but I ask them not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, but to co-operate in trying to get done here the things that will enable us to have the higher standard of living which they naturally desire for their members and for the other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We cannot achieve that, unless we can enter into competition with outside countries and we cannot enter into that competition if we are to be priced out of it.  We have to produce here on terms which will enable us to compete with outsiders.  Surely the intelligent people in the Labour movement realise that and they ought to throw their weight in behind the national effort to get these things done.  I do believe that the Labour sections of this community are as patriotic as any other section and that the small farmers are equally patriotic.</P>
    <P>As the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; has come to my mind, I do want to say that one of the things which is essential in the schools is that there should be instilled in the children a sense of patriotism. What we should get into the minds of the children is that they have a country and we should get that brought into the minds of every individual in this country.  We should get it into their minds that patriotism is a noble thing.  In pagan countries, it was considered a noble thing to die for one's country; surely it is a noble thing to work for and serve the country and the members of the community.  That <Col N="1926" /> is one of the things which in our schools, I hope, will be done&mdash;that young children, besides being taught proper behaviour, will be given a love of their country.  It is a christian and natural element of virtue, and, if we do not practise it, we are going to fail in the realisation of the aims of those who in the past struggled that this nation might survive as a nation.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to get our people to realise that this is a nation worth serving and that its survival is worth while, not only for our own people in the nation but for those of them who have gone from home.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House will do everything in our power to see that the present crisis is surmounted successfully and quickly.  We will do everything in our power to help whatever Government might be in office, and to do it ourselves if we get the responsibility, to try to see that emigration will be stemmed and unemployment lessened.  There was hope of achieving that in 1953 and it continued into 1954. I do not know what happened afterwards to change that trend, but we want this trend back and we will get it back if we are prepared to work for it. We promise from this side of the House and from everybody we can influence in the country to get full support in that matter and whatever hardships are necessary to get over the present crisis, I believe the people will be prepared to undertake them to see that the efforts that we are making will be for the advantage of our country.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach gives each and every member of the House an opportunity of examining the work of the Government over the past year. Now that we are reaching the stage when the curtain is about to come down on the political year and Deputies are going back to their ordinary avocations, we are doing so with a gloomy and dismal outlook.  In political life, particularly in a democracy, it is natural that there should be exploitation of any political difficulties <Col N="1927" /> which have arisen.  If we wanted to make speeches of that type in this House, this is an opportunity which presents itself for doing so.  I think that even we as an Opposition have learned from the behaviour of the people now in Government that exploitation of the situation such as the present position provides could be used for political advantage.  The Government finds itself in that position because of the manner in which they exploited the position when our Minister for Finance took steps to deal with a similar situation, in the past.</P>
      <P>I can never forget the days when we sat over on that side of the House, listening to the speeches made on this side of the House; I can never forget the days when the people were being told that they were being unnecessarily penalised, that restrictive measures were being unnecessarily imposed upon them and that we were actively implementing a policy under which we wanted them to eat less and live on lower standards than were necessary.  These tactics might be successful to-day if the people believed that those who were responsible for them then did not know the seriousness of what they were doing; but there was not a single member on this side of the House then who did not know as well as he does to-day, now that they are on that side of the House, that those measures were necessary in the interests of the nation in order to save us from the growing crisis which was looming up at the time.  For that very reason, their tactics must now be condemned as inexcusable, and they will be so condemned by the country on every possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister for Agriculture speaking to-day.  Having heard that speech to-day and remembering the speech he made here in 1952, one cannot fail to notice the contrast in expression as between the two occasions.  In 1952, he accused Fianna Fáil of being responsible for inducing a credit squeeze which was putting the people out of business.  There is no reference to dictation from the Central Bank or the Chancellor of the <Col N="1928" /> Exchequer to-day when stronger and sterner measures are being taken by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Referring to the action of Fianna Fáil in 1952, this is what he had to say at column 1730 of Volume 131 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us face the fact.  The policy of this Budget is clear and&mdash;to give the devil his due&mdash;has been proclaimed. It is this: our people are eating too much and living too well and the time has come to cut down their victuals, to reduce their consumption and to see that these commodities pass into the channel which the Central Bank and the Treasury think they should pass into, so that the Central Bank and the Treasury may use the proceeds for the accumulation of good respectable British consolidated stocks for the better protection of our currency and our Government funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was being as cynical as he possibly could on that occasion.  It is obvious from the trend of events since that he was perfectly well aware that he was taking advantage of a situation to create in the minds of the people the belief that what we were doing then was unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to this talk about cutting down on imports in order to correct the balance of payments position.  Let us see what Deputy Dillon had to say then in the same speech with regard to imports.  At column 1731 Deputy Dillon said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil policy is to cut down the victuals, reduce their consumption and export the proceeds and, as they grow poorer, to view with satisfaction a decline in imports. What more certain index is there of a falling standard of living than declining imports?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What more certain index is there of a falling standard of living than declining imports?  That was the philosophy of Deputy Dillon in 1952, Deputy Dillon who, as Minister for Agriculture, now expects Fianna Fáil to co-operate with him to-day in calling on the people to cut down imports so that the balance of payments position may be corrected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" />&ldquo;Can anyone point to any nation in the world that raised the people's standard of living contemporaneously with a decline in their international trade?  That is Fianna Fáil policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, our pointing out that unnecessary imports were coming in then was deemed by a leading member of the then Opposition, now holding ministerial office, as unnecessary and something which should not be done. One thing that will never be understood here, is that, as a result of the campaign against Fianna Fáil and the exploitation of the situation then, so many people went to the polls in the following election and actually supported Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary is always trying to get a story for the benefit of the Press for circulation to the public.  The story in the past used to be that the Fianna Fáil people were aspiring to be some day the Leader of the Party, that they were all fighting amongst themselves.  He knew perfectly well at the same time that there was no more united Party in the European Continent than Fianna Fáil.  To-day his story was that different leaders of the Opposition were making different speeches regarding policy.  What was his reason for concocting a story like that in his speech to-day?  Everybody knows that there is not a shred of fact in it.  The reason for making that statement was to counteract the principal accusation which could be laid against the principle of Coalition Government, whereby each Party goes out in an election time, speaks with its own separate, distinct and different voice, and when the election is over they come together and carry on any old policy or no policy as the case may be.  That is why he tries to make the allegation of that kind, to counteract what is, in fact, the greatest drawback which besets any Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> We had in the last general election the Labour Party expounding the most progressive policy, as one would expect the Labour Party to do.  They belched forth a volcano of progressive policy and promises, and no sooner were the votes counted and the Government formed than those promises of Labour, and the whole Labour policy, had trickled into and become solidified in the moulds of Fine Gael conservatism. If Deputy O'Leary wishes to do something worth while for the cause of the future of the Labour Party in this country he should take a more active part in showing to the people what effect Labour has, if any, on the course taken by the present Government. But while Deputy O'Leary comes to this House as the only representative of the Labour Party in this debate&mdash;and I give him credit for that&mdash;and comes in to give his usual interjections, one of the more solid members of his Party is out in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in Cork, telling the people we are living in an Alice in Wonderland atmosphere&mdash;that the Government of this country is living in an Alice in Wonderland atmosphere. It is a very true description from a leader of the Labour Party to-day, when the Labour members are conspicuous by their absence from the most important debate of the year.  I hope it is a good omen.  Perhaps they are beginning to see that the progressive Party in this House is now in opposition. Perhaps they realise that Fianna Fáil have been the progressive Party, that not merely have they worked for sectional interests but they have taken the interests of every section of the community in this country, of which our Party is representative, and for that reason the future hope of this country lies in the restoration to power of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, as our leader pointed out a few moments ago, we are not hankering after getting back into power for the sake of power, as was the case when the present Government saw an opportunity of exploiting the <Col N="1932" /> situation when we were in power before.  But we are prepared to take the full responsibility of Government if the country thinks so fit, and are prepared to continue to guide the destinies of this people as we have done so ably in the past.  In 1952 Fianna Fáil were depending in this House on a very slender margin majority in the most critical division, and sitting then on this side of the House were a number of bright young potential Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers. They saw before them opportunities and they realised that all they needed to do was to exploit the serious national crisis at the time, in order to find themselves in the position which they now enjoy.  The temptation was too great.  It was too much to expect that the Leader of the Opposition then would get up and say: &ldquo;We realise that there is a serious national crisis, and are prepared to support the Government in any measures which they take to overcome that crisis.&rdquo;  Instead of that Deputy Costello, as he then was, the Leader of the Opposition, stood up and said that he would resign his seat if he were Taoiseach before he would give effect to a single provision of the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>Those are the people who ask Fianna Fáil to co-operate with them to-day and to give them their support in putting through a policy designed to retrieve the country now from the crisis into which it is plunged.  We are not going to exploit that position.  We realise that one day not far distant we, too, will have the responsibility of again guiding the destinies of this country, and we hope that then this Opposition will not repeat the venture, which has now acted as a boomerang on them, of exploiting any situation in which we may find ourselves as a result of their present policy.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking in this House from this same seat a few days after the present Government was formed, and if Deputies turn over the Official Reports they will see that I said that we on this side of the House welcomed the change of Government, because we knew that there was no more definite way of confounding the lies of <Col N="1933" /> the Opposition which we had than by putting them on that side of the House for a few years.</P>

The present ex-Taoiseach is there now, and when we were asking him from the Labour Party to do things for the people he went to the Park in the middle of the night, dissolved the Dáil and said that he could not get on with the Labour Party.

Does Deputy de Valera forget that?  He had the workers of this country in such a position that they could not stir.  Unless they were industrial workers, they could not go to Britain, although they were unemployed. Those are the things I want to remind the House of.  We know what we had to do so far as the unemployed man in the country was concerned during the emergency. Deputy de Valera said that 45/- a week was enough for the working man.

      <P>It is not the first time that Deputy de Valera denied what he said.  Did he not say he would break stones if there was a Coalition?  He had a Coalition, with four Independents, and held office here at the time. We in the Labour Party do not forget the tactics Fianna Fáil used against the workers of this country.  We hear all about unity from the President. How can you have unity when the appeal comes from a man who is a politician?  I do not think we are in a crisis.  I have heard that preached since I came here.  The cry of Deputy de Valera was that the country was in the wood and that the people were not out of the wood yet.  That was his whole cry.  From the public platform, he exhorted the people not to change horses crossing the river.  I do not think there is any need for this alarm and I do not see any harm in putting the levies on these luxury goods coming from the other side.  I saw it stated in the papers to-day that at the Port of Dublin these levies did not cause any upheaval.  The Opposition are talking nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few days ago, they were crying out for the Government to take action and stop the imports.  Now they are not satisfied when the Government is taking action to prevent the importation of luxury goods which are not <Col N="1936" /> needed.  What is wrong is that the price of cattle came down from £10 10s. a cwt. to what it is to-day.  Had that price remained, there would be no confusion in regard to the position of the balance of payments.  We would have been able to deal with it.  That is the real position.  If we had not cattle for the British market, what would we have to export?  A few years ago, the cry was: &ldquo;Thank God, the British market is gone and gone forever.&rdquo;  What is the cry to-day?</P>
    <P>We know what is taking place in the rural parts.  We know that farming is becoming mechanised and that the horse is being replaced by the tractor and the man on the land by machinery. No one who is living in the rural areas can deny that.  The same thing applies in regard to the councils who are spending the ratepayers' money importing machinery to do away with the labouring man on the roads and in the councils.</P>

There is no difference when it comes to the question of an increase in wages.  They vote as a solid bloc against the Labour men in the councils.  I think the whole issue is confused.  If Deputy de Valera has confidence in the people, he should not tell the country we are broke and unable to meet our commitments.  It is not good national policy to tell the people in the Six Counties that we are down and out and cannot meet our commitments.  I think that is not good national policy and it is time that sort of thing stopped if we want to solve Partition.  I do not think that the language to-day is going to save the situation in relation to the balance of payments.</P>

      <P>I do not think that our <Col N="1937" /> young boys and girls from the Gaeltacht who are glad to be working in Britain are worrying about the Irish language because they had to leave the country after all the years of self-government. We hear a lot about emigration.  In 1932 I heard a Deputy speak in the town of Enniscorthy who was a Minister for a long time.  He said he would put the shovel into every man's door and the man who would not work he would put in prison.  Deputy Dr. Ryan made that statement in 1932. All Fianna Fáil can do is go back to quotations and look up the Official Debates to find out what this fellow and that fellow said in days gone by. What the ordinary people in the country want to-day is to lower the cost of living and provide employment, if that can be done.  We are not the Government; we are only part of the Government; but we are satisfied with the progress we have made in the Government.</P>

If the case is as bad as Deputy de Valera says it is, he ought to come over, and shake hands with Deputy Costello and never mind backsliding and pretending that he is all with him, when he is not.  There is no use trying to stand on two stools all the time.  For the last two years since this Government was formed, things have been done that would not have been done if a one-Party man had been in power.

      <P>I will go back to it, but if people want to &ldquo;cross-hackle&rdquo; me, I will &ldquo;cross-hackle&rdquo; them.  A lot of time has been taken up on this debate and it is ten minutes past nine now.  Why are they moving to refer back this Estimate of the Taoiseach? Was it ever done in the other Government's time?  Was it ever done before to make political capital and propaganda out of the position?  We were too quiet, I suppose, when we were in Opposition, or we could have used the same tactics.  Then we would not have given Deputy de Valera his Estimate either, as the Opposition are told now not to give it to the present Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is too much talk about emigration.  There has been emigration always.  I would like to know if Fianna Fáil want to keep young men and young women who want to go away to Canada, America, Britain, Scotland or Wales?  Do they want to deny them that right?  We gave them <Col N="1940" /> that right when we took away the restrictions that were placed on them by Fianna Fáil.  There are young men leaving the country who are in good jobs; there is no doubt about that. It is natural to expect that.  That is happening all the time, away down the years.  This is only a small island. Surely to goodness, we are not going to deprive our people and tell them they must remain in this island, out in the wilds of the country in places where there is no amusement and no recreation, but looking at turf bogs.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has represented Clare for a long time.  I was in Clare last week and I did not see many factories down there, in the constituency he represents.  I was told in Kilkee by people: &ldquo;We have nothing here; our children must go away and we are living on what they are sending home from America, Canada and Britain.&rdquo;  That is in Deputy de Valera's own constituency.  We hear all that talk about emigration, but what do we find with regard to industry?  The Fianna Fáil Government brought in what they called the Undeveloped Areas Act.  By that Act, if you are a foreigner, you can come in and you get all the facilities and moneys you like, if you go down to the West.  That was it, but down in my county and in the South of Ireland, the local people are told that they must put up so much capital before they get a factory.  If you go to the Gaeltacht or to the West of Ireland, then even if you are a black man, you get all the concessions you like.  That is not right.  We are looking for a factory in my own town and there is £50,000 in local capital available, but we cannot get anyone to come.  They say they must go to the West, as the Government will give them more help if they go to the West and start the industry there.  That is why the South of Ireland and other centres are not getting the industries they should.</P>
    <P>We hear about the markets and the farmers.  I have been speaking to a lot of farmers and I get farmers' votes. They are not doing too badly and they know what I say is right.  The people I represent in the majority are those who have to labour and that is why <Col N="1941" /> we have a trade union, to see that they get value for their work.  Deputy de Valera wants them now to cower down and not look for an increase of wages.  That is what he meant to-day. He told the workers they must make sacrifices.  It is the workers who have made sacrifices all the time; it is the poor people of Ireland who are making the sacrifices all the time, and I suppose they will always remain to do so.</P>
    <P>There is too much political propaganda in this House.  We are all elected here to do the best we can, to tell whoever is in power, whether Fianna Fáil or the present Government, what we want for the people we represent. I would tell them pretty quickly if they were not doing things rightly, but I am satisfied, under the circumstances, that our people have not been forgotten by the present Government.  I am glad to see that the unemployed man, for the first time since 1932, who has to go to the labour exchange, will get an increase.  I am glad to see that the widow and orphan, who got no increase the last time, will get increases in September.  I am glad to see that the man who is sick&mdash;yes, depending on national health&mdash;is being remembered by the Government, which is coming to his aid.  I ask the people in opposition: Are they against that? Are they against the improvements?  If they are, let them tell us and not be trying to hoodwink one another.  I am glad these concessions are coming their way.  Some of these things might be on my own head.  Of course, there are meetings on in the House.</P>

      <P>I have been here for the past two days listening to an Opposition that was in Government for 20 years.  If a good Government were in power for 20 years, there should not be a straw astray in Ireland.  When I hear them criticising the Minister for Agriculture, I think of the time when one could not get a rasher and when, <Col N="1942" /> if one saw a pig on the road, one would salute it.  The pig industry has been revived and the bacon factories are kept going.  The bacon factory in Wexford was closed down under Fianna Fáil, because there were no pigs available. When the first Coalition came into office in 1948, the grass was still growing around the bacon factories. If the Minister for Agriculture did nothing else, he restored the bacon industry. He did a good job for the farmers when he put lime into the fields at 16/- a ton.  The farmers know well from whom they got the benefits.</P>
      <P>It is right to criticise when you are in opposition&mdash;I do not blame the Opposition for that&mdash;but the criticism should be fair.  If there is a crisis, the Opposition should join with the Government in order to get over the crisis.  I do not believe that there is a crisis because I have been listening to talk of crises since I came into the House.  Over a great number of years the cry was: &ldquo;You are in the wood&rdquo;, the suggestion being that there is gloom and disaster if Deputy de Valera is not in power.  That is the policy of Fianna Fáil: if Deputy de Valera is in power, everything is all right and if Deputy de Valera is not in power, everything is all wrong.  You would not hear one word from the Fianna Fáil Party if Deputy de Valera were in power; they would not say one word of criticism because they would not be allowed to criticise.  We, on this side of the House, are free to speak our minds.  That is a great thing.  We are not cowed down by one man.</P>

      <P>We have a good leader, a man who is admired all over the world, never mind in Ireland.  We ought to be fair in our criticism. Remember, none of us was sent here except to work for his constituency and for the people.  Deputies are not sent here to be &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo;  There was too much of that for years.  There was a whole crowd of &ldquo;yes-men.&rdquo; That is not the position now, and has not been since 1948.  There has been freedom of discussion for all Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that every Party in <Col N="1943" /> the country should be represented in the Government.  No one Party should dominate or try to hold on to power for ever.  I have said enough now, but I was brought to my feet when I heard Deputy de Valera worrying about the Labour Party and asking the workers to make sacrifices.  The workers made sacrifices down the ages and will be prepared to do it to-morrow, if necessary, but we are not going to stand, as we had to stand when Deputy de Valera was in Government, for a standstill wages order.  We are not faced with that possibility under this Government.  We have our trade unions to secure conditions and wages. The Taoiseach said that, if he could not control prices of essential foodstuffs, the trade unions were free to look for increased wages to meet the increased cost.</P>

      <P>All I have learned from Deputy O'Leary's speech that I can understand is that there should be no restrictions during an emergency&mdash; that was the first thing he told us; secondly, that machines create unemployment, whereas, of course, we know that they eventually increase employment, and thirdly, that only the Coalition Parties can criticise the Government in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about all that I could glean from Deputy O'Leary's speech.  The members of the Government have been running very quickly from their 1952 shadows and, at last, with this last emergency levy, the 1952 shadows are creeping up on them and have got very nearly level.  Ever since 1947, we have been listening in this country to a farrago of nonsense, most of which meant quite simply that the people were entitled to a good living immediately, that the good living could be got for them immediately, if they voted for the Coalition and that that was all they needed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last, the facts are catching up with the present Government and, as I have said, the shadows of 1952 have closed in on them and the Minister for Finance's speech earlier to-day and the Taoiseach's speech on this Estimate <Col N="1944" /> are nothing more than a contradiction of hours and hours and weeks and weeks of nonsense talked in this House about the balance of payments, about external investments, about the method of expending external investments, about our trade, about our industry. Perhaps the only good thing that has happened in 1956 is that, for the first time, the Minister for Finance is beginning to acknowledge the truth.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to study the economic developments that have taken place in the countries of Northern Europe, some of whom compete with us in the British market.  It is interesting to read their parliamentary debates, to see the difference between the way they conduct their affairs and the way that we do.</P>

      <P>One of the advantages which they have had, because they have had nothing like the Coalition Government, in respect of dealing honestly with statistics and with economics, is that they have always argued together on a common acceptance of the state of the nation in which they live.  Even in Great Britain, although the divergencies of the Socialist and the Conservative Parties are very considerable, and although they fight each other in Parliament and disagree in policy, ever since the war they have had a measure of agreement on the general economic facts of the life of the British people.  But, in this country all the facts have been confused, all the facts have been distorted by the Coalition Parties.</P>

So, what are the people of the country who will invest their money, who, we hope, will invest their money, in exports, to say?  Will they believe Deputy O'Leary or will they believe the Taoiseach?

This is a very good time to have a good deal of clear thinking on these economic matters and it is very much easier, now that the Minister for Finance has had to agree as to the facts, for us to say many things than it was to say them at an earlier period.</P>
      <P>I think the present Government owe an apology to the Central Bank directors, who made certain pronouncements in 1951.  Most of the suggestions they made are now being put into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>What I object to is the fact that many members of the present Government and the Labour Party not only jeered at the directors of the Central Bank but implied that they were scarcely Irishmen because they were warning the country of an inflation which has now had its effect fully.  As I have said, the Central Bank, in the prophecies it made in 1951 proved to be very nearly correct and their warnings have proved to be very valuable to the present Government and to the last Government.  It is a curious thing that we do not seem to have grown up in this House.  Those of us who know less than others about <Col N="1946" /> economics are inclined to scorn the advice of those who are in a position to give advice.  The more ignorant a Deputy is on the Coalition side, the more he scorns people who have most knowledge of the balance of payments and of the effect that continual adverse balances have on the life of the country.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil is supporting the present Government in imposing the present levies, as they supported the last, a prophecy made as far back as 1935 by the very conservative Banking Commission at that time would have very nearly come true.  It shows that men who sit in high position can occasionally be good prophets.  Here is an extract which said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There may be a deficit in the balance of payments which eats into the monetary reserves, and in the end, forces the country into a position of acute disequilibrium which leaves no alternative to depreciation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then follow these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the Free State (as it then was) with its large foreign assets such a possibility may seem remote but the very existence of those assets would permit for some time that maintenance of an unbalanced position, whereas, with reserves of a more limited volume corrective measures could be taken earlier.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very interesting prophecy which will not come true as long as this Party supports the Government in restricting imports.</P>
      <P>We all know what the position is. There is nothing to boast about.  As far as the economic life of the country is concerned since 1947 we have not done as well as has been done by practically every country in Europe. We have not produced as much.  We have not saved as much.  We have not invested as much as virtually every one of the countries who belong to the O.E.E.C. group who provide the figures of production and so forth.</P>

      <P>The major reason in my view is that the whole political <Col N="1947" /> issue in this country has been confused since 1947, by the fact that at every crossroads and at every single political meeting we on this side of the House have been fighting propaganda which more or less said: &ldquo;Vote for us now; we promise to give you a good time now.&rdquo;  That is the principal reason for the stringency of our position.</P>
      <P>One can go back to 1947.  In 1947 and 1948, instead of battling as to what were the methods by which production could be increased and by which a revolution in agriculture could be carried out, the methods by which our exports and production could be increased, what did we spend most of our time doing?  We spent it in answering the charge that the people of the country were very badly off under Fianna Fáil during the war.  We were answering exactly the same charges as were made in 1954.  I could bore the House by quoting yards and yards of speeches of Coalition Ministers promising to reduce the cost of living, promising to make everything easy, of Deputy Norton promising to gain control of national credit, promising to restore the corporation profits tax, promising to punish the profiteers who never could be found afterwards and speeches of the Taoiseach promising to tax tourists to reduce the cost of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The campaign started in 1947 has brought us to the present position.  It began then and it went on continuously all through the years.  As I have said, we are getting nearly to the end of it now.  We heard the Minister for Finance speak to-day and talk about foreign assets.  He said that action must be taken in the light of present circumstances.  He made a polite speech to Deputy MacBride, who had gone in for the usual propaganda which characterised the whole of the first part of the régime of the Coalition <Col N="1948" /> Government that, somehow, everything could be made perfect in this country as long as the Government spent very rapidly all the people's money at no cost to anyone.  We had that policy played to its maximum during the whole period from 1948 until Deputy MacBride, quite mercifully, did not join the present Government.  I am glad he did not.</P>
      <P>I think myself that, of all the Parties in the State, Clann na Poblachta has done more to poison the wells of national consciousness than any other Party.  They were the people who set the example for everyone else in 1947. It was their policy that was partly copied by Fine Gael and by the Labour Party, the policy of promising everybody everything at no cost to anyone. It amazes me that, even now, I can hear Deputy MacBride get up vaguely saying that the Government should have more control of the banking system, that the Government in some way should have more control over national credit.  I do not think the Minister for Finance has even yet been insistent enough on this problem of the control of national credit.  He cannot even restrain the members of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>We had, during the Leix-Offaly by-election, Deputy Larkin going around saying the Government should nationalise the banks.  That is another reason why the businessmen and farmers of the country have no confidence in the present Government.  They want to know is there a move to nationalise the banks and, if there is not a move at the moment, they want to know what influence Deputy Larkin and certain members of the trade unions are likely to have on the Labour members of the present Government in the future and what, in the course of the next year might happen in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is about time the Minister for Finance told Deputy Larkin that it does not matter whether the Government nationalises the banks or not, that so far as the present situation is concerned every time the Government spends a pound of their own money or of other people's money, they cause the importation of roughly ten or 12 <Col N="1949" /> shillings' worth of goods and that if the Government were to take over the whole banking resources of the country, if they appointed investment board on top of investment board, no matter how they did it, the only result would be that every penny so spent would result in a halfpenny worth of imports. I do not think that the present Minister for Finance has persuaded the members of the Labour Party about that at all. I go down to Westmeath and Longford and hear the same sort of underhand talk: &ldquo;would it not be a good thing to nationalise the banks?&rdquo;  That is another reason why the Government has no longer the confidence of the business community.  They can never be quite certain what the Government will or will not do.</P>

      <P>We had a long peroration from the Minister for Agriculture as to what he is said to have done for Irish agriculture.  As I said on a previous occasion, the Government of this country have spent since 1946 £1,000,000,000 altogether on capital services.  Of that total amount, just £100,000,000 have been spent on agriculture. I think agriculture represents 30 per cent. of our national income.  We have never yet got down fundamentally to getting more capital invested in agriculture.  There is that fact and, at the same time, for months in 1951-52 there were wordy arguments by the then Minister for Finance justifying the use of foreign assets for consumer goods, social purposes and purposes other than productive purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the whole of 1951-52, the then Government was castigated as anti-Irish conspirators because they suggested a very mild and cautious halt to the spending of external assets.  In 1951-52, we had Deputies like the present Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, saying that the Government was mentally deficient in that they did not spend the assets as rapidly as possible and asking what was the use of not spending the assets which he now describes as so precious with the value of the £1 <Col N="1950" /> down from 20/- to 10/11d. and would it not be better to spend the assets rapidly on goods of any kind so long as they were spent.  They held that if you believed, as Deputy de Valera suggested, that it would be a good thing to place yourself in the position that your nearest neighbour always owed you large sums of money upon which you could call immediately in the event of any crisis it was tantamount practically to sitting in the lap of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I am sorry that a lot of people in this country believed that kind of frightful twaddle.  Now this present Government are paying for the results.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister for Finance would dearly like to be able to use some of the savings that were frittered away because of this easy living atmosphere created by the present Government.  I am quite sure the present Minister for Finance would very much like to have a little bit of what was described as &ldquo;mental deficiency&rdquo; actuating the life of the people between 1950 and 1954.  If we had even £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 of useful external assets at this moment, how much easier it would be to get us over these financial difficulties, to raise an immediate loan for some special agricultural purpose, to reduce Government expenditure and to be able to go to-morrow and say: &ldquo;We have the savings.  We can go ahead with national development.  We have plenty of money in hands.  Of course, we reasonably restrained our imports and we do not have to worry&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance would very much like to have now some of the savings that were misspent during that period.  We should like to know even now whether the Government is united in policy on this matter.</P>
    <P>During the course of the North-Kerry by-election, we had the Minister for Defence saying that we had £500,000,000 invested, that £35,000,000 had been liquidated in 1955 and that it was not a very serious matter.  I wonder how many times any Deputy in the Coalition Party, in his ministerial or other capacity, could be found during the whole course of the last nine <Col N="1951" /> years to remind people that our debts to other countries were constantly rising?  We now have a balance of payments problem.  The average person down the country does not understand very much about economics.  He has not the time to study them.  He has a long working day and he hopes, at the end of it, for a little bit of leisure.  If you ask him about the economic position of this country and if he had listened to the Coalition he would simply reply that we have £500,000,000 invested abroad.  That has been the excuse for attacking Fianna Fáil for years and years.</P>
    <P>Whenever we taxed people to pay for current services, we were told we should borrow the money as we had £500,000,000 invested abroad.  Whenever we decided it was better to pay for some development in the country from current revenue, we were told: &ldquo;We have £500,000,000 invested abroad.  Why not spend it on that particular service?&rdquo;  I have never yet at any crossroads or political meeting heard any Minister of the present Government tell the people that we have between two-thirds and four-fifths of that sum in liabilities.  This £500,000,000 that has been dangled before the people is simply a kind of dope designed to make them believe that everything can improve quickly without any exertion or any sustained effort, that everything is all right as we have £500,000,000 invested abroad. &ldquo;We do not have to worry, boys.&rdquo;  But they are worrying now at last after all that talk.</P>
    <P>I heard another Labour Minister down the country within the past two months speak to the people there and say that he preferred the prosperity of the people to bank balances.  He made a speech directly contradicting the statement of the Minister for Finance.  He made it perfectly clear that the banks were great big prosperous organisations who would worry about the balances in the bank and that what he was concerned with was getting the workers a higher wage.  No wonder there is no confidence in the present Government.  The people want to know what is the real opinion of the <Col N="1952" /> Government.  Is it the opinion of the Labour Minister who says that prosperity is more important than bank balances, or is it the opinion of the Minister for Finance who gave us a long and extremely correct lecture yesterday, pointing out that the net assets of the banks had reached an all-time low level and could not be further reduced and that the amount required was the minimum to transact the ordinary commercial transactions between our country and other countries?</P>
    <P>That is why the people lack confidence. They hear the Minister for Finance make very correct speeches. They hear the Taoiseach make very correct speeches and, the next moment, a whispering campaign goes around because the Labour Party is always hoping for something to turn up that will enable them to justify the promises they made to their electors. You have the whispering campaign going around suggesting that things might be easy and, after all, maybe they will not be quite so bad.  You have the Minister for Finance getting up and saying that if the people do not save, there will not be any capital construction.  Almost the next day, a Labour Minister says that whatever else happens the housing of the people will proceed at its present pace and that everything will be all right.  The people are asking who is correct and who is giving the right view.  They are asking who is likely to have the most influence in the Government&mdash;the view that everybody will have to save or the view that everything will be all right.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance talks about a savings committee and of the efforts to stimulate savings.  In the first six months of this year, the people put less than £1,000,000 into the Post Office Savings Bank: that is the net accretion, the deposits less withdrawals.  It is about one-third of the amount put in during the corresponding period of 1953, just six months after the &ldquo;penal Budget&rdquo; of 1952, as it was called.  But the Minister for Finance has not made it sufficiently clear that the savings he requires need to be increased from £17,000,000 to £54,000,000.  That represents additional savings of <Col N="1953" /> £37,000,000 and it would require a tremendous and sustained personal sacrifice by every individual in the State, the kind that no member of the Government has indicated sufficiently clearly.  A sum of £37,000,000 represents about £12 per head of the population, men, women and children.</P>
    <P>I recognise that, statistically, that is a dangerous average to make because the savings include all kinds of savings.  But if the Minister for Finance is correct, and I believe him to be correct, that not only can we not finance the present capital programme of the State but we cannot start on a real campaign of increasing production, we can develop no new fresh plan to increase our exports, the saving involved is not simply what a person puts into the savings bank in order to go for a holiday, which is the tenor of the present advertisements inviting people to go abroad.  The advertisements issued by the Director of Savings are everywhere, telling people they can have a holiday abroad, if they save the money.  Those advertisements are a little out of date.</P>
    <P>The saving required now is something which almost involves a contribution in the patriotic sense to this position.  The people of this country, whatever their financial difficulties, have got used to buying motor cycles and refrigerators; people of very modest incomes have been buying cars; people of very modest incomes were able suddenly to find their way to get hire-purchase articles in large measure.  If this £37,000,000 is to be saved, it means they will have to reverse completely a trend of life. It means they will have to forgo all the ideas that have been preached to them by the Coalition Government ever since 1947.  It means we will have to go back to doing what the Danes and the Dutch did after the war.  Whatever Party they were in, whether it was Socialist or Conservative, whatever special views either side of their Parliament had, what they recommended to the people was that they must deliberately forego the standard of living they would like to have to build up the economy of the nation, not to save money for one's own holiday but to save money to lend <Col N="1954" /> it to the Government or to lend it to a private concern which was going to provide more jobs and expand production, not saving only for marriage but saving for the nation.  As I have said, I think the Minister for Finance, who spoke very well in giving a description of the country's position, will have to go much further in regard to that. When he says there must be this personal saving, he is demanding a personal change of attitude.</P>
    <P>As I understand the Taoiseach is to speak very shortly, I shall conclude on one note.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture implied in the course of their speeches that other countries are suffering the same difficulties as ourselves.  Let me say this with absolute sincerity.  I do not mind whether the Coalition is right or wrong, or whether we are right or wrong in our attitude to this whole matter, but I know this, that to drug the country with self-pity of that kind will get us nowhere.  The position is that most of the countries in 1939 had no savings abroad, that most of the countries who had savings abroad in Europe, foreign savings in investments, lost what they had during the war, that we were neutral and saved between £150,000,000 and £200,000,000 during the war by exporting more to our neighbours than we imported.</P>
    <P>We have not the faintest excuse for dissipating our savings to the extent we have and although I regard the Coalition as mainly responsible, we all have a joint responsibility in this House for that.  All of us to some extent, greater or lesser, are to blame. We have not the smallest excuse for dissipating those savings to the point we have.  If we had spent a far greater proportion on reorganising the pig industry, on live-stock products and improving our agriculture, we would be able to build all the houses we needed out of the profits we made from agricultural production.  However, let us have no self-pity in regard to the position.  If England were in our position now, they would have had at the end of the war £2,500,000,000 in foreign investments ready to use, that is, in proportion to their population. In fact it would have been far more.  I worked it out purely on the basis of <Col N="1955" /> population.  We would have to work it out purely on the basis of the total resources being developed, in proportion to the wealth of the country and so on.  In such circumstances as ours, England would have no balance of payments problem.</P>
    <P>We have all been to some degree at fault.  The Coalition were mainly responsible by preaching easy living. Let us have no self-pity about it now but let us get on with the job.  We are back where the Danes and the Dutch were after the war and we must save virtually every penny to build up our production.  We have got to save hundreds of millions of pounds before we are a modern developed nation. Most of it has got to be found from the savings of our people, savings that will hurt, that will be difficult, and will not come easily.  That will mean a great change in attitude.  As I say, there should be no self-pity about it. Let us be frank and if we are frank about it we might have some success.</P>

The Deputy who has just sat down, speaking to the House as he usually does in a condescending manner, referring to the ignorance of economics of most members of the House and in that condescending way also referring to the lamentable fact that our people were completely ignorant of economics, proceeded to deliver what I believe was the most mischievous speech that has been delivered in this House certainly in my memory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come back to the £24,000,000.  If there is any doubt in the minds of anybody in the House that that is a sore point, it is not now necessary for me to emphasise it.  It has been emphasised in a much more forcible way by the Deputies across the House than by anything I could express. Deputy de Valera told us he foresaw this situation in 1947.  Mind you, that was some foresight.  Deputy Childers went back further.  He told the House that the present day conditions, not merely of this country but of the world, were foreseen by some banking commission and by the Central Bank in 1935.  We had to listen to Deputy de Valera, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Childers talking here as if the 1947 conditions in this country or in any part of the world were comparable with conditions to-day.  It is an amazing thing that Deputy de Valera could foresee, nine years ago, what the greatest statesmen and <Col N="1961" /> leaders of the greatest nations in the world could not foresee nine months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was there nine months ago, but you did not admit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this is the penalty one has to pay for democracy. There is no comparison whatever; there was nothing in 1952 comparable with to-day and there was certainly nothing in 1952 that called for a 50 per cent. increase in the price of the loaf of bread.  The people who increased the price of the loaf of bread by 50 per cent. are the people who are now ex-Ministers. When they are not in this House, they are down in Cork for the by-election filled with concern for the people in case the price of the loaf might be increased by one farthing.  If they got a 50 per cent. increase in the loaf in 1952, under then conditions, and all the other increases, surely we are entitled to ask what measures would the Fianna Fáil Party, if they were now in Government, consider it necessary to take to meet the conditions obtaining to-day?  I think we know.</P>
      <P>Of course it is quite slick to talk about lack of confidence in the Government, but the average man in this country, and in any other country, is not accustomed to making a fine distinction as between the credit of a Government and the credit of a State. There is nobody more conscious of that than Deputy Childers.  He was so conscious of it that he deliberately repeated that, and I have no doubt whatever, that the speech was delivered, not merely for this House, but so that it would get leaded headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> to try to shake the people's confidence.  You could, particularly in a situation like that which faces us to-day, shake confidence in the Government without shaking confidence in the credit of the State.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera told us again last night that there is only one person fit to lead this country and that is himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He will never get that chance again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the besetting curse of the Deputy that he believes, <Col N="1962" /> perhaps honestly, that he is the only person in Ireland competent to lead the country along the right road.  If this country is not geared to meet the harsh winds when they blow, who is responsible?  If our agriculture is not sufficiently geared to give us that extra production, who is responsible?  Who was in charge of this State for 20 years with not even the excuse that they had not a complete majority over all Parties for 16 years?</P>
      <P>The Deputy now talks about what should be done in the schools.  He brought us back to the temptation of Eve.  I suppose it is a polite way of describing people on this side of the House as serpents.  He told us that he detests this Government, and of course a man less used to playing with words would perhaps have used, more directly and straightforwardly, the word which the Deputy probably would have liked to use, but thought it inadvisable&mdash; that he hates this Government.  Sixteen years, with all the machinery, all the resources of this country completely and entirely at his disposal, with a complete and overwhelming majority in this House, to give effect to any policy or programme for the welfare of the people and the State, that he could possibly think of and desired to put into operation and what was the end of it?  We now hear about emigration. At the end of that 16 years of continuous, strong, one-man Government, 500,000 of our people&mdash;one-sixth of our entire population&mdash;had cleared out of the country and more people were lining up at the labour exchanges than on the first day he took office 16 years before.  We are told that we, on this side of the House, are the people to blame because agriculture and industry are not geared to meet the harsh wind when it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers talked, in his condescending way, about all the arrant nonsense talked in this House and in this country.  Deputy de Valera challenges us about dishonesty and deception of the people and suggests that we obtained office under false pretences. I could recite from the 17 promises of the Deputy.  I am not going to remind the Leader of the Opposition of those 17 promises.  They are well known and <Col N="1963" /> on record, and the Deputy cannot adopt his old excuse that he was misrepresented or misreported.  I will refer only to one.  He gave a very solemn promise that food subsidies would not be touched or disturbed and the Deputy, flagrantly and without any real reason, or excuse, deliberately broke that promise and every member who sits beside or behind him, was a party to it.  We are lectured by the Leader of the Opposition on the virtue of truth.  He has repeated it so often that it has even caught on with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  It is tough enough having to listen to it coming from the Leader of the Opposition but when the Deputy Leader starts, it is worse.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have the truth? Deputy de Valera knows quite well that this Government or the inter-Party Government that preceded it are not responsible for the conditions to-day.  Deputy Childers alleged that we deliberately told the people that they should have a good time; spend all and save nothing.  Is that the truth?  Has it any resemblance to the truth?  We are told that the people were told there was no necessity to be industrious, no necessity to be thrifty and no necessity to do other than be merry and gay, drink and have a good time.  Nobody said that here.</P>
    <P>Neither this country, nor any other country in the world, except when Fianna Fáil were in power, wanted to inflict any of the hardships, which both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Childers talked about to-day, on our people before it was necessary to do so.  We are told we are going to get the co-operation of the Opposition in meeting this crisis.  What is meant obviously, of course, having regard to the speeches to which we listened, is that the Opposition do not think it judicious or politically wise to oppose what we want to do here.  There is a big difference between that and wholehearted co-operation.</P>
    <P>Are we never to get the interests of this country put before the interests of Party?  As a great man once said: &ldquo;Is the country never to get a chance?&rdquo;  Must we go on, after 35 years <Col N="1964" /> of the futility of it, being more concerned with scoring off each other and taking mean advantages of each other than with trying to do something for the country?  We heard a lot of talk about the unity of the 32 counties. When I hear people talking here about the desirability of uniting our people in the 32 counties but who are doing their damnedest to see that the people in the Twenty-Six Counties will not be united or act in unity, I begin to wonder what they mean when they talk about uniting our people of all creeds and classes inside the 32 counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera ought not to object to plain speaking.  He indulged in a lot of it yesterday.  He lost his temper. I grant he does not often do that. The Deputy, yesterday and to-day, spent practically his entire speech trying to justify himself, his own Party and his own policy.  That was his sole concern.  I am not blaming him for that.  I do not mind any man trying to justify himself, provided he does not feel it necessary first to damn the people with whom he is in opposition. You are not going to establish to the satisfaction of anybody, either the individual or the community, your own rectitude and good name, whether as an individual or a Party, by trying to drag the good name of other people into the mud.</P>
    <P>There is nobody with any sense at all but must be concerned about the conditions which obtain to-day.  There is no person in any walk of life who has any understanding of the situation or any regard for the country, or its people, or their future, but must be concerned.  I do not think he meant it, but I think Deputy de Valera went a bit far when he picked out the Labour Party and the workers of this country and made a special appeal to them for help and to come together when there was a national danger facing this country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of his intimate knowledge of the working people and the poor, and his concern for them.  I do not question that in the slightest, but I want to suggest to the Deputy that his contact with them over the years, perhaps of necessity, has been <Col N="1965" /> rather a remote one.  Again, I do not think it was meant, but it was almost a piece of impertinence to suggest that the trade unions, the Labour Party and the workers of the country generally would not respond at least as quickly as any other section of the community when the call of danger went out.  Perhaps I had a much more intimate connection with the poor and the workers than even Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <P>They will always try to put me off the track, Sir.  I will come back to what I was dealing with when the interruption came&mdash;Deputy de Valera's appeal to the Labour Party. He said he would like to hear somebody from the Labour Party speak. They have spoken&mdash;and, I am sure, to the Deputy's dismay&mdash;to the speech and the proposals of the Minister for Finance and to the speech of the Taoiseach.  They are very important and very useful members of the Cabinet and the Government of this country.  They have enough strength, enough patriotism and enough realisation <Col N="1966" /> of whatever dangers there may be, to do what the Deputy and his colleagues have asserted up and down the country for the past two years they would not have the strength to do: to approve and to stand over unanimous measures which are necessary but which are probably politically unpopular.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and his colleagues told the people of this country that this was a &ldquo;jellyfish Government,&rdquo; made up of bits and pieces, with no common ground and no common agreement, with one dragging the tail and the other the snout.  The Deputy's latest was that there was one foot on the brake pedal and the other on the accelerator.  The policy put forward in the Taoiseach's speech is not the policy of the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan or the Independents.  It is the common policy of the Government and the one they believe is necessary to prevent disaster and to safeguard the interests of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before proceeding with my reply, I wish to make an observation on the last remark of Deputy Blaney.  This arrangement was made well before Deputy Morrissey got up to speak.  Deputy Morrissey was the only speaker, with the exception of Deputy O'Leary, from this side of the House during the entire debate on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1967" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are referring to, that when the arrangement was made Deputy Morrissey got up and talked it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement was made.  There is no doubt that on this Estimate the Opposition can criticise and examine the whole policy of the Government.  We allowed a perfectly clear field to the Opposition during the entire debate on this Estimate. The suggestion of Deputy Blaney is therefore, I think, wholly unsustainable.</P>
      <P>What has struck me during the debate on my Estimate, and during the debate on the proposals of the Minister for Finance to increase the levies, has been that from the point of view of the Opposition the debate has been carried out in a very poor manner.  The reason for that is not hard to see.  We in this Government have gone through a period, during the last eight months, of trials, difficulties and anxieties in connection with the financial and economic situation in this country, such as have never faced or beset any Irish Government since this State was established.  We have had to consider anxiously and carefully all the problems that arose from day to day, unforeseen and unforeseeable difficulties arising from causes undoubtedly beyond our control.  They have arisen perhaps to some extent from conditions created by our own people here in this country, but, to a large extent and perhaps to the largest extent, from the effects which flowed over here from the new financial policy of the British Government and the conditions existing in Great Britain. That is what caused our greatest difficulty. It was the problems which arose from those conditions that we had to meet and I want to make it clear to this House, and through this House to the country, that no Government had to meet such difficulties in circumstances of such grave anxiety, and no Government has ever found among its members such resolute unity in facing problems of this kind, and in achieving a solution of them, as I have got from my colleagues, Labour, Fine Gael and Clann na Talmhan, for the past eight months.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deny categorically the suggestions made here by the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Opposition that there is disunity in this Government. Any such suggestion is devoid of any foundation whatever.  I know that my word will be accepted in the country that, during this period of anxiety and danger for this country, I got such unified support and help from all my colleagues, and from Labour in particular, as no Taoiseach, or Prime Minister, has ever got in this country since the establishment of the State.  I can say that no Fianna Fáil Government was ever as united as the inter-Party, or Coalition, Government &mdash;call it what you like&mdash;has been over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Proof of that is forthcoming in the speeches we have had here to-day.  It was because of that that we have had such bitterness from the Leader of the Opposition and his Party.  It is because of their disappointment that we can, together, face the difficulties of the situation resolutely, and come forward with concrete proposals to put before this House to meet this situation, and that we can come and tell the facts to the people one week before the by-election in Cork, that there is all this bitterness.  We come forward resolutely and do so because we put the nation before political Parties or political advantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason for the hysterics which we had yesterday. They thought that this Government could not keep together and face the difficulties of the situation.  Everybody knows the reason for these statements by the Opposition, but it was not the reason given here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at what we have done to meet the situation.  It is agreed and admitted that there is a serious situation in this country, economically and financially, due, as I said, to causes entirely beyond the control of this Government, and it has not been suggested <Col N="1969" /> in the whole course of this debate that the Government were in any way responsible for the conditions that have emerged in the last seven or eight months, and which face the country to-day.</P>
    <P>We find in this House now that there is unanimous agreement that there is a serious situation financially and economically and that steps had to be taken to meet that situation.  The steps that we have taken and have put before the House are being approved unanimously, without a division, by this House and there has not been a single additional suggestion put forward during the debate.  There has not been any criticism of our proposals, and there has been no suggestion that they are not the right and proper steps to take&mdash;in fact the only steps to be taken&mdash;in the present situation.</P>
    <P>There was no criticism of these proposals, nor has there been any suggestion, much less a statement, that other things could have been done or that other measures could have been taken, instead of those that we have taken.  Notwithstanding all the hysterics we had yesterday, there has been no suggestion that we have failed to do anything that we should have done as a responsible Government, facing this Dáil and the country as a collective Government, with collective responsibility for these proposals.</P>
    <P>It has been said more than once in the last few years that a Coalition could not govern this country, and would be afraid to take firm decisions. We heard Deputy de Valera say, and we read it in the paper, too, that one section of the Government was pulling this way and another section was pulling that way; we heard him say that one section was facing this way and another section facing that way. Yesterday, he used some sort of strange analogy about putting one's foot on the brake and one's hand on the accelerator. It is news to me that one puts one's hand on the accelerator.</P>

      <P>The supposition was that we were pulling in different directions. That was Deputy de Valera's analysis some time ago.  Deputy MacEntee yesterday, when he moved to refer this Estimate back, was rather facetious in his approach, but he did suggest that some statements made by some of my colleagues did not appear to agree with the statements I was making or with general Government policy.  According to Deputy MacEntee, and some of the other Opposition Deputies, the supposition was that Fine Gael said one thing, Labour said something else, and Clann na Talmhan something different.  He gave an example.  He selected three Fine Gael members&mdash;Deputy John O'Donovan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy General MacEoin, Minister for Defence, and some other Fine Gael Minister.</P>

If ever any Government came into office with a mandate from the people it was this Government.  I went around the country, up and down the country, asking the people to vote for Fine Gael but stating clearly and specifically that, even if Fine Gael were to get a majority in that general election, I would invites my colleagues in the Labour Party, in Clann na Talmhan and in Clanna na Poblachta, to form a Coaliation, or an inter-Party Government with me, even if we in Fine Gael had an overall majority.

      <P>Another charge that the leader of the opposition levelled at us, and at me in particular, to-day was that this Government got into office at the last general election by false pretences.  That is a charge which he is found of making, never giving any authority to support the proposition. He said that I said something in 1952. I did not catch what he referred to in the course of his speech.  During the entire period, when I was leader of the Opposition, I dealt with the Policy of the then Government in detail.  I criticised it in a manner in which I thought was constructive.  Having given constructive criticism, I gave my own positive proposals every time.  I did that during the course of the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All my speeches are on record.  They are on the records of this House.  They are on the files of the newspapers, because, for practically every speech I made, when in opposition, I gave a script to the newspapers so that nobody <Col N="1976" /> could thereafter misrepresent what I had said.  I assert that, while in Government, during the first inter-Party Government period, and in Opposition from 1951 to 1954, I followed a consistent line of principle and policy and, as head of this present inter-Party Government, that same line of policy has been complied with in principle and in every detail.</P>
    <P>In respect of the sterling assets to which Deputy de Valera referred to-day, the principles upon which our schemes of productive capital expenditure and prudent repatriation of external assets were founded were stated again and again by me in public from 1948 to 1951, and were put on the records of this House between 1951 and 1954.  Those principles guide the decisions which we now have to make.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance said to-day in reply on the Fifth Stage of the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Order) Bill, our policy is a flexible policy.  The principles have been strictly adhered to in every single respect. Deputy de Valera made a suggestion that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, had, if I took Deputy de Valera down correctly, stated that our external assets were of no use.  He rhetorically cried&mdash;and, again I say, hysterically&mdash;could we not get an end to this nonsense of saying that our sterling assets were of no value.  Who said that?

      <P>The leader of the Opposition referred distinctly to me; Deputy Childers referred distinctly to me in the context of promises and false pretences.  I want to recall to the Deputies of this House.  It will go the records of this House.  It will go again on the records of this House.  I was asked by the <i>Irish Times</i> a series of questions during the general election for the purpose of putting me into a hole of corner.  I invite the <i>Irish Times</i> to produce them again and print them again.  I rejoice in the answers I gave at that time because nobody can accuse me of promising what I believe to be incapable of fulfilment&mdash; of giving irresponsible promises.  The answers to the questionaire that I got from the <i>Irish Times</i> were printed in that newspaper on the 13th May, 1954. The first two questions I was asked were:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If returned to the Government, do you propose, in the coming year, to reduce the cost of living by increasing food subsidies?</P>
      <P>If returned to Government, do you propose, in the coming year, to retain taxation as it is at present on beer and spirits, motoring and cigarettes?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I then proceeded to say a few introductory words before coming to the following sentence:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not therefore, propose to repeat the action of our opponents in 1951, when they made specific promises which they subsequently broke.  They failed to keep their specific promises to maintain subsidies and not to restore certain taxes. I am prepared to make only one promise&mdash;to provide good Government to the best of my ability.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to make one further quotation from the speech that I made following the speech at Ringsend opening the campaign.  I made almost the same speech at Ballyshannon.  This speech was in the possession of the <i>Irish Press</i> and was given to the <i>Irish Press</i> and the Leader of the Opposition before it was made.  I said, on the 24th April, 1954:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We do not intend to stifle our future endeavour by promises, hotly secured in the midst of an election campaign.  We will enter into no such competition and it should be appreciated that anyone who holds out to you rosy prospects of the expenditure on benefits is offering to spend your money for you.  We will make no such promises, which would dishonour you as much as they would dishonour us.  We do not believe that the Irish people are to be brought, but we will promise earnest service, the endeavour, so far as we may, to see that only the best talent is employed in Government, and the determination to be untiring and undistracted in the search for economic amelioration and social peace.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That promise has been fulfilled by me and my colleagues in the spirit and in the letter.  When it is said that I secured votes by false pretences, I invite any impartial man to read those speeches which, fortunately for me, are on record.  Remember that I was tuanted by the <i>Irish Press</i> and by Deputy Lemass, for failing to make any promises.  I am now in the happy position of being able to say to the Deputies opposite that I never made an irresponsible speech during the entire campaign in that general election.</P>

      <P>I said &ldquo;bear and spirits.&rdquo; I said you promised that you would not put on the taxes on beer and spirits but that you did put them on in 1952.

I am occupying the time of the House perhaps unduly on this, but I think it is in the public interest to deal with these charges, these false charges, which are repeated in the Hitler fashion&mdash;get the lie going and you never can catch up on it.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He complained that I had not given an <i>exposé</i> of the economic conditions and financial affairs of the country during the past 12 months and said that I had brought in emigration as a red herring.  Then he proceeded to say that my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party were apparently not in agreement with me, or something to that effect.  That was all playboyism.  Does Deputy MacEntee remember the 20 years, or nearly 20 years, during which his leader, Deputy de Valera, was Taoiseach, when his method of introducing the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach was to get up and move the formal resolution for £20,000, or whatever it was, and sit down and say that he would <Col N="1985" /> answer any questions?  There was never any <i>expose</i> by him.  When I because Taoiseach I did introduce the practice of giving information to Deputies and giving them some material on which they could discuss Government policy during the 12 months.  I kept up that practice all the time I was Taoiseach and every year since I came back to office I have done it.</P>
      <P>This year I made it clear in what I said that, because we had had so many discussions of an economic character, and because the facts and figures had been given as recently as yesterday, I would not go over the ground again; but I did deal with a matter that I thought was very relevant, the matter of emigration.  If I had wanted to draw red herrings across the discussion, do you think I would deliberately, have brought the subject of emigration into this debate?  I threw it into the arena of this debate, deliberately threw it in, and I got a very poor response, I must say.  I invited attack upon myself and my colleagues, but I have nothing to reply to in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee then proceeded to say that, because I had not given an <i>exposé</i> I prevented him from reviewing Government policy.  In answer to Deputy MacEntee yesterday, I said that this discussion on my Estimate was free for all, that Deputies were entitled, even though I dealt with only two or three topics in my introductory speech, to deal with all or any matter of Government policy, that there was nothing to stop them doing that.  I do say this, and I say it not merely about Deputy MacEntee, but about every Opposition Deputy who has spoken in this debate, that another characteristic feature of this debate on my Estimate is that, whereas there was much hysterical denunciation of the Government in all moods and tenses, there was practically no discussion at all of any aspect of Government policy or any <i>exposé</i> of any errors of the Government in matters of policy. There was no real criticism of Government policy at all.  The Leader of the Opposition detests this Government. Not a single one of the Deputies opposite, from Deputy de Valera <Col N="1986" /> down, selected aspects of Government policy and said, &ldquo;That is wrong; you should not have done this; you should have done that; this could be our policy.&rdquo;  There was nothing but destructive denunciation in the speeches that we had to-day or yesterday.</P>

He is comical when he is playing the role of political playboy; he is very dangerous indeed when he is acting the part of pseudo-statesman, I have in all seriousness to speak to-night to the dangerous utterances that he made within the last few days, and I have to do so in all the greater seriousness because of the remarks made by the Deputy childers a very short time ago.

It may be that Deputy Childers made this suggestion about nationalising the banks in some particular context.

It is very regrettable that I should have to deal with matters of this kind.</P>

At that time, the whole trend had reversed itself, as we pointed out and demonstrated in speech after speech and article after article in periodicals.  The inter-Party Government on the other hand, took action the minute we saw the trend going against us.  We took action in December last when, rightly or wrongly, whichever point of view you take, we acquiesced in the raising of bank interest rates.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee, crying woe and havoc in relation to the critical condition of the country, issued a White Paper in September, 1951, showing how the trend was going against the country, but he took no action until May, 1952, and, at that time when he introduced his Budget, the trend had gone entirely in favour of our balance of international payments. That Budget of 1952 was introduced in a year in which there was a £10,000,000 increase of the external reserves of the banking system.  Is that the condition that exists to-day when, in a period of 18 months, the Irish banking system has lost something like £50,000,000 of net external reserves? Is that not an entirely different condition?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;creating a situation in which limitations on expansion, which in other circumstances we might have enhoued, became the unenviable duty of the Government.  In 1952, Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Finance as he then was, based, as appears from the infamous White Paper of 1951, his whole principles, and his utterances of woe and misery, on the opinion that here would be no expansion in the agricultural industry. We said the cause of the imbalance at that time was the stockpiling created by the war in Korea and that, inevitably, the running down of those stocks would tend to correct the imbalance, we also said that agricultural exports would rise&mdash;as they rose dramatically <Col N="1993" />&mdash;and turn the tide of the balance of payments in our favour.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition tries to suggest that the conditions in 1947 and 1952 were the same as those which exist now&mdash;again trying to justify his past.  The Leader of the Opposition spent a considerable time in telling us, item after item, of the hopes he had held.  When he had concluded his speech I asked some of my colleagues whether I was mistaken or whether he had just given us a list of all his failures down through the years.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I just want to dwell on the other side of the picture.  I spoke, in the course, of my remarks in opening this debate, of the necessity for not looking too much on the dark side of things, for remembering the achievements of the past.  Those of us who were alive in Dublin prior to the Treaty wil remember the conditions in Ireland from 1910 onwards.  I remember them here in Dublin, where I have lived all my life, and in the country, where I travelled as a young barrister. I can see the changes.  If anybody lived in the City of Dublin when I was a boy they would remember that scarcely a boy or girl had a boot or stocking to their feet, I remember a phrase that was used by my mother in reference to the amount of clothing that the poor pelple wore in this city, that they had not enough on them to dust a fiddle.  I would ask Deputy McQuillan to remember that, when he whinges and whines in this House about our present conditions.  Remember what has been achieved, the houses that have been built&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You can take, if you like, the credit for anything that was done but I am saying we were all in on it for the last 35 years.  Every single Party in this House was in on it.  Whatever has been done, we can all take part of the blame or the credit, whichever you like, but I do say <Col N="1994" /> that something has been achieved.  I have lived to see, and I thank God I have lived to see dramatic changes in the conditions of life and the standard of living of our people.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture said to-day, we have had to take these corrective measures, but they are only palliative measures, only transitory measures, and the sooner they go the better we will be pleased.  Any such measures to correct the balance of payments, whether taken by us or by any other Government, are, as I said, only palliatives.  We cannot get a proper balance of trade until we get a greater volume of exports, until we get more production, to use a phrase of which, as Deputy de Valera said, everybody was tired.  Until we get the support of farmers and industrialists and an increase in the exports of goods, cattle and everything else, we cannot make progress and we will be only stopping holes and keeping out leaks here and there.</P>
      <P>Those are the fundamental things that must be done, but let us survey what has been done.  We have on the credit side the successful efforts of my friend, the Tánaiste, in getting the oil refinery in Cork.  Look at what that will mean to this country in capital flowing in, in all the goods and services and all the subsidiary services it will bring in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be said by Deputy MacEntee that bringing in capital into this country was a liability, but it is one of the ways in which, ultimately, you can hep to correct your balance of payments deficits and I take it that is what we all want to achieve.  That is what we have been trying to do.  In addition to the oil refinery we have had the mineral development in Advoca, in Allihies, West Cork, and other places.  The output of our cattle last year was the highest ever recorded.  The stocks of live stock, cattle, sheep and lambs were the highest we have ever had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a grealy increased output in pigs and as I think the Minister <Col N="1995" /> for Agriculture said to-day, practically a record crop of barley is expected.  By the end of this year we hope there will be 1,000,000 acres of Irish land rehabilitated or in the course of rehabilitation under the land project.  We have made dramatic strides in forestry and we have fixed our target in forestry.  We have fixed our target in housing, and we have more boats than ever before in the hands of Irish fishermen, all of which are being operated at a profit.</P>
    <P>Are those not things to be proud of? I do not care who is responsible for them, but I say we are entitled to meet our difficulties without, as Deputy Childers said to-night, beating our breasts and indulging in self-pity.  We have no need of self-pity.  We shall meet our difficulties, expected or unexpected, as they come, without whinging, whining or self-pity.  If we get co-operation from the Opposition, from the country and from the farmers in particular, and if the Opposition will ask their supporters to co-operate in the savings campaign, then we shall be able to carry out our programme of capital expenditure and there will be some hope for this country.</P>

      <P>In relation to the second question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, he is aware that what occurs in respect of the Report of the Central Bank is that it is delivered to the Minister for Finance, that it is then handed over to the Stationery Office, that it is between the Stationery Office and the Central Bank that the printing arrangements are made, that it is the Central Bank that checks the proofs as they come from the Stationery Office and that it does not come back to the Government through the Department or the Minister for Finance until the final proofs have been checked by the Central Bank and the printing completed.  The completed prints have not yet come back to me.</P>

      <P>At this hour, I cannot make many observations on this Estimate, much as I should like to do.  One of the principal activities of the Comhairle this year was to republish Dr. Thomas Bodkin's book <i>Hugh Land And His Pictures.</i>  It has been sent to every member of the British House of Commons and to some members of the House of Lords in the hope that some results will be achieved in getting back the pictures to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that in 1947, there was no balance of payments deficit.  I want to correct that statement.  In 1947, there was a balance of payments deficit of £29.8 million.  By the following year, 1948 there was a balance of paymentd deficit of £19.6 million, and, in 1950, there was a deficit of £30.2 million.  In 1951, there was a balance of payments deficit of £61.6 million.  The Taoiseach alleged in the course of his statemet that there was no balance of payments deficit in 1947 and that therefore there was no need to take special budgetary measures.  We disagree with that.  There was a deficit and the Supplementary Budget of 1947 was introduced to deal with it among other things.  On July 18th, 1951, I came into this House and I said&mdash;the reference is Volume 126, column 1898 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the present rate of disinvestment continues, Ireland will, by 1954, have lost her creditor status. We shall have no external resources to fall back upon in an emergency. To quote Deputy McGilligan, there will be no mainstay for our economic independence and our standard of living; our production and our population must decline.&rdquo;</P>
