    <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&mdash;(Deputy Briscoe.)</P>

      <P>On the evening of the 8th May when I moved that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, I had begun to try to point out to the House that the position confronting not only the Dublin Corporation but every local authority in connection with one aspect of local government&mdash;the provision of housing &mdash;had almost come to a standstill and that a very serious and critical situation still existed.  In connection with some of the statements I made, there were questionable interruptions.  I stated that it had always been the responsibility of the Government to provide moneys for housing&mdash;that housing was notified to each local authority as one of the priority items of local authority operations and that in every case local authorities had <Col N="890" /> definitely been informed that the question of finance was not to be their headache but that it was to be the concern and responsibility of the Government.</P>
      <P>Since 1948, when housing activities were resumed on a large scale and when, as a result of these extended operations, the provision of a large amount of money became essential, each Government, in succession, until last year, met the situation without any question so that local authorities could design a programme which would ultimately see the back of the housing shortage situation broken.  In that connection, there seemed to be some doubt and some reflection was cast on the capacity of local authorities who had under Acts of Parliament power to issue their own stock, the reflection being that the local authorities did not enjoy the confidence of those who had the money and that consequently their stock issues were failures, and particularly the last one.</P>
      <P>I should like to put some figures on record.  I stated that over a period of years the Dublin Corporation has, for instance, required £26,000,000 capital moneys.  The corporation issued public loans but the total subscriptions from the public in all those years towards that £26,000,000 were slightly in excess of £6,000,000.  In January, 1950, there was a 3½ per cent. stock issue for £5,000,000.  It was not put to the public.  It was privately underwritten by the Government and the full £5,000,000 was given to the corporation. That, I take it, is evidence without doubt that the Government then appreciated its responsibilities, appreciated the situation in the money market at the time and decided, rather than have the corporation go through the form of a public issue and then have it underwritten, to give the whole £5,000,000 themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June, 1951, there was a stock issue of £5,000,000 at 3½ per cent.  Of that, the public subscribed £1,397,190.  There was no talk then of the corporation having failed.  There was no suggestion then that the corporation had &ldquo;muffed&rdquo; the situation.  In February, 1953, the corporation on the advice of the Government, issued a loan, again <Col N="891" /> for £5,000,000, but the rate of interest was then 5 per cent.  It was substantially subscribed by the public because the corporation got £3,316,590 from the public.  That was one of the best results the corporation had over a long number of years.  In June, 1954, the corporation again had a stock issue for £5,000,000, but it was thought that 4½ per cent. should be the proper rate of interest.  The stock was put to the public at that rate and the total subscribed by the public was £1,164,660. In December, 1955, the rate was again changed from 4½ per cent. to 5 per cent. and the corporation wanted £6,000,000.  Of that, the public subscribed £1,802,430, the banks giving a guarantee to take up £2,000,000 of that loan.</P>
    <P>The total of those five issues was £26,000,000 and the total subscribed by the public was £6,680,870.  That will, I hope, make it clear to the House that suggestions that the Government never had responsibility for the finding of the money should be completely knocked on the head.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the situation that confronts us at the moment.  There seems to be quite a lot that some people have to learn about the problem. On 25th October, 1954&mdash;and I hope that is going back far enough&mdash; the corporation sent a letter to the Department notifying them of the corporation's estimated capital requirements for the year beginning 1st January, 1955.  They pointed out that their total capital requirements came to £6,553,040.  Nothing was heard from the Department.  A letter was written on the 24th March, 1955, in connection with the matter.  Then we come to the 11th May, 1955.  Some six or seven months had passed; we were well into the middle of 1955 and had made no arrangements whatever about our capital requirements.</P>
    <P>On that date the city manager wrote to the Committee of Finance of the Dublin Corporation and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 15th March, 1955, I informed you that the sum of £6,500,000 would be required to finance the following capital <Col N="892" /> items....  I pointed out that the corporation was carrying on its full capital programme on the assumption that the necessary money would be forthcoming at once.  The corporation also has commitments under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts committing them to a further sum in addition to the £6,500,000 mentioned beforehand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were proceeding to do our work in the normal way in which we had been doing it year after year for a number of preceding years.</P>
    <P>The city manager continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Following this meeting, I sent the following letter to the Department of Local Government&mdash;&lsquo;I have to refer to previous correspondence on the subject of the corporation&rsquo;s capital requirements for the year beginning 1st January, 1955.  I informed you on the 25th October last that an estimated £6,500,000 was required to finance capital expenditure for the 12 months from that date.  The Finances and General Purposes Committee of the corporation directed that invitations be sent to insurance companies asking if they would be prepared to make large sums available to the corporation by way of mortgage loan or otherwise. No satisfactory replies have been received.  The only offer was one of £50,000 at 5 per cent. for 25 years. The committee rejected this offer. The committee have directed me to point out that the corporation is carrying out its capital programme on the clear understanding that Government support will be forthcoming as in the past.  The estimated capital requirements for 1955, 1956 and 1957 are £6,500,000 per annum.  Accordingly, they are anxious to have an assurance that the necessary finances will be forthcoming.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were told from public platforms, we were told in this House, that the corporation had made a mess of the situation and that they were responsible for the situation.  The Minister himself, in meeting deputations, and particularly deputations from contractors <Col N="893" /> who were engaged in the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acts, told them that this position had resulted from mismanagement by the Dublin Corporation.  Is it not about time that the Minister came down to earth and admitted that the plain simple fact of the situation is that it is the difficulty of the Government finding the capital moneys that has put us into this position and that there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion that we have not approached our responsibilities in a proper and sensible manner?</P>
    <P>Time went on.  We were committed, having signed contracts.  This was in May and the corporation election took place.  On the eve of the corporation election, it was obvious we might have a change of members as a result of the election.  It was also known to us that our then city manager was retiring, that the new corporation, after the June election, would appear with new members and possibly a new city manager and there was no finality, as far as this situation was concerned.</P>
    <P>I myself then got in contact with the Local Government Department to find out what was the position.  At the beginning of the year, we had been authorised to borrow, by way of overdraft from our bankers, a sum of money up to half our capital requirements. The bank accorded us overdraft facilities up to a figure of £3,000,000.  There was, of course, the undertaking that, within the year, the corporation would fund that debt. They would issue either a loan or get the money from the Government to pay off this bankers' debt and, at the same time, have sufficient money to carry on for the balance of the year.</P>
    <P>What was the position?  I was told &mdash;and I reported accordingly to the finance committee and the city manager&mdash;that the position was not at all as easy as we thought.  There were a number of public loans to be issued. There was the E.S.B. who were going for £10,000,000; C.I.E. were looking for £5,000,000; Cork Corporation were seeking £1,500,000; the Government itself was going for £20,000,000, and then the corporation would come out of its position at the end of the queue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> What was the decision then?  The Department of Local Government issued sanction to the Dublin Corporation to increase its overdraft from £3,000,000 to £6,000,000, to carry it on until the end of December and extend the period of repayment of the first £3,000,000 from June also until December. Sanction was accordingly issued to do those two things, but the Minister for Local Government seems to think that, once he issues sanction, his responsibility ends.  He has said several times: Have I not given sanction? But the bankers did not agree. They said: We cannot give you £6,000,000 by way of overdraft since no arrangement has been made about when you are going to repay us. Neither are we going to allow you to extend your existing overdraft much beyond the agreed date.  In fact, you will have to pay us back the present £3,000,000 by October.</P>
    <P>The situation then became what one might describe as effervescent.  The bubbles began to. burst, and, by November, we had reached the position where we were not allowed to go beyond the figure of £3,800,000 by way of overdraft.  We had no indication of where money was coming from.  The bankers wanted their £3,800,000 back. The contractors wanted the money from us to pay them for the work they were doing and there was then a sudden decision to issue a rushed loan in December.</P>
    <P>By this time, our total requirement was the £6,500,000, plus money to give out on loan under the Small Dwellings Acts.  We indicated we wanted £8,000,000, but were only allowed to go for £6,000,000.  It is true that, in the £6,000,000, there was included an item for small dwellings amounting to £1,900,000 and this figure was kicked round like a football.  The Minister said: But you got £1,900,000 for small dwellings.  What are you worrying about?  The Minister did not seem to be able to get it into his head that this was money which was already practically spent, except for £300,000, and was part of the overdraft that we got from the bank and which we had to pay back.  I do not know if at the moment the Minister knows the position as clearly as he should know it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> I spoke about November, and now I want to draw the Minister's attention to another thing.  In the month of November, when we found ourselves in this jam&mdash;it was not very sweet jam&mdash; it meant meeting after meeting over and above the normal meetings we had.  It meant all kinds of approaches to the Department and the Minister. The corporation decided that, until this money problem was solved, it would be unwise to allow people to make commitments with contractors for the purchase of houses under these small dwellings loans, because each person who made such a contract paid a deposit in the belief that he was undertaking a commitment on the basis of the rate of interest ruling at that time.</P>
    <P>I was certain that the money situation was so changing that, apart from its restricted availability, the price of it would be dearer.  I proposed a resolution which the corporation carried, to the effect that the Dublin Corporation should put an advertisement in the papers stating frankly that we had not money to make these loans at the moment and that the people who were seeking such houses should not make any further commitments until the situation had clarified itself and that we were not receiving applications.</P>
    <P>Here is something which, I think, indicates the lightheartedness with which the Minister for Local Government approached the matter.  The city manager wrote a letter to the Department of Local Government and referred to the meeting of the city council on the Tuesday night prior to the writing of this letter.  He again gave them all the details and facts about the position in relation to money commitments and so on, but there was this paragraph in the letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is, therefore, proposed by advertisement in the public Press to give notice that the corporation is not in a position at present to deal with further applications under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and any applications received will be returned with the application fee.  It is further proposed to return the <Col N="896" /> applications received since November 21st.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the manager puts this final short paragraph in his letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before taking this serious step, I thought it better to inform you, so that the Minister may have prior notice of the position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What do you think was the Minister's answer to that, Sir?  Here we had a serious situation with a serious step contemplated and the manager reports to us, the corporation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Immediately after the receipt of that letter, the Department phoned and asked that action on the lines indicated be deferred until the Minister for Local Government, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, had a further opportunity of considering the position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister says to us: &ldquo;Do not do that yet.  We are having another look at the position.&rdquo; Now behind the scenes, they take full responsibility for the position, because, if the Government had no responsibility for the making available of these moneys, they would have said: &ldquo;It is none of our business.  If you cannot carry on your business, I suppose that is what you will have to do.&rdquo; But the implication there was: &ldquo;Do not do that yet, boys.  We may still be able to solve this after another consultation.&rdquo;  And we were precluded from putting this advertisement in the paper.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  Great numbers of people continued entering into commitments with contractors for loans under the Small Dwellings Acts. They paid deposits and, to-day, the position is that many of these people have forfeited their deposits.  Many more are living in the houses they intended to buy under caretakers' agreements, until such time as the situation is altered.  Now we wanted to save that situation.  Many people did not know that, when this consultation took place and when the Minister agreed, as a result&mdash;and this is admitted now&mdash; to my proposition that £1,000,000 might be made available as a stop-gap, strings would be attached and the <Col N="897" /> people who had previously qualified outside of what is called the supplementary grant class would be excluded; and they are not yet catered for.  The screening, as it was called, of the applications to the Dublin Corporation for payments out of this £1,000,000 reduced the number of applicants because those who were outside the supplementary grant class were excluded.  Now, the £1,000,000 was going very fast and it was pointed out that, by the end of May or the end of June, we would be back again to where we were last November: the available moneys would be exhausted, and what were we to do then?  That is the position now, but there is yet another problem with which I shall deal at greater length later on.</P>
    <P>We have the rate of interest change. People who, with a certain limited income, entered into commitments to buy houses, believing they would cost them so much per week or per month, now find that their payments in many cases have gone up by as much as 12/- and 14/- per week.  I do not know whether there will be a frank admission by the Minister that that situation has developed, not because of mismanagement, bungling or a lack of appreciation on the part of the corporation, but because of circumstances quite beyond their control.</P>
    <P>We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy O'Donovan, making very sharp debating points, refusing to get down to a proper realisation of the facts and trying to make out all the time: &ldquo;You made a mess of it,&rdquo; trying to put the blame on other people's shoulders, so that people would think that the Government were the innocent party in this matter.  All the Parliamentary Secretary's interjections are reported here and, when he reads them in relation to what I am putting on record, I hope he will see that the matter is not as he would have people believe it to be.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed this matter, the Minister said: &ldquo;I told you to apply to money institutions.&rdquo;  That was his advice. May I tell the Minister that every year the same procedure is adopted?  Every time we write to Local Government saying we want so many millions, the <Col N="898" /> Minister of the day always sends back a note asking: &ldquo;Would you find out whether there is any money available in insurance companies and suchlike institutions and then, when you get some of the money, we will see what we can do for you about the rest?&rdquo; But the Minister interjected in the debate as if that approach was his particular invention.  In connection with the present situation, we have written to 74 different institutions. I have a list here of insurance companies of all kinds, building societies, trade unions, lending agencies, Church bodies, big institutions and big businesses.  We wrote all 74 a letter asking: &ldquo;Have you any money to lend on mortgage to the Dublin Corporation?&rdquo;  We got replies from four.</P>
    <P>The Irish Assurance Corporation, to which we referred on May 8th, gave us £500,000.  The Minister said they gave us that £500,000 because of his intervention and his persuasion, but he forgot that, before his intervention and persuasion entered into it, we had been given £1,000,000 last year, without any persuasion or intervention on his part. We got an offer of £250,000 from another insurance company at 6 per cent., having borrowed the previous week £500,000 at 5½ per cent.  That offer of £250,000 has not yet been accepted.  It has not been rejected and it is now for the Minister to advise us as to whether or not we should accept that money at that rate.  We have another letter here from the Taoiseach referring to £3,000,000 which I shall deal with later.  We got an offer from a trade union of £10,000 and an offer from another trade union of £1,000. That was the total reaction to our 74 letters.</P>
    <P>Our present position is, therefore, that we have an assurance from the Government that they will give us the balance of £3,000,000 that we cannot raise ourselves.  The £1,000,000 for the small dwellings is separate.  We have received £500,000 of that and we are to receive the other £500,000 in mid-August, but we have to look for £3,000,000 in order to ensure that the rate of building will be the same this year as it was last year.</P>
    <P>The letter which the Lord Mayor received from the Taoiseach has the <Col N="899" /> most extraordinary phrases and so forth, but the pertinent part is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is expected that the corporation will use their best endeavours to raise the balance of £3,000,000 from appropriate lending agencies, subject to the consent of the Minister for Local Government to the terms.  It is accepted that a special issue of stock by the corporation would not be practicable in present circumstances.  If, however, the corporation should not be able to raise independently the full £3,000,000, the Government will come to their aid and make good the deficiency by advances from public funds.  This undertaking is being given despite the current shortage of capital in consideration of the onerous obligations of the Dublin Corporation and the desire of the Government on social grounds to continue to devote a higher proportion of national resources to meeting essential housing needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not told when we are going to get the balance of that £3,000,000.  We are told: &ldquo;Look for it and, whatever you get, we will give you the balance.&rdquo; We have now exhausted every available source, and if we are allowed to accept this £250,000, to which I referred, at the 6 per cent. rate of interest, we will have secured £750,000, but we will be still short £2,250,000. Where are we to get it?  We need it now; we are now going into overdraft again in the bank.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister to make a note for the Minister so that, when the Minister comes back from the place where I should be to-day with him, he will make sure to answer that and tell us when we are going to get this money and, further, at what rate of interest it will be provided to us or on what instalments.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's letter was interpreted on the last occasion he spoke here, by both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, and the Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;But have we not given you £3,000,000?  That is on record.&rdquo; What I want to get clear here is this: there seems to be a complete misunderstanding <Col N="900" /> about the definition or interpretation of certain words.  Are we to take it that a promise to give is, in fact, performance?  Are we to take it that sanction is performance&mdash; sanction for us to get it somewhere&mdash; because we have not been given the money yet?  We have been given a promise.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here to which I want to refer also.  At the time when our situation became so critical, we felt it would be more prudent for the corporation not to sign contracts until they knew where the money was coming from to pay the people with whom the contract had been signed; and we passed a resolution&mdash;one which was discussed with the deputation from the corporation that was received by the Minister&mdash;that in the future, side by side with sanction for new housing schemes, there would have to be an indication from the Government that the money would be made available. We were not going to sign new contracts without knowing that we would be able to meet the obligations.  In pursuance of the resolution and in pursuance of that indication to the Government, we sent along a number of tenders we had received for schemes, asking for sanction and drawing attention to the money side of it.</P>
    <P>A new development has now taken place.  We got back this letter on the 10th May, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to your letter of the 8th March, 1956, enclosing tenders for the erection of 40 houses at the Coolock and Raheny housing scheme and to state that no objection will be raised to the proposed acceptance of tenders and payment to the contractor&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>whose name I do not want to mention</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;of £52,950.  With regard to the financing of the scheme, I am to add that, on receipt of the corporation's proposal for borrowing the necessary capital, the Minister will sanction the borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not bringing things to a farce? The Minister knows that since last November we have been screaming for money, pointing out the non-availability <Col N="901" /> of it and the impossibility of our getting our full requirements by borrowing from the bank or otherwise.  In the middle of all this, and when the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, has written us a letter, saying that they are now recognising the shortage of capital situation, recognising the needs of the corporation for housing schemes and that they must come to its aid and provide whatever money the corporation cannot borrow, we get this letter, written by grown-up men to other grown-up men, saying: &ldquo;The Minister will sanction it&mdash;go out and borrow it.&rdquo;  Will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government tell us where we are to get it?  I understand that we have written back saying we purpose to borrow it from the Local Loans Fund.  Where else can we borrow it?</P>
    <P>With regard to this promise of money from the Government, we discussed last week what we are to do; and the city manager will be negotiating with the banks for some accommodation, beginning at the end of June.  We are not letting it go to have it come on us the day it happens.  We are trying to make provision in advance and yet we will be told that, because we see the writing on the wall, and because we see these dangers, and try to provide against them in advance, we are committing sabotage.  We have sanction from the Minister for Local Government to borrow £2,000,000 from the bank, but may I point out that practically every local authority in Ireland to-day is not being granted overdraft accommodation?</P>
    <P>The Limerick Corporation only recently sought what to us in Dublin is chicken feed, £49,000.  The bank would not give that money and they had to go to an insurance company for it.  It was not available from the Local Loans Fund either.  The Wicklow County Council has since last February been waiting for an answer to a letter in which they informed the Government that for their small dwelling loan operations they wanted £50,000.  They have not even had the courtesy of a reply, and what are they doing?  They intend to put an advertisement in the paper to the effect that applicants <Col N="902" /> should not make commitments because they feel, and rightly so, that if they allow applicants to go along in the dark, those applicants might find themselves losing their deposits or faced with the taking of a loan at a rate of interest much beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>Is it not nonsense to write a letter of this kind?  We want from the Government, for every scheme they sanction which is over and above our £3,000,000 commitment, a clear undertaking that once we sign this contract with their sanction the money will be made available, whatever way the Government gives it to us, either by advising us to go for a stock issue and underwriting it, or through the Local Loans Fund or any other way they like.  It is ridiculous to have a document of this kind passing at this stage because we cannot sign this contract now since we have no means of implementing the last paragraph&mdash;go out and borrow the money.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the Department's officials have been directed to seek out every possible way of slowing down small dwelling loans.  We received recently a circular, which I suppose every other local authority received, telling us that the giving of a loan under the Small Dwellings Aquisition Acts where the borrower had guarantors must cease.  That is illegal now.  What does that mean?  Every local authority tries to operate this scheme with a certain amount of humanity.  A young man comes along who is going to be married.  He is in a good class of employment and is perhaps half a crown a week short in the required income according to the scales laid down.  In the past, local authorities&mdash;we in Dublin did it in any event&mdash;knowing that this man would in the following year, or shortly after he had completed his application, be in excess of this small minimum, said: &ldquo;You do not quite qualify but we will give you the loan provided you produce guarantors.&rdquo;  Now we will have to say to that young man: &ldquo;You are half a crown a week short of the required amount. Postpone your wedding, postpone everything, for six months or a year and come back again when you have that extra half a crown a week.&rdquo;  That <Col N="903" /> is deliberately done for the purpose of slowing down operations.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Local Loans Fund has been very important in this part of the world anyway.  I had a list made covering a few years of our operations and to show the Dáil the extent of this activity and the repercussions there must be, since this situation arose, on employment and on the livelihoods of people engaged in this business, it is necessary to put these figures before the House.  From 1949 to 1953&mdash;that is a good number of years&mdash;the Dublin Corporation advanced 1,073 loans, the amount being £1,747,000 and the average loan being £1,629.  In the year 1953-54, that is in one year only, the number of loans granted in Dublin was 1,456, amounting to £2,229,000, the average purchase price having now gone down to £1,500. That is a very substantial operation, to say that in one year there were accorded 1,456 loans to persons who are buying their own houses.  In 1954-55 the figure was 1,120 loans, involving £1,714,000, and in 1955-56 there were 1,170 loans involving £1,790,000.</P>
    <P>I want to point out as a member of a local authority&mdash;and I am sure it applies to all other members of the House who are members of local authorities&mdash;that it is a very good thing to see so many people buying their own houses.  From the local authority point of view it is very important because no maintenance charge arises on the local authority when the individual owns his own house, and the aiding of such citizens automatically assists the rates.  We must end slumdom in Dublin.  We must build sufficient houses to meet the needs of those people who are qualified to be housed under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  The latest census in Dublin in connection with the needs of families with only three children shows that we still need another 10,000 houses.  That does not include the newly-weds or the persons with one or two children.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say that to allow this very useful method of having houses <Col N="904" /> made available to people to decline and go out of existence is a very grave deed.  In fact, in my opinion, it would be a disaster.  These people who buy their own houses are useful citizens. They pay the full rate of interest.  It does not cost the Government or the local authority anything by way of subsidies on interest charges.  It does not cost the local authority anything for maintenance.  There is no necessity for compulsory acquisition by the local authority of ground on which to build the houses.  That is all done in the ordinary run of business.</P>
    <P>Now this whole system is to be discarded and endangered.  In to-day's morning papers we see a statement issued by the Minister for Local Government following a conference over which he presided between him, the local authorities and the building societies.  One would think that the problem for small dwelling loans for those over and above the supplementary class has been solved.  I said yesterday to some person who showed me this statement: &ldquo;What is your reaction to that?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;This is a case now of not saying to somebody: &lsquo;You hold the baby now&rsquo;.  This is the case of saying: &lsquo;Would you give the pram a bit of a shove?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what it means.  First of all, I know that the building societies have not sufficient capital nor are they able to get sufficient money to deal with this problem in the manner in which it should be dealt with or in the manner in which the local authorities could deal with it.  Secondly, small dwelling loans were a protection to the borrower against unreasonable interest charges, and there is nothing in this statement issued by the Minister to indicate what rate of interest will be charged, if and when any transactions are completed between the building societies and these borrowers.</P>
    <P>I made it my business within the last few hours to inquire what rate of interest will be charged by these building societies.  I was informed it was 7 per cent.  This is one of the things where the Government are trying to swim away from their responsibilities in connection with small <Col N="905" /> dwelling loans.  In 1948 the late Deputy Murphy, the then Minister for Local Government, came into this House and improved, from his point of view, the facilities for borrowers for getting these loans by reducing the deposit which they had to pay up to that date. His idea&mdash;and the House agreed unanimously with him&mdash;was that the time had been reached when borrowers of this kind should not only be encouraged but helped.  Now what is this new business going to do?  It envisages legislation being passed through the House enabling local authorities to give guarantees to lending bodies.  Up to the present, building societies, which might be private bodies, lent 75 per cent. to 80 per cent. on the valuation and not on the cost of the house.  Now the suggestion is that they shall lend 95 per cent.  The difference between 80 per cent. and 95 per cent. will be made up through a guarantee which will be shared in three ways.  Two-thirds of it will be borne by the local authority and one-third by the lending body and the two-thirds will be divided 50-50 between the Government and the local authority.</P>
    <P>That looks very nice, but it does not say that the lending society will now lend 95 per cent. of the cost, which was the arrangement under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Is this margin now to be much bigger?  Are the local authorities to agree that the lending societies may fix their own valuations on the houses and then say: &ldquo;We will give you the balance under this guarantee&rdquo;?  Or is the position going to be that the whole thing will collapse because, if they do estimate the loan on their own valuation of the house, the borrower will now be getting away from the 5 per cent. of the total cost.  He will be allowed only the 5 per cent. of the valuation fixed by the building society and the difference between the valuation and the actual cost of the house will have to be found in some other way.</P>
    <P>In addition, I understand there are requirements to be met by the Minister for Finance in connection with the income-tax side of these lending societies.  The matter is not clear and will not be clarified for some considerable time.  In my opinion, it is not <Col N="906" /> fair to let it be thought by intending borrowers that the matter is being solved and clarified.  It is getting more bemuddled, befuddled and bedevilled. I subscribe to the view that it is necessary for the Government to retain its responsibility for the provision of the necessary capital moneys for persons who are qualified under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  I think it it wrong to throw these people out into the arena or the jungle of competition to get money from different societies. It will mean that these people cannot pay the rates of interest that may be asked.</P>
    <P>I have here a table showing how the payments will be affected by increases in the rates of interest.  If one takes two types of house, the £1,200 house and the £1,800 house, every 1 per cent. that the rate of interest is increased means an increase of £12 per year on the former.  There is nothing mysterious about that calculation.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government might wish to have it appear so but even a national schoolboy knows that 1 per cent. on £1,200 is £12 per year.  If the house is an £1,800 one, the interest at 1 per cent. is £18 a year and if the rate of interest has, as it has, advanced from the previous 4½ per cent. or 5 per cent. to 7 per cent., it is 2 per cent. extra and on the £1,200 house it will obviously mean a repayment commitment increased by £24 per year, 10/- per week. If the house is an £1,800 one, the increase is £36 a year.</P>
    <P>I think we would be doing grievous harm to the type of person who seeks this assistance by asking him to have that amount of money sunk in interest charges.  We will be doing the country damage from every other point of view as well.  I am not being questioned at the moment or criticised on what I have said.  I think something must be done by the combined local authorities to force the Government back to the situation that existed in 1932 and that existed in 1948 when everybody realised that the housing of our working classes, in view of the situation that confronted us, was an emergency that was deserving of priority treatment, that was deserving of the greatest <Col N="907" /> financial assistance from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We must get back to that and we must not confuse people, and by that confusion prevent them from realising that we are getting away from the responsibility. I want to say that I see through these manoeuvres but it will be very sad for the people who suffer and who cannot see through them.  The whole idea now is to get away from the idea of speedy rehousing&mdash;slow it down; adopt every measure possible and suggest every possible means to take it away from our doorstep.  That is what is happening and I hope the people will realise that.</P>
    <P>I have been talking at some length and in some detail about the position of the small dwelling loans.  We know that, taking into account those who qualify for the supplementary grant and those who are above that level up to the other maximum for qualifying without a supplementary grant it will mean that for a number of years, the rate of building these houses should be in excess of 1,000 a year in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The methods adopted at the present moment have not only slowed down, but have in many cases entirely stopped building, and in this year, 1956, I do not know how many houses will be constructed, but it will certainly be a lot less than 1,000.  That may be one of the Parliamentary Secretary's methods of curing the need for capital money.  If you cannot get it, find a way of not needing it, and if you do not need it&mdash;very well, the position is not so bad.  But that is not meeting the situation as we understand it and as we understood it all these years.  Every member of every political Party in every local authority in the past co-operated in dealing with this matter of housing, but to-day they are at one another's throats.  We have representatives of one political Party now trying to blame the members of another political Party because of this situation.</P>
    <P>Now we come to ordinary housing. It is very interesting to follow the development when we did not have many problems.  In the year 1949-50, the Dublin Corporation constructed <Col N="908" /> 1,245 ordinary houses and 254 flats and reconditioned 75 other houses, a total of 1,574, the expenditure being £3,030,000.  In 1950-51, we had a total of 2,601 houses, at a cost of £3,317,000; and in 1951-52, a total of 1,982 at a cost of £3,054,000, and in 1952-53 a total of 2,209 at a cost of £2,976,000.  Then we come along to 1953-54, when the number was 1,353 at a cost of £3,182,000.  In 1954-55, the number was 1,937, at a cost of £2,847,000; and in 1956-57, 1,339 at a cost of £2,701,000.  Now, the corporation building programme, which has been in progress since the beginning of this month, concerns the erection of 2,098 dwellings and this work is being carried out and provides employment for 1,941 men.  These men are employed by direct labour and indirectly by two contractors in the building of our housing schemes.  If, as I anticipate, it is the intention of the Government to treat the building of ordinary houses as they have treated the small dwellings, there will be a considerable slowing down.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the House that we cannot build, stop and then build again, as you would deal with a pack of cards.  One deals them out, plays a game, adjourns for tea, and then goes back to the cards, and the pack of cards remains on the table.  In housing, there is a constant situation: we must envisage first of all the minimum number of dwellings we want to construct, not this year or next year but for many years ahead.  In order to do that, we have to acquire, in the first instance, the ground on which to build the houses.  That may sometimes take a considerable period of time. First of all, we have to indicate to the Department of Local Government that we propose to take these or those fields, or this or that ground, or that we propose to acquire compulsorily a certain block of derelict houses, and when sanction has been got&mdash;it may sometimes be necessary to hold a public inquiry&mdash;it may, in the long run, mean that from the time we first put our fingers on a particular site, two years will have elapsed before we own it.</P>
    <P>Then we have to develop it.  We have to develop a site, provide roads, <Col N="909" /> sewerage and so forth, and all the plans for these must again be submitted to the Department of Local Government for approval and sanction. Having done that tenders are invited for the type of houses or dwellings or flats which it is proposed to build, again subject to sanction, and from A to Z, when all stages have been gone through, a house that is occupied to-day may have been conceived in a scheme seven or six years ago.</P>
    <P>It is imperative, therefore, that local authorities should be made aware of this position.  They should be told frankly that if the Government fears it cannot carry this baby any longer, or cannot push the pram at the same pace&mdash;very well, reduce the building, and let them take responsibility for it, or alternatively, let them say: &ldquo;We have not changed our approach to the building programme, and you should go ahead as you have been doing previously.&rdquo; The Minister for Finance told the deputation which called on him that a survey was to be completed before the Government could be expected to give any indication of a long-term nature such as I have suggested. Surely a survey is not necessary in the City of Dublin, where we know that we need another 10,000 houses immediately?  It was pointed out to us that the survey included also availability of capital moneys.  Therefore, it is quite clear to me that we will be faced very soon with a series of manoeuvrings and manipulations which will result only in a slowing down of housing and a deliberate attempt by the Government to blame the local authority for it.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be accepted, in this debate, that the housing of our people is endangered and has been affected by a situation that is not the responsibility of local authorities.  The Minister or the spokesmen for the Government should indicate the true position. If their difficulty is inability to inspire sufficient confidence in the public to give them all the money they need for their programme, they should say so. I believe there is a lack of confidence. I know that there are people who feel that this Government is no longer worthy of the support they previously gave it.  That applies to a great extent <Col N="910" /> to people who would underwrite loans. If that is the position, let the Government spokesmen say that, instead of making matters worse by trying to undermine the confidence of the people in their local representatives.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, on 8th May, I said, at column 166, Volume 157, No. 1 of the Dáil Debates, in reply to an interjection by the Parliamentary Secretary, whom I must compliment on his silence to-day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Parliamentary Secretary will not put me off... We have been told by the Taoiseach in the form of a long letter that we may go and borrow up to £3,000,000 from anybody who is prepared to give us money and that, if we cannot get the full amount, the Government will make up the deficit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's interjection at that stage is worthy of repetition:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Was the Deputy surprised at the letter?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He was flabbergasted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Parliamentary Secretary, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What happened the speech the Deputy had prepared?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was surprised and I was flabbergasted, because the letter does not bear the interpretation that has been put on it by the Parliamentary Secretary and by the Minister for Local Government. I do not know whether or not they still think it, but they certainly thought on May 8th that we had got the money or, alternatively, if we had not got the money, that we could go to the bank and discount this promise.</P>
    <P>On that occasion, I pointed out that the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation were still looking for their £200,000, that County Dublin was looking for £1,250,000.  When I said that the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation still had not got the money which they had applied for last November, the Minister for Local Government, ably supported by the Parliamentary Secretary, said that <Col N="911" /> they got it that morning.  Again I was flabbergasted, because I knew, that afternoon, that they had not got it. What did they get that morning?  A body that previously got all its money from the Local Loans Fund received that morning a letter sanctioning their borrowing.  In the opinion of the representatives of the Government in the Dáil, that night, that was the granting of the necessary money.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation will be accused of mismanagement or whether it will be suggested that they did not apply in time.  I do not know what the excuse will be in that regard, but the fact is that this situation is general and the Government must do something about it, other than pretend to the public that everything is all right, that these fellows must be put in order first of all, that they do not know how to manage their affairs and that the Government are the men who will teach them how to manage their financial business.</P>
    <P>Up to last year, the capital requirements of every local authority were met in one of two ways, either through local loans advances, or, in the case of Cork Corporation and Dublin Corporation, by sanction to issue their own stock, which was always underwritten by the Government and the banks, or by the Government itself, if necessary.</P>
    <P>That is a situation to which we must get back.  It is some years since I said in this House that it was ridiculous to have local authorities competing in a limited arena for money.  Obviously, the Government, when borrowing money, should be able to get it at a cheaper rate than the rate at which a local authority can borrow.  Nevertheless, a situation was allowed to develop to the extent that, not only are the Government and some local authorities competing in the market for money, but there are additional undertakings, all competing with one another for the money that is available and paying a higher rate of interest for it.  Has the time not been reached when the Government should be the sole borrowing authority and should give out of <Col N="912" /> its borrowings the requirements of other borrowers?</P>
    <P>I have put down a parliamentary question which will be answered to-day.  I cannot anticipate the answer.  What is happening to-day? The vocational education body in Dublin want money to build three vocational schools.  They have been told to borrow it.  Where?  They are competing with us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, but I am afraid it is very difficult to separate the Minister for Local Government from the Government.  This whole situation is the result of a new approach. The Dublin Corporation used to give the vocational education body capital moneys for the building of schools.  Presumably with the acquiescence of the Minister for Local Government, that position was changed recently, to the extent that the local authority is relieved of that responsibility and the vocational education body must borrow in the open market. The net result is that, if the local authority are looking for money, as directed and recommended, they must stand in a line, as if at an auction, and bid for whatever is available and try to secure it by offering a little more than the next fellow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must come back again to the letter from the Taoiseach.  I do not know whether or not I will be challenged to read it.  I have read an extract from it.  It is a public document.  It may be suggested that my reference to it is not a fair interpretation, but I will read the whole letter, if challenged. I have it here.  He says that the £3,000,000 which is to be made available in the way suggested in the letter <Col N="913" /> is to be used exclusively for ordinary housing.  What is the position with regard to other capital requirements? We are in the position now that we require £189,000 for a variety of capital expenses including compensation under our town planning, street widening, acquisition of sites for building, and so forth.  The £189,000 does not qualify to be taken from this £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>We sat down on Tuesday and tried to make up our minds what we would do&mdash;whether we would write to the Government to ask them to permit us to take this £189,000 from the £3,000,000 or whether we would ask them to increase the £3,000,000 to £3,189,000.  We do not know yet.  If we take it out of the £3,000,000 we shall be reducing our expenditure on ordinary housing and that will not be so good.  What are we to do?  Has the time not been reached when the Government should say, if their policy now is to put the brakes on in the expenditure of money by local authorities for a variety of capital requirements including housing: &ldquo;Do not spend more than so much money&rdquo;?  If that is not the case, find it and make it available and let us go along at the same speed as we have been going in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will deal with the matter when concluding this debate or not but I think he is the only person competent to deal with it, and I should like him, in respect of housing generally, to be categorical in his indication to the local authorities at large as spokesman for the Government.  I want him to say whether or not there will be any alteration in the speed to meet the housing requirements.  How long will it be, if that is so?  If he cannot give an answer to that before the survey suggested by the Minister for Finance has been concluded, is he satisfied now as a result of the efforts he has made to try to solve with outside bodies small dwellings loan transactions that we must come back again to their being carried on by local authorities?  What steps is he going to take to see that rates of interest charged to such borrowers will be under some form of control or some form of agreement?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> To what extent is a local authority &mdash;take Dublin Corporation as an example&mdash;able to develop its town-planning commitments?  This House passed the town planning legislation. It gave the local authority the option of adopting it.  It was adopted by a certain number of local authorities including Dublin Corporation.  It has taken a considerable time to get a picture as to how best alterations should be made in the city in connection with what one calls a modern town plan.  The war intervened.  It stopped any possible development in this matter resulting, as the House knows, in Dublin Corporation being brought to court and ordered to complete its plan by a certain date.</P>
    <P>This is where the problem now commences. The moment we adopt a plan we are responsible for a large amount of compensation.  How does that arise? If we say we are going to widen a particular street or that we are going to straighten a particular street, we have to interfere with private property and, whether we deal with it immediately or not, we are liable for compensation forthwith.  Where are we to get this compensation money from?  Are we to be told again: &ldquo;We will sanction this: you go ahead and borrow it&rdquo;? Nobody can say at this moment what the ultimate cost will be.</P>
    <P>I want to confess that the town plan we are rushing through is not the town plan one would like to have developed. However, if the general plan one would have liked to develop had been accepted, in time&mdash;provided we had sufficient time to sit on it&mdash;it might have involved us in annual payments of some millions of pounds for a number of years.  Our plan now is designed to be completed in, I think, five eight-year periods&mdash;40 years&mdash;in order to have the impact and the capital cost as light as possible on the public. However, whether it is £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 or whether it is unknown millions, the position is that we shall become liable and if we cannot find the money to meet our liabilities we shall find ourselves ousted and I do not know what the next step would be.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the Minister that he might now consider bringing in some legislation either to <Col N="915" /> postpone the date for our having to have this plan completed&mdash;which will put off the problem of compensation arising from an accepted plan, an adopted plan&mdash;or to have some conference with the local authority concerned with a view to seeing to what extent he can aid and advise them or at least bring in legislation to alter the present situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The matter is very urgent to everybody concerned. I did not say the Minister should introduce legislation.  However, he should have a conference and then if, resulting from that conference, he has to introduce legislation, I am sure he will get the support of the House.</P>
      <P>I was pleased about one thing, anyway. That is that the Minister indicated in his statement that he was satisfied that there was no over-expenditure or waste in the administration of local authorities, and that the cost of administration had not risen unduly in comparison with other forms of administration or business expenditure.  I am glad he said that, because it is a confession by him that his previous utterances were ill-founded. From the way in which the Minister previously spoke, one would have imagined that there was complete chaos and waste.  What is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in rates result from certain decisions&mdash;either decisions of the local authority itself or decisions of the Government.  Since the introduction of the conciliation and arbitration between the Civil Service and the Government, it has become the practice that, where civil servants secure an increase in salary, officials of local authorities benefit to the same extent, based on their occupations.  On the last three occasions, the rates of the officials' salaries have increased to the extent to which they have increased in the Civil Service, and they have brought about an increase in the rates. That is something for which the local authorities cannot be blamed.  That is <Col N="916" /> The accepted practice.  Similarly, the wage earners, the ordinary workers, who are not salaried officials, have their wages increased to bring them up to increases given by outside employers.</P>
    <P>On top of that, Governments introduce legislation&mdash;it does not matter which Governments&mdash;which imposes on local authorities extra commitments, as the Health Act has done.  I am not going to suggest legislation, but I suggest that the time has come when the Minister for Local Government ought to examine all the activities of the local authorities.  The time has come, in my opinion, when a local authority should be left with purely local authority operations.  The health scheme, the health services, and the social services have become too widespread to be operated as they are at present by all these local authorities bordering on each other.  Regional bodies should be set up to take from local authorities certain items which are not statutory obligations on the shoulders of local authorities and in connection with which they have no say whatever.  It is all laid down in the Custom House.  These services have to be paid for from the rates. They should be taken away from the local authority and made a matter of a national charge, with an arranged contribution from the local authority for the services rendered.</P>

      <P>Recently the Dublin Corporation decided that persons who had applied, up to November, for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, who were qualified, and whose applications were held up because there was no money, should be entitled to get their money at the then existing rate of 5 per cent.  The city manager, in accordance with his powers, had the right to refuse because the difference between 5 per cent. and the new rate would have meant a charge on the rates.  However, that decision of the city manager could be revoked by invoking Section 4.  We found, however, that you can invoke Section 4 three times a day, and before breakfast, dinner and tea, and it does not make any difference because the Minister himself rejected what the local authority had decided to do under Section 4.</P>
      <P>On 13th December last, the city council, at a special meeting, considered a motion in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" />&ldquo;(1)  To fix the rate of interest to be charged to all applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts who have already been notified by the corporation that their applications have provisionally been approved at 5 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  To fix the rate of interest to be charged to all applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts whose applications were received on or before Monday, November 21st, 1955, and who are subsequently passed for loans at 5 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  To fix the rate of interest to be charged to all applicants for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts whose applications are received on or after November 22nd, 1955, provisionally at 5½ per cent. per annum in so far as money is or has been provided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;and when I was concerned with this discussion I felt&mdash;that, because of a certain situation which had developed, the Government should hold themselves responsible for making good the loss to a local authority for carrying out this arrangement under this motion or, alternatively, for providing the money by way of grant, because it was unfair to hold up the applicants, as they were held up, when charges were at a certain rate when they made their commitments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, when discussing that matter in the House on an earlier occasion, tried to make out that he was precluded from sanctioning any such arrangement by a local authority because of a circular issued by his predecessor.  I think he was the most amazed man to discover that the circular issued by his predecessor had been issued before his predecessor met a similar situation with fairness and equity to the persons concerned and that that was done subsequent to the issue of the circular. This is the kind of thing we get.  We are told: &ldquo;My predecessor did this or my predecessor was the cause of that.&rdquo; The country is destroyed because our predecessors did so and so.  All that can be altered if the present occupants of the benches opposite think it is wrong <Col N="919" /> and want to amend the situation.  They are not bound by everything their predecessors did.</P>
    <P>The position was that the Minister refused to sanction that transaction and the Minister continually says that matters of this kind are in the hands of the local representatives.  I do not know whether we need some kind of a conference to discuss the meaning of sections of that amending legislation, because constantly we have local authorities disagreeing with one another on the interpretation of certain sections, particularly where operations jointly concerning neighbouring local authorities are concerned.</P>
    <P>We were accused in our time of a very vicious approach to local government by having extended the managerial Acts.  They were first introduced in the days of Cumann na nGaedheal, admittedly on an experimental basis.  They were extended afterwards under the Fianna Fáil Government again, subject to a review as a result of experience.  It seems to be that the managerial system has come to stay, but what I am more concerned about is that there seems to be a complete contempt for the representatives of local authorities and for their decisions.  There is a certain disregard for their knowledge and appreciation of what is going on around about them and what they know is necessary for the development of the area in which they are serving.</P>
    <P>I want to see the Minister for Local Government change his attitude. I am sure we will have more trouble as a result of the policy of the Minister for Local Government in connection with housing.  I mentioned on another occasion in this House that, as far as I could estimate, the employment content of all housing activities in the City of Dublin was some 15,000 people, skilled, unskilled, directly and indirectly employed.  I am reliably informed that over half of those have now ceased to be employed and the bulk of them have emigrated.  I am told that if this position is allowed to develop much further, we will have further unemployment, with the result that, if and when another Government <Col N="920" /> takes over the responsibility of maintaining the proper tempo of housing in the country, manpower will not be available.</P>
    <P>It is not so long since the inter-Party Government issued statements and publicised by way of advertisement a come-back-home campaign to build up Ireland.  It is not long since they were screaming to the ends of the earth for all the Irish emigrants to come back, that there would be a shortage of manpower for all the building projects that were to be gone on with.</P>
    <P>There is no talk about that now.  The trains are running full the other way now.  If there is not something done very soon, the position may be beyond cure.  Does the Minister not realise that the shutting down of housing, particularly in connection with individual house building under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, is affecting every other form of industry? Has he not been informed that the builders' providers, furniture manufacturers and those firms engaged in the production of articles which normally go into new households are on halftime, if they are not altogether closing down?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not realise that the position is more than serious?  We talk about stopping the adverse trade balance.  We talk about controlling people in regard to the buying of luxuries.  Nobody can tell me that the young man who commits himself for a period of from 25 to 35 years in buying his own home is engaged in lavish and luxurious expenditure.  Nobody will tell me that getting a house for oneself and one's family is a luxury. Nobody can make that charge.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of misrepresentation about the situation, misrepresentation by Government spokesmen.  I do not suppose that my annoyance, if I express it, will carry much weight, but I met representatives of trade unions and representatives of builders' associations who told me they had come from a conference with the Minister and the Minister had told them the Government was not to blame and that it was purely the corporation that must be blamed; when we explained <Col N="921" /> our position, they came to the conclusion naturally that somebody was not telling the truth.  I am now satisfied that everybody knows that the truth was not being told to the people by the Government, that there was a deliberate attempt to mislead and, as I said before, to confuse them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government has expressed himself several times on this.  I hope when he gets up here he will deal with the following questions.  First of all, on the availability of money, how does the Government propose to raise and provide it?  How will he assure the House that this problem, which has arisen since 1955 and is continuing right up to the present day, will be solved?  I imagine that what he will do is get up and start debating.  The Parliamentary Secretary said here the other day that I had made a particular speech&mdash;and the Minister for Finance made the same statement&mdash;which was a misstatement of fact.  I challenge him to provide me with the material of that speech.  I went down to the local authority offices and I asked there for information as to the speeches I had made.  I discovered that there may be a confusion between me and somebody else.  I was accused of sabotaging the corporation loan.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us who sabotaged the national loan.  It was a failure, but I was not accused of that. It was a complete failure.  Unlike corporation loans, which have never been successful, that was the first time a Government loan was not a success.</P>
    <P>Let me relate that now to the position which confronts us.  If the Government had got all the money they wanted when they looked for that loan, there would to-day be money in the Local Loans Fund to meet the requirements of local authorities and there would be no need to meet a situation such as the Dublin Corporation is confronted with at the moment. Its success would also have proved, if Deputies wanted to make it appear that way, that Government credit was far better and far higher than that of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with the matter in that way. <Col N="922" /> I hope he will give us some information upon which we may build our future operations.  I want to point out to him, however, that the money that has been promised to the Dublin Corporation in the Taoiseach's letter will be barely sufficient to meet existing commitments for the balance of this year.  I want to know will the Government now say that, if we sign any more contracts for the building of houses in the next 12 months, the necessary money will be made available to us.  Have we got a letter saying that the Government will give us £3,000,000 next year for housing?  What are we to do about the rest of our capital requirements?  Our requirements are very varied.</P>
    <P>In the middle of this housing crisis, the Minister for Local Government journeyed to Paris.  I think he went for the purpose of seeing housing schemes and sewerage schemes in France.  I would have preferred if he had gone there to find out how they finance their housing schemes and their sewerage schemes.  Perhaps he could have come back here then and given us a talk on that.  But we have heard nothing, despite the fact that he went in the middle of the crisis and it was in the middle of the crisis that the Taoiseach wrote and said that the Minister for Local Government was away and he would, therefore, deal with the matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have received from the city manager a request that representatives of the Dublin Corporation would be afforded an opportunity of discussing the finances of the capital housing programme of the corporation. The Government having considered the question in the normal way, the Minister for Local Government would have conveyed to you the views of the Government. As he is absent, however, I am writing to you so that you may know the position at the earliest possible moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the time to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>Our housing capital requirements under the two heads are only one aspect of our problem.  We require <Col N="923" /> capital for the completion of our sewers and main drainage, particularly our North Dublin drainage.  We give supplementary grants to certain applicants under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  In fact, we are limited to them entirely now and our requirements for those in the year 1954 amounted to £150,000.  We need capital in connection with our street widening and our town planning.  We need capital to keep our fire brigade up to a proper standard.  We require new conveniences for the cleansing department. We require capital for special works and we require capital for expenditure under a variety of other heads.  These are merely the ones in the list that was submitted.</P>
    <P>What will happen about these?  I think we are entitled to ask the Government to tell us whether or not we are to shut down on all forms of capital expenditure, until such time as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government has been able to devise a new approach to our economic problems. He has the responsibility of telling the House now how this will be done, if it is to be done at all.  It would, perhaps, be a fair question for the Parliamentary Secretary to ask me: Where would you get the money? How would you go about it?  But we are not asked that.  If we go over there, we probably will be asked it and we will face up to answering it then. This is the Parliamentary Secretary who promised so many things during his election campaign and during discussions afterwards, but not one of those promises has been implemented.</P>
    <P>The one that I remember best is, of course, the one upon which we had a debate together, when he was going to reduce the price of spirits and beer so that consumption would go up and we would then have &ldquo;oodles&rdquo; of money to spare for all our capital requirements. Of course, that has not happened at all.  I suppose human beings have a certain capacity even to consume liquor, but the price was not reduced, and I should now like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House where we are heading, and what is the position.  Are we realistic in talking as <Col N="924" /> we are talking?  Has the time come when we have to trim our sails according to a new wind, or are we going to have a blow, blow all the time from those spokesmen over there with no indication whether it is a north-west, a south-west or what kind of wind it is?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech referred to a figure of £37,000,000, being the capital requirements for this 1956-57 period.  I take it that in that £37,000,000 is included £10,000,000 for the E.S.B.?  They will be going for it very soon.  I take it it includes £5,000,000 for the C.I.E.  They will be going for it soon.  That is £15,000,000 off your £37,000,000.  Does it include the £7,000,000 which the Tánaiste, thumping the table, told the Turf Development Board that, no matter what happened, they were going to get?  If it does&mdash;and it includes short-term loans for repayment by the State&mdash;how much is going to be left for the normal capital development requirements of the Government and local authorities?</P>
    <P>This is the kind of statement we want to hear from a person who is assumed to be responsible and who occupies a responsible position.  We do not want to hear cross-road election discussions on this; we want to hear factual statements.  The situation has long gone past the stage for seeking political advantages.  It is a very real situation.  Sometimes some persons do not mix with the people and do not come in contact with these problems. There are others of us who are up to our necks, day and night, in the problems of the people as they are affected by the inactivity of the present Government in these matters. We must get some complete picture and I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to be serious to-day.  He is in this House two years now and I have never heard him give the House a serious talk in connection with matters that are affected by the financial situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, as he is sitting in for this debate, to tell me and to tell the House whether he appreciates the economic situation which confronts us, whether he knows to what extent money can become available to the State, for capital purposes, particularly with reference to the development of housing?  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us seriously his appreciation of the situation and what he thinks should be done?  I want him to state quite frankly if we are faced with a situation of a certain type.  Will he admit that there is a great scarcity of capital money and, that being so, that we have to make certain changes, for the time being anyway?  If it is not so, why all this unnecessary fiddling, bungling and public abuse of people who are in no way responsible whatever for a situation which has developed?</P>
      <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to deal in a realistic way with this. Does he know anything about this survey?  Has it commenced?  Is there to be an interim report?  Is it to be a survey that may take years before the findings are made known to us, nothing being done in all the intervening period?  If he has knowledge of this survey, and I am sure that he must have, will he tell us to what extent this survey is specifically concerned with housing and housing finance?  This is what I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will deal with.  I am convinced that he will try and make reference to statements made by certain people, but I am challenging him to come down to earth and deal with a matter of importance and urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority in Dublin has communicated with the Minister and with the Department of Local Government and has pointed out that our estimated capital requirements for the next few years will be in the neighbourhood of £6,000,000 to £6,500,000 per year, all in.  Has there been any examination of the situation so that an indication can be given to the local authority concerned as to what it may expect to be allowed to spend?  If it <Col N="926" /> is not conceivable that that amount of money will be available per year for the next few years, what items are to be cut out and what items are to be cut down?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary answer these questions, or will they be left in the air like Mohammed's coffin&mdash;between Heaven and earth with nobody knowing whether it is going up or coming down?</P>
    <P>These questions must be answered. No local authority can make provision for future development of the city if it is not in a position to know how it is to meet consequential payments arising from certain operations at a particular moment.  If you demolish slum tenement property you must rebuild in its place.  It is no use acquiring such slum property to knock it down for the purpose of building flats, if we are not told now that the money will be available to complete the job. These are the things we want to know. We have in the City of Dublin cleared away a great many of these slums.  We have vacant sites for the use of which we could begin to make plans in some way, provided we knew that the capital sums to do the job would be available when needed.</P>
    <P>We are now getting these stupid letters, and when we ask for sanction to build 46 houses we are told: &ldquo;You can, if you can borrow the money.&rdquo; That is no way to meet the situation. The time has come when there has to be a serious approach.  A lot of people think that this Government is trying to bluff its way through a situation which the Government hopes will clear itself, because they have no measures at their finger tips to deal with it.  The situation is deteriorating.  People engaged in the industry of building are being wiped out.  They are being destroyed during this waiting time.  Skilled people, experienced in this particular trade and work, people whom it took years to train, are being lost to the nation.  Nobody knows any more what to do about property.  Unless we are told specifically: &ldquo;Carry out your normal programme; money will be available&rdquo;, how can we take over possession of sites or prevent others from taking them over?  The whole machinery of local government is being <Col N="927" /> destroyed, in so far as local authorities are concerned, through all this inactivity and this lack of frankness</P>
    <P>I have spoken at great length on certain aspects of local government and I am pleading that in the course of the debate we will be told what we are to do about the position.  When the Minister for Local Government consults his colleagues behind closed doors, they do know what the situation is and they say: &ldquo;You must get out of this difficulty&rdquo; and the difficulty is overcome by some bluff statement blaming somebody else.  It is too late in the day now to say: &ldquo;Your corporation is wrong; they did not apply to us soon enough.&rdquo;  I have put on record the fact that our requirements for this year of 1956-57 and our requirements for 1955-56 were notified in writing to the Department of Local Government on 25th October, 1954, and up to the present they have been unable to deal completely with last year's requirements and to no extent at all with the present year's requirements.</P>
    <P>I want the meaning of the Taoiseach's letter to the Lord Mayor made clear.  When will we get this money we cannot borrow?  Will we be pushed through the farce again of going to the banks and being turned down, notwithstanding a Government guarantee for our borrowing?  If there is no satisfactory answer to that question, local authorities will have to precipitate a situation by closing down on these things and not create headaches for themselves and other people.  The Corporation of Dublin will be again in overdraft by the end of June.  It will have no money for small dwelling loans after that month.</P>
    <P>We do not know whether we will get accommodation from the banks or not, whether they will have it to give to us. We are not blaming the banks because they have been very reasonable with us in the past.  This is purely the Government's responsibility.  I hear rumblings by people who say that, if the money is not made available, we will nationalise the banks or we will take over a bank or take over the Central Bank.  What I am concerned <Col N="928" /> about is the situation that confronts us.  At the end of June, we will need money.  Will it be made available or will we be kept again on a gridiron, as we have been kept since the beginning of 1955?</P>
    <P>We have been carrying on with all forms of negotiations and conferences and now there is a new development. The Minister and the Government should have a sensible appreciation of the situation, which they do not seem to have, or, if they have, they are pretending not to know what the situation is.  I have put some categorical questions. I do not know whether they have been noted or not, but I can assure the Minister that he will not find it so easy to get all the different groups of the corporation to follow the line that has been taken up to the present.  I am convinced that members of the Dublin Corporation who support the Government will soon have to make it clear, in disgust, that the problems that have been created have not been created by the members of the corporation or the management of the corporation, but by lack of candour on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government knew about this situation, as I did, last November. They knew about it in June, 1955, and even earlier than that in 1955.  Every local authority and the Government had been notified by the bankers that the availability of capital was lessening. It did not come suddenly on anybody. That is why the Dublin Corporation has become a sore on the back of the Government because, having realised and appreciated the situation and wanting to avoid what has taken place, we took every step possible in an endeavour to get reason and action from the Government.  However, we failed.</P>
    <P>As I said, this little propaganda statement that is being issued by the Minister for Local Government about the possibility of all the money required being found for small dwellings under this new arrangement with these building societies is all nonsense.  In the first instance, these building societies have not got sufficient money to do the job that must be done by a Government.</P>

I said earlier, and I do not wish to repeat myself, that the whole method was improved upon in 1948, in order that more people could avail of such loans.  Now there is no money available.  There is the supplementary class and the non-supplementary class.  The supplementary class is being dealt with up to a certain limit but no provision is being made for them and by no stretch of the imagination can Deputy Collins tell me that building societies will advance money to the supplementary class even with a guarantee <Col N="931" /> for the difference between what they previously gave&mdash;somewhere around 80 per cent.&mdash;and the 95 per cent. given by the local authority.  The societies are being consulted and discussions are taking place mainly in relation to the non-supplementary class.  Even that class will not benefit to the extent to which they previously did.  I know that the Government are plainly trying to escape their responsibilities in connection with them.</P>

I <Col N="932" /> gave a list here of Dublin Corporation's money requirements during five periods and showed that every Government except this one honoured their obligations and responsibilities in making money available to the corporation for capital requirements.  I proved what I told the Minister as a member of the deputation&mdash;that of the £26,000,000 the corporation required and received, only £6,000,000 had to be provided by the public.  The rest was provided through the instrumentality of the Governments who recognised their commitments and responsibilities. The Minister talks about distortion.

In my opinion, it was typical <Col N="934" /> of Deputy Briscoe, and it reminded me of what he did when he was chairman of the Finance Committee of Dublin Corporation, when they sat for seven hours considering rate estimates and other figures and then did not reduce them by one penny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe referred to me time and time again during his speech and I never once <Col N="935" /> interrupted, and I am not going to stand for any interruptions from Deputy Briscoe to-day.  What was the nature of Deputy Briscoe's speech to-day? I took down a number of phrases from it: &ldquo;The time when our situation became so critical.&rdquo;&ldquo;We see the writing on the wall.&rdquo;&ldquo;Deliberate attempts to mislead.&rdquo;&ldquo;We cannot sign this contract now.&rdquo;&ldquo;In the middle of this housing crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;The whole machinery of local government is being destroyed.&rdquo;  When Deputy Briscoe was relevant on the Estimate, he raised two points: first of all, that the Dublin Corporation had been kept waiting in the queue before they were allowed to float the stock issue; secondly, that the amount of the issue should have been about £8,500,000, and not £6,000,000.  As regards the first point, there is no justification for the statement that the Dublin Corporation was kept waiting in the queue for money.</P>
      <P>Since June, 1951, which is less than five years ago, the corporation has been helped to float no less than four separate stock issues.  They were floated in 1951, 1953, 1954, and 1955. In October, 1954, four months after the £5,000,000 issue of June, 1954, Dublin Corporation wrote to the Minister for Local Government pointing out that the proceeds of the stock issue would be exhausted by the end of December, 1954, and that the corporation would need to make arrangements for the provision of £6,500,000 for capital expenditure during the year 1955.  In December, 1954, the corporation passed a resolution asking for sanction for the borrowing by way of temporary overdraft of a sum of £3,000,000 at a rate of 4¼ per cent. to cover the period up to 30th June, 1955. That request was sanctioned, on 4th January, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, 1955, shortly after the new city council came into office, they considered a report from the city manager on the financial position.  This report was dated 5th July, 1955, and it listed a number of capital works of the corporation and stated that the sum which would be required to finance those <Col N="936" /> capital works was £6,500,000.  The report then went on to say that, from the particulars then available, a sum of £6,000,000 would be required up to 31st December, 1955.  The council accordingly applied for sanction to the extension of the borrowing limit to £6,000,000 for the period up to the end of that year.  The meeting was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 12th July, 1955, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dublin Corporation last night agreed to sanction an increase in overdraft from £3,000,000 to £6,000,000.  It was stated at the meeting that the interest rate would be 4¼ per cent. and that the money was required for housing and allied needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report then went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Captain P. Cowan said that every councillor knew, or should know, as it was no secret, that the Government would soon be floating a substantial loan, but the Minister for Finance had not given the green light to it yet.  It was cheaper for the council to get the money by overdraft from the banks than to raise it by way of loan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report in relation to Deputy Briscoe said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Briscoe said that there was almost unanimity everywhere in all Parties and by all Governments, on the housing problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, that was before Deputy Briscoe thought housing in Dublin was a suitable subject for a malignant political campaign.</P>
    <P>This point that it was cheaper for the corporation to obtain money by overdraft rather than by stock issue was again made in November, 1955, by a deputation which the Minister for Local Government received, consisting of the Lord Mayor, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Captain Cowan, and the city manager and other officials.  That deputation emphasised that the corporation was not unduly perturbed about the present situation, if the banks were willing to extend overdraft facilities.  If there was a queue for financial accommodation, it was a most orderly <Col N="937" /> queue.  The corporation was not pushing and it was a short queue.  The interval that the corporation had to wait between stock issues was June, 1954, to December, 1955.  Between these dates, the following stock issues were floated: £20,000,000 National Loan in October, 1954; £4,500,000 by C.I.E. in April, 1955; £10,000,000 by the E.S.B. in October, 1955; and a £1,550,000 loan by the Cork Corporation in November, 1955.  We all know that it is a sound financial principle that there should be intervals on the market between each particular stock issue.  The rest given to the Dublin Corporation's stock issues from June, 1954, to December, 1955, was not a very long one.</P>
    <P>The second point made by Deputy Briscoe, that the amount of the issue should have been £8,500,000 and not £6,000,000, I repudiate absolutely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Lord Mayor agree with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £6,500,000 as being required for 1955 was mentioned in October, 1954.  In July, 1955, the estimate of the amount required up to December, 1955, was £6,000,000.  This figure, although lower by £500,000 than the original £6,500,000, was again too high, because when the deputation went to the Minister on 7th November, 1955, they explained that their overdraft on capital account at that time was £3.7 million and that the estimated expenditure from then until 31st March, 1956, was £2.4 million.  This gave a total of approximately £6.1 million.  The Deputation explained to the Minister that the purpose of their visit was to get the Minister's support in obtaining funds to liquidate the overdraft and to cover expenditure up to 31st March, 1956.  A £6,000,000 stock issue was floated, with Government support, in December, 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question?  I think he read there that at one stage £6,000,000 was required up to the end of December, but the fact that the next date is March will explain the <Col N="938" /> £2,000,000, if the Parliamentary Secretary reads it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not try to draw that red herring across. It is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Read it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The money lasted a great deal longer than the Deputy is pretending.  That is just the point, that the money did last up to 31st March, 1956.  In other words, it lasted three months longer than the money the Deputy was pretending they wanted up to 31st December.  That that issue was ample, to cover not alone the calender year, as was originally requested by the corporation, but the period up to 31st March, 1956, is evident from the fact that, in the first week of April, 1956, the capital account of the corporation was in credit to the extent of approximately £285,000.  That is so much for the part of Deputy Briscoe's speech that was relevant to the capital requirements of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with a number of other matters he raised.  First of all, he says that the corporation were not told when the Government would give them the balance of the £3,000,000 which they cannot get elsewhere.  To-day, he invited us to enter into all kinds of hypothetical cases and to define our attitude in circumstances that have not arisen at all.  He has been disappointed time after time to find the Government intervening to take the Dublin Corporation out of its difficulties and now his mind is intent on inventing new difficulties, in the hope that they will be such that the Government will find it hard to surmount them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe wants to see, in every sanction to a housing tender, a guarantee to the corporation as to where it will get its money.  That is a demand that the position that has obtained for 30 years should be reversed, the position being that the corporation borrows retrospectively only.  The phrase, &ldquo;The Minister will sanction&rdquo; holds together with the statement of the Taoiseach in his letter of 16th April, which I will come <Col N="939" /> to in a moment, that the Government will supply the balance of the money. Deputy Briscoe is so anxious to raise difficulties and to pretend that there are difficulties that he referred to the Department of Local Government circular, saying that guarantors were not legal, as being a difficulty.  First of all, that statement was based on legal advice which the Department of Local Government obtained and the effect of it is to make the issue of loans easier and to require only a mortgage on the house as the sole security.  That is the kind of rubbish we have listened to here from Deputy Briscoe for two and threequarter hours to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe worked up the case from the time he made a reasonable statement in the middle of 1955.  He thought these were suitable waters in which to fish and he so worked himself up that he attempted, I understand, to persuade the Leader of the Opposition that the Government would not come to the assistance of the Dublin Corporation.  I understand that, so keen was he, that he induced the Leader of the Opposition to depart from the habits of a lifetime and to make a bet of 2/6 with Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Briscoe betting that the Government would not come to the assistance of the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>This matter came to a head on Monday, 16th April, 1956.  I cannot help admiring the manner in which Deputy Briscoe, having met his Waterloo on that day, has continued to flog this very dead horse ever since.  On that day, working up trouble outside, Deputy Briscoe and his colleagues in the Dublin Corporation had, I understand, 40 builders in the gallery of the City Hall at the meeting.

I have given C.I.E. a general direction, namely, that, as far as is economically possible, they should manufacture here in their works anything they require for running the railway and, so far, I have had no evidence adduced to me which would indicate that C.I.E. have departed from that policy.</P>

    <P>In reply to the supplementary question put by Deputy MacBride on Question No. 4, may I say that all the imports of diesel stock for 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956 were ordered before June, 1954, and that substantially all the imports of coach and wagon components for 1953, 1954 and 1955 were ordered prior to June, 1954?  I have been informed that carriage and wagon construction work is proceeding at Inchicore to a greater extent than ever before, that nothing is being imported now which was ever made here and that the carriage and wagon underframes of the type being imported were never made at Inchicore and could not be made there.</P>
    <P>I have been informed as well that the welding of underframes before importation represents a value of £10.  Work <Col N="946" /> to the value of £100 per frame is performed on the imported welded frame. Any attempt to perform the welding of the frames would impede the performance of the additional work and would result in a net loss of employment. Steel wagon body panels are heavy pressings which could not be economically manufactured in Ireland and they are imported in the &ldquo;black&rdquo; and galvanised in Ireland.  Cast steel bogie frames could not be made in Ireland. They represent an important technical advance in coach construction.  Coach buffers in cast steel could not be made in Ireland, but wagon buffers which have a cast iron body are made at Inchicore and are not imported.  Some were imported for a very short period. Wheels and axles are imported now in the same condition as that in which they were always imported and undergo further operations in Inchicore. I think that this information will probably assist Deputies in getting a new evaluation of the situation.</P>

      <P>On 4th January last the housing authority requested my sanction to an alteration in the method of assessment of family income for the purposes of its differential rents scheme by allowing a deduction from income of 5/- per week in respect of each child under 16 years of age after the second in a household.  It was stated at the same time that the <Col N="957" /> matter of amendments to the rents scheme would again come up for consideration when the corporation's estimates for 1956-57 were being considered, in view of the fact that the effect of the proposal would be to reduce the corporation's rental income by £6,000 a year.  Further examination of the proposals made in January was accordingly deferred in my Department pending receipt of information as to the corporation's further views on the matter following the review referred to.  No further information has so far been received.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare ceased in August, 1954, to be liable for the cost of physiotherapy treatment provided for insured persons, when in pursuance of the provisions of the Health Act, 1953, and of the special interim arrangements made under the Health Act, 1954, services for such persons became the responsibility of health authorities.  When Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, was brought into operation in full on 31st March, 1956, insured persons and their dependents became eligible for a wide range of institutional and specialist services but physiotherapy services do not come within the scope of the specialist services available under the Act for out-patients, and the Dublin Corporation are consequently not at present in a position to assume responsibility in this matter.  I am examining the question of physiotherapy services, and I hope to come <Col N="962" /> to an early arrangement which will resolve any difficulties experienced by the Dublin Rheumatism Clinic.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe said that a proposal was put forward in December, 1955, by the Dublin Corporation to the Department of Local Government that loans should be given at the old rate of interest to those who had applied for Small Dwellings Acts loans up to November, and that that proposal had been rejected by the Minister.  That statement is not true.  It is not true, not because of any opinion of mine as against that of Deputy Briscoe, but because&mdash;and this is a very simple reason&mdash;the Minister's sanction is not required at all for the fixing of a rate of interest to borrowers.  That is why it is not true.  The Minister does not have to sanction any such rate.  As the House will see in a moment, when I read the Taoiseach's letter, a sum of £1,000,000 was approved by the Government and half of it has already been issued.

      <P>There is this difference between Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation: Cork Corporation got their last loan filled and, as the Minister says, they are to be congratulated on the manner in which they carry out their financial business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe asked about the survey.  The survey to which he referred was that mentioned by the Minister for Finance to the corporation representatives at a conference in February last.  The Minister for Finance told them at that time that the capital position generally was being reviewed and that the review would be completed in advance of the Budget. It was arising out of that survey that the Taoiseach wrote to the Lord Mayor on 16th April and, anybody who wants to know what the position is in relation to the matter, can find out by reading the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I come now to the most important matter raised by Deputy Briscoe, namely, the meaning of the Taoiseach's letter of 16th April, 1956.  I would like to read this letter for the House and place it on the records:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My dear Lord Mayor,</P>
      <P>I have received from the city manager a request that representatives of the Dublin Corporation would be afforded an opportunity of discussing the finances of the capital housing programme of the corporation. The Government have been considering the question and in the normal way the Minister for Local Government would convey to you the views of the Government. As he is absent, however, I am writing to you so that you may know the position at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the interviews which you and members of the city council had with the Ministers for Finance and Local Government in February, as a result of which £1,000,000 was allocated exceptionally to Dublin Corporation from the Local Loans <Col N="965" /> Fund for Small Dwellings Acts advances, careful consideration has been given to your representations about the corporation's capital position in general.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might at this stage make the comment that that was the first occasion, to my knowledge, on which moneys were made available from the Local Loans Fund to the Corporation of Dublin&mdash;the first occasion&mdash;and nothing Deputy Briscoe may say can alter that position.  It is a fact.  The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As was indicated at those meetings the Minister for Finance wished to have estimates of the capital requirements of the State, local authorities, the E.S.B., C.I.E., etc., before assessing the extent to which these requirements could be met and consulting the Government as to the arrangements that might be approved in individual cases.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the most sympathetic consideration has been given to the capital needs of Dublin Corporation for housing, both for slum clearance and for house-purchase loans under the Small Dwellings Acts.  I am glad, therefore, to be able to inform you that the Minister for Local Government, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, will approve of total borrowing by Dublin Corporation in the current financial year of £4,000,000. Taking into account the balances available from the last stock issue&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;mark you, balances available from the issue of £6,000,000 which Deputy Briscoe said was not sufficient for the purposes of the corporation up to the end of December, but there were still balances at 16th April of this year&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;this will provide for housing under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts on the scale of last year's actual expenditure: for requirements for Small Dwellings Act advances, applications for these being screened by reference to the circumstances of the applicants and the availability of house purchase finance from commercial sources; and for work on the North Dublin main drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>Of the £4,000,000, £1,000,000 is <Col N="966" /> being advanced from the Local Loans Fund for Small Dwellings Acts advances, as already mentioned.  It is expected that the corporation will use their best endeavours to raise the balance of £3,000,000 from appropriate lending agencies, subject to the consent of the Minister for Local Government to the terms.  It is accepted that a public issue of stock by the corporation would not be practicable in present circumstances. If, however, the corporation should not be able to raise independently the full £3,000,000, the Government will come to their aid and make good the deficiency by advances from public funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is the most important sentence in that letter and I shall come back to it for a moment later on.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This undertaking is being given, despite the current shortage of capital, in consideration of the onerous obligations of Dublin Corporation and the desire of the Government, on social grounds, of continuing to devote a high proportion of national resources to meeting essential housing needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could any words be more specific? Has an official letter ever being issued the meaning of which is clearer?  What the Government has done is something no other Government has done before. They have taken the Corporation of Dublin into the Local Loans Fund. That is the effect of that letter, and then Deputy Briscoe comes along and pretends &ldquo;we have not got the money&rdquo;.  He speaks disparagingly of letters of this kind, and by innuendo and insinuation he has suggested time and again that the Government gave no real promise or no real guarantee. I do not know what he expects to gain by this kind of tactics.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on his objection when Deputy Seán Collins interrupted him and said his language was &ldquo;the language of sabotage&rdquo;.  Deputy Briscoe objected very strongly&mdash;I do not blame him for that&mdash;but I took down carefully one sentence which he used late in his long speech.  He had already been speaking two-and-a-half hours and perhaps he might be forgiven, but this, Sir, is the sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" />&ldquo;The best thing would be for local authorities to precipitate a situation by closing down now.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that the language of sabotage? What is the meaning of it, if it is not?</P>

      <P>During the course of his speech Deputy Briscoe referred to many things which I think were not really relevant.  Might I have permission to reply to one of them?  It was a statement&mdash;just as untrue as many of the other statements made&mdash;in which he announced that the recent failure of the Government loan was the first time that a Government loan was not a success here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe was a member of the House in 1934 when Deputy MacEntee issued his first loan, and personally I believe that the failure of that loan in 1934 and the effect it had on Deputy MacEntee then as Minister for Finance was responsible for the rate of interest he paid in 1952 for the huge loan he raised at that time.</P>

      <P>There may have been.  I am not disagreeing with the Deputy, but the Deputy is disagreeing with his colleague now.  Deputy Briscoe said it was the first time a Government loan was not a success.  I am just answering that.  Deputy Smith may be right; I am not going to take issue on it at all.

      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for giving me permission to answer these points.  Deputy Briscoe made other points not relevant at all, but I want to deal with one specific thing.  It has been suggested, for example, that certain Small Dwellings Act cases are not yet catered for.  I understand that the total amount of money required&mdash;again speaking from recollection&mdash;to cater for these cases was £160,000, and Deputy Briscoe made a statement about some additional oddments totalling £189,000. Whether I know anything about finance or not is a matter of opinion, but at least I know something about estimates. I spent a long time working in the Department of Finance and I know everything about estimating and about how expenditure works out when you make estimates.  I have been informed that the gross expenditure of the Corporation of Dublin for this year is estimated at £11,400,000, of which about 48 per cent. will come from the rates.</P>
      <P>Is anybody going to tell me that you could not get £160,000 out of £11,400,000?  If he does, he either knows nothing about the subject or he is a knave or a fool.  It is contemptible to say that you could not get out of a sum of £11,400,000 a sum of £160,000. It is disreputable and it is unworthy of the consideration of any reasonable, decent person.  If the Corporation of Dublin are incapable of getting £160,000 out of £11,500,000, the best thing they could do is to fold up their tents and give up their job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. D. Larkin Mr. D. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the fact that, if there is excess available in one year, it must go to the credit of the ratepayers in the following year.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not suggesting that the corporation should take £160,000 from the moneys raised for other purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that, if any group of persons are spending £11,500,000 a year, they should be able to find approximately £200,000 somewhere in that £11,500,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows from long experience of working on estimates and working on expenditure that there is no difficulty whatever, with goodwill and effort on the part of the people concerned.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Briscoe was chairman of the Finance Committee in 1953 they sat for seven hours and, after that seven hours, they took not 1d. off the estimates put up by the city manager. Is anybody going to tell me that the officials of the Dublin Corporation are so precise and so accurate that the whole Dublin Corporation, with Deputy Briscoe at their head, could not find 1d. to take off in that year after they had sat for seven hours?  I think really that it is asking us to believe the unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall end by giving Deputy Briscoe a piece of good advice.  Of course, he will not act on it.  The best thing he could do would be to pay the Leader of the Opposition the 2/6 that he bet him.  I admire the Leader of the Opposition for breaking the rule of a lifetime and making that bet of 2/6, and if I were the Leader of the Opposition I would make it, too.  The best thing Deputy Briscoe could do is to pay the Leader of the Opposition the <Col N="970" /> 2/6 and never mention the subject of Dublin housing anywhere ever again.</P>

      <P>The Minister has asked me what the bet was for.  Deputy Briscoe bet the Leader of the Opposition that no Government in this country would let Dublin housing fall down through lack of making money available.  It shows to what a pitch Deputy Briscoe had worked himself on this political canard.  Deputy Briscoe said in this House on one occasion that his purpose on this was to bring down the Government, but he will want to play a better card than that to bring down this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening here for the past three or four hours, one would imagine that the housing problem existed only in Dublin.  No matter what Deputy Briscoe has said and no matter in what way he is replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary, I have no doubt about the genuine interest that each member of the House, and particularly those who are members of local authorities in Cork or Dublin, has in the solution of the housing problem and the financial difficulties&mdash;I will not say crisis&mdash;that have arisen in Cork, as well as in Dublin.  While appreciating the genuine interest of everybody in the problem and the genuine desire on the part of the Minister, and the members of the respective local authorities to solve it, I have no real fear that the present difficulties will not be overcome, both in Cork and Dublin, if for no other reason, to come down very much to earth, than that no Government can afford the political unpopularity that a housing crisis would bring in its wake.  Therefore, while not viewing the problem with any degree of complacency, I am not, at the same time, very much alarmed that the difficulties now being encountered will not be overcome to the satisfaction of everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the difficulties that have arisen, and apart from the realisation that there is still an acute problem, both in Cork and Dublin, throughout <Col N="971" /> many parts of the country, the housing programmes under different local authorities either have been completed or are within reasonable distance of being completed.  Unfortunately, however, in Cork, for which I can speak, I cannot see any reasonable conclusion before the next seven to ten years.  I suppose it will always be a recurrent problem and it is one for which I think the local authority more than the Department of Local Government must bear responsibility.</P>
    <P>If a local authority were prudent enough to order its finances properly and, more important still, to secure sufficient land on which to build and to avail of its resources in manpower and in building materials at the proper time, I doubt if such an acute problem as has arisen in Cork would arise.  At all events, the difficulty has arisen in Cork that there have been some dismissals from the direct labour building schemes.  Whether they are all due to financial difficulties or not, I do not know, but I do know that there have been very many more men laid off in the recent past than have been taken on in a similar category of labour. Some investigation is taking place into that aspect of the matter at present.</P>
    <P>On housing generally, I believe that the requirements of the Department with regard to specifications are too ambitious, where very acute housing problems exist.  The density of houses to the acre is too high in areas such as Cork, where, once the land easy of development has all been taken up, the density qualification on the more difficult building sites should not be as severe as it now is.  In the old days, when local authorities built houses, they built terrace-type houses and they could put 12 or 14, where now only two or three are permitted.  At all times, let us advance with regard to public health and hygiene, but I do not see any reason why good land should not be taken over and used for all types of houses.  There is a demand all over the country and particularly in the city for a cheaper type of house. Possibly the minimum it now costs to build a dwelling for a family is about £1,600.  I suggest houses of a cheaper <Col N="972" /> type would be welcomed by many of the people who are now looking for houses of the terrace type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am trying to persuade the Cork Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister's interjection, I should like to point out that the members of the Cork Corporation have been trying to prevail on the Department not to be so strict in their specifications as to density, or as to the type of houses permitted.  We have in Cork many old types of terraced dwellings and there is still room for many more of these.  We have not been given permission to erect these houses, even though there is a demand for them from the people and a genuine desire on the part of the corporation to erect them. Therefore, I do not think the Minister is quite right in trying to suggest that the Department will give Cork Corporation <i>carte blanche</i> to erect any type of houses they like.  If more small terrace-type houses were erected, it would facilitate the solution of the housing problem as it exists in Cork. I will not dwell any longer on that problem, because everybody knows how serious it is, with over 3,000 families waiting for houses and the list increasing all the time, as newly-weds come along.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to another aspect of housing in relation to a question I addressed to the Minister yesterday and which I also addressed to him six months ago, that is, the proper completion of roads, sidewalks and other amenities in housing estates and in parks in the Cork suburban areas.  The local authority, in this case the Cork County Council, slipped up to a large extent in permitting these houses to be erected without any specifications as to the laying of roads and footpaths and the provision of public lighting. There are all around Cork city, within the county council's administrative area, housing estates and parks built privately, the road surfaces and footpath surfaces of which are in a shocking condition.  Many of these estates have been built for upwards of ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> To a certain extent, the blame could possibly be laid on the individuals who built the houses or who had the houses built for them, in not having provided in their contracts for the proper completion of the road surfaces. Unfortunately, many of those people were young newly-married people or people contemplating marriage and it would be difficult to expect they would think of making provision for such things in their contracts.  The position is that many of these park houses and estates have been built for ten years and the road surfaces are still covered with pot holes.  Added to that is the fact that no public lighting has been provided, so that these places are a positive danger to life and limb in the winter time.</P>
    <P>This would seem to be entirely a matter in which the local authority should assume responsibility for putting these roads in proper condition. However, they seem to adopt the attitude of saying to the builder or to the owner of the land on which the houses are built that they will assume that responsibility only when the roads have been put into a state of repair as suggested in their specification.  In many of these cases, builders are &ldquo;spec.&rdquo; builders and in some cases they have now disappeared from the scene, with the result that the owners of the houses have no redress, other than through the local authority.</P>
    <P>For the very obvious reason of finance, the local authority will not undertake the proper completion of these roads, with the result that these people have been paying rates for many years&mdash;many of them have gone past the seven year remission period &mdash;for services they do not get.  They get no public lighting, no proper roads and no sidewalks.  The only service they do get is water and possibly the emptying of refuse bins.  These people are living in shocking conditions and I know many of them, living in parks and estates, who are afraid in winter time to go out at night because they could not find their way home over unlit, badly constructed roads.  I urge the Minister to take the matter in hands.</P>
    <P>The remedy may not be in the interests <Col N="974" /> of the people who occupy the houses, inasmuch as they may have to pay something to have these roads properly surfaced.  However, the fact remains they are paying high rates and getting no commensurate services. In many cases, county council housing schemes adjoin these parks and estates.  Before the tenants go into the local authority schemes, they are provided with beautiful concrete roads and sidewalks, while the people who pay a good share of the cost, not alone of the houses but of the roads and sidewalks as well, are denied these amenities.</P>
    <P>It is no encouragement to such people to have to live in such conditions. Steps have now been taken by the Cork Corporation, as the town planning authority for the entire area, to ensure that no builder will get away with that kind of activity, by pulling a fast one on the unfortunate people who put up their money, by loan or otherwise, to have houses built.  From now on, the builders or the ground landlords will have to make roads up to a certain standard to enable the local authority to maintain them.</P>
    <P>I believe I am in order here in referring to road traffic regulations.  The remarks I intend making concern the lighting of vehicles on public roads.  I think the Minister for Local Government has power to prescribe that certain dimming devices be put on cars and to ensure that they be maintained in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they found that the rates of interest had increased.  I was dealing with the same situation when my colleague, Deputy Smith, was Minister for Local Government.  I attended a number of meetings at that time and there were extremists of the Minister's Party present.  I was told on that occasion that there was no necessity to increase the loans or the loan charges.  I was told what I was <Col N="976" /> saying was all codology, but I will say that every person who made application for these small dwellings loans up to the date the Minister for Local Government announced that the loan charges had increased&mdash;all these applications were honoured, some even as late as the following January, and applicants were given the loans at the old rate of interest.  I would ask the present Minister to follow that precedent as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I have to deal with both city and county and I find myself in a somewhat invidious position in dealing with two local authorities in the one constituency. To show what the present position is, I will cite just one case.  It is the case of a man who got half his loan prior to the 10th March, actually received it, and his solicitor was notified then that the other half would be sent on immediately.  After 10th March, his solicitor was notified that, for the second half of the loan, he would be charged the increased rate of interest. So we find it goes to this kind of hair-splitting. I hold that is not fair to the people.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy with these people who are buying their homes.  In County Dublin, many of these people find they are not able to carry on after six or seven years and come looking for corporation houses again.  Only this very day, I had to deal with the case of a man who was about to be evicted. These situations arise because the outgoings of these people after seven years are about £3 10s. a week and one requires a fairly decent salary to meet that expense.  Whether we like it or not, we are crippling the citizen who is trying to provide a home for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All along the city boundary, thousands of these people have purchased their own houses to find after a few years that it is impossible for them to carry on, and, on top of that, they find interest rates going up.  I hold that, where a man makes application for a loan on a particular basis and budgets to meet the demands that will be made on him on that basis and who then finds that the rate of interest changes within a short time and that charges have gone up, in ordinary justice, that man's claim to have his loan granted <Col N="977" /> on the terms he originally sought should be recognised.  I appeal to the present Minister and the Government to meet the claims made by such people, whose difficulties are great enough, apart from all this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be humorous, but tenants of such houses have come to me to ask if they could get corporation houses.  Many of them, through unemployment or sickness or something else, and even others on permanent salary, find, after a few years, that it is very hard for them to carry on.  I believe these types of people are the hardest hit in our community.  It is very nice to say that the State has tried to relieve the burden on these people by giving them substantial grants, but I would ask the Minister now to ensure that any person who made an application on or before 10th March should get the loan at the old rate, and I am asking no more than is fair.  Even where the loan is given at the old rate, there is this hair-splitting I have pointed out to the Minister, in the case where half the loan is given by the county council at the old rate and then the applicant is told that the other half will be at the new rate.  I hold that the Government should have notified the people of the impending change a considerable time in advance, so that they would not be left in the present difficulty.</P>
    <P>The position, not only as regards the people who have committed themselves to buy houses, but as regards contractors who have bought land, spent money on developing it, who may have obtained overdrafts from their banks, is genuinely serious in the City and County of Dublin, as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary criticising my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, and it is very easy to come in and get all hot and bothered and say that Deputy Briscoe did this or that&mdash;I think one of the words used was that Deputy Briscoe &ldquo;sabotaged&rdquo; the matter.  I believe no Deputy would be associated with trying to sabotage anything which is in the interests of the nation.  I would give that credit to Deputies on all sides of the House, but when we are forced into the position <Col N="978" /> by the people whom we represent who come and ask us what we are doing in Leinster House, we have to come in here and be critical.</P>
    <P>I say that the responsibility in this matter is on the Government.  The Government should make the situation clear to the people concerned.  Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, irrespective of any statements made by the Taoiseach or the Minister, are not sure if they will get sufficient loans to carry on, and I ask the Minister and the Government once and for all to make a definite statement on the matter.  If the Government are not able to meet the situation, they should say so clearly and should not allow people to go ahead and then cut down day after day as things go on. There are tradesmen leaving the country every day who had plenty of work here for the last few years.  They do not want to go on the dole and they are going to England.  I have here numerous statements from contractors with which I am not going to bore the House, but they all tell the same story.</P>

      <P>That is a very unworthy statement for the Minister to make about Deputy Briscoe.  How could Deputy Briscoe be responsible for the chaotic conditions in housing in Dublin City and County?  That is utter nonsense.  It is an unworthy statement for the Minister to make about anybody.</P>
      <P>I have received statements from a number of contractors.  One of them is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am writing to you in the hope that you can use your good offices to draw attention to the position of builders and their employees in and around the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the building work at present in hands by private builders is 15 per cent. of what it normally is at this time of year.  As a result builders had to dismiss their staff accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number employed in Dublin both directly and indirectly in the building trade is 15,000 and of this number it is reliably estimated that 4,000 men have already gone to Britain and approximately another 3,000 to 4,000 will be dismissed if funds are not forthcoming at once. I now refer you to the <i>Times</i> outlined in red.  What seems to be completely misunderstood by the people responsible in the Government is that builders buy and develop their lands the year before they build as the actual building of a house is, to the average organised builder, a matter of a week's work or so.  As a result of the present loan difficulty, builders are &lsquo;caught&rsquo; with lands developed and banks pressing for overdrafts to be reduced. If the situation is not cleared immediately many builders will fail <Col N="980" /> in business and the remainder will lose confidence in their business.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter continues as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I refer above to a misunderstanding by Government but upon examination it seems different.  The corporation asked for £10,000,000 which the Minister for Local Government reduced to £6,000,000 knowing well that S.D.A.A. would suffer.  A loan of £1,000,000 on such conditions that only two out of 11 prospective purchasers finally get a loan&mdash;this clearly indicates that a policy deliberately designed to hold up housing is contemplated.</P>
      <P>We see in the Press numerous public announcements to the effect that housing will not be held up for the lack of money but up to this day there has been no progress made in the formation of the tripartite arrangements whereby building societies would advance loans to the over £520 per annum class.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The letter continues as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is well known by all persons concerned that a similar arrangement in Britain took at least 18 months to inaugurate and it would be futile to think it would take us less time.</P>
      <P>I think, in fairness to our creditors, not least of all the banks, who have advanced large sums of money, are deserving of a publicly announced statement setting forth the future position of housing loans.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister can have this letter and all the other relevant facts and I wish him luck with them and I hope he will be able to satisfy the people on whose behalf I speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> With reference to the statement in to-day's paper, to me it is only begging the question.  We are not getting anywhere at all with these statements. Statements and pronouncements have been made by responsible Ministers and contradictory statements have been made so often that I am afraid the dignity of the House is lowered by cheap statements.  It is time that we faced up to the position and the people were told what the position is and what will have to be done to deal with it.  I do not want the people's confidence undermined by statements to the effect that a Deputy is responsible for the critical position that obtains.  That is utter nonsense and everybody in the House knows it is nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is no pleasure to me to have to speak on a matter of this kind.  No Deputy wants to say anything harsh about other Deputies.  No matter what our political views may be, individually, we respect one another for what we are.</P>
    <P>I should like a check to be made on the statement in the letter which I have given to the Minister that there are thousands of men going to Britain. That is absolutely true.  They are going from my constituency as well as from the Borough of Dublin and I want the Government to state what the facts are and to tell the people what they will do and not to deceive them any longer.</P>
    <P>I want to claim the indulgence of the Chair for a moment and to go back again to the first point I made with reference to the applications already made for small dwelling loans and to ask that they at least will be honoured.</P>

      <P>I want now to come to a point that I have mentioned on <Col N="982" /> every Estimate for Local Government since I came into this House.  I want the Minister to ask Dublin County Council&mdash;I have asked them&mdash;what they propose to do to install a water scheme into North County Dublin. Would the Minister favourably consider appointing a regional director or somebody who would take an interest in making a water scheme available for North County Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry the Minister did so in this case.  I have asked in this House for regional committees to be appointed to deal with water supplies alone.  There are districts in North County Dublin that are tourist centres&mdash;Skerries, Balbriggan, Rush and a number of other areas&mdash; and we have failed miserably to put a decent water supply into those areas. I should like the responsibility for bringing a water supply to those districts to be placed on a regional water committee and that it would be their specific duty.  So long as it is left to Dublin County Council, it will be just one more scheme under their care and no progress will be made.  I should like to see consulting engineers appointed to deal with this matter. One was appointed a few years ago.  I do not know what the report he made, but we see no result of it in North County Dublin.  There are warnings now of a shortage of water.  What will the position be in July, when the fine weather comes?</P>

It is distressing to see, after 30 years of native government, that we still have places with a couple of thousand of a <Col N="983" /> population depending on the old well&mdash; and, indeed, some of them are miserable old wells, too.  Half the time they are out of order and half the time they are dry.  The Minister for Local Government has said he has divested himself of all dictatorial powers and left the matter to local authorities.  If that is so, then we are wasting our time in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Then the Minister tells this House that he has divested himself of all dictatorial powers.  If he has divested himself of all dictatorial powers in relation to such an important matter, then I think it is completely wrong.</P>

      <P>Then I would ask the Minister to get that statutory authority.  Another problem which partially concerns the Minister arises where Dublin Corporation have taken over big slices of County Dublin and a number of cottage tenants are anxious to purchase their houses, if they are repaired.  I feel that Dublin County Council are very slow in carrying out these repairs, because, if they were carried out, these people would purchase the houses.  I understand the dead-line is 31st March next. A number of people who already have purchased their houses are anxious to get sewerage and water facilities.  I <Col N="985" /> understand from the Department of Local Government that they can have this work carried out with the aid of a reconstruction grant.  I know a few who have applied, but I do not know anybody who has availed of it yet.  I should like the Minister to make inquiries from the Dublin County Council as to when these cottages will be repaired, what they are doing to repair them and whether or not they have enough staff.  There is much dilly-dallying at the moment.</P>

I am not fond of dictatorship, but sometimes it is essential in the national and in the public interest. Generally, I am very disappointed with the replies of the Minister in regard to water and the various other things in relation to which he says he can do nothing.  I hope he will take dictatorial powers to see that something is done to extend water supply schemes to the towns that want them very badly rather than to be told by local authorities that they cannot do the work this year.  It might not be done for 20 years.  Notwithstanding the fact that we are in the position in some of our North County Dublin towns that we have an increased population of 5,000, 6,000 and 7,000 in the summer time.  I must say that I am disillusioned and disappointed that an important national matter such as water for our people and our visitors is being dealt with in this lackadaisical way.  After 12 years of effort I am very disappointed. I am keenly disappointed with the present Minister when he says that he has divested himself of all responsibility in the matter and put it on to the local authority.</P>

We have seen from the Estimate and the report given by the Minister that 22 local authorities have already achieved their objective and have succeeded in building the number of houses which was estimated, in 1947, to be required.  Of course, with the ordinary depreciation of houses, further houses need to be provided, but at least 22 local authorities, corporations, borough councils and county councils have succeeded in meeting what was considered to be the full needs of the nation in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to what has happened in the meantime.  It is obvious that while we have not yet reached finality in providing all the houses required, we have reached saturation point in <Col N="987" /> the matter of providing the money for those houses.</P>

      <P>While it was appreciated that such a large number of houses were needed, the question of providing finance for the houses was another problem.  We had to depend on the resources of the nation to provide the houses.  Since 1948, £90,000,000 has been provided by this small nation towards the cost of providing houses for its people.  That includes £67,000,000 towards the cost of providing working class houses such as corporation dwellings, council houses and cottages. <Col N="988" /> In addition to that £67,000,000 for those houses, a further £23,000,000 was provided for the building of middle-class houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  That £90,000,000 was a colossal sum of money for the people to provide from their limited resources for the building of houses from 1948 to the present time.</P>
      <P>In 1948, we appreciated the big problem there was and the large number of houses required and over the years since we have had to look to the nation to provide us with the money. Now we are at a stage where we have not completed our housing programme and we still look to the nation to finance the completion of that programme. Those are the difficulties which are confronting us at the present time.  Where will we get the money? We got the money from various sources in the years past, but we may not in the future be able to get money from the same sources.  In any case the question of providing finance for the provision of these houses, both working class houses and houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts remains to be solved.  Whether or not it was intended, it is true that Deputy Briscoe upset the provision of finance for housing so far as Dublin Corporation was concerned.</P>

      <P>We all remember the very prominent publicity given to those damaging statements by Deputy Briscoe in the <i>Irish Press</i> which resulted in the failure of the corporation loan.  Realising the difficulties that confronted us in connection with the provision of finance for housing, it was decided by the Government to ask the <Col N="989" /> corporation to float a loan and the success of the loan depended upon the confidence which the people with money would have in that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the increase in the English bank rate which affected the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would take the trouble to read the question raised on the Adjournment on the 25th April, 1956, reported at columns 957 to 970, he will see that the Minister for Local Government pointed out very clearly to Deputy Briscoe not alone what the difficulties were but what caused the difficulties.  He also pointed out to Deputy Briscoe the damage which he had done, as a member of the Dublin Corporation, in connection with his activities so far as the failure of that loan was concerned.</P>
      <P>We hoped the people would invest their money in the corporation loan which would enable the provision of working-class houses to be continued in addition to middle-class dwellings under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  When that loan was not a success, difficulties arose immediately and we have them at the present time. I am satisfied that, given time, the financial difficulty can be and will be sorted out and that the housing programme can be continued until it is completed.  In that connection, I should like to point out to Deputy Briscoe and his critical colleagues the attitude of the inter-Party Government. In 1948, when the inter-Party Government came into office, a man wishing to build a house was encouraged to do so by the offer of a grant under the Fianna Fáil Administration of £45.  That was the amount of the grant which a man would get to build his own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct.  The inter-Party Government decided that they would make a grant of £275 to a person desiring to build his own house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is still not correct.</P>

      <P>I remember that the Fianna Fáil grant was only £45 because a neighbour of mine was very anxious to qualify under the new housing legislation which gave a grant of £275 during the year 1948.  In addition to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, a supplementary grant, in addition to the grant of £275, has been made available by the inter-Party Government amounting to approximately £137 10s., bringing the total grant to a figure exceeding £400 in respect of certain classes of persons desiring to build their own homes either under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts or out of their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> I feel that the housing difficulties at the present time should not be made the plaything of Party politics.  I feel that the Fianna Fáil Party have a duty to the nation at this stage.  Instead of making a shambles of the position at the present time by inaccurate remarks and the improper views which they have expressed they should try to follow a proper line in this case and, if possible, point the way by which the necessary finance can be provided.</P>
    <P>We noticed in the papers this morning that the Minister for Local Government has been discussing with various insurance companies and building loan societies the possibility of a new method of providing finance for these housing programmes.  The difficult side of our housing programme at the moment is under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I should like to remind the House that in England, where, of course, the resources are far greater, 90 per cent. of the money made available to people wishing to provide their own houses come from building societies and insurance loans and not from the Local Loans Fund such as we must depend upon here under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Here the State has been required to find the money first and then provide it in order that people can build their own homes by means of loans but in Great Britain such people desiring to provide their own homes have been able to get the necessary finance from, if you like, private enterprise, building societies and insurance companies. That is the aspect of the problem which the Minister for Local Government is examining now.  He appreciates that, if there is an inclination not to provide the money in the form of public loans, we must look to another section of the community to provide the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if our national loans are not fully subscribed we cannot expect our national programmes to proceed apace.  We must expect them either to be curtailed or cut down. There is where we must depend upon other sources to bridge the gap, if there is a gap, resulting from the under-subscription of public loans for these projects.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 29th May, 1956.</P>
