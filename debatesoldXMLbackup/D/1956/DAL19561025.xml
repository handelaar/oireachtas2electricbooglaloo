      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that clerical positions in State-sponsored organisations which are under the aegis of his Department, are confined to boys and girls who hold secondary school leaving certificates, he will ask such concerns to amend their regulations in this respect so that all boys and girls can compete for these appointments until such time as every child, who wishes to obtain it, is provided with free secondary and university education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in the public Press at the time, the Advisory Body reported that the wholesale discounts allowed by members of the Irish Jam Manufacturers' Association were excessive and recommended that they should be reduced, the manufacturers to apply the saving thus effected to mitigate proposed increases in the prices of their products.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether an increase of 10 per cent. in the price of prams, pramettes and go-cars has been recommended by the Prices Advisory Body, and, if so, why the application for the increase was not heard in public.</P>

I am informed, however, that the price of the product mentioned, which is a maize meal mixture, was increased by 10/- per ton recently and that this mixture, in common with other mixtures of a similar nature, was increased in price as a result of the inclusion of barley in the millers' grist.</P>

As far as vocational schools are concerned, depending on what can be done by the Department with funds from the Local Loans Fund and from other funds, the total to be spent this year is twice what was spent last year, again an all-time high record.</P>

      <P>Although I have not had the advantage of seeing the Minister's reply, I think it is generally known that an instruction issued from the Department of Agriculture early in August which meant that the allocations of grants for farm buildings were to cease as from that date.  I wish, in the first place, to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that justice has been done to all those who had undertaken work under the scheme whether they had completed the work or not? Is he satisfied that justice had been rendered to them when the instruction was issued?  Secondly, I wish to ask him when it is proposed, or is it proposed, during the present financial year, to resume consideration of fresh applications?  In particular, I want to know whether the work that had been in progress is going to be dealt with by the Department and whether farmers who undertook that work will have their claims met?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of recent information supplied to him, he has re-examined the question of the slaughter of horses for the purpose of exporting the flesh thereof for human consumption, and, if so, whether he has yet come to a final decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> Since the beginning of 1956, four applications for facilities to export horse flesh for human consumption have been received by my Department.  In three cases, the applicants were informed that it has been the policy not to permit the export of horse flesh for human consumption as it is considered that the development of such a trade would be contrary to the country's interests in regard to the export of high-grade carcase meat.  A reply on similar lines is being sent to the fourth application.</P>
    <P>There is nothing I can usefully add, at this stage, to my previous statements in the House on this subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how he reconciles this information with the fact that apparently there is no restriction on the export of horses across the Border or to the Continent for that purpose?  The fact is that Irish horses are at present being freely supplied to these places for slaughter for human consumption and what I would like to know is how, if that does not affect our beef trade, would it affect the beef trade if that business were done here rather than in these abattoirs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The view has been taken by all those qualified to advise in this matter so far that the export of horse flesh in carcase form is liable to do serious injury to our valuable export market in high grade carcase meat. The difference between the export in carcase form and on the hoof must be, I think, obvious to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">

I am informed that this meat is being sold on the Continent as Irish horse flesh.  All I want to know is: if that is not injuring our beef trade at present, the trade which has been carried on for a number of years, <Col N="201" /> how would it injure our beef trade if we developed this industry here ourselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a question of what is in the best interests of the economy as a whole.  Is it desirable and expedient to export carcase horse from this country and give the exporter a right to describe it in our continental markets as prime Irish meat, which he would be entitled to do?</P>

      <P>He cannot export carcase meat.  My duty is to protect a very valuable trade of this country which I have good reason to hope is going to expand and provide useful employment here and provide an export commodity of which we can all be proud.  That is my sole concern in this matter.  As at present advised, I am persuaded that the export of carcase horse from this country is calculated to injure that trade and I am bound to recall that that view was shared by all my predecessors in the Ministry of Agriculture since the State was founded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to recently, I believed that that argument was sound. Now my difficulty is this: I find that in fact we are supplying horses across <Col N="202" /> the Border where they are being slaughtered and the carcases sent across to England where there is a veterinary inspector who certifies them as being fit for human consumption. That is point No. 1.  Again, we send horses on the hoof to the Continent, knowing that they are to be slaughtered for human food.  I am informed by authorities over there that in fact the meat is valued because it is Irish horse flesh.  Now the fact that the horses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I keep this matter under constant and careful review.  My sole concern is to protect the growing and valuable carcase meat exporting industry in this country.  As at present advised, I believe that the export of carcase horse from this country, the Republic, for which we are responsible, would adversely affect the permanent and developing trade in prime beef.  If it should ever be shown to me that that is not so, I would have no interest in preventing anybody doing anything, but so long as the conviction is in my mind that that is so, then I conceive myself to have a duty to do what is necessary for the protection of the predominant and permanently valuable trade on which the farmers of this country are largely dependent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that many farmers had materials for the erection of hay sheds delivered to their premises on dates subsequent to the stoppage of grants under the farm <Col N="203" /> buildings scheme and before the erection had been approved by his Department, and, if so, if he will consider making grants available to such farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that many farmers are in the position described in the first part of the Deputy's question.  A small number of farmers whose recent applications for grants in respect of hay sheds under the farm buildings scheme have had to be deferred for the present informed my Department that they had already made arrangements for erection of hay sheds, although they had not obtained the necessary approval of their applications.  It is an essential condition of the scheme that an applicant must obtain prior official authority for carrying out, to prescribed specifications, any work for which he seeks a grant.</P>
      <P>As the funds provided for the scheme this year are earmarked to meet applications already accepted and applications in respect of cow-byres from participants under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, I regret that I cannot accept any further applications at this stage.  I may mention that this year's funds are up to the level of last year's and are substantiaally more than the funds provided in earlier years.</P>
      <P>The acceptance of applications will be resumed at the earliest possible date, but I would like to make it clear is that connection that there must be observance of this condition that the applicant must obtain prior official authority for carrying out, to prescribed specifications, the work proposed for a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the work is to cease from now to the end of the financial year, would the Minister tell us what is to happen to the staff normally employed over the year in this work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully sympathise with the Deputy's well-intentioned misconception. I said that the receipt of applications will be suspended, but, in fact, I am still charged with the <Col N="204" /> responsibility of spending in the remainder of this year £426,000 on farm buildings and if that does not keep the staff of the farm buildings scheme as busy as bees, they are better men than I am, Gunga Din.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the suppliers of hay sheds, who canvassed the farmers for years, had delivered and erected them in farmers' haggards before the owners of the farms had made application?  There were a number of such cases throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the Deputy's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider these cases?  The hay sheds were delivered by the suppliers and erected at the same time as application was made, during the same week; it takes only two or three days to erect a hay shed.  They made application the same day&mdash;before the Minister's officers decided they were within the specification. Could the Minister not reconsider those cases with a view to allowing a grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that concludes the Deputy's supplementary question, may I say that, with his usual perspicacity, he has laid his finger on the very heart of this matter.  The problem to which he refers is that the fellows who want to erect the hay sheds are delivering them before the other fellows apply for a grant at all.  Then they expect me to deliver automatically a grant to whomever they have delivered a hay shed.  Since the State was founded, it has been the established practice that, before a Minister authorises the outlay of public money, he must satisfy himself that it is being laid out in accordance with the rules laid down for him by Dáil Éireann.  It is perfectly true that, so successful has the farm buildings scheme been, the number of erectors has doubled, trebled and quadrupled and they are chasing one another round the country seeking custom.  As Deputy Allen says, they will deliver the makings of the hay shed on chance into anybody's yard. However, I do not think it is reasonable for a Deputy to ask me to give an <Col N="205" /> undertaking that automatically I will give a hay barn grant to anyone into whose yard an enterprising erector has dumped the raw materials therefor.  I cannot change the regulations which provide that, before a hay shed grant is given, the person who wants to buy it must apply; the officer of the Department in charge of farm buildings in his area must inspect the site and satisfy himself that it will be built to specification and I will then issue the appropriate notice that he will get a grant if he builds the hay shed.  If he tries to short circuit that procedure, there is nothing I can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that, without any notice whatever, he clamped down on a certain date in June, July or August of this year and said there were no more grants for hay sheds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main proposal put forward by local interests for the improvement of the landing place at Portaleen, County Donegal, has been the construction of a dock basin.  The Office of Public Works carried out a close survey of the site in 1953 and came to the conclusion <Col N="207" /> that the estimated cost of the cheapest feasible scheme of the kind would be £250,000 and that a full harbour of refuge would cost £400,000. The Donegal County Council were informed by my Department on 18th January, 1954, that a case could not be made for incurring expenditure of this order at Portaleen and a smaller scheme, limited to the provision of shipping, lifting and storage facilities in the best form practicable, was proposed instead for the council's preliminary consideration.  The Donegal county engineer was of opinion that adequate shelter in a revised form could be provided at appreciably lower cost than that estimated by the Office of Public Works and undertook in February, 1954, to furnish details of the plan he had in mind.  Such details having been received on 16th June, 1955, in my Department were transmitted for examination by the Office of Public Works by whom certain clarification of the details was required from the county engineer before proceeding further with consideration of his proposal.  The necessary clarification was not completed by the council until 17th September, 1956, and I am now advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that, following evaluation of the material so supplied, the estimated cost of the county engineer's proposal, when due allowance had been made for all relevant factors, cannot be measured at less than £240,000.</P>
    <P>I regret that, like my predecessor, I am unable to recommend that expenditure of this order should be incurred to improve the landing place at Portaleen and I have no alternative but to advise the Donegal County Council accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister to have this matter reviewed by the officers of his Department in view of the fact that the county engineer who originally drew up and drafted this scheme on which the Minister has now received a report from the Office of Public Works estimated, to the best of his ability at the time, that this job would not cost a quarter of the figure now mentioned?</P>

Furthermore, in view of his reply, will the Minister have that investigation carried out and, in having it carried out, may I ask if he will have due regard to the fact that no engineer employed by the Office of Public Works can ever, in any case, take a chance, for the simple reason that there is nothing to be gained by doing a good job if there is the slightest danger of failure?

They tell me that the county engineer's scheme cannot cost less than £240,000.  In conscience I cannot recommend to Dáil Éireann that that sum should be spent on Portaleen Harbour. If the Deputy can suggest to me any other source from which I can get a reliable estimate of the cost, he can give it to me on a halfpenny postcard and if there is anything practicable in it he can depend on me.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether recipients of pensions and allowances issued by his Department have suffered any curtailment in the amount of such pensions and allowances as a result of an increase in social welfare benefits, and, if so, if he will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that such cuts are restored retrospectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1943, when special allowances were introduced, the directions governing the assessment of means for the purpose of such allowances have provided that, in calculating the yearly means of a person, one-half of the amount of disability pension and the full amount of a widow's pension must be reckoned as means.  Accordingly, it was necessary to reduce, by approximately one-half of the amount of the increase granted in disability allowances as from the 3rd September, 1956, and the full amount of the increase granted in a widow's (contributory) pension as from the 7th September, 1956, the special allowances of persons who were in receipt of such allowances and who were also in receipt of disability pensions or widows' (contributory) pensions.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take any steps to alter the present position regarding the calculation of means in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider taking similar steps to those taken under similar circumstances by the Minister for Health when he made an Order ensuring that these increased insurance benefits would not lose in the cutting down of pensions and allowances?</P>

    <P>It is to be expected that issues from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities other than the Dublin and Cork Corporations should show a falling off since 1952-53.  Several of these local authorities have now completed or are nearing completion of their main building programme.  In rural areas as a whole 92 per cent. of housing needs as estimated in 1947 have been met and in urban areas excluding Dublin and Cork Cities 75 per cent. of needs as estimated in 1947 have been met.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the question, there is no undue delay in my Department in sanctioning applications for loans required for essential housing within the limits of the available funds, subject to compliance with the usual conditions.  In the allocation of the capital available for public purposes a high priority is being accorded to housing; of the total issued to local authorities, other than the Dublin and Cork Corporations, in the current financial year up to 30th September, amounting to £3,792,000, a sum of £2,690,000 related to housing.  In addition sums amounting to £2,159,000 were issued to Dublin and Cork Corporations in the same period on foot of loans for housing, making a total expenditure under this <Col N="219" /> head of £4,849,000.  Any increase in the funds that can be made available for housing and other building purposes is dependent primarily on an increase in the community's savings and, as the Deputy is aware, special steps have been and are being taken to encourage increased savings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, the rate of interest on loans is that operative at the time of issue of the money from the fund. This rate is subject to review from time <Col N="220" /> to time in the light of changes in the Exchequer borrowing rate and, accordingly, it is not possible to say in advance what the rate of interest may be for any particular loan.

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of the very great trade potential that would be if tourists were allowed to purchase goods, normally subject to duty or a levy, free of such duty or levy; and whether, with a view to safeguarding genuine purchases by such tourists, he will take the steps necessary to permit traders to forward such goods to the customs depot at the tourists' point of departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability to departing foreign tourists, free of duty or levy, of goods ordinarily liable to such imposts would no doubt have some effect on the volume of tourist purchases, depending largely on the extent to which the relief might be passed on to the purchasers.  I regret, however, it would not be feasible for administrative and other reasons to operate a general scheme such as that envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has received representations that grave unemployment has been created in certain industries as a result of the Emergency Imposition of Duties (No. 383) (Special Import Levies) Order, 1956; whether he has considered such representations, and, if so, what decision he has arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made on behalf of particular firms and industries about the effect of the special import levies.  Official statements have been issued covering the results of the consideration of the representations in the case of the motor assembly industry, where forces other than the levy are mainly responsible for the decline in sales.  It should not be overlooked that in some industries the levies have had the incidental effect of conserving and increasing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in general has been fully explained to the public by my statements in Dáil Éireann in March and July in which I indicated the purpose of the levies (which is to restrict expenditure on less essential consumer imports) and the intention that they should be retained only as long as the balance of payments situation requires.  I made it clear then and on several occasions since that if the balance of payments drain were not stopped, the country would face a situation in which, through inabaility to buy the raw materials on which our industries depend, there would be widespread shutting-down of factories and businesses, with general and heavy unemployment.  The recent trade figures show an improvement in our position, but we cannot relax our efforts.  An increase in production, bringing with it an increase in employment, is the most desirable way of closing the gap and of enabling us to pay for all the imports we would wish to have.  Until the measures to that end, including those recently announced by the Taoiseach, are effective, <Col N="225" /> imports of less essential consumption goods must continue to be restricted as this is essential to the achievement of a balance in our external payments and the preservation of national solvency.</P>

The process is a continuing one, the results of which cannot be known with certainty until the final figures become available at the end of the financial year.

      <P>As I said in my Financial Statement on 8th May last, the overall capital requirements of the State and other public bodies in 1956-57 were then settled at a gross figure of £43.5 million.  If by productive expenditure the Deputy means expenditure yielding a direct annual return equivalent to the interest charge on the relevant borrowing, approximately three-fifths of this amount may be regarded as productive.  That is not to say, of course, that capital expenditure may not be justifiable, within limits, on economic or social grounds, even if it is not directly productive in the financial sense.</P>
      <P>On 25th July I outlined the general position as regards capital to the Dáil and pointed out that there was no escaping the conclusion that the net borrowing requirement for public capital purposes as fixed at Budget time must be reduced.  I explained that the plans for economies to be effected would cover the whole range of current as well as capital expenditure by the Government and the various public bodies.</P>
      <P>As regards the nature and extent of these economies, I would refer to my reply to Deputy Vivion de Valera's question on this subject to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question asked by the Deputy, but I can assure the Deputy that these market valuers for the various local authorities are the same persons as they have been down through the years and that no new instruction was issued by me to them on the question of valuation; and further all local authorities appear to have accepted these market values as assessed by these <Col N="238" /> valuers up to the present and, as I say, no instruction to the contrary has been issued by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Deputy but that is not the question which he has asked me.  It is laid down by statute what each valuer shall take into account in assessing the market value of a particular dwelling, and so far as I know all valuers are complying with the law in assessing market values.  Very often it has been the case down through the years that the market value does not agree with the selling price but that is not the fault of the valuer.  The market value as assessed by the valuers has been accepted by builders, local authorities and applicants down through the years.  Until it is proved to me that a particular market valuer is not doing his duty in assessing the value as he is bound to do by statute, I think he should not be removed from office.  If any local authority is not satisfied with the manner in which a particular valuer is carrying out his functions, they are at liberty to dispense with him and appoint somebody else in his place.</P>

      <P>Sanction was not refused to the loan of £50,000 referred to by the Deputy.  The loan was to be spent over a two year period and it was ascertained from the housing authority that they considered that a loan of £25,000 would be sufficient to continue the council's cottage repair programme for the balance of the present financial year.  The raising of a loan on this basis was sanctioned on 9th instant.  In these circumstances the second part of the Deputy's question does not seem to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night, I was concerned to direct the attention of the House to a very interesting and important development in the pig and bacon trade of the country.  That is the remarkable increase that has taken place in the percentage of grade A pigs now being delivered to the factories in the country at large.  In the August-December period of 1955, the proportion of grade A pigs was 54 per cent. of graded pigs delivered to the factories for conversion into bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> In the January-March period of 1956, the proportion of grade A pigs delivered to factories was 58 per cent., and in the April-June quarter of 1956, and again in the June-September quarter of 1956, the proportion of grade A pigs rose to 63 per cent.  The situation has actually arisen now, it is hard to believe, when certain curers in the south of Ireland would almost say they are getting too many grade A pigs and are at a loss to secure pigs from which stouter grades of bacon can be made.</P>
    <P>This is certainly a very dramatic change from the day when we here in Ireland regarded ourselves as being seriously embarrassed by the fact that an undue proportion of over-fat pigs was being delivered to the factories by the farmers.  I do not think we should allow this occasion to pass without recording in public our congratulations to the farmers of the country who, in so short a time, have raised the percentage of grade A pigs from 54 per cent. to 63 per cent.  I dare express the hope that, if this rate of progress is maintained, our commercial experience of deliveries of grade A pigs to our factories will, in the early forseeable future, rival that of any other country in the world.</P>
    <P>As regard pig prices, the export price guarantee scheme has been proving its value recently, and despite reductions in bacon prices on the whole in the export market, the prices received by producers here have been maintained at 235/- per cwt. for grade A and 230/- per cwt. for grade B1 pigs.  Producers are assured of these minimum prices.  It is the intention of the Government to continue to guarantee a minimum price for grade A pigs and producers may, therefore, with confidence increase their output of pigs in the certainty that, whatever number of pigs they produce, there is no danger of the price collapsing, providing the pigs are grade A pigs.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a word in clarification of the true position compared with the position in past times. In the June Census, the total number of pigs in the country fluctuated around the 1,000,000 mark&mdash;a little <Col N="253" /> below sometimes, sometimes a little above.  Our exports of bacon in 1938 amounted to 545,000 cwts.  Our exports of bacon in 1939 amounted to 467,000 cwts.  In 1940, our exports of bacon amounted to 562,000 cwts.  Then the number of our pigs began to decline, but in the June Census of 1941 we were shown to have 763,000 pigs in the country.  In that year, we exported 232,000 cwts. of bacon and 21,000 cwts. of pork.  In 1943, we had only 434,000 pigs; in 1944, 380,000; in 1945, 426,000; in 1946, 479,000; in 1947, 456,000; in 1948, 457,000.  In 1949, the number of pigs went up to 674,000.  In 1950, we had 644,000 pigs and in that year our exports of bacon amounted to 47,949 cwts.</P>
    <P>In 1951, I negotiated with the British Government a Pigs and Bacon Agreement and, if I say it myself, it was a very good agreement.  Under it, we managed to get a price from the British for pork and bacon which enabled us to pay the farmers of this country, and guarantee to them over a five year period, a highly remunerative price, both for pork and bacon, but especially for pork.  The result of that was that the numbers of pigs began to climb and in 1952 we had 719,000; in 1953, 881,000 and in 1954, 958,000.  In 1955, we had 798,000 and in June, 1956, we had 742,000.  But during the four years of the operation of the Pigs and Bacon Agreement we had the following astonishing exports of pork: in 1952 we exported 106,000 cwts. of pork; in 1953, 335,000 cwts.; in 1954, 290,000 cwts.; and in 1955, 226,000 cwts.  Then the agreement came to an end and now our exports of pork are relatively infinitesimal.</P>
    <P>I wish the Agreement had not come to an end but when you are making an agreement with a foreign government you must bear in mind that there are two sides to the agreement.  They must want what you want to sell and you must be in a position to supply it.  The plain fact is now that the British can supply all their own requirements of pork because they are paying their own domestic producers such attractive prices for pork that the British farmers have increased the numbers of pigs immensely, and the fresh pork market, <Col N="254" /> so far as we are concerned, has ceased to be profitable because our pork pigs do not qualify for the guarantees provided by the British Government for their own producers.</P>
    <P>Our exports of bacon in 1953-54 were very substantial but there is another interesting point that emerges.  Our total pig population, to go back to 1941, was 763,000 as of June, 1941; and in that year we exported 232,000 cwt. of bacon.  In 1955, to take the last complete year, we had rather more pigs&mdash;798,000 approximately&mdash; but because our people's standard of living had risen, they ate all the pigs and we exported only 51,000 cwt. That is a fact which may give us all cause for rejoicing in that our people are now so circumstanced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they can eat all the bacon we are producing as they are eating the greater part of the butter we are producing.  But it should spur us to further and better endeavours to increase the quality and quantity of pigs produced so that we can sell them as top grade bacon in the export market in relief of our balance of payments situation, because it is only by expanding production and exports that we can bring the balance of payments situation into balance while, at the same time, maintaining or raising the standard of living of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to direct the attention of the House to one other aspect of this business on behalf of which I bespeak the sympathetic support of Deputies on all sides of the House.  Pre-war we had to face the fact that our exports of bacon were being sold in an extensively competitive market abroad and therefore, any advantage enjoyed by our competitors had to be secured if it was physically possible for the Irish Government to secure it, for our own producers.  Pre-war, the cheapest cereal food for pigs available in the world was maize and our competitors had free access to the unlimited supplies of that cereal.  There was no cereal then known we could grow in <Col N="255" /> our conditions which would compete with maize.  Since then, however, new Scandinavian varieties of barley have been evolved and these varieties give a yield on our land and in our climatic conditions which makes home grown barley competitive with foreign grain.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, urging our farmers to aim at expanding pig production in this country on the basis of home grown barley and skim milk to supply the protein element essential to a pig's diet.  There may be parts of the country in which the user of potatoes will certainly be desirable.  We did have an old ratio that a cwt. of meal was equivalent to three cwt. of potatoes in feeding value and that where the price of potatoes was less than one-third of the price of a cwt. of compound feed it was economic to feed potatoes.  I think that situation certainly obtains at the present time and, therefore, where potatoes are abundant, it is undoubtedly economic to boil them, ensile them or to pit them and boil them, and give them to the pigs freshly boiled.  Either procedure is eminently practicable.  Many co-operative societies now provide services through which steam boilers are sent round to boil potatoes in bulk so helping a farmer to ensile which is a very simple procedure.  The potatoes can then be fed as required for the pigs to eat.</P>
    <P>If we could persuade our farmers to use home grown barley and skim milk for the production of pigs it would be safe to say for many years ahead that we could expand the barley acreage indefinitely.  There is no limit to the amount of home-grown barley that could be profitably consumed in this country.  In the present situation we are in a position to guarantee that a farmer who grows more barley than he proposes to use on his own holding will have a guaranteed market at not less than 40/- per barrel for any quantity he produces.</P>
    <P>I cannot too strongly emphasise&mdash; and I hope others will endorse what I say&mdash;that the farmer who grows grain, particularly feeding grain, will get the best profit for himself if he walks it off the land, that is to say, if he feeds <Col N="256" /> it to his own pigs.  At the same time there may be farmers who want to grow not only the grain that they intend to convert on their own holdings but a surplus as a cash crop.  It is a valuable fact that we can say to them without a limit: &ldquo;You will be assured of not less than 40/- per barrel for any surplus you have to dispose of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the things which is urgently necessary is that we should get barley grown in the areas of maximum consumption. It is an unfortunate fact that more than 50 per cent. of the entire barley crop of the country is now grown in East Cork and practically none grown in Monaghan, Cavan, Mayo and Kerry&mdash;I am speaking now of feeding barley&mdash;where large quantities of animal feeding stuffs are required.  I would hope to secure in the years that lie ahead an ever-increasing acreage of this particular crop in Donegal, the province of Connacht, Cavan, Monaghan and north Louth so that we could avoid the nightmare of piling transport costs on to a raw material of an exporting industry because to shift barley from Cork to Monaghan or from Cork to Sligo involves transport charges which seriously jeopardise the whole future of the plans we have in mind to substitute home-grown grain for imported feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>I cannot too strongly emphasise&mdash; and I feel sure that Deputy Dr. Ryan will confirm this&mdash;that it is of vital importance that farmers should recognise that if they have not got skim milk to use with home-grown grain they must find an alternative source for protein which is now happily available in abundance in the form of meat and bone meal.  But it is true that some farmers have made the mistake of trying to rear pigs on home-grown grain and potatoes and have been disappointed in the apparent failure of the pigs to thrive.  That failure is due to the lack of protein in a diet consisting exclusively of potatoes and barley or, indeed, of potatoes and any other grain.  If they used skim milk, and have enough of it, they will get the protein but if they <Col N="257" /> have not got skim milk they must introduce an appropriate quantity of meat and bone meal which I do not think would be excessive if one were to suggest a stone of good meat and bone meal to every cwt. of barley meal they used.</P>

      <P>There is not much between us.  In any case, a farmer will be well advised if he seeks specific directions.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>True, but in any case there are men charged with the responsibility. We have just published a new leaflet which Deputies possibly have seen in regard to the production of pigs and in which is to be found the fullest information in relation to these matters.  It is available to farmers who can get it by sending a postcard to the Department or who ask the managers of their co-operative societies or bacon factories, all of whom have supplies of the pamphlet which they will distribute free of all cost to anyone who asks for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, I think, covers the case I want to make.  I particularly desire to emphasise that I believe we have turned the corner and the pig population is rising again.  One bogey has always haunted the mind of the farmers of this country in the past and <Col N="258" /> that was that if they increased the production of pigs the inevitable consequence would be that the price would slump.  I want it to go on record now as telling the farmers of this country that no matter what quantity of grade A pigs they produce in the future, whether it is 1,000,000, 2,000,000, 3,000,000 or 4,000,000, there is no possibility of the price slumping now.</P>
    <P>The price of grade A pigs is guaranteed and no quantity produced by the Irish farmer will operate to precipitate a slump in the price.  That bogey is dead and that ought to be a great encouragement to farmers in all parts of the country to put their shoulders to the wheel and increase the output of this commodity for which we have an unlimited market and which can be rapidly expanded to the great advantage of the farmers themselves and the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear in regard to the last point.  How long does the guarantee last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing guarantee lasts until the 31st of next March and I have no reason to anticipate that it will not be extended for a year further and thereafter it will be renewed annually but with very full notice. Farmers will get good notice in advance of what the price is going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, instead of guaranteeing for, say, a year, I think the best form of guarantee for the farmers would be to say the guarantee lasts until notice is given.  That would give the farmers ample time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What notice would the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would want to be 12 months, but perhaps 12 months might be too great a burden, but perhaps the notice could be a nine-months' notice.  As the Minister and everybody knows, if a farmer is fattening his sow to breed, by the time the progeny is fit for the market a period of ten or 12 months would have elapsed.  Really, the farmers would want to be given 12 months' notice.  The Minister has a better opportunity of considering that with the officials than I and I would <Col N="259" /> ask him to consider that point and see whether he could not put it into the guarantee, not that he is going to extend it to the 31st of March but that he is extending it until notice is given and that the notice will not be less than 12 months, if possible.  The Minister has better machinery for and a better opportunity of considering those things than an ordinary Deputy and I would like if the Minister would consider that matter and let us know if something on that line could be done on the further stages of the Bill or, perhaps, put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Bill dealt with three points and point No. 1 concerned colour.  Those of us who have put through various Acts of Parliament will agree that every Act, either implicitly or explicitly, made it illegal to have a black pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>A colour bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In fact, we legislated here for the large white pig and no other would be allowed, but in spite of that there are black pigs in the country.  It may not be unfair to say that a black pig cannot be kept or sold but it is going to be wasteful to say the least of it.  If these pigs have to be destroyed, and no use is made of them, it would be a great waste.  Therefore, I think we should give one more warning of a few months in order to get rid of those pigs.  Give people a chance to fatten them off in four or five months, or whatever the period might be, and then let it be absolutely illegal to rear them, and provide heavy penalties for having a black pig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may bring this Bill into operation at a certain date.  However, as that clause is worded, the Bill must come into operation as a whole or not at all.  If the Minister would agree with what I say about giving a warning in connection with the black pig&mdash; not that I have any sympathy with those who keep black pigs, but just in the interests of economy and to ensure that we would make some use of those that are there&mdash;then I think we shall have to alter the wording regarding the bringing of this Act into operation. He may have to fix different dates for <Col N="260" /> different clauses, or sections, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The big thing in this Bill is the matter of a fixed price.  At the moment, the Minister is operating under emergency powers.  We are changing over from emergency powers to permanent legislation.  In itself, that is good.  I think every Party in this House is anxious to see the Emergency Powers Act done away with and to make it unnecessary to have that Act. At the same time, we recognise the value of certain powers taken under that Act and these powers will have to be put into some permanent legislation before the Act is finally rescinded. Therefore, so far as the legislation is concerned, we are going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We all know that there was a very drastic reduction in the price of any pig below grade A standard.  The Minister tells us that, as a result of fixing this price, the farmers did their utmost to bring their pigs into the grade A class.  The Minister says the figures show that the farmers have been very successful and that, in recent months, they have been able to bring two-thirds of their pigs into the grade A class.  We are told that certain curers will be asked to state&mdash; they have not approached it yet, I believe&mdash;the position as regards the cutting out of stout bacon.  I believe there will be no difficulty in getting it if a better price is given.</P>

      <P>I should not like to see it go off the market.  I do not like lean bacon at all.  If curers want stout bacon, there will be no difficulty in getting it.  Any farmer will tell you that if he could fatten his pig for another two or three weeks, and thus make it a few stone heavier, he would get more profit as a result of the extra few stone than he would as a result of his work in the preceding few months. Consumers in general are looking for grade A bacon.  In all probability, as time goes on, we shall want a bigger and bigger percentage of grade A bacon produced if we desire to sell it at a good price.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> The Minister gave a good many interesting figures to us this afternoon. I should like very much to have these figures tabulated and presented in such a way that we could study the trend, as he put it, of the number of pigs since 1938&mdash;pre-war, during the war and since the war&mdash;and the number exported.  One thing that these figures show, and which I think the Minister tried to bring out, is that we are consuming a lot more of our own pigs now than was the case in 1938-39.  In that connection, we must not lose sight of the fact that before the war we aimed at producing a pig at about 12-stone deadweight for the factory or 16 stones liveweight.  Now, it is dangerous to aim at that.  One would need to have a pig at 11 stones deadweight in order to get the best value.  That factor should be taken into account in comparing the number of pigs consumed at home now and pre-war.  It takes more pigs now to give us the same amount of bacon for home consumption than it did pre-war.  I suppose the increase would not be more than 10 per cent., but I suggest we should add 10 per cent. to the pre-war figure in order to get a fair comparison between the consumption in both periods.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's figures, it would seem that the number of pigs in the country on the 1st June in each year has been going down in the past three years.  In his concluding remarks, the Minister said he thought there was an upward trend.  I hope he is right. I must say that I thought there would be an upward trend in view of the guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>I do not want to start a controversy now as to the price level&mdash;some people say it is not high enough&mdash;but a guaranteed price at a good level would, in my opinion, bring more pigs.  I believe that if the farmer were assured he had a chance of making money on pigs, or that he would lose only a little bit on them, it would result in an increase in pigs in this country.  Therefore, I hoped to see more pigs in the country when this guarantee was brought in but, so far, the statistics do not show that increase.  I sincerely hope the Minister was right when he said he thought there was an upward trend in the pig population.  The number has been going down since <Col N="262" /> 1954, which was the peak year since before the war.  In particular, the number of pigs for export has been going down.  The Minister read out the figures rather hurriedly but, if I heard them properly, I think there was only a token export in the past few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year.  In 1955 there was a substantial export but less than in 1954.  There is only a token export at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we are not forgetting the old warning about locking the stable door when the horse has fled. Let us hope that all the horses have not fled.  Let us hope that with this Bill to make permanently legal the fixing of a price, we may give further encouragement to farmers in general to produce pigs and that we may have more for export as time goes on.</P>
      <P>I always felt it would be a great thing if we could feed the pigs from our own produce.  I believe the only sure system of getting pig production on a sound basis is to have our own feeding for them produced within the country.  As a matter of fact, the Minister talks of conditions here pre-war when imported feeding stuff, such as maize, were freely available and in the Minister's opinion it was cheaper to buy them.  Of course that is a matter of opinion.  The strange thing about it is that at that time the Scandinavian countries, to which the Minister referred, were producing pigs in very big numbers by feeding a far higher proportion of home-grown feeding than we were feeding.  That was before new varieties of barley had been discovered, which have been giving us such good yields and which have proved so suitable for pig feeding.</P>
      <P>I had an opportunity of seeing feeders in Denmark feeding pigs with home-grown feeding.  I hope the Minister is right in his hope that the farmers here will turn more and more to the production of home-grown barley, as far as possible feeding on their own farms, but where they have a surplus, it can be sold to others for feeding poultry and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in this Bill, I notice, deals with export subsidy.  That was <Col N="263" /> the kind of thing to which the Minister had a very strong objection in the past.  Perhaps he is objecting to it still.  We all thought in our time that it was necessary in order to encourage export, but the Minister did condemn it.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy not remember that I brought in a Supplementary Estimate for this purpose at the end of last session?  Under the existing legislation, I had to fix the subsidy before the date of export. Under the subsidy scheme, it is fixed in retrospect.  You look at what the average price was for the previous fortnight and the bounty is related to that.  I have to change the procedure under the Pigs and Bacon Act to make that procedure legal.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that he intended to bring in an amendment. The amendment he intends to bring in is that it may be made possible, or made legal, to compel the curers to export a certain proportion of their output and killings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not see any objection to that because if some curers are at a disadvantage in exporting and others are not up against that same disadvantage and were exporting, then it does appear to me that it would be fair that they should all bear the burden.  But is not one way or another sufficient to deal with this?  If there is a levy on all pigs, whatever it may be, that is paid into a fund and the man who exports is recouped for whatever disadvantage he has.  It appears to me that would be sufficient and perhaps a better way.  We do know that certain curers have had a long tradition of export and therefore had the connection on the market. Certain curers will, therefore, get a better price than others because they have that connection and name and it might be a mistake to compel curers who never exported to go into the market and to try to build up a name. I would imagine that the pool is a better way.  The sum total coming into the country is better, in my opinion, than in the other way&mdash;than by compelling everybody to export his fair proportion.  However, the Minister may be able to mention other reasons that have not occurred to me. A percentage export would be a better system, in my opinion, and then a subsidy is not necessary at all.  They will all suffer equally together.  If the curer loses 10/- on one pig in three exported, he must make 5/- on the two he sells at home.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill.  I could say a good deal on the question of pigs.  It is a good thing I suppose if Deputy Dr. Ryan agrees with what the Bill provides and the Minister says&mdash;that the prices of grade A pigs are being fixed. I would like to know however, what is going to happen the prices of other pigs.  We are all concerned in this House with building the pig population up to the peak figures we had in 1954, but one of the great discouragements to the pig feeder is grading.  I know, and I do not need to be told, that grading is necessary, but I think that the grading has been very severe and there has been too much profit out of grading.  I have said in this House on three or four different occasions&mdash; several other Deputies have said it and questions have been put down about it&mdash;that when pigs are graded and we have this grade A pig we hope to export, nobody knows what happens all the other classes down to this X grade because the bacon is all sold at the same price when it comes into the shops.  I have had bacon curers protest to me that that is not so but I replied to them: &ldquo;Well, why not identify that bacon and mark it with the number of its grade down the whole side.&rdquo;  I mention that to the Minister again and whenever the question of pigs comes up, I shall always mention it.</P>
      <P>There is a matter which does not really arise on the Bill but I would crave your indulgence, Sir, in respect of it.  It is the matter of live pigs as against dead grade A pigs for export. It was rumoured freely some time ago that the bacon curers were endeavouring to obtain a concession from the Minister and from the Government that, if and when it would be profitable to ship live pigs, they should be the people to do it.  That would be a retrograde step and I will tell you why&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister say that, but I would like it to go down on the record also that, when we were not exporting any pigs at one time during the Minister's first term of office and when pigs were getting more plentiful and the prices began to suffer, they consistently fell and the bacon curers, God help them, could not pay any more.  However, the Minister in his wisdom removed the restriction on the export of live pigs and people over whom, I might say, the bacon curers had no control, stepped in, and bought the pigs at the various fairs and markets in this country.  That was the reason the Irish farmer got £3 per cwt. more for these pigs because the pigs were shipped over the Border.  It was also the reason for grading being done away with.  All pigs became grade A pigs over night.</P>
      <P>I know Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that we want to make sure no group of men, no matter who they may be, will have control over the whole of our export business, live and dead; that it should be free to anybody, if he has the money, the way and the trade, to step in at any time and buy live pigs to ship them. It may be argued we should keep the pigs at home to cure them in our own factories.  My answer to that is that if the factories want them, let them pay for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan mentioned about maize before the war. It was a matter of opinion whether the feeding of maize or home-grown crops was the more profitable.  Surely his memory cannot be so bad that he fails to remember he had to bring in an Act or an Order here and have oats mixed with maize in order to compel the Irish farmer to use the oats.  The maize was so cheap at one time that it did not pay to feed the oats.  I should just like to say that in passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret for me to have to sit in this House and listen to the figures that the Minister <Col N="267" /> mentioned and the figures that Deputy Dr. Ryan mentioned that were supposed to be peak figures, when I remember the fine peak figures we had before Deputy Dr. Ryan got into action and smashed the pig trade to pieces.</P>
    <P>I want to remind Deputies that it was Deputy Dr. Ryan who brought in the Pigs Bill of 1936, 1937 and 1938, and that that was the first time the Irish pig feeder ever heard of grading.  That was the first time the bacon curers were given complete control of the Irish pig trade.  That was the first time an Irish bacon curer was brought before the Prices Commission and it was proved beyond a doubt that his profits were no longer profits but had risen to such a height that they could be called plunder&mdash;£800,000 excess profits in a year out of pigs that were making only 50/- a cwt.! I mention that again and I want to put it on the records of this House to show the danger of this House legislating at any time to turn over the pig trade, or any of our trades, to any group.</P>
    <P>Whatever profit or whatever progress was made in the cattle trade in the past five or six years was not made by our legislating the cattle trade out of business but it was made because of the fact that, if the factories wanted cattle, they could go and buy them, or if the cattle dealers could pay more for them, they could buy them.  I hope I have made myself clear to the Minister and to Deputies on the other side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They did get them for nothing.  I will quote the figures.  They got them from 44/- per cwt.&mdash;that was the lowest&mdash;up to 54/- per cwt., and I remember clearly reading at that time, when it was debated in this House, that bacon was selling at 112/-.  They were doing all right at the time.  Wages were low, outgoings were low, and they were getting more than 100 per cent. They had all the pig producers of Ireland at their mercy.  Deputies, especially farmer Deputies, should know that I would not come in here and make irresponsible statements in regard to a matter that was close to me and that meant so much to me.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo; pigs, as they are called now, very fat pigs, were sent to the furnace towns and steel cities of England. There was a trade then for that type of pig and there may be a trade in the future.  People who work in furnaces have whatever fat is in their bodies sweated out and they crave fat and eat fat pork.  Heavy pigs were sent to the Birmingham market.  They were sent first to the bacon sellers in Ireland and the bacon curers' men said they were too heavy or too fat, as the case may be, and the people who owned them shipped them.  It would be a good outlet for us if we could have a live pig trade again.  I am glad that the Minister has given me an assurance.  I hope that when we have a live pig trade again, it will not be the monopoly of any small group of men in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down comes from an area in which there was a good deal of pig production at one time and in which there were many pig jobbers and bacon factories. I am sure that over the last century pigs and bacon were often a live issue in the Deputy's immediate <Col N="269" /> area.  We do not agree, however, with some of the statements the Deputy has just made, such as that it was possible for a factory to make all the profits he mentioned out of bacon at one time.  The history of the Pigs and Bacon Acts of 1935 and 1937 is well known to many Deputies.  It was necessary to bring in that legislation at that time, following legislation passed by our neighbours across the water.  That was the origin of the Pigs and Bacon Act of 1935.</P>
      <P>Pig production was as profitable at that time, although the economic war was on, and all the rest of it, as it is at the moment.  The number of pigs produced was maintained pretty well during all that period and we have never been able to produce as many pigs as we had at the commencement of the last world war.  Whether the legislation did good or harm, anything that has happened since has not improved matters.  The Deputy is sitting behind a Minister who is all-powerful, with a majority behind him.  If he can persuade him that it would be much better to do away with all legislation regarding the sale, production, export of pigs and all the rest of it, it is up to him to do so and to persuade his colleagues.</P>

      <P>There is no use in criticising existing legislation, if the suggestion is not that the Minister should abolish it.  We do not know what the result of that would be.  We do know that, at the moment, as we have no exports of bacon, there is no necessity for any of the legislation.  We need not regiment or control the industry, or have inspectors, or anything else. If we do not increase pig-production, by whatever means, so that there will be an exportable surplus, there is no necessity whatever for all this legislation. We can just continue to produce bacon to suit the consumers' needs. The same could be said to apply to all the legislation in operation about butter, if we have not an exportable surplus of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is at the <Col N="270" /> moment, but, if we had not, we would not be concerned with the legislation governing butter.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to think that, as a result of this piece of legislation, producers will considerably step up production. It is true that, as a result of grading, we need more pigs than we ever did in order to supply our own needs and have an exportable surplus. I calculate that in the past, one-fourth of the pigs at least were between 16 and 22 stone live-weight.  If we aim at producing only grade A pigs, they must be marketed under 16 stone&mdash;15 stone live-weight.  Therefore, the number produced must be increased by 25 or 30 per cent. over the number produced pre-war.</P>
      <P>We hope that this guaranteed minimum price for grade A pigs will bring about the desired result.  I often have doubts about it because I agree with the Deputy from Waterford who said that the grading of pigs did damage in the beginning.  As time goes on, I suppose it will not have that effect.  It did damage production.  Producers were only getting 50 per cent. of their pigs into the grade A class and the other grades were sold at a very bad price, with the result that producers were not getting an economic price.  If producers get a fair price and a fair profit, they will produce.</P>
      <P>It is very significant that, since the Minister took office less than 30 months ago, the pig population has reduced by 20 per cent.  The Minister tries to maintain that that was because of the agreement that he made with Great Britain just before he left office expired during that period.  I think it expired only this year.</P>

      <P>Last June, yes.  The number of pigs began to fall very considerably before last June and I want to suggest, if the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, that the Minister is engaged on the production end of it; he will be engaged on the export end of it when there is a surplus to export; but there is another end of it that is operating here and which damaged pig production in the last 24 or 30 months, that is, the interference all the way, <Col N="271" /> for other purposes.  The bacon put on the market in this country has become a political weapon and has been operated by a section of the Government as a political weapon.  That has done more damage since this Government took office than anything else that has happened.  The pig population was reduced during the war but that was when there was not enough food to feed them, when there was hardly enough food to feed human beings.</P>
      <P>I asked a question yesterday of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the number of occasions on which there were changes in the retail price of bacon in the last two years.  The reply was that from February, 1955, there were 25 change Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the price of bacon.  I do not care what this House does in the matter of providing funds to guarantee the price of pigs or what the Minister may do; pig production will not increase while that is going on.  We have no export of bacon at the present moment and that is the cause of it. Another matter is the price of offals on which we had a discussion quite recently in the House.  Those are the two matters that come under the control of another Minister who has nothing to do with agricultural production at all.  While that is going on we will not get any increased production of pigs no matter what the guaranteed price is.</P>

There were five different sets of prices for pigs in an Order made in February, 1955, and in the last 18 months, since February, 1955, 25 Orders have been introduced.  I am surprised at the Minister for Agriculture sitting as a member of the Government where that is going on.  I have got some information also that since January, 1954, the average price paid per cwt. dead weight for pigs bought for bacon or for pig carcasses at the factory has <Col N="272" /> changed almost every month.  That is what sets all the producers in this country mad, fit for mental hospitals &mdash;these price changes.  A farmer will get so much a cwt. for his bacon pigs this week; next week he will get a different price and the following week another price, all because of the way the Minister for Industry and Commerce changes the price up and down every week.</P>
      <P>The price of mill stuffs that the farmer produces or which he buys in the shops, whatever way he may be feeding his pigs, does not change as often as that.  The cost of bacon does not change as often as that.  It is down at the moment.  The latest figure is for 6th October, 1956.  In the latest price Order it is in grade 6; in September it was in grade 7; in August, grade 8, and early in August, grade 9; in July it was grade 10.  It is down almost to the lowest at the moment. There is one grade lower than that at which the price of bacon is being retailed.</P>
      <P>I make the charge that there is an absolutely political purpose associated with this question of bacon production. I make that charge and I suggest to the Minister he is losing his time if he cannot stop that, and continues to sit as a member of the Government while that is going on.  He has no business asking the agricultural community for higher production of bacon. We all want to see a higher production of bacon and higher exports if possible. Even in the economic war when things were very difficult, when there was a blistering tax on our bacon going into England, we were still able to get it in there and we still maintained our population of pigs.  There is a blight on it now because of the operations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the price of cereals and wheat offals and the fixation of the price of bacon.  If the Minister makes an Order reducing the price of bacon this week it is as certain as the sun is in the heavens that next week the price of pigs will drop, and that is going on in a see-saw fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I am a scamp when I annoy him.  The Exchequer of this country has been asked for a substantial contribution to create a pool in order to enable the export of pigs when we have them.  All the taxpayers of the country will be paying into that pool.  Every farmer who produces a pig will pay into that pool, whether it is a grade A, B or C pig.  He must pay into that pool whatever levy is imposed by the Pigs and Bacon Commission. It is up to 5/- or thereabouts at the moment.  At the present time we are consuming the produce of 700,000 pigs in the country.  The number of pigs has dropped by 200,000 in two years, or a little over, of the Minister's term of office.  The Minister got a lot of joy one time in this House out of the fact that the pig population was so low when the war ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister, in the Fianna Fáil Government's time they ruined the farmers by reducing the number of pigs in the country.  That was during the war period when there was no food available except for human beings.  That is when the pig population dropped.  They were competing with human beings for the food that was available.  Now there is no scarcity of food and no competition between human beings and pigs or any kind of animals and the pig population has dropped.  This Bill will not stop it while the Minister for Industry and Commerce has free rein to do what he likes with bacon and to change the price up and down, with a would-be guarantee of 245/- from the Minister. There is no control whatever over the majority of pigs before they reach the factory.  All producers are not in a position to deliver whatever few pigs <Col N="274" /> they may have direct to the bacon factories.  Some of them may live 50 or 60 miles away from a factory.  The result is that their pigs pass through many hands and no effort is being made in this piece of legislation to ensure that the producer shall get a minimum price for his pigs under all circumstances.</P>

      <P>There is provision here in relation to the colour of pigs. Deputy Dr. Ryan has already adverted to that.  I have been told by a good pig breeder that he had a throwback recently and he had some discolouring in a litter.  He never had a black pig in his life.  He cannot understand what has happened.  Now he may have a little of that over a certain period and the Minister should make some provision to meet that type of case.  On the question of the production of barley and the feeding of barley, it would be a good thing if the wheat offals produced could be sold at the cost of production and not have them utilised for the subsidisation of flour and bread.</P>

      <P>They should not be used by the Minister for Finance to subsidise the price of flour.  It was proved conclusively that, in the last financial year, he took over £600,000 out of that fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely true and the Minister cannot prove otherwise. As compared with the administration of the late Deputy Tom Walsh in the last Fianna Fáil Government the price of cereals was stepped up from £22 a ton to £27 a ton within three or four months of this Government assuming office and the resulting profit to the Exchequer was used to subsidise flour. There is no doubt in the world about that.</P>
      <P>Home-grown barley was mentioned by the Minister.  Our farmers will grow all the barley in substitution for maize, the maize that the Minister up to recently swore by&mdash;good yellow meal was the salvation of the country.  We are glad that he has changed.  As a result of Fianna Fáil efforts over the years, we have succeeded in convincing the Minister for Agriculture that there can be grown on the land of this country all the cereals necessary to feed our people and our animals.  That is what the land should be used for. We are bringing in pollard and bran at the moment from the ends of the earth.  It is coming through the Suez Canal.  We are buying it in Africa and all over the world.</P>

      <P>The position is that here we are trying to do something to remedy a situation and, just because it is this side of the House and not Deputy Allen's side which is taking those steps, Deputy Allen does not approve.  With regard to wheat offals, does the Deputy not know that there is no cost of production.  They are offals.  The best we can do at any time and the fairest thing to do is to make sure that our farmers get these offals at the same price as that obtaining in the British market, or any other market, in which they sell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister reduced the price of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the world price of offals to do with the price of wheat here?  The production of pigs is not one in which we can look for a very large profit on each single animal. We must compete with the Danes, the Dutch and the British producers themselves if we are to export pigs.  When we do that, we are competing with people who keep pigs in large numbers in well-ventilated, well-constructed houses where there is a minimum of labour and a maximum of pig-meat gain for every lb of meal fed.  We must look for an economy which will bring us certain profits and which will bring the farmers their biggest single profit with the exception of that on cattle raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> We will not be on a feather-bed market.  We have got to compete.  A Bill such as this, designed to set up machinery to regularise prices and seeking to put a floor under grade A pigs, is a good Bill.  It is the only basis we have on which to work.  A considerable lot has been said about the grade A pig; it has been said that such a grade is too severe.  I do not agree.  As a pig producer myself, I send my pigs to the factory and I have to take my grade.  When we were exporting bacon we were selling it at low prices because the quality was not as good as that of our competitors, notably the Danes.</P>
    <P>In future we must proceed on a basis that will reward the farmer who does his job well.  We can produce grade A pigs out of the large white as well as out of any other breed.  I know a farmer who kept 1,000 large white pigs and his average of grade A pigs was 80 per cent.  Is that not an excellent result We must try to achieve a greater average of grade A pigs, and if that is to the detriment of the man who produces the other type there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of corn, I will not indulge in any lengthy remarks.  I will say that we must produce quite a large quantity of our own barley and that we must feed quite a bit of it on our farms if we are to get a profit from our pigs.  The cost of manufacturing the barley, after haulage from the farm, into compound feeding stuffs is extraordinarily high. The cost of the traveller who sells the product is extraordinarily high.  The cost of the sacks into which the meal is put is extraordinarily high.  We must, therefore, feed quite a large proportion of our barley on the farm itself.  At the same time, we must remember that a great number of farmers at the moment sell a big proportion of their barley as a cash crop and that they will continue to do this for the next 20 or 30 years.  The Minister has taken pride in the fact that all the barley produced has been collected this year.  That is a good thing.  I think that when the acreage increases we shall have more to say about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> Unlike Deputy Allen, I have the utmost confidence in the Minister.  I believe that he will create the new machinery required for the marketing of barley that is not fed to pigs.  I should like to refer briefly to the marketing of pigs.  I believe a difficulty is encountered at the moment in the sale of grade A bacon.  I do not think there is any need to brand a whole side of bacon.  As the Minister said here on a memorable occasion, everybody wants a back rasher but he did not know of the pig that walked on back rashers or that rolled in the mud on back rashers.  The difficulty is for the shopkeeper to sell any bacon except grade A bacon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What do they do with the rest of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot of it goes into sausages and other products.  I do not think there is any necessity for the straight marking of bacon as grade A, B or C.  As regards the fixing of areas, I think that is a good idea.  It is most uneconomic to take pigs in lorries from Donegal to Cork or from Louth to somewhere else, except in situations where factories in certain areas suffer from scarcities and must be supplied or go out of production.  However, there is no reason why the pig producer should be called on to pay the freight in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision, which is contained in existing legislation, which makes it an offence to keep any pig other than the large white.  We must grade up our pigs and the decision to grade them up has been exclusively worked through our large whites. There has been great criticism of that pig.  Alternative breeds have been suggested; alternative breeds have been introduced by the back door. You will probably get as good results from the large whites as from any other breed in the world to-day.  We see that the Americans have taken a few of our large whites for breeding purposes.  They did that for a twofold reason: (1) because the large white was acknowledged as the third most efficient breed, and, (2), which was a more serious consideration, because it was extraordinarily free from disease. <Col N="281" /> Finally, I should like to say that I welcome this Bill.  For as long as I can remember, the price of pigs has been going up and down.  That will not be so in future, whether or not Deputy Allen likes it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Donegan, I welcome the Bill.  I cannot understand how Deputy Allen and Deputy Dr. Ryan could not have got together outside the House.  I might say the same thing to Deputies Lynch and Donegan.  However, I suppose a bit of variety within the Parties is welcome. The bugbear of the bacon trade has been price variation and if this Bill can stop that&mdash;it appears to be able to do it&mdash;and if it puts a firm floor under the price of bacon pigs, a very good step will have been taken.</P>
      <P>It is a bit depressing for me to look back to the period round about 1939, when there was a commission on agriculture, before which I remember giving evidence on behalf of a group of pig producers in County Donegal, and to remember the sort of pious hopes expressed as to what was to be done and as to the courses that should be followed, and to realise how little has been done in the interim period. Admittedly, the war did upset things very much, but this Bill seems to me to be the first concrete step towards remedying what was one of the major complaints of pig producers in 1939. That was the variation in prices which caused rapid fluctuations in the number of pigs produced and helped to bedevil the entire industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not complete stability will be achieved by the Bill or whether there is room for some variations I do not propose to know.  Just how far the home price of bacon might&mdash;because it would require too big an amount to subsidise the producer's price for bacon pigs&mdash;tend to lower prices I do not know.  I do not know whether that may eventually force prices down.  I should hope it would not, but I would like the Minister to consider very seriously and if possible agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan's suggestion&mdash;a very sensible one I thought&mdash;that at least nine months' warning should be given of a change.  I think the suggestion that there should be no question in <Col N="282" /> the Bill that the guarantee ends at any particular time; it should be left open on the terms that the prices will remain the same until notice is given and that notice should be fairly generous.  I do not think that 12 months' notice should be given; nine months' notice would be quite sufficient and it might even be a little less.</P>
    <P>You do not necessarily have to look for an unreasonable cushioning for every owner of every sow: that would be very nice, if it could be done and I assume any Minister in power would do his best, but it might be impossible to secure that.  After all, all the sows in the country are not going to breed in one day, so that whatever effect downward price changes might have would be reasonably well cushioned to the agricultural community if the warning was moderately long.  I do not think you can possibly legislate down to the last individual.</P>
    <P>On this vexed question of grading, I am a bit horrified to find anyone in this year still left with even the amount of nostalgic looking-back that Deputy Lynch indulged in towards the days when there was no grading.  Indeed Deputy Allen went further and he frankly deplored the change.  No worse policy could be put forward in this country than any suggestion that at any time we should revert to the old free-for-all and let everybody decide what sort of pigs he wanted to produce and fatten.</P>
    <P>I know there are farmers who have a sort of hankering that they should be allowed to determine for themselves the type of pig to produce, but it is quite inevitable that the consumers' taste must be considered first.  Anybody who starts producing anything and thinks he can dictate what the consumer should have is making a very great mistake and is going to run into trouble.  You must start from the consumers' wishes and work back and it is the business of any producer to consider the tastes of the consumer.  There is no doubt about it that the trend is towards leaner bacon and that means grade A pigs.  If you once start to mitigate in any way the reduction of prices for animals that do not come up to <Col N="283" /> standard, if you give any sort of cushion to the fellow who does not make the grade even though it may be only a small departure from the standard, you will ruin the scheme.</P>
    <P>The only way, in this case, is to be firm and say that you will guarantee the price for what you want and to the person who cannot produce it you will say: &ldquo;If you cannot produce it, you had better go and do something else.&rdquo;  If you start cushioning the fellow who is a pound or two out&mdash;and I know there is an argument made to the effect: &ldquo;What does a pound one way or the other matter?&rdquo;&mdash;the scheme will be ruined.  The Minister must be very firm and must not give way to any representations from anybody on that score.  Otherwise we will ruin our trade because our only hope of getting in on the export market is to have first quality bacon.  That is what ruined us before on the export market; we could not compete with the Danish bacon and the chief reason for that, I was informed, was not so much that he could not get better Irish bacon than any produced by the Danes, but when a wholesaler in Britain ordered a side of Danish bacon, and when he had seen one, he had seen the lot, because they were as alike as peas in a pod.</P>
    <P>I remember a big wholesaler in London saying that he knew he could with careful selection get Irish bacon better than anything in Denmark but that he could not be sure if he ordered 100 sides of Irish bacon he would not get big variations in quality and colour.  It was standardisation that made the Danish market in Britain and that is what we have to get.</P>
    <P>On that point of grading, I did not quite catch the reply the Minister gave to somebody yesterday&mdash;I think it was yesterday&mdash;about grade A pigs which became grade B bacon and grade B pigs which became grade A bacon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>To me that was a most disturbing thought.  I could quite appreciate that a pig that was grade A because of some defect which turned <Col N="284" /> up which was not visible earlier, could become grade B, but it is not so easy to see how it could be the other way round.  There may be a very good reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Grade B pigs can become grade A middle while having a grade B shoulder; but if the pig fails in any one of three points of measurement it is grade B bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that some attention will be paid towards the percentage of grade B pigs that go into grade A bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is microscopic.  In my experience the number of grade A that would have to go into grade B and the number of B that would get into A would balance out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reasonable.  At the time it was given as a percentage and as I did not know the original numbers, the percentage did not convey very much.  That is reasonably satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The only other point I would like to make is with regard to Deputy Allen's complaint about people having pigs and having many miles to go to the factory before they can sell them. There is a perfectly obvious way out of this.  If there is no bacon factory near, let the producers in the area form a group and market their pigs themselves at the factory.  We did that in Donegal in 1937 and it was most successful.  We would have beaten the pig jobbers out of the county but for the war coming and upsetting things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing radically wrong in Ireland is the daft, medieval system of marketing which the farmers themselves seem to want to carry on.  This applies particularly to cattle, but it applies to pigs also.  I remember men on my own committee stating that a pig jobber was able to pay more than the factory and they were convinced of that, even though the jobber had to sell the pigs to the factory himself. How the bacon factory could keep open on that principle I do not know, but that was firmly believed.  It is often amazing how silly propaganda <Col N="285" /> put out by the pig jobbers sinks in, while any amount of facts and figures produce no results.  However, if there are marketing difficulties, I think the producers should take over and do their marketing themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they still do it in your county?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we do not need to do it now because we have a couple of bacon factories and their agents come and collect the pigs.  There is no marketing problem now but there was at that time and our marketing operation was very successful.</P>
      <P>On the question of the use of barley, I could not agree more than I do with the sentiments expressed by everyone on the subject.  I wish both Parties would realise how sick, tired and fed up the people are&mdash;at least in my constituency&mdash;with the spectacle of one side blaming the other.  It is a highly desirable thing that we should grow barley to feed to pigs but I am not so happy about the suggestion which seems to come from Deputy Allen and Deputy Donegan with regard to the provision of storage.  I am not so sure that that is a good thing to do.  It means the sinking of what is very scarce in this country, capital, into physical assets which are of practically no use for anything else except the purpose for which they are designed. I think it is a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is too much barley in relation to the storage space available, the farmers should be encouraged by a price differential to stack it and keep it.  There is no better form of storage since no grain can be lost.  I do not like what has happened in regard to wheat.  It is terrible that we should have £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 sunk in something when we might have done better by way of an improved price differential to encourage people to stack the wheat.  If we rapidly approach the point in regard to barley that there is more of it available than the market can handle during the few weeks of the harvest, the Minister should carefully consider offering a better price differential and ensure that the farmers will stack the barley <Col N="286" /> themselves and condition it in the best possible way as most grains condition best in the stack.</P>
    <P>I think mechanisation can be overdone in this country.  I congratulate the Minister on ending another piece of emergency legislation.  Obviously, it is very desirable to have all these things wrapped up as soon as possible. This Bill is another step in that direction, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said.  I am glad he agrees that the sooner we get down to the business of covering the various points needed in statutes the better.  I am sorry he did not manage to convince Deputy Allen that the Bill was as good as Deputy Dr. Ryan thought it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to follow in the path of the previous speaker I would probably find myself speaking about breeding, grading and pig testing and I would be still much nearer the mark than I would be if I started to talk about stooking and stacking the grain.  But I do not propose to go so far afield and the few remarks I have to make I shall try to make in as short a time as possible.  I did not think the debate on this Bill would have dragged out so long.  I know the Minister is anxious to get away to his tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things which always intrigues me is the way in which the Minister can fulminate.  Another thing is his incandesence&mdash;the way he can illumine the ship of State to replace the dark spectre painted by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister congratulates us because of the fact that the bulk of the population are in the happy position of having eaten so much bacon that we are all overlapping on the curves.  In his remarks he made <Col N="287" /> a reference to the amount of barley produced in the constituency which I represent.</P>
    <P>At least 50 per cent. of the barley produced is produced in that constituency and in the counties adjoining it.  The funny thing is that, while barley is a primary product in the production of bacon, we cannot boast of the fact that East Cork is a highly intensive bacon producing area and this gives rise to the fact that barley as a primary product in the production of bacon is transported out of the constituency into what are the bacon feeding areas.</P>
    <P>East Cork is an area in which a considerable number of pigs is not produced, and yet it is a barley producing area but I think the Minister was inconsistent when he urged us in East Cork to walk our barley off the producing farms.  If that could be done I know it would be the ideal situation but I am at a loss to know how the Minister can reconcile the suspension of grants for the erection of grain lofts in that constituency and in the country generally.  I want to appeal to the Minister to treat the erection of grain storage as as urgent a matter as the erection of cow byres.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to reconsider the suspension and to restore the grants for the erection of grain stores.  There is no use saying you can produce pigs on the farm where barley is produced if you have not storage space for the grain there.  Again, there is the question of drying plants but I think that is a bit outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy rule out the storage of grain in stacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As the Minister is aware, the storage of grain in stacks is bound to lead to wastage in wet and stormy weather and farmers generally try to get threshing done in the harvest. That, as far as I am aware, is the practice in the grain producing areas in the south.  It is only on very few farms that you have early spring threshing.  I think that if farmers were encouraged to provide storage space for grain it would be an incentive <Col N="288" /> to increase the production of pigs in the area and it would considerably reduce both the expenditure and the losses incurred in marketing by grain growers who have no storage space and who at threshing time sell the grain to grain merchants and then buy it back in a miller's bag as they require it.  The fact that we eat so much bacon is not so much a factor as the fact that we are unable to make any substantial or constant increase in our export of bacon.</P>
      <P>Only last week, I had an opportunity of examining figures of the imports of bacon from the main exporting countries into Great Britain.  I discovered that, for the week ending 20th October, 1956, the export of Irish bacon to Great Britain represented something like .03 per cent. of the total consumption of bacon there in that week.  I have the figures of the main exporting countries and they will give some idea of our position in relation to our competitors.  For the week ending 20th October, 1956, the Danes exported to Great Britain 3,800 tons; Holland, 700 tons; Poland, 800 tons; the Irish Republic, 280 tons; Hungary, 80 tons; South Africa, 50 tons; Sweden, 300 tons, and Great Britain themselves produced 3,000 tons. Strange as it may seem, these are figures which I got from one of the directors of the Danish Bacon and Wholesale Company over there.  How could we hope to make any impression when that figure substantially represents our contribution to that enormous market?</P>
      <P>Again, we have to realise that, even though the amount is so small that it could be consumed in one small centre &mdash;if we were exporting&mdash;we have nothing like the marketing facilities of our competitors there.  I was amazed to discover that the Danes have over 40 marketing centres situated in the main centres of population.  Not alone that, but, on British soil, they have erected their own bacon-smoking plants.  They are able to distribute their bacon direct from their own smoking plant to the bacon trade in all the highly concentrated centres of population.  That is our difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount we export is so small <Col N="289" /> that we cannot create a taste for Irish bacon over there.  If and when, as we all hope, there is an increase in the export of bacon from here, one of the things we must do is to improve our marketing facilities over there.  I was amazed to discover that much of our bacon is handled by the Danish marketing companies there.  One of the directors of the Danish company informed me that, among his orders for Danish bacon, at different times would come an order for, say, so many sides of Irish bacon.  He would then have to get the bacon from our agents in London and distribute it himself to his own regular customers.  That will give some indication that, not alone have we failed to produce the quantity that would create a market, but we suffer from the further disability that our production is mainly seasonal.  The highest figure the Minister can quote for any year represents only a trickle so far as the consuming market on the other side is concerned.  We suffer from the disadvantage of being unable to continue to export that product over the whole year.  Our production of bacon, in the main, is seasonal.  We have a long way to go even when we develop grade A bacon and are able to export the bacon in sufficient quantities. Then we have got to develop a proper marketing system at the other side.</P>
    <P>I wonder if a stabilised price of 235/- will be the biggest incentive to an increase in our exports to Great Britain.  The amount we consume at home is not the factor in our present financial position: the main factor is the amount we will have available for export.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that the Minister was ready to reply and therefore I shall try to be very brief.  I welcome this Bill because I think it is a very good Bill.  It will give stability to the pig and bacon trade as a whole in this country.  It will be of particular interest to the people in congested areas in the West of Ireland where, to a very large extent, they rely on pig production.  I think those people will be very pleased that this Minister, by the introduction of this Bill, has <Col N="290" /> taken steps to put a sound floor under the whole industry.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, the unfortunate ups and downs of prices for pigs and bacon over a considerable number of years have caused serious uncertainty and many farmers who were good bacon producers went completely out of business.  It is unfortunate that that should have happened, but there is not use in crying over spilt milk.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, this Bill will give the stability that is required to help this industry.  I agree thoroughly with Deputy Moher on the question of marketing our bacon.  We do not seem to have gone into the matter as thoroughly as the Danes, the Dutch and other people have for the purpose of ensuring that our very good bacon customer across the water is properly treated.  I have no particular love for the British, any more than anybody else in this House, but neither have I any hatred for them.  They have been very good customers for our bacon.  If, to-day, we are not exporting very substantial quantities of bacon to England, I think that, in the main, it is our own fault.</P>
      <P>We should appreciate that to-day's bacon market is a very competitive market and for our bacon factories at home to be communicating by telephone across the water with merchants, wholesalers and retailers, who require bacon from time to time, with the amount of delay that naturally arises, is not a good method of handling the industry.  I would like the Minister to consider the suggestion of Deputy Moher in that regard and try to establish distributing centres in England.  It is worthy of note from the figures he quoted that the percentage of our bacon sold to Britain at the present time is very poor indeed, having regard to our geographical position in relation to England and considering that many of our competitors live so far away.  It is proof positive that there is something wrong and I would urge on the Minister the necessity, as Deputy Moher has already done, of considering proper distributing centres in parts of England where we have a good market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The question of grading of pigs has been gone into thoroughly.  We must realise, having regard to the facts as already stated, the keen competition of the present time.  It is of the greatest importance to have our bacon graded.  There were times in this country when we could sell the heavier types of bacon at home and we also had a foreign market for them.  That market seems to have disappeared and to-day the market for heavy pigs is very small.  I want to tell the Minister, and he is probably aware of it, that there is a system in operation in this country that is, if you like, detrimental and defeating its own purpose. It is the purchase of pigs on a live weight scale.  Farmers come in and get a certain price for pigs up to 16 stone weight, regardless of the particular grade, which might be either A, B, or C.  It is a flat price that is paid and the average farmer sells on the live weight scale to the factory agent. He is not compensated for producing grade A pigs.  That being so, he does not mind which type of pig he turns out.  He still continues the old method of pig production&mdash;feeding rapidly and with the wrong foodstuffs, foodstuffs which are wasted.  That has been very convenient for farmers in some areas but, while it continues, you will naturally have a lot of heavy pigs coming on the market.</P>
    <P>I understand from people engaged in the bacon industry that it is worthy of note that pigs purchased at fairs by dealers are sent direct.  But farmers have a higher percentage of grade A pigs than pigs sent in from the live weight scales.  Where bacon factories are within a reasonable striking distance I would not like to see that system seriously discouraged.  I do not know what steps the Minister will take to deal with that situation.  I myself engage in the pig business and I naturally know something about it. Perhaps if the Minister took action it would put such people out of business but I would rather consider the industry as a whole than consider my own interests in the matter.  There are many people engaged in this way, in the purchase of pigs, and paying farmers on the spot.  While it may be <Col N="292" /> convenient it does, at the same time, have the effect of keeping up a higher percentage of grade B and C pigs.</P>
    <P>On the question of the growing of barley I should like to say that in the West of Ireland, particularly in the part I come from, land is so poor, in the main, that it is hardly fit for growing a lot of barley and we must rely on the producers in other counties to produce the necessary barley for our requirements.  It is, therefore, of the greatest importance that people in the congested areas would be able to purchase barley at keen prices.  That is the grumble of my neighbours.  They do not grumble so much about the price of bacon which they say is fair enough if the feeding stuffs were cheaper.  That is our problem.  It is a serious problem.  I do not know how the Minister is going to get around it. At the present time, maize is very expensive and then again the Minister discourages, and rightly so, the use of maize as far as possible, but even barley is not always readily available at an economic price in the congested areas.  If the Minister can do anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, potatoes are quite plentiful but I think the Minister would much prefer the producers to go on barley and skim milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like them to grow potatoes this year and barley next year and also produce skim milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case the point I have made to the Minister is that feeding stuffs could be made available more cheaply.  I think it would be of great advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to people having up to 1,000 pigs.  That is quite a lot of pigs to have for any one individual but no such gambling in pig production goes on in my part of the country.  People have pigs in twos and threes and some may have four or six.  I would say to the Minister in all seriousness, if people could be encouraged to go into the production of small lots of pigs it would be very healthy for the Irish economy and better than having people gambling <Col N="293" /> with a couple of thousand pigs who get out of business in a flash.  These people, to my mind, are more or less undesirable in business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again welcome the Bill, which seems to me to be most desirable, for the purpose of putting a flow in the pigs and bacon industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies will recall the undertaking which I gave to the House on the question of temporary legislation.  I undertook that such legislation would be carefully examined to see the extent to which it is still required and that, where it was necessary to retain certain powers, permanent legislation would be introduced to replace the temporary provisions.  This is the permanent legislation relating to the production and price of flour and wheatenmeal.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to give extended life to Orders which, in the normal way, would lapse with the expiry of the Supplies and Services Act.  The Orders under which the controls are at present exercised are the Flour and Wheatenmeal Order, 1956, and the Flour and Wheatenmeal Order, 1955 (Amendment) Order, 1955.  The main provisions of these Orders are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  When wheat is being cleaned preparatory to milling not more than 2½ per cent. of the wheat may be removed as screenings.</P>
      <P>(b)  Millers may not make or sell any flour or wheatenmeal other than &lsquo;straight run&rsquo; flour and standard wheatenmeal.</P>
      <P>(c)  Flour and wheatenmeal of different kinds may not be sold in excess of fixed maximum prices.</P>
      <P>(d)  Flour and wheatenmeal may not be sieved by bakers and others who use flour and wheatenmeal for the purposes of their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e)  Wheatenmeal and flour other <Col N="294" /> than flour of a certain extraction may not be used in the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery.  This restriction makes it illegal to use subsidised flour for the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery.</P>
    <P>(f)  The Minister may, by permit, give relief from any of the prohibitions contained in the Orders and may attach to the permits such conditions as he thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A difference&mdash;but not a difference in principle&mdash;between the provisions of the Bill and the provisions of the Orders which will be allowed to expire is that the prices for &ldquo;straight run&rdquo; flour and standard wheatenmeal are specified in the Orders, while the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe the prices which may be charged.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice, in administering the flour subsidy, to settle the proportions of native and imported wheat to be contained in the grist which is milled into flour and to prescribe the extraction rates at which the grist is to be milled, that is to say, how much of the products of the milling is to be taken off as flour and how much to be taken off as offal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted Deputy O'Hara's references to the use of live weight scales for buying pigs.  I have a constitutional reluctance to pushing people about.  I am aware that the practice of buying pigs on live weight scales exists in certain parts of the country.  I believe it results in the producer getting less for his pigs than he would get if he sent them to the factory and had them graded.  I am not convinced yet that I have any duty to coerce people to do better for themselves than they are at present doing.  As at present advised, I feel my duty is done when I provide people with an opportunity of getting the value of their produce.  But if they choose to take what appears to them a more convenient course of action and they want to pay for it by accepting a lower price than they otherwise could get, I do not know if I have a duty to constrain them in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Any person is now entitled individually or collectively, as Deputy Sheldon suggests, to bring his pigs to the factory. He is entitled to go in and see his pigs graded.  The officers of my Department attend that pig factory to superintend the grading operation, and if a man is producing grade A pigs, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he will get a better price for his pigs by following that procedure than he will by bringing them to the scale and selling them by live weight, but I think he has a right to make that choice himself.  However, I would be prepared to hear representations that something further should be done. As at present advised, however, it seems to me that the existing provision is sufficient.  I believe that, in the long run, our people will come to realise that the production of grade A bacon is their best bet and I think our experience over the last six months, which shows an increase in the percentage of grade A pigs received at the factories from 54 to 63 per cent., is fairly good evidence that our people are making considerable progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara also said that he thought the marketing system in Great Britain should be improved so that the customer would get the highest possible percentage of top quality bacon from Ireland.  There, again, I am dealing with a large number of factories, some of which are proprietary and some of which are cooperative. I suppose I could ask the Oireachtas to impose upon all these factories a uniform system of marketing in Great Britain, but the fact remains that many of these factories have been in business for close on a century and they have their contacts in Great Britain.  They make the case that by using these old and valued contacts they can market their products better than any other system would market them and I am reluctant to tear up a well-established pattern of trade relations and substitute an untried and new procedure unless there are overwhelming reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Hara has overlooked the fact that we are trying to achieve the end that he has in view, that is, that there should be a uniform <Col N="297" /> supply of top-grade produce.  We are subsidising only the export of grade A bacon.  If anyone wants to send grade B or grade C bacon to England he must market it there at whatever it will fetch.</P>
    <P>The only bacon in respect of which we guarantee a price to the curer is grade A bacon and I am asking the Dáil under this Bill to give me the authority to require every factory, if that should be necessary, to send a percentage of its entire output of grade A bacon to the export market. At present, curers have voluntarily undertaken to operate such a scheme themselves but the curers have said that they would wish me to take that power lest the voluntary agreement should break down and that certain individuals would concentrate all their output on the domestic market to the detriment of others who were trying to meet what they conceive to be their duty in maintaining a constant supply on our export market.  I propose to use the power, if I get it from Dáil Éireann, should it be necessary to do so, in order to maintain constant supplies of bacon on the foreign market, and I would hope ultimately, of uniform quality comparable to the best that Denmark can produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher, I think, dwelt on that aspect of the situation too when he said it was important to maintain uniform quantities and uniform quality.  That is the objective towards which we are moving by the devices to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moher feels that, as we move over to the exclusive use of home-grown barley instead of imported coarse grains, we will have to provide larger and larger storage facilities.  I am sorry to hear him express that view because I think Deputy Sheldon's view is the sounder.</P>
    <P>I think it would be much better if we could enable farmers to spread out the threshing of the barley crop and allow the barley crop to come on to the market gradually.  Deputy Moher has overlooked that, if you provide storage at immense capital cost, the cost of storage per week is appalling and, if you have any kind of central storage, the cost of transporting the <Col N="298" /> barley from the farm to the store, the cost of taking it into the store, the cost of handling it in the store, the cost of taking it out of the store and bagging it and unbagging it and then transporting it to the mill and then grinding it and transporting it thence in the form of meal or compound to the ultimate consumer would be shocking. It would be infinitely better if these charges could be eliminated and, in so far as it is possible, to have the grain consumed on the farm where it was grown or, in the alternative, where there is a surplus available for sale, that it should go straight from the farm to the mill and thence to the consumer. Every intermediate stage adds immensely to the costs and we have got to bear in mind that we are here dealing, not with a product that will be consumed on the domestic market where we can fix the price, but with a product which is the raw material of an export industry and, therefore, we have got to see that the price is kept at a reasonable level.  If there are to be heavy storage charges and heavy transport charges and heavy housing and unhousing charges, either the pig producer or the barley grower will be mulcted for those charges.  I think the man who grows the grain or the man who feeds it is entitled to any profit there is in it.</P>

      <P>Because I have too many.  Unless the Deputy suggests that I should appropriate unlimited millions in each fiscal year.  We are doing at present all that is reasonably prudent to do under that scheme in this fiscal year and we will do as much again next year, please God.  I do not believe that there is any insuperable problem there and I entirely agree with Deputy Sheldon that any device we can operate to avoid piling costs on home-grown grain will be a very material contribution to the successful development of an expanding pig industry based on home-grown grain and skim milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon went rather further in respect of rigidity in grading than I would be prepared to go.  He spoke of being absolutely unbending; that if a man's pig were a pound over the prescribed weight to qualify for grade he would have to take grade B and make the best of it.  I did not take that view and I have deliberately provided what is called grade B.1 which is a grade identical with grade <Col N="300" /> A in respect of fat measurements at the three relevant points on the carcase, but which provides that if a man's pig is anything less than 7 lb. above the maximum weight allowed for grade A it shall be treated as grade B.1. in respect of which he receives 5/- a cwt. less than for grade A.  If his pig is more than 7 lb. overweight then he has to take grade B or what ever grade his pig falls into.  Although I sympathise with the view expressed by Deputy Sheldon I believe I am justified in making that concession.  It is a great hardship on the small man, if he has three or four pigs and a couple of them are a pound or two pounds over weight, to find himself cut 15/- or 20/- a cwt., and it is very hard for a man who has not the facilities for constant weighing to be sure his pig will not go a pound overweight.  However, if a man keeps his pig until it is half a stone overweight it is his own funeral and I can do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Donegan said in respect of offals.  That business about bran and pollard is a dirty, dishonest racket which can do a lot of harm.  If the case is made that an artificial price has been fixed for milling offals to the detriment of pig feeders, a lot of people will believe that and that will do harm and discourage people from pig production. There is not a scintilla of truth in the racket.  It is just a shameful traversty of the facts and the facts are that anyone in this country can buy milling offals anywhere he likes in the world and if he can buy them cheaper in Nagasaki, Peru, Southampton, Le Havre or anywhere else, he can bring them in perfectly freely.</P>
    <P>The price at which mill offals come into the country is accepted as the world price for offals and that figure is incorporated into the millers' accounts as the figure that they are in fact able to get for bran and pollard and that is charged up against them.  If you did not charge that figure up against them the only result would be that the millers would get that figure and if that figure was not debited in their accounts they would get a subsidy on the flour as well to which they would not be entitled.  I know of no other <Col N="301" /> sane system of ensuring to our people bran and pollard at the lowest price at which it is available from anywhere in the world than to ensure that they shall be free to bring it into this country free of tariff, tax or restriction of any kind from anywhere it can be bought.  That is being done and will continue to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Lynch when he suggested that the grading is too severe.  I do not think it is and I would direct his attention to what I have said in regard to grade B.1, because that concession was deliberately made to avoid the possibility of grading imposing an unreasonable hardship on small farmers.  There is now complete freedom to ship pigs for anybody who wants to ship them anywhere. There is no restriction on their shipment and so long as I am Minister for Agriculture I hope there never will be.</P>
    <P>I have explained why the power to impose uniform export percentages is in the Bill and the only remaining points I think I have to deal with are those raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan. While agreeing with me that the black or spotted pig is an undesirable element in our pig population, he asked me to give those who had them on hands a period of grace to get rid of them.  Of course, we have been giving them periods of grace for the last four years and the real fact is that the spotted pigs and coloured pigs we do find from time to time are mainly smuggled over the Border.  Where we find them being used for breeding we will prosecute anyone we so find.</P>
    <P>If people make a traffic of dealing in such pigs we have a duty to prosecute them, but if a person finds, as Deputy Allen suggests, that there is an occasional throw-back and he winds up with a spotted pig and he disposes of it to a factory as soon as he reasonably can, I do not think he will find that the law will be invoked against him in any unreasonable or vindictive manner.  If there is anybody in any doubt about what he should do with a pig with a black spot, let him bring him to the factory as soon as may be and dispose of him, and I do not think he will be harshly treated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I can assure Deputy Dr. Ryan that the number of periods of grace and the number of warnings that have already been issued are legion, but you will always get a few lame dogs who find it hard to conform to the simplest and the most obvious requirements, and even in their case I do not think they will find the Department of Agriculture in any sense unreasonable.  I want to make clear, however, that we cannot, consistent with the best interests of the trade, allow black pigs or spotted pigs to be used for breeding purposes in this country and we do not propose to allow it.  If anybody thinks he can get away with it it is my duty to inform him that he cannot, because the whole interest of the industry would be put in jeopardy if he were allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which everybody has been very chary about but since we have referred so much to it I think it would be foolish for me to sit down without mentioning this matter of the Landrace pig.  I often wonder why people think the Minister for Agriculture for the time being makes a regulation prohibiting something. He does not get any fun out of doing it.  It is always much easier for a Minister for Agriculture to let everybody do what he likes.  What on earth difference can it make to me whether there are Landrace pigs in the country or not?  Why should I lose an hour's sleep over it?  The only conceivable reason why I have resisted the importation of the Landrace pig is that every veterinary authority I have consulted in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic are unanimous in informing me that in their considered judgment the Landrace pig is the vector of atrophic rhinitis, and that they curse the day that they allowed the breed into Great Britain or Northern Ireland; that they have received no benefit from its introduction commensurate with the devastation that outbreaks of atrophic rhinitis have caused them and they have no doubt whatever that, whether it is that the breed has some constitutional tendency to the disease or whether it is that the bone structure of the snout of that breed of pig is peculiarly susceptible to the disease, <Col N="303" /> where the Landrace is you also have atrophic rhinitis and, where the Landrace is not, you do not have the atrophic rhinitis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question?  I think, since the Minister is dealing with this matter, he should give an answer to this proposition: how is it that in Denmark, where the Landrace pig is also subject to this disease, they continued to have the pig?  To what extent does this disease affect the production of pigs in Denmark?  We all know that the pigs in Denmark are the best bacon producers in the world, and the Danish people seem to be altogether on the Landrace pig.  If they have the disease, does it affect them?  To what extent does it affect them?  What is the percentage of loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been in Denmark and I have not got full information of the kind the Deputy seeks but, so far as I know, the answer is that they live with it.  Deputies ought to open their eyes to the fact that one of the advantages of being an island country is that you are kept free from certain veterinary diseases that continental countries have long given up hope of keeping at bay.  We all know that foot-and-mouth is endemic on the Continent and frantic efforts are made to keep it under control.  But it keeps cropping up and, where you have a land frontier, it is virtually impossible to keep it at bay.  They have to live with it.  We all know that rabies in dogs is endemic on the Continent and they have to live with it because long experience has taught them that, with a land frontier, it is impossible to eradicate it as it was eradicated here and in Great Britain during the 1906 Muzzling Order.  There is a whole string of equine diseases from which we are free, but on the Continent they live with them.  They have to; they cannot get rid of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating that breed but the Minister should take the opportunity on some occasion to make a considered statement giving all the facts, as far as he knows them, because <Col N="304" /> many very well-intentioned people who want to increase production say that the pig which has done the good work in Denmark should be imported here to do the same good work.  They know all about the endemic diseases and they say that does not seem to prevent the Danes from making a profit and it should not prevent us from doing likewise. I think the matter should be dealt with fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a great many statements in public on this and I am simply not temperamentally disposed to say: &ldquo;That is my opinion. Let no dog bark.&rdquo;  I can quite see that there can be two views held about this. But this is a deliberative Assembly. The problem is purely a veterinary problem.  If this breed were free from the proclivity to atrophic rhinitis I believe its introduction here would be a matter of indifference.  That is the plain fact.</P>
      <P>I should tell the House that I believe that our own large Irish White is in process at this moment of being graded up to give us as high a proportion of Grade A Wiltshire sides as the Landrace breed would give us.  But I think it is fair to add that the ham of the Landrace pig is as yet distinctly a better average ham.  It is true to say that the ham of the Landrace is better than the ham of the large Irish.  I believe that by a process of selection and progeny testing we can improve the large Irish White; and we are in process of doing that.  If that veterinary element did not enter into the picture, my present inclination would be to say to anybody who wants to bring in the Landrace that he is free to do so.  I am, however, in this position; every veterinary advice I can get here and abroad is unanimous in advising me not to take that veterinary risk involved.  Those who have had experience of bringing in this pig make no disguise that they curse the day they did it, and they have not got anything by way of improved quality to compensate for the loss they have sustained in the endemic character of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has to take a final decision. Somebody has to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or somebody has to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  It would <Col N="305" /> be much easier for me to say &ldquo;Yes, let everyone do what he likes to do.&rdquo; Would any Deputy, if he had the responsibility of being Minister for Agriculture for the whole pig population of the country and if he had that unanimous advice, set all that advice aside and say: &ldquo;There is a clamorous vested interest which wants these pigs in; they are a nuisance and I will give way to them.&rdquo;  Bear in mind&mdash;I think Deputies ought to bear this in mind&mdash; the history of the introduction of a new breed.</P>
    <P>The history always is that there is a great ta-ra-ra-ra-boom-de-ay about the marvellous quality of this new breed. Five or six wealthy men bring in half a dozen sows and a boar and they have perhaps fifty pigs to sell off the first litters.  Now these pigs are sold at sales which are widely advertised.  The virtues of the new breed are proclaimed to all and sundry.  In England, sums of up to 1,200 guineas have been paid for a gilt and sums of up to 1,000 guineas for a boar.  That goes on unto the third or fourth generation.  Then there are a considerable number of these pigs scattered throughout the country.  The bottom falls out of the market and the pigs fall into line with the domestic breeds already there. But all the boys who got in on the ground floor and who did all the tooting and fluting and sounding of horns have got away with the boodle in the first three or four generations.  It is legitimate to do this building up, this propaganda campaign eulogising the virtues of the breed, by those who confidently anticipate that they are getting in on the ground floor and will make a good thing out of it.</P>
    <P>I am in the unfortunate position that I have to take a decision whether, considering the best interests of the whole industry, I should or should not let in the Landrace pig.  For the reasons I have set before the House, I do not think we should let them in. I think the best interests of our people are served by concentrating on progeny testing and improving the breed we have.  I hope to have results within another twelve months.  I hope to have, with proper feeding and correct publicity in regard to proper feeding, <Col N="306" /> up to 70 per cent.  Grade A pigs.  If we attained that I think we would have attained to as good an average as the Landrace pig is in Denmark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that progeny testing and all that gives an improved pig, but I would urge on the Minister to give to the public who are interested in this question the information he has given the House.  If he could do it by mentioning the names of the authorities he has consulted and by giving their reports it would settle the minds of a lot of people in this country.  People throughout the country think that the Department of Agriculture are too conservative in this matter.  They get annoyed about it.  If the Minister gives to the public who are interested the full information he has, and mentions the authorities here and abroad, he would be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether it is expedient to get the Veterinary College to give advice.  I do not think it is expedient to be drawing public servants into the arena of controversial matters.  That is the situation as it stands at present.  It must be obvious to any reasonable person that no Minister for Agriculture wants to pursue a course of conduct just for fun.  There must be a reason of a fairly formidable nature before a Minister for Agriculture would take an implacable stand.  That is the reason and it is the only one.  I do not believe that we should take the risk of making atrophic rhinitis endemic here.  I do not think we should run the risk of losing potential markets we have for the export of pedigree stock.  The fact that we are free from certain diseases gives us a potential for the export of pedigree stock that we would cease to enjoy if we became susceptible to those diseases.</P>

      <P>There has been no outbreak of atrophic rhinitis in this State. In this matter we are not dealing with a contact disease.  But an inherited disease.  Unlike rabies or foot and mouth, atrophic rhinitis is not a communicable disease.  It has the horrible quality in it&mdash;though this is not perfectly clear&mdash;that it appears capable <Col N="308" /> of skipping a generation.  Even if yon bring in these pigs and keep them in quarantine and breed them in quarantine and their progeny show no evidence of atrophic rhinitis you can find that the progeny of the disease free progeny may in fact have the disease. It has that peculiar quality superimposed. It is anybody's bet in these circumstances whether the Minister for Agriculture should let it in, with the virtual certainty that with the breed the disease will come.  If anybody can argue the opposite I am prepared to listen to them.  However, I am particularly concerned with the protection of the disease free status of the country and the industry and I do not believe that this status should be abandoned for whatever advantage might be derived from having the Landrace.  Since we have our progeny testing we should be able to get, from our disease free Irish Large Whites, just as good results as any we might achieve if we brought in the Landrace.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister determined to go on with Section 6, on the question of butter boxes?  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may by regulations provide that empty butter boxes of a specified description shall not be sold save to specified persons and at specified prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> (2)  In this section &lsquo;butter box&rsquo; means a box in which creamery butter has been sold.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might have been necessary when the emergency powers regulation was brought in to cover this point in this way, but surely at the present time the Minister could afford to be without the power given by a regulation prohibiting anybody from selling a butter box. There is no great shortage of timber now in the world.  The Minister adverted to the fact that we are in the process, he hopes, of producing our own butter boxes in our own factories from pressed pulp of some sort, and I do not think, from the point of view of the supply of boxes, it is necessary in present circumstances to have this power.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Fianna Fáil Government took the decision that the Emergency Powers Orders should be got rid of, the Ministers were told to bring forward permanent legislation, and that they must drop unnecessary powers from the permanent legislation, even though these had been in the Emergency Powers Orders.  It seems to me that even if there was a shortage of timber, or if there was a desire, even a necessity, to get these butter boxes back to the original suppliers, this could be met by the creameries themselves, or the suppliers of butter. They could invoice the butter at whatever number of shillings per box it costs, plus a value for the box, or if they wanted to make sure to get the boxes back, they could invoice the boxes at twice their value so that if the shopkeeper who bought the box of butter did not send the box back he had to pay a fine in this case to the creamery for the box he did not return. I think in that way this problem could be met in these days when there is no great difficulty about the supply of timber.  If there was really a physical shortage of boxes, the Minister might be entitled to take such powers to compel shopkeepers to return these boxes under penalty of a £20 fine, as provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, if he has not gone into this matter since the Second Stage, to look at it between now and the Report Stage.  If he does, I think he will make his mind up that <Col N="311" /> this power is not really necessary and that the situation could be handled by the creameries themselves in the case of a shortage of butter boxes, in the way I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall certainly look into it.  I know there is a strong tendency when powers exist to maintain them, very often, beyond the time when it is strictly necessary to do so. I think the only justification for retaining power of this kind at the present time is that the cost of marketing butter can be materially affected by the number of times a wooden box is used, and the creameries are entitled, as the Deputies know, under the price structure for butter to an allowance to cover costs of production, part of which would be the cost of packing, and so forth.  I imagine the reason for retaining this power is in case a situation should arise that inadequate user of wooden butter boxes would raise an additional charge against the Exchequer in respect of the subsidy paid for butter or to the consumer in respect of the prices chargeable for the butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My idea, of course&mdash;and it is the right idea&mdash;would be that a butter box should be used only once and it was with that in mind that I have tried to popularise the fibre-board box, but a great many suppliers are still using these wooden boxes, all the timber for which, it must be borne in mind, is imported from Sweden.  I think I would be able to justify to the House, so long as the commodity was a fairly expensive imported commodity, and so long as the price of butter contains a subsidy element, whether payable by the consumer or the Treasury, that there should be power in the Minister for Agriculture to control the user of butter boxes, even if he did not use it, lest unnecessary cost be thrown on the consumers.  Otherwise, all my sympathies are with the Deputy from the point of view that it seems to be a rather odd power to carry over from the time when it was made to deal with an article which was in very short supply&mdash;which was, in fact, physically unobtainable.  This power was created <Col N="312" /> in order to perpetuate a supply of some kind of boxes, but I imagine the reason for wishing to retain it is what I have suggested to the Deputy now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the price of butter is controlled.  I know there is an allowance for manufacturing and other expenses made to the creameries, but if the creameries want to keep down the costs of production and distribution by getting back the boxes, there is a way in which to do it.  They can invoice the butter at so much per cwt., plus so much for the box, and if the box is worth, say, 2/6, if the creameries urgently require to have these boxes returned in order to keep down distribution expenses, they can invoice those boxes at 5/-.  If the shopkeeper returns the box, he is credited with 5/- and if he does not, the creamery has got 5/- in lieu of the box.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he will be able to come back and listen to the rather difficult query I am going to put him.  The argument which brought me to my feet is, I think, one of the most important issues that has ever been put to the House.  The Minister is taking wide powers to interfere with business transactions between individuals, even to the extent of empowering himself to prevent and prohibit the sale of old butter boxes.  I do not think the desire for unbridled authority has ever gone so far.  I do not think the House has ever before been asked to legislate to give a Minister power, without any restriction whatever upon his use of the power, to prohibit a transaction of that kind.  I cannot find words, really&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the comic interlude has ended and the Minister has come back to his place of responsibility, I put the case to him again. Through this section the Minister asks the House to empower him to prohibit what is in most cases a very trifling <Col N="315" /> transaction.  He asks the House to give him power to prohibit the sale of old butter boxes to any individual&mdash; the sale of an old butter box to a widow, say, for kindling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other uses for old butter boxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister would not prohibit the sale of old butter boxes for the Fine Gael candidates in the next election.  I assume that would be quite a legitimate transaction in his view provided, of course, he can get a candidate to stand on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not knock the candidates off them if they got up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We can find a great deal of humour in this&mdash;a great deal of humour, indeed, because the Minister's proposal is not only audacious but ridiculous.  It provokes laughter in the House when one sees what the Minister is trying to do.  He may &ldquo;by regulations provide that empty butter boxes of a specified description shall not be sold save to specified persons and at specified prices&rdquo;.  That is to say, he could, if he wished.  I am not suggesting the present Minister would do it but, with Deputy Major de Valera, I think that if a Fianna Fáil Minister were to come into this House with a proposal of that sort we should hear from these benches the suggestion that he was taking the power in order to confer a monopoly upon some political henchman.  I am not making that suggestion.  I am perfectly certain that is not the purpose behind this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal may have its origin in the well-known desire of the Minister to control everything that will add, he thinks, to his prestige and stature as a public man but are we justified in giving this power on the basis of the argument which the Minister recommended to the House?  He said that the reason for all this is that there is an element of subsidy in it.  Has the Minister considered how large that element of subsidy is, having regard to the present price of butter, the present manufacturing cost of butter and the <Col N="316" /> present price which the creamery gets for the butter, even though that price is a subsidised price and related to the cost of the butter box?</P>
    <P>I think all of us will recognise, even if we do not express our verbal agreement, that the proposition&mdash;and I am not putting it to the House&mdash;that the element of subsidy represented by the subsidy on the butter box is infinitesimal in relation to the price of butter.  Yet, that is the argument upon which the Minister submitted this to the House.  It may be that, in some Order made under the Emergency Powers Act in the circumstances in which the country found itself during the last Great War, there was a proposal of this sort.  But the war is ten years over.  I hope even the Minister recognises that.  There is no difficulty, I think, in procuring butter boxes at the present moment, nor is there likely to be in the immediate future.  Therefore, why, if a person wishes to dispose of a butter box to another in exchange for coin, should he be prohibited from doing it?  I say &ldquo;in exchange for coin&rdquo; because, so far as I can see, if the person wishes to dispose of the butter boxes not by selling them for legal tender but by barter or exchange, then it would appear to me that the Minister cannot catch him at all.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the sort of thing the House has been getting from the Minister for Agriculture over the past two years.  We have these half-baked proposals submitted to the House.  The Minister makes an eloquent speech, and, hypnotised by his oratory, the House is supposed to accept his proposals without giving them any consideration whatever.  The Minister ought to treat the Legislature with more respect.  When he comes here and submits a proposal, he should at least demonstrate to the House that he has thought out its implications.  He should be able to prove to the House that a power of that sort&mdash;which is in restriction of the right of the individual, about which the Minister used to be so eloquent&mdash;is fully justified by the circumstances of our time.  I do not think that is the case with this regulation. Again, I think it is one of these proposals <Col N="317" /> which has been inspired by the greed of the Minister for authority.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the Minister was on these benches.  When the Government of the day was using every effort to ensure that the nation would not starve, the Minister used to wax eloquent about the arbitrary powers which the Government of the day were taking in those circumstances.  However, those circumstances do not any longer exist.  It appears to me that, since the circumstances are nonexistent, the Minister ought not to seek power to prohibit the sale of an old butter box to an old woman who may need it because she has not any other fuel and that when the Minister comes to the House with a proposal to restrict the rights of the individual, he ought to be in a position to make a better case for that proposal than the one he has made for Section 6 of this Bill to-night.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is prepared to go a substantial distance to give effect to the principles which I wanted to be made effective in <Col N="319" /> amendments Nos. 31 (a) and 31 (b).  He does not go quite the whole way in regard to my objections to Section 38.  I did suggest, when I was speaking on this Bill on the last occasion, that another way of doing this&mdash;I am not stating this controversially&mdash;might be to set up a register of licensed auctioneers in which would be inscribed the names of those who held auctioneers' licences and, who if you like, were members of the Irish Auctioneers' Association.</P>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, I should like to have an opportunity of considering this matter further between now and the Report Stage.  If between now and the Report Stage the Minister will put down his amendment to compromise between the point of view expressed in amendments Nos. 31 (a) and 31 (b) then a great part of my personal objection to this section will be removed, provided that the compromise he suggests would be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The compromise I suggest is that, instead of asking in 31 (a) that every rule which carries the possibility of conviction would have no force or effect, unless the Minister has given his consent, we could provide that every rule carrying the force of a conviction would have to lie on the Table for 21 days, which, I think, is an even greater safeguard.  I am reluctant to get drawn into the day-to-day administration of the board and, as far as I can, I want to keep out, but I see the force of the point raised by Deputy MacEntee, that, in principle, it is a dangerous thing to give a statutory body power to create punishable offences.  I would be prepared to say that any such regulation made would have to lie on the Table for 21 days and, if annulled, cease to have effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to go as far as he can in this direction of safeguard, as he has indicated.  Nevertheless, I have a fundamental objection to this section. I think, on a previous occasion, I went into that objection in considerable detail and that is on the records.  I do <Col N="320" /> not wish to renew it.  It may be summarised in this way: we are in the section handing the power to legislate, delegating the power to legislate by Order, to a board, and, for that matter, a very specialised board, somewhat and rather remotely removed from legislative organisation and procedure. On that occasion I stressed, and so did other Deputies, the attitude which the Minister took on previous legislation of this sort.  I think that, unless it is unavoidable, it is a pernicious thing.  I would be bold enough to claim that the Minister and his colleagues are sympathisers in that point of view.  Here, however, in this section, we find this Parliament being invited to go further than delegating powers to the executive.  It might not be any harm to pause for a moment to see how this thing was developed.</P>
      <P>In former days, the legislative act was the direct Act of the House almost invariably.  As society became more complex and emergencies developed, the practice grew of delegating power to legislate to the executive, but the delegation of that power was always subsidiary to some directing legislation which had been considered in detail and enacted by the Parliament.  It was considered, indeed, that the only function of the Government in making legislation was to give effect to the intention of Parliament.  Now, unfortunately, in the course of two world wars, in Britain, where our parliamentary system in a sense originated, and here in this House during the last world war, it was necessary to rely very much from day to day upon statutory rules and regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody was more vocal to the dangers of that situation of legislation by Order, and nobody was more vocal in the criticism of such Orders as were made, and in the championing of the rights of the Legislature and of the community, than the Minister and his colleagues.  I do not think I am being unreasonable when I urge his former point of view on the Minister.  I do it with a clear conscience because I can recall I did it when I was on the far side of the House.  I cannot be accused of changing my mind.  This is not a case of delegating power to the <Col N="321" /> Minister or to a Government.  If it were, the Minister's answer, I grant him, would in present circumstances be sufficient, but here the Minister is asking this House to delegate beyond him and to relieve him of the responsibility by giving it to a board.</P>
    <P>There is another matter, another very fundamental principle, involved in this&mdash;a fundamental principle of democratic right for the community.  I repeat that&mdash;a fundamental issue in the matter of the democratic rights of the community functioning through their Parliament&mdash;and it is this: that, where this House legislates, it legislates in the name of the community and for the community and the Deputies, all of us who legislate, are originally and ultimately responsible to the electorate, the community functioning as the electorate, and we will have to render an account thereafter when the occasion comes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be very serious and objective about this. When it comes to delegating power to legislate to the executive, the very important relationship is still preserved that the Executive, the Government, are members of this House answerable directly and responsible to this House, which in turn is responsible to the electorate, and on any matter of regulation or order the Government is available, responsible and answerable to this House.  What is happening here?  Here we are passing out&mdash;or invited to do so, if we pass this Bill&mdash; of this House and passing over to a board the power to enact legislation, and a board who have a very restricted interest in the community.  Not only are we handing them the power to legislate, but we are handing them the power to effect legislation in matters affecting the economy of the country in certain aspects and a fairly wide section of the community in its ultimate application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to interrupt for a moment?  In the light of what I have said to Deputy MacEntee, this section now does no more than empower this board to ask Dáil Éireann from time to time to <Col N="322" /> approve regulations.  Its whole active force is gone.  All that remains now is that from time to time the board may draft regulations and put them on the Table of Dáil Éireann, asking the Dáil to give them their approval.  That is all.  If within 21 days, the Dáil says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, there is no regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot say I am in agreement with the Minister in that view, because, on that, I would be equally entitled, if attempting to simplify the situation, to say, as categorically as the Minister, that all it does is to give the Dáil notification that this board has exercised its legislative functions, and it is giving us a <i>fait accompli</i> which in any event we can only receive with all the disadvantages of facing a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>To get back to my argument, I am going to a matter of principle in this. It is not a question of an issue in the ordinary way.  I do not care whether it has been done before or not, but we should not delegate beyond the Government the power to legislate and we should only recognise the power of delegating legislation in the proper executive as a necessary evil&mdash;&ldquo;evil&rdquo; may be too strong a word&mdash;as a necessity which in certain respects is to be deplored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to relate it to certain circumstances in the present day.  There are far too many opportunities and we are becoming accustomed&mdash;and the Minister will please take the statement as an attempted objective statement&mdash;to finding places to unburden unwelcome responsibility. The Minister has made quite innocently the <i>bona fide</i> statement&mdash;and I accept the spirit in which he made it&mdash;that he did not want or that his Department did not want to be bothered with the day-to-day administration of this board.  From the point of view from which the Minister looked at it when he made that statement, many will sympathise with him, but the fact remains that it is too easy to get rid of our responsibility and I can see no reason now at this stage to turn the Minister's own argument back on him, if the matter is to appear on the Table of the House, if machinery is to be invoked and if it is annullable within 21 <Col N="323" /> days.  If the board is to be reduced to the level of merely drafting regulations, then why should not these regulations be made by the proper authority, namely, the Minister in charge?</P>
    <P>That is the question I ask.  Why, when you have got that far, if I accept the Minister's statement that the board is merely a drafting authority, why not draft for the Minister and let the ordinary procedure stand and not be making an inroad into a principle already ravaged sufficiently by incursions in the past?  Why not let that board submit its regulations to the Minister and let the Minister make the regulations?  You have no innovation there.  We are prepared to concede that in such detailed matters it may be necessary to proceed in that way.  The normal safeguards will be there for the House and, even in that case, we would fight for the provision the Minister has graciously accepted now, that is, the opportunity of notice here and <i>ex post facto</i> annulment.  I see no reason why that cannot be done and that is what I will urge on the Minister.</P>
    <P>If this Parliament goes on and if the Government goes further and delegates its responsibility all around the place, it is an easy way of avoiding unpleasant decisions and of passing the apparent responsibility to somebody who can shelter behind a Minister in an impregnable way as a board like that can.  It can be &ldquo;Heads I win; harps you lose&rdquo;.  The Minister can come in here and say: &ldquo;That is the board's decision.&rdquo;  The board can turn around outside and say: &ldquo;Well, the Minister put us in that position.  We are responsible only to the Minister.&rdquo; That type of situation can grow up so easily that I really do urge most sincerely on the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  I want the Minister to exercise these powers, even if only formally.  It is easy to appoint a commission.  As a matter of fact, it has become a bit of a joke amongst the people outside.  When a big problem arises, somebody rushes <Col N="324" /> off to appoint a commission.  Somebody suggested to me the other day a cartoon. The cartoon shows the three new commissions which the Taoiseach appointed appointing a sub-committee or a sub-commission of their own to inform them about the proposals for which they had been constituted to look into.  We have too many commissions, too many delegations <i>ad infinitum.</i> On principle, I would strongly urge on the Minister: you are going to bring the thing to our notice&mdash;that is all that is in it&mdash;by putting it on the Table of the House for 21 days.  I grant that any Deputy who is interested will have an opportunity of finding out and moving an annulment of it.</P>
      <P>Suppose I take the Minister's statement that the board is only a drafting body, why cannot that Order be made by the Minister for Agriculture?  Why, if it is in that capacity he is going to function, can he not make that Order? I think that a lot of the <i>bona fide</i> objections that some of us have to that section could be got over in that way. I strongly urge that and I would go a little further and say that that simple change is quite easily made in the whole Bill.  It certainly would be a gesture and a recognition of a principle of which the Minister has professed himself previously to be very much in favour.</P>
      <P>I would make this appeal to the Minister&mdash;and it is an appeal&mdash;here is your opportunity to bring home to the public a lesson which thinking parliamentarians and people who believe in the functioning of a democratic Assembly such as this feel should be brought home, as a reality and not as a cipher.  To those who have looked at it even from the economic point of view, here is the Minister's opportunity to vindicate something which I understand he has advocated in the past and he will certainly have our support and our approval, I would even say our applause, in doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy de Valera in the principle he has enunciated there.  I think that if you set up a statutory board to run the greyhound industry, you ought to give that board as wide discretion as <Col N="325" /> you possibly can, consistent with the protection of the rights of citizens.  I think it is all wrong to set up a racing board or greyhound board or sugar board or any other board charged with responsibility to do a particular task and then to try to draw back into your own hands the power to make every executive decision.  You ought to establish the board, give it the powers necessary to do its job, accept responsibility for appointing a good board and then let it go and do its job.</P>
      <P>I must confess that when Deputy MacEntee raised the point that, even if you concede all the cases I have made, if there comes a stage when you are giving a statutory board the power to create an offence in respect of which a citizen is liable to be charged with a criminal charge, that is going too far. If they have powers to make regulations of that kind, creating a new offence under the law, then they ought to be brought back under the jurisdiction of the Legislature <i>ad hoc</i> for any such departure.</P>
      <P>I therefore propose to meet Deputy MacEntee in that.  I think he is right in that principle but I do not agree with Deputy de Valera's point and I think he is making a false analogy.  I think it is wrong for a Minister&mdash;I agree with him there&mdash;to delegate his own power unduly because he ought to make his own decisions and answer to Parliament for them.  That is not what I am doing in this Bill.  I am trying to create a board to run an industry and, avowedly, the board is to be representative of the vitally interested parties to that industry.  I have said here, and I think the House has accepted it, that nothing the House can do will salvage this industry if it is not prepared to save itself.  All we can do is to place at its disposal machinery with which it could ensure its prosperity if it were prepared to use it prudently.  That is the principle on which I have sought to go in this Bill but in seeking to go on that I think perhaps I did go too far in propounding sub-section (3) of this section without the qualification proposed by Deputy MacEntee and I am prepared to accept that qualification in principle.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate unduly but I want to protect myself in this way, that I have tendered an amendment which will to some extent qualify the power of the board to refuse licences at its discretion.

      <P>I am merely indicating this to the Minister because I am not proposing to divide the House.  I propose to allow this section to go through.  I have tendered it and I think it may be before the House on another occasion but I want to try to explain my own position at this moment.  I was saying that it would propose to set up a register of recognised auctioneers; it would propose to give any person who holds an auctioneer's licence and is a member of the Irish Auctioneers' Association, the right to be inscribed on the register. The board, on the other hand, will have the right to remove any person from that register if, after investigation, it is satisfied that he has been guilty of a breach of any regulation made under Section 38.</P>
      <P>I am merely informing the Minister that that amendment has already been handed in and it may, perhaps, with the permission of the Chair, come before the House, not really as an alternative to Section 38, but as a qualification of the right of the board to prohibit <i>ab initio</i> a person who is a duly licenced auctioneer from carrying on his business.  Having said that, I do not propose to delay the House any further on Section 38.  Deputy de Valera may have something to say to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Having made the point on the section in principle, if the Minister will not go so far with me as to take the whole section, which I think would be the best way, into his own hands, there are a couple of points I want to make in regard to serious questions.  I could make a trivial point by indicating that the word &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo;<Col N="327" /> is not defined but I will come to something of more substance.  Take paragraph (e) of sub-section 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The keeping of records by licensees and the production of such records for inspection and taking of copies or extracts by authorised officers of the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that what that section would provide is simply this: take any one at random.  The board are authorised to walk in and to inspect the books of anybody who can be brought within the ambit of this Bill in any way.  I do not wish to take up the question of inspectors and of interference with the private rights of individuals and proprietors with the Minister for Agriculture.  I know his views on the matter.  I take it that I have a certain sympathy from him when I ask is the power of entering and inspection of records, the taking of copies, etc., which is contained in paragraph (e) a necessary power to give to the board in the ordinary way or, at least, should not two safeguards be put in, namely, that the officer shall be specified by the Minister or even in the Bill and then a residuary protection in exceptional cases, giving the Minister a residual power to give the authorisation if he wants.  I know all the objections that can be put to it originally but you can get over this difficulty by specifying the officer or the type of officer of the board and then giving residuary power to the Minister, which would correspond to this, which would not be exercised unless it was absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (e) refers to &ldquo;the keeping of records by licensees and the production of such records for inspection and taking of copies or extracts by authorised officers of the board&rdquo;. As I understand the Minister's provision, the regulation will be law and enforceable, until it is annulled.  It is not that it will be a draft regulation, until it is approved.  It is the other way around.  Therefore, the board are given very wide powers of entry and search.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to my fundamental objection and say that not only are we delegating the power of legislation <Col N="328" /> from this Government and from this House and the people directly responsible to this House, but we are also giving to these people police powers of entry and search.  That is going very far and it is unnecessary.  This section shows clearly the natural complex that an executive has in drafting a provision, namely, to be sure to cover all contingencies from their point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is somewhere else.  However, that provision &ldquo;the production of such records for inspection...&rdquo; is not very far removed from that.  The provision in relation to the furnishing of information is also very wide, but that is not so objectionable.  This matter should be looked into and should certainly be modified in one of the two ways I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the recording and publication of information relating to the results of sales, supposing there is a public sale of greyhounds&mdash;you can still have a public sale, I take it; we are not going to reduce everything to a Star Chamber procedure&mdash;can this board say to all and sundry, Radio Eireann, newspapers, magazines: &ldquo;You are neither to record nor publish the information&rdquo; or &ldquo;The information will be recorded or published in this particular way.&rdquo;  The provision says that the board can make provision for the recording and publication of information relating to the results of sales.  It depends on what you mean by &ldquo;make provision for.&rdquo;  You might argue, on the one hand, that &ldquo;make provision for&rdquo; would allow <Col N="329" /> them to do it, but I think the scope of the thing is quite wide enough so that the phrase could mean to dictate how it will be done.  Is that wording happy?  As far as the fundamental principle is concerned, it is legitimate enough to try to arrange that.  I think what the Minister really means is the recording and publication of what would be called official information, that is, official or recognisable information, the only information that would be recognised in a court or contract. I think that is what the Minister means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>It might make provision, as far as I can see, that there would be no publication of the transaction at a public auction, until an officer of the board approved the record, and if that is not a form of censorship I do not know what is.  I humbly bow to the Deputy's superior knowledge in these matters, but that is my common reading of the section. What is to prevent the board saying that no information, or news, or record of a public auction of greyhounds will be published, until the record has been perused by a specified officer of the board and the publication authorised? If that were to happen, the effect, first of all, would be to abolish public auctions in fact, and the second effect would be censorship.  Do not get me wrong.  I am not saying there is any such intention, but the Minister himself, I think, when on this side of the House, quoted the well-worn phrase, the road to a certain place was paved with good intentions, and Ministers' good intentions are no better than anybody else's intentions.</P>
      <P>This matter can probably be amended by draftsmanship, but I think the Minister will have to have regard to two things: one is as to what is a public transaction and what should be public property, and, in times of peace, freely publishable; the other is the right and wrong of a transaction that appears to be in order.  I do not think it is right to deal with the possibility that an auction may be fair on the face of it.  In other words, that a bid may not be <i>bona fide.</i>  I do not think it is right to deal with that problem in this way.  The proper thing would be to have sanctions against the individual who attempted to do that, just as we impose sanctions at the present time on the confidence trickster. It is wrong to try to remedy that situation by a provision which amounts to censorship.</P>

    <P>Will the Minister please believe me when I say that I do not want to be obstructive in this, but I feel so strongly about the section as it stands <Col N="331" /> and its inherent defects, and I feel so strongly that this is yet another hammering of the wedge which is making the breach, already too wide, so much wider that I am putting up all the resistance I can to the section and begging the Minister to remedy these obvious defects.</P>

      <P>These are difficulties. These are defects and they should be remedied.  I strongly urge that upon the Minister.  I appreciate, and possibly the Minister does too, that I am in a fair way to repeating much of what I said on a former occasion.  I do not want to do that.  I appeal to the Minister to remember what I said before in this context and to take me as repeating every word now.  This is not, as the Minister charged me, for the purpose of obstruction, but because I, as a Deputy, feel I must use every effort to block the passage of this section in its present form.  Indeed, it is my duty so to do.  Although my colleagues may not agree with me in going to these desperate lengths, I must join issue with the Minister on practically every point.  Will the Minister please consider the implications of this section and I will leave it confidently in his hands?  I appreciate his willingness to meet the situation, but I still urge the general point I made earlier.  If he will not accept that, will he not even try to see what can be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, and probably will, argue that boards are constituted of <Col N="332" /> reasonable people.  I will produce for the Minister, if he so desires, before this debate concludes, an example of the kind of thing a board like this can do, and did within the last few months. A board can do things which, if they came to mind here, would appear to be ridiculous, but I will give to the Minister an amendment of rules, such an amendment as it would be hard to believe could be made in 1956.  I will give the gazette in question to the Minister, if he has not already seen it. I will give him the wording of that amendment before this debate concludes. For that reason, I do not feel I am going too far in pressing the Minister to the extent to which I am pressing him here this evening.</P>
    <P>Probably my colleagues are anxious to get on with the business.  Possibly I will get no further even if I prolong the battle.  I appeal to the Minister very, very earnestly to please consider these aspects of this section in the interests of Parliament and in the interests of the community.  In the interests of good, reliable Government at the moment and in the future, will he please look at provisions like this and prevent us slipping any further down the slope down which we seem to have slipped almost too far already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister.  Is the Minister aware of the position which obtains in relation to sales in the greyhound industry at present?  When the information I give him now is further corroborated, the Minister may, perhaps, on the Report Stage consider it worth while bringing in an amendment to remedy the present position.  At the moment thousands of auctioneers, most reputable and highly respected members of their profession, are in charge of the greyhound sales at the different tracks. At no time, since greyhound sales came into vogue, has there ever been a finger of suspicion pointed at any of these reputable firms.  Unfortunately, it was the tracks&mdash;particular tracks&mdash; which cashed in, not so much upon the <Col N="333" /> integrity of the auctioneers as on their potential earning power.</P>
      <P>Take the 1953 figure for the total sales carried out in Shelbourne Park. These came to £93,340.  Did the firm of auctioneers engaged in these sales get 1/- in the £?  Did they get 5 per cent., the normal commission that the purchaser pays to any auctioneer who sells bloodstock?  I will inform the Minister as to what happened.  The firm of auctioneers in question was tied to a fixed fee for every day on which sales took place.  I will not be far out when I say that of the potential £4,500 paid in commission by the purchasers, foreign and native, the greyhound tracks in question took 90 per cent.</P>
      <P>For the sake of illustration, suppose there were greyhound sales on 20 days at X track; the auctioneer might get 30 guineas for every day's sale he conducted.  Supposing there were 20 greyhound sales throughout the season, 20 x 30 gives us £600.  Supposing we go further and take it there were between 20 and 30 days on which sales were conducted and the firm of auctioneers were paid 30 guineas per day, 30 x 30 gives us £900.  Yet, the track in question collars £3,600 out of a total of £4,500 paid by the purchasers, the difference of £900 being the fees paid to the auctioneers.</P>
      <P>This section is permissive.  I am very glad to notice that in the amendments tabled by Deputy MacEntee, he uses the phrase: &ldquo;The board by regulation shall prescribe.&rdquo;  We have often heard criticism of the omission of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and in the very first line of this section the Minister has the phrase: &ldquo;The board may make regulations.&rdquo;  It could so happen that the board might be negligent.  Whatever they might have in their minds at the outset, on the establishment of this control board, the result might be that one of the most important aspects of the industry would be neglected.  If the Minister said: &ldquo;Within three months of the establishment day, the board shall make regulations to be approved by the Minister&rdquo;, it would provide considerable protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having made that point, I would bring the attention of the Minister to <Col N="334" /> paragraph (h) of sub-section (2) of this section.  The Minister is not sure&mdash; and the board evidently can use their own discretion&mdash;as to how the board will do one of two things.  They can either license an auctioneer or else employ an auctioneer themselves. Surely they cannot have it both ways. We heard Deputies talk about the protection which should be afforded to auctioneers.  The amendments tabled by Deputy MacEntee deal with protecting people who might become aggrieved by decisions of the board.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister give us his views as to whether the board itself should appoint these auctioneers?  If the board should not appoint these auctioneers, is he of the opinion that the board should give the right of obtaining a permit to every auctioneer who applies who is a member of the Irish Auctioneers' Association?  Will he impose any limit?  The existing reputable firms of auctioneers in this country have no guarantee whatever that they will not be bounced from the appointments which they now hold.  That is quite possible in one way or another. There are many public bodies and private companies where the directors have a written&mdash;in guarantee that, in the event of their removal, they will be compensated to a certain extent. It is only common justice that if legislation is enacted in this House which results in depriving a man of some profit which he enjoyed that that man should be compensated.  I trust the Minister will go into those points before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>It could easily happen, that the control board, as envisaged by the Minister, would be controlled by nominees of the Irish Coursing Club. If it were never controlled by the Irish Coursing Club it could happen that the nucleus of the board, or certain of its members forming the majority, would have it in for a certain firm of auctioneers. I am stressing the necessity for a safeguard.  Does the Minister agree with me?  If he does I can shut up.  The position with regard to auctioneers should be included under Section 38 in paragraph (h) of sub-section (2).  I think also that in sub-section (2) (a) of the section the Minister <Col N="335" /> might give further clarification on certain points.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble about this Bill is that the Minister failed to clarify a number of points.  He got up here in December, 1955, and dismissed the whole lot in four lines.  He did not go into any details; he did not clarify any of the sections which might appear ambiguous.  He left it to the members of this House to try and interpret the whole Bill.  When the Bill was introduced here he did not give much information, with the result that interested Deputies have had to go to a great deal of trouble to find out what was in the back of the Minister's mind and what was at the back of the mind of the parliamentary draftsman, who probably never saw a greyhound in his life.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot plead he never saw a greyhound because he knows quite a bit about them. Surely the time has come when he should wake up to the fact that this Bill will have to become alive, realistic and not be full of permissive legislation and legislation by regulation.  I have no more points to make because some of the points I should like to raise are covered by Deputy MacEntee's amendments.  I trust the Minister will give attention to the points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23(a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 39 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board by regulation shall prescribe the form in which applications for licences under Section 38 of this Act are to be made and every application made in due form shall <Col N="336" /> be considered by the board as soon as may be and decided upon within a period of eight weeks from the date on which the application was received by the board.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that every person, qualified by holding an auctioneer's licence to conduct sales of other property, will be entitled to apply for a licence, and that the board will be bound to consider his application within a reasonable period of time.  We can discuss this and the following amendment together, because the second amendment merely provides that, whenever the board rejects an application for a licence, it shall notify the applicant by a letter addressed to him, that such a letter shall be sent by registered post and shall set out the grounds on which the board refused to grant his application.</P>
    <P>I think it is very important we should include this provision because quite frankly there has been around this business of greyhound racing a great deal of what one might call the closed shop.  A great many vested interests have been created.  I suppose it was all very well for these vested interests to endeavour to maintain themselves as long as the industry did not come under public control.  We are now giving it over to public control and in those circumstances it is only right that we should safeguard the rights of every individual to practise, even in relation to the sale of greyhounds, the business for which he has qualified himself.  I trust that the Minister will see his way to meet us in regard to 23(a) and 23(b).  35(c) raises another matter which I would like to consider separately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised it is not practicable.  I would agree with the Deputy that if the power given to the board were used in an arbitrary and unjust manner, we would have to consider repealing the whole legislation and abandoning the attempt to allow the industry to run itself, on the ground that it was not fit to do so.  I said repeatedly, since I first sponsored this legislation before the Dáil, the whole of this proposal is based on <Col N="337" /> the assumption that we can get a decent board that will act decently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not get a decent board, if we get a board that acts arbitrarily or unjustly or in any way unfitting its responsibilities, then I do not believe that, by hedging it round with a series of inhibitions of this kind, you would effectively achieve your purpose. I think if it were quite manifest to the Oireachtas that the board when set up under this Bill was misusing powers conferred on it and that even a change of personnel simply reproduced the same situation, the Dáil would have to repeal the legislation and say: &ldquo;This procedure is not practicable.&rdquo; But it seems to be manifest that if we are to have a board with the responsibility of confining the business of conducting greyhound auctions to suitable people, we cannot impose on the board the obligation of stating in writing the reasons why it withholds or grants licences, because there may be cases in which it decides to withhold licences on the ground that it believes the applicant to be a rogue, but if you put in writing: &ldquo;The reason we refuse the licence is that we believe you to be a rogue,&rdquo; you leave yourself open to an action and you may be unable to justify your beliefs in court and if you are not able to justify your beliefs in court, your grounds for the refusal disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it comes to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture that this board arbitrarily refuses to provide a respectable and honest auctioneer with the right to auction greyhounds and does it for the purpose of confining this right to a restricted and chosen coterie, then the duty of the Minister is to get rid of them, and, if he cannot find a board that will act honestly, the Minister's duty is to come back to Dáil Éireann and ask them to wind up the whole plan on the ground that it has not <Col N="338" /> worked and will not work.  I do not believe that will happen.  I do not see the point in setting up a board to run the industry and then hanging round the neck of that body a whole series of obligations which make it impossible for it to do the job we want it to do.</P>

      <P>The Minister, whether he intended to or not, shocked me in some of his approaches.  He may next say to his colleague beside him: &ldquo;Declare martial law and we will not interfere with you.&rdquo;  To take the Minister's speech in sequence, he says that decency covers everything, but I think Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll had a point when she mentioned the word &ldquo;representative&rdquo;.  I shall furnish the Minister&mdash;I regret I cannot do it tonight, but I think I mentioned the matter already to the Minister for Defence and he may be aware of it, though not officially, of course, as yet, though I shall give him the information&mdash;where a board, of which the members, I am sure, are perfectly decent people, has apparently done something to which a large number of people in this country would take exception&mdash;at any rate to the tenor of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No more than Governments or any other groups of people are boards omniscient, nor have they all the gifts of Solomon.  Why should the board not be compelled to give its decisions within a reasonable time?  Is it not well known that one of the easiest ways of getting over an awkward situation very frequently is to say neither &ldquo;yes&rdquo; nor &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  That may be a very good thing to do where nobody is hurt, but in the particular case of a person making an application which, as a citizen, he is entitled to make, and depending on the answer to the application for the future conduct of his affairs, is not that individual <i>prima facie</i> and in the first instance, entitled to an answer that will enable him to make further decisions?  Is he not entitled to some measure of certainty?  Is not the ordinary citizen &mdash;it could be any of us here, if we took it into our heads to go into this business&mdash;entitled to some certainty in a matter of law, and is he not deprived of all certainty if a board or any other body can delay and hedge on any <Col N="339" /> matter of such a kind?

      <P>Whenever the board rejects an application for a licence to hold public sales of greyhounds, the board shall notify the applicant by a letter addressed to him at the address given in his form of application, and such letter shall be sent by registered post and shall set out the grounds on which the board has refused to grant his application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got to the stage where the applicant is entitled to certainty, but the Minister has said that the board cannot give reasons.  I <Col N="340" /> take it that the Minister's only objection to 23(b) is that the grounds shall be set out on which the board has refused an application.  The Minister made a statement, which was rather peculiar for a Minister to make, to the effect that the fellow might be a rogue but that the board would not want to say so, but they turn him down all the same.  Frankly, I see no difference between that and hauling the fellow into court and saying: &ldquo;We will send him to Mountjoy for stealing that pig but we cannot prove it, and therefore we do not want to say he stole the pig.&rdquo;  But he goes to Mountjoy all the same.  I cannot see a tremendous lot of difference between the two things.</P>
      <P>Surely, a citizen when dealing with a statutory provision of this kind, is entitled to some information.  I am in agreement with the Minister to the extent that the grounds should not be set out in a long statement of causes and reasons, but I think an applicant is entitled to such information as this: that he is turned down because he is considered unsuitable.  That is enough. Or, it might be said&mdash;even though it is not a case in point here&mdash;that his premises were unsuitable or that he had not sufficient capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, then.  If he is unsuitable let it be so.  If that is so, then let there be a form to say so. If that is the only ground, let it be quite clear.  I think some indication should be given as to why he is unsuitable. He might be unsuitable because a majority of the board might have an interest in another way.  That is putting the matter very far, that is, were the board inclined to look at it that way.  He might be unsuitable if he were campaigning for objects which the board consider unsuitable, where he had a legitimate right otherwise to campaign.  He might be opposed to the board and he might be campaigning for the abolition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is no reason why he should not get the licence.  There should be definite grounds laid down for such a wide power as this.  I wonder whether, in <Col N="341" /> the last analysis, a lawyer will not find some day some grounds from the very vagueness of this for bringing the matter into court and disputing it.  I think there should be some compromise possible.</P>
    <P>After all, a rather interesting thing can develop out of this.  Suppose some lawyer&mdash;and our Irish lawyers are not without resources in their services to their clients and the community&mdash;finds ground or cause of action to impeach the refusal of a licence, will not a discovery of documents be one of the things that will turn up immediately? Presumably, the records of the board will be there.  I presume that, if it is a decent, reputable and properly run board, it will not be run on the basis of merely getting together to do the thing without records.  There will be some proper records and proper administration, unless the Minister will go so far as to claim a State privilege or something like that.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable for Deputy MacEntee to ask for reasons in this case why that should be turned down. There is a number of reasons possible. There may be the fact of personal unsuitability and things like that.  It may be a matter of previous conduct.  Any of these things could be there.  They could be stated shortly as the net grounds.  Presumably, a board will not make a decision on any of these grounds if it is a board composed of people within the Minister's definition of decency.  They will either refuse because in the interests of the industry there are too many either locally or at large or because of the actual personal suitability of the applicant.  In neither case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not using the word.  I am pointing out that surely they will exercise their decision reasonably and that, therefore, they will come to no decision to refuse an applicant without reasons that are so clear, so reasoned and so examined that they are statable and, if they are statable in private to the board and sufficient for the board to make its decision, they should certainly be sufficient <Col N="342" /> to stand up to a public tribunal if they are challenged.</P>
      <P>One can certainly rely upon the courts.  This to my mind is just another one of those things that tend to take jurisdiction from our courts, which is a fundamentally bad thing. The people have confidence in the public courts, the law courts.  It is bad enough to remove jurisdiction from the courts but it is contemptible to remove jurisdiction from them by defeating the means by which evidence can be brought to them.  That, in effect, is what the Minister has said here.  What the Minister has publicly stated here amounts to this: We do not want to have the poor devil have the evidence he can bring out in the court.</P>

      <P>I think that is appalling.  The courts have the confidence of the people and they should be resorted to whenever possible.  The people's only objection to them is the slowness or the cost of the process which is not the fault of the courts and the lawyers.  It is bad enough to remove jurisdiction, as we have been doing wholesale in this House for a long time now, and thereby undermining society in no small degree in my humble opinion but it is contemptible to carry on the attack by way of preventing the evidence being available that the citizen can have resort to the courts.</P>
      <P>I may have spoken somewhat warmly on the matter but it is not in any sense an attack upon the sponsors of this Bill; it is in the hope that the seriousness of these things will be appreciated and in the hope that I can make Deputies understand that there is something more in this than quibble and talk.</P>

      <P>I would not mind if the Minister had not set a precedent himself.  There was an agreed decision by a board in regard to a certain party.  That party has already been given by the Minister the right of some measure of justice.  I would refer the Minister to Section 29 of this Bill. Deputy Finlay unless I misinterpreted <Col N="343" /> him, intervened to point out the one point in regard to the unsuitability of the applicant.  Section 29 deals with the position of a bookmaker who might be refused a permit.  Sub-section (3) of Section 29 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where the board proposes to refuse an application for a course-betting permit or to suspend or revoke a course-betting permit, the board shall serve notice of the proposal on the applicant or holder and shall, if any representations are made in writing by the applicant or holder within seven days, consider the representations.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, in practice, apart from anything else, this business <Col N="346" /> of imposing an onus or an obligation on a board, or on any organisation which has a discretion, to state its reasons for refusal to accept a person as <i>persona grata</i> for getting a licence or anything else is impracticable.  It will have the result that the board will run away from its duties honestly to consider and come to a decision&mdash; adverse, if necessary, in cases&mdash;or else it will wrap up its decision in some formal phrase which will mean nothing and which will be of no assistance to the applicant at all.</P>
      <P>Translate this into everyday practice in commercial firms.  Consider the position of any person who advertises a job and gets four or five applications. They have a right to the job if they are suitable and the best persons available.  They have a right certainly, in justice, to full consideration for the job.  Nobody would be foolish enough to say why he has not taken them.  If you impose an obligation on a board to tell a person why they have not granted him a licence, this is what is likely to result.  In cases where the board feel that the information might lead even to the possibility of libel or slander proceedings, the board will say: &ldquo;We should like to stop this fellow but, if we put down the reasons, we shall all be in trouble.  Therefore, we will let him through,&rdquo; or they will evolve a formula which means nothing and which merely says that the person is not suitable or is not required. That would not be of any assistance to the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy de Valera, and Deputy O'Malley to a certain extent, are confusing two things.  There is a lot to be said for the right of an applicant to know the decision within a limited time, but I do not think it will put him further on the road to securing justice if a purported reason is given. You will create an unnecessary restriction on the genuine function of the board if you impose a statutory obligation to give these reasons.  Therefore, I suggest that, to insert a provision that the board has to give a reason or set out the grounds on which it refuses to grant a licence to an auctioneer to sell greyhounds, will not improve the position of the auctioneer or increase his chance or right to secure justice <Col N="347" /> and it will largely decrease the effectiveness and the courage of the board in dealing with any application.</P>

      <P>I want to point out two things.  Let us not confuse the question of slander or action or the personal liability of members of the board.  It is simple to provide them with a privilege that will protect them.  They can be given complete and adequate protection, even as a judge has protection in the execution of his duties.  The matter need in no way be complicated by any fear on the part of the functionaries in the discharge of their function.  I think that is a complete and absolute answer to the first point.  There is no reason why the board should in any way be misrepresented for fear of consequences by any right of appeal.  The only thing the board might in practice feel would be that too easy a series of appeals would obstruct its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering Deputy Finlay, and this is germane. The reason why this information would not be given was that the board would be in trouble for disclosing its reasons. Was that not the argument?  In so far as any such appeal could be personally embarrassing or dangerous to the members of the board, that matter can be simply disposed of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But how do appeals arise?  On a point of order, how does the question of appeals arise on this, when there is no question of appeal involved?  I do not think I am being discourteous, but Deputy MacEntee has not raised any question of appeal in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would answer the Minister with this: the question, of course, arises because of a very practical reason.  The refused applicant wants to appeal and he wants the evidence. In every normal judicial process, where decisions regarding the granting or refusing of rights is involved, a citizen who would have a similar type of case in the courts would have the advantage of a first trial where evidence would be available. In most cases, you have the reasons given by a judge in judgment, anyway.</P>
      <P>My point is that it is very desirable that the appellant be given the reasons why his application is refused; that you are, in effect, trying here an issue between the individual applicant and the board or somebody else, as to whether the applicant has a right which he would normally have in common law.  If the board is to refuse him that right, surely it is only correct that it be done in a proper way.  That is why I mention the question of appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the duty imposed by the sub-section be fully met by a statement that the applicant is unsuitable, and that there are good grounds for refusal?  Where do we go from that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do we go from that?  If the board refuses, there are two answers.  One is: who is this board anyway, which is going to say to any applicant: &ldquo;You are unsuitable,&rdquo; for grounds not disclosed?  I think that is going very far in conferring powers on the board&mdash;extraordinarily far.  I have already mentioned a document <Col N="349" /> which I am going to give to the Minister. If that principle were applied, I do not know where we would be.  That is going too far.  Let the board regulate&mdash;that is a good thing&mdash;but it must regulate on behalf of the community, and the surest guarantee for that is that it does it in the full open light of the day, and with a certain amount of publicity.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, if this board rejects a candidate, surely he will be rejected on grounds that will stand examination, and if these grounds will stand examination, why could not they be disclosed in the first instance and so remove a lot of uncertainty?  I would remind Deputy Finlay of an old axiom&mdash;&ldquo;It is not enough that justice should be done; it should appear to be done.&rdquo;  Not only have we no guarantee that it will appear to be done in this case, but ultimately, you have no guarantee it will be done anyway.  Are you simply saying at this stage that the courts are out of this?  Some day there will be an issue on the right of the courts on this matter.  Some day the courts will find that they are faced with a problem of what is their proper jurisdiction.  Let us face this issue.  Is the board going to be so independent, so remote, so authoritarian and authoritative, that it can snap its fingers at the courts?  Is that the intention? If it is, let us say so.</P>
      <P>Let us not try to do the thing by underhand methods, by making evidence not available.  To try to filch evidence from the unfortunate individual is a contemptible matter.  I have made appeals to the Minister on this Bill&mdash;and I am trying to do it objectively&mdash;and I think he could meet Deputy MacEntee on this amendment. He could protect the board and Deputy Finlay's point about libel could be met.  It would be much better to give them the protection of the courts and have it in public and have the appeal to the higher courts.  It would be much better to have all these things in order than to do what is proposed here.  It would be far, far better. Lastly, in regard to an applicant for a job, I congratulate Deputy Finlay on his ingenuity in thinking up analogies and making his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> One of the advantages of appealing is that you would have the whole thing threshed out and it is one of the safeguards of the system.  You have not got it here.  In the name of goodness, let us face this issue here.  Is the mentality and determination behind the Bill: &ldquo;To Hong Kong with the courts. We will keep them out of it by hook or by crook. My sovereign lord and master will rule everything?&rdquo; If it is, then we have gone a long way.  If it is not, then let us work the pattern into the existing accepted pattern.  I cannot see why this amendment cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on 23 (c), which is the question of appeal.  On a previous occasion&mdash;I think in connection with Section 29&mdash;I indicated my readiness to meet him with some kind of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, but I put it to him that I did not think it appropriate to burden the District and Circuit Courts with matters of this kind and that we could work out some kind of quasi-judicial tribunal which would hear appeals of this kind.  I will meet him on the same problem in 23 (c), but I think 23 (b) is illusory, because, as Deputy Finlay says, if you put this obligation on the board, you will have&mdash;and I mean no offence&mdash;an empty formula to justify a refusal, or you will get a failure to do the duty they have to do if they are to protect the people whom the board are charged to protect: those engaged in the industry.  But if it is the question of appeal that is primarily worrying you, I will meet you on that.  If I meet you on (a) and (c), I think everything of substance is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I attach a great deal of importance to the proposal which I have in 23 (c).  I am grateful to the Minister for indicating that he is prepared to meet us from the point of view of considering some sort of appeal to a tribunal, but this is not exactly a question on all fours with the previous case, because we have <Col N="351" /> to consider this in relation to the fact that there is a recognised business or occupation in this country, that of auctioneering, that the Dáil had cognisance of its existence by actually enacting a statute to regulate it. Therefore, it seems to me that it is fundamentally wrong, where we have a business subject to legal restriction, as the business is already, where the conditions for entering into the occupation are somewhat severe, that we should confer upon any board not under the control of this House the right to debar such members belonging to that occupation from carrying on.  I am sorry I was a little bit confused there, but I think the House will recognise what I am trying to say.</P>
      <P>We have got to take this offer in its proper perspective because paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 38 provides that the licences are to be granted by the board at its discretion. Therefore, we have this rather extraordinary situation likely to arise, that a person who complies with the requirements of the Auctioneers Act, makes the necessary deposit, has established himself in business, has a good reputation, may apply to this board to be permitted to carry on and may be permitted to engage in the business of conducting public sales of greyhounds or may be prohibited from doing so by the board at its absolute discretion.  I think that position is not really tenable by the Minister.  After all, the Minister is bound to take cognisance of the legislation of this House and he is bound to take cognisance of the rights of the citizens under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter, and it is no petty matter. According to the report of the advisory committee, one may anticipate a very considerable business developing in the sale of greyhounds.  It is true that the committee do not take, perhaps, the somewhat optimistic view of some of the witnesses who appeared before it who said that it was quite possible, if the abuses which had reduced the industry to the condition it was in at this date were remedied, that an export trade to Great Britain alone of <Col N="352" /> the order of £2,000,000 per year might develop, with indeed some possibility of developing an export trade in greyhounds to America.  Having regard to the prices which the Americans are prepared to pay for horses and also for greyhounds, it might be considered that an American trade might even be greater than the trade with Great Britain.  In any event, there is a figure given there of £2,000,000 per year and as most of these greyhounds would probably be sold by auction to the highest bidder, because that would be the natural way of disposing of them if the auction sales were properly regulated and were conducted in proper form, the amount of fees involved would be of the order of 10 per cent. of that £2,000,000, say £200,000. That amount of business for qualified auctioneers is certainly involved in this matter and are we, having set up this board which will not be under the control of this House, which is not responsible in any way to this House and, as far as I can see, not responsible to the Minister, to allow this board to confine the opportunity of participating in that very large and substantial business to the favoured few? That is what I think we ought to take steps to ensure will not happen.</P>
    <P>This is a monopoly.  We are giving an uncontrolled monopoly to the board and we all know what happens in these circumstances.  Your son, my son, my thirty-first cousin on the mother's side or his equivalent on the father's side so far as your relatives are concerned, is going to get a job.  One or other of these relatives is engaged in the business of auctioneer and how could we do better for him, for us or for the country as a whole than by ensuring that he and his likes will be granted licences to hold public sales of greyhounds at their discretion.  That uncontrolled monopoly, frankly, is what I am anxious to prevent and I cannot see any justification for trying to keep this provision, to create this nest of vested interests, as it will be created around the greyhound industry if we do not give every man who is legitimately in business as an auctioneer the right to apply for a licence and, if that licence is refused by the <Col N="353" /> board at its discretion, to know why it was refused.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Finlay that the board could get round the requirement of the Legislature by adopting such a simple subterfuge as he has described for us.  After all, so far as being informative is concerned, Deputy de Valera has already pointed out that we can make the communications of the board privileged and the board would be quite entitled to say to a rogue such as the Minister for Agriculture had in mind; &ldquo;You are a rogue.  In our opinion, you are a rogue.  We have some evidence to show that you are a rogue&rdquo;.  They need not necessarily say that and, if they do say it, and send that answer to his application to the dishonest man by registered post, there will not be any publication except to himself. I understand that in certain circumstances that might constitute a libel, but I doubt if the dishonest man who is told he is a rogue will take an appeal to the Circuit Court.  I think he will accept the decision of the board in rejecting his application.</P>
    <P>I could see other reasons for refusing which would not convey such a reflection upon the character of the applicant as that.  One could quite simply say: &ldquo;You have not had any experience in the selling of animals, particularly of selling greyhounds.&rdquo;  That might be true or it might be untrue, but it certainly would not be regarded, I think, as a libel and would not give the person who was informed that, in the opinion of the board, he had not had sufficient experience in the auctioning of animals ground for an action for libel against the individual members of the board.  I suppose he could not take the action against the board.  But, it would give the person to whom the board conveyed this information the right, if he so desired, if he was prepared to face the expense, to bring the board into court to show to the satisfaction of the judge that the statement that he had not had sufficient experience was well-founded.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the very substantial business which is involved here, having regard to the fact that the board is not under the control of the <Col N="354" /> House, having regard to the fact that the business of an auctioneer is a business which has been made the subject of legislation by this House and that persons have a right to practise and engage in selling everything else, have still at the moment the right to sell greyhounds, if they happen to be auctioneers, I do not think there is any justification for giving the board the right to prohibit a person from engaging in that occupation, unless they state the reason why they consider he should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>That is what we are asking in amendment No. 23 (b).  I think it is perfectly reasonable to hope that the Minister will have regard to considerations which have been put before him by Deputy de Valera, Deputy O'Malley and myself and I trust that he will see his way not merely to meet us in regard to amendment No. 23 (c) but that he will see his way to impose on the board the obligation, when they reject an application for a licence, to tell the applicant why they have turned him down.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister examine it with particular reference to making (b) effective?  It is all the more reason, if the Minister is accepting (c), that we do not make (c) illusory, that the machinery should be there to make (c) a reality.  I should like the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not mind my intervening on this section.  During the Recess, I studied the Bill, primarily in the interest of people who, like myself, have been breeding, rearing and selling greyhounds for the last 36 years.  I appreciate that on this side of the House we had a good team in Deputy MacEntee, Deputy O'Malley and Deputy de Valera, as against the Minister and his draftsmen.  Any Deputy who studies this Bill line by line, section <Col N="355" /> by section, will have to admit, without casting any reflection on the draftsmen, that they know very little about the greyhound industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had considerable experience of selling greyhounds and it might be helpful to the Minister if I were to bring to his notice that, if you deny to any licensed auctioneer or firm of auctioneers the right to get a licence for the sale of greyhounds, say, in Tralee or Listowel, we will have to come to Limerick or Shelbourne Park and there could be very reputable auctioneers in Kerry, who conduct their business in Tralee, who could be refused a licence.  I am certain of my facts and sure of my premises.  As a matter of fact, I conveyed to Deputy MacEntee yesterday that if you deny auctioneers the right to apply for and to get licences from this board to sell greyhounds, you are more or less operating what all of us in this Parliament have abhorred, restrictive trade practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might be surprised to <Col N="356" /> know from me that auctioneers&mdash;I am not saying all but I have some in mind &mdash;can depress sales of greyhounds.  I brought dogs to a particular sale.  We know they are graded and have to compete in heats.  My dogs happened to qualify by being placed first in their respective heats and they went up on the platform.  The bidding opened at 20 guineas for one of my dogs.  My other dog went up and the bidding opened at 30 guineas and I withdrew my greyhounds.  They were not in my name but were registered in the name of another member of my family.  It was requested that my dogs would go back again and the bidding for the 20 guinea dog opened at 80 guineas and the bidding for the 30 guinea dog opened at 120 guineas, and I sold my greyhounds.  I could never understand that.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, Sir, I say it is relevant and I want to bring it home to the Minister that the more we widen the scope and the opportunity for people to get licences to sell greyhounds the better it will be in the general interest of the people who rear greyhounds.  About 62 per cent. of small farmers, the depressed type of farmer, have gone in for the rearing and breeding of greyhounds and it has been a good market.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is widening the debate on this amendment.  The amendment seeks to have the reasons given by the board for the refusal of the licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will keep to the point.  My main reason for standing up was to impress upon the Minister that the scope of the provision should be widened so that as many people as possible would be allowed to engage in the business of selling greyhounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard it as wholly improper for this board to withhold a licence to sell greyhounds from any honest man who was qualified to sell them.  I hope Deputy MacEntee <Col N="357" /> has learned from what his colleague, Deputy Collins, has to tell, that there are people who can engage in very questionable activities in auctioneering greyhounds and if a wise man had not been watching their operations they could have robbed Deputy Collins of two-thirds of the price of his hounds.  It is against such persons that I seek to invest the board with discretion to ensure that they will not be licensed to rob less vigilant vendors than Deputy Collins evidently proved to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister for Agriculture overrates my innocence in regard to transactions that take place at greyhound auctions and greyhound racing tracks, because one of the reasons why we have fought certain provisions of this Bill so bitterly, or so resolutely, to put it that way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Adhere to your first adverb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so resolutely, is the fact that we fear that, by reason of the manner in which this board is to be constituted, some of the people who are up to their necks in it&mdash;if that is a parliamentary expression&mdash;will be in a position to prohibit persons from conducting or holding public sales of greyhounds. I can cap Deputy Collins's reminiscences.  I can tell a story about a certain greyhound.  The price at which it changed hands was £175.  It was a very good dog indeed.  It justified the price which had been paid for it in a very signal manner but the person who sold it, through a member of the standing committee of the Irish Coursing Club, afterwards met the person who bought it.  The original owner said to the person who bought it: &ldquo;That was a very good dog you got from me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other person, &ldquo;it was a very good dog indeed, but I paid a very good price for him.&rdquo;&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; said the original owner. &ldquo;£300,&rdquo; was the answer, but the man who bred the dog, who had raced it first, did not get £300 for it.  That is one of the reasons why we, knowing some of the things that have been happening in connection with greyhound <Col N="358" /> racing in particular, are very anxious that unrestricted power should not be given to this board.  We will have to impose some limitation or impose such a condition as will make the board act in a very responsible manner in relation to the granting of licences for the holding of public sales of greyhounds and the granting of permits by the board, both of which are at its discretion.</P>
      <P>May I also call the Minister's attention to something which has been pointed out to me by my colleague, Deputy O'Malley?  You will notice that I have referred in the three amendments, Nos. 23 (a), (b) and (c) to applications for licences under Section 38. It has been pointed out to me that, in fact, in the case of holding public sales of greyhounds, a licence is required to hold a public sale but, in the case of a person who wishes to act as an auctioneer, a permit has to be granted by the board.  A permit is issued to an auctioneer but persons may conduct public sales of greyhounds and yet not act as auctioneers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very good indeed in expressing his readiness to meet us in regard to amendments Nos. 23 (a) and 23 (b).</P>
      <P>However, as to his promise in relation to amendments which he will put down, I hope he will note the distinction between a licence to hold a public sale as set out in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) and a permit to act as an auctioneer as set out in paragraph (h) of the same sub-section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 (b), by leave, withdrawn.</P>
