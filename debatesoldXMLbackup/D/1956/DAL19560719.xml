      <P>When progress was reported last night, I was referring to Deputy Cunningham's reply to the case which had been made by Deputy Declan Costello with regard to what is commonly referred to as compulsory Irish, by which it is intended to imply the teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish.  I conceded that Deputy Cunningham was, at any rate, theoretically correct in the case he made that, so far as the Department's regulations are concerned, there is not any such thing as compulsory Irish of that sort.  Theoretically and technically Deputy Cunningham is correct in that but I do not think that that is by any means the full answer to the point of view which was voiced by Deputy Declan Costello and I think also by Deputy Tully of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>All of us are aware that there is a feeling in the country and that there has been a feeling for some time that some reassessment of the position, some change of outlook, some new approach, is necessary on the question of teaching through Irish.  That feeling exists.  Various people from time to time have referred to it.  It may be that the phrase &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; is a misnomer but, as I say, I do not believe that Deputy Cunningham's reply is the complete answer to the problem which is posed from all sorts of sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not claim to be very familiar with the topic.  I do not claim to be in any way an expert or to hold views which are particularly weighty on the subject of teaching through Irish or as to what can be done, but while Deputy Cunningham is correct in saying that so far as the regulations go there is no such thing as compulsory teaching through Irish, nevertheless, I think it is correct to say&mdash;some of the Deputies who are members of the teaching profession <Col N="1377" /> can correct me in this if I am wrong&mdash; that special inducements are held out to teachers who do, in fact, teach other subjects through the medium of Irish. If there is that particular attraction of special inducements, whether by way of bonus or other cash rewards, while technically it is correct to say there is no compulsion and that it is a matter to be decided having regard to the ability of the pupils and so on, the tendency must perfectly naturally be to teach through Irish if at all possible.</P>
    <P>I think the phrases &ldquo;if at all possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; occur in the Department regulations.  Deputy Cunningham also gave his own personal experience of a situation which he met in a non-Gaeltacht school where he was teaching.  In regard to particular subjects which were being taught through the medium of Irish and where the pupils were not making sufficient progress, he decided that those subjects should be taught through English.  He put his views before the Department and, if I recollect what Deputy Cunningham said correctly, the view held by the Department was that to revert to teaching these subjects through English, where they had been taught through Irish for a number of years, would be regarded as a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham did not agree with that and resumed the teaching of these subjects through English rather than through Irish.  I doubt if every teacher would adopt the same stand as Deputy Cunningham took in face of a view expressed by the Department that the step would be a retrograde one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be complimentary to Deputy Cunningham in the remarks I am making.  I doubt if every teacher would adopt the same stand.  The conclusion having been come to that, from the educational point of view, it was bad for the pupils that those subjects should be continued to be taught through the medium of Irish and in face of an expressed view from the Department that to depart <Col N="1378" /> from that procedure would be a retrograde tep, I am entitled to doubt whether every teacher would, notwithstanding that, hold to his own views and revert to teaching through English. Deputy Cunningham conceded, when he made the switch, that there was an improvement so far as the pupils were concerned.</P>

      <P>I accept unreservedly what the Minister says.  At the outset I said I did not claim to talk with full knowledge of this subject. I understood there were particular attractions. Apparently, that is not so. It may be that the inducements exist from the pupils' point of view.  When I was a pupil at a secondary college, there was an attraction to do examinations through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that various references were made to this subject from all sorts of sources and I think not least by members of the teaching profession, members of the I.N.T.O. who called for a new approach to the subject of teaching through Irish.  Only this morning there is a report in the newspapers giving the views of a lecturer at a course for teachers conducted by the I.N.T.O. at University College, Galway.  Let me now quote from today's issue of the <i>Irish Independent.</i><Col N="1379" /> The report is headed: &ldquo;Wants New Approach to Irish Teaching.&rdquo;  In this report the lecturer, Pádraig Ó Meara, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Despite the tremendous progress that had been made in the Irish revival in the Gaeltacht during the past 30 years, the present rate of progress could not save the language.</P>
      <P>The national teachers knew this, and hence their demands for a new approach to the teaching of Irish in the schools.</P>
      <P>Mr. Ó Meara described the primary school as &lsquo;the powerhouse of the language revival&rsquo;, yet both pupils and teachers, he said, were hampered to a degree that seemed to show that the responsible Department either did not understand the position or, understanding it, made no effort to solve it.</P>
      <P>The Irish programme was unsuitable and the system of examining Irish was bad.  It tended to confuse pupils, to dishearten teachers, and to break the spirit of inspectors.  He had yet to meet a successful teacher of Irish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on to make it clear that he was not attacking the inspectors but that he was attacking what he described as the &ldquo;machine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Talking as a person who is interested in this topic as a public representative who does not claim or pretend to be in any way personally familiar with it, I naturally must have regard to the views such as that expressed by people who I assume&mdash;and I think correctly&mdash; know what they are talking about from personal experience, but the whole thing is extremely difficult because it seems to me that this question is only part of a very much bigger question&mdash;the question of the revival of the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can regard it purely from the point of view of education, of instilling knowledge into the minds of the pupils.  It is part and parcel of the bigger question of the Irish language revival.  Every Deputy subscribes to the view, I think, that there is a responsibility on every Irish <Col N="1380" /> Government to further, as best they can, the cause of the revival of the Irish language.  I certainly subscribe to that view.  I think most Deputies do, but I am tempted to ask if that view is generally held by the people in this country&mdash;whether this Government or the last Government or any other Government have what might be described as a positive mandate from the people with regard to the question of the revival of the Irish language, or is the position that their mandate can be described only as a mandate by default?  In so far as my recollection goes, at any rate, the question has never been specifically put before the people for decision.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any political Party in this State, or the likelihood of a political Party ever arising in this State, that will hold the view that it was not the duty of an Irish Government to endeavour to revive the language.  However, it is important to know whether we have, as an Irish Parliament, the backing of the people for the policy which is pursued in relation to this question.  I am conscious of this and of the fact that in the Constitution&mdash;I think it is in Article 8&mdash; Irish is referred to as being the first official language of the State.  In that Article in the Constitution also, it is provided that laws may be made which would permit the exclusive use of either of the official languages for State purposes&mdash;probably for State and other purposes.  I do not recall the exact phrasing of the Article.  I know it can be argued that in adopting a Constitution with that Article in it, this House and the Government&mdash; whatever Government is in power&mdash; consequently have a mandate from the people, that the question was submitted to the people and that the people decided Irish would be the first official language of this State.</P>
    <P>However, it is also possible to argue otherwise.  It is possible&mdash;and probably people would argue with ample justification on it&mdash;that no Party and no Government have ever gone to the people and said: &ldquo;Do you want us to go ahead with a policy for the revival of the Irish language or not?&rdquo;  It is a question that can be of importance; <Col N="1381" /> it is a question that must be faced because, having regard to the views which one hears expressed from time to time that we are not making any progress towards reviving Irish as a spoken language in this country, I think some Government must face up to this question in a very courageous way.</P>
    <P>I believe there is in this country at the moment a sufficiently large reservoir of Gaelic speakers to justify the assumption that, by a more rigorous policy of enforcement, of compulsion if you like, you could, within a limited period, hope to see this country Irish speaking.  I am simply giving a personal viewpoint on it.  I do not imagine it will find general support in the House, and I do not imagine it will find support from the Deputies who have had the onerous duties of Minister for Education and who have been more into the kernel of the problem than I have.</P>
    <P>However, it does seem to me that is one way of approaching the problem. I do not say it is the correct way of approaching it, but we have to get clear in our minds, first of all, what the ultimate aim is.  It seems to me there are three targets open to us.  We can aim at having this country bilingual&mdash; Irish speaking and English speaking&mdash; we can aim at crushing out the English language and having this country Irish speaking only, or we can decide to leave things as they are, where the vast majority of the people of the country are English speaking. I think I would be justified in asking are we doing very much, effectively, about altering the position or endeavouring to get away from the position where the majority of the people of the country are English speaking.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to have a clear statement of policy and I do not say this in any Party or partisan spirit.  A clear statement of policy is needed, that will be adopted by all Parties in the House, as to what the ultimate aim is.  I think there would be general agreement that the policy should be towards making this country bilingual, that, having regard to our geographical situation, to the necessities of commerce, trade and so on, the English <Col N="1382" /> language is a language which it is necessary for us to preserve.</P>
    <P>Assuming our aim is to become bilingual, we have got to ask ourselves what are we doing to bring that about. I know the work that has been done by the Department of Education and by the successive Ministers for Education since this State was founded has been good work.  It has been work well done, it has been work which I consider well worthy of support from Deputies of all sides of this House. But you have a man such as Mr. Ó Meara, whom I have quoted, saying yesterday:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite the tremendous progress that had been made in the Irish revival in the Gaeltacht during the past 30 years, the present rate of progress could not save the language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Assuming our object is to save the language, would it not be possible to go a little bit faster?  Would it not be possible to have official Government policy, backed by the support of all Parties in this House, move more rapidly?</P>
    <P>It seems to me there are many ways in which the official policy can be speeded up.  I have in mind Radio Éireann in which approximately the same time is devoted to Irish news and English news.  I think if we are serious, the emphasis should be entirely on Irish news&mdash;that is news in Irish.  I think we should not do anything more than give headlines in English and that in every sphere in which the Government can bring their influence to bear in so far as publicity is concerned, the emphasis should be in that way.  Newspapers could play a far greater part than they do play. The fact that you merely have a daily genuflection to the Irish language in the daily newspapers is one of the measures of the slowness of the progress that has been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no responsibility for all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he might be able to bring his influence to bear on the matter.  The position as the Minister referred to it in his introductory speech is that the Department <Col N="1383" /> of Education has had a very special association since this State was formed with the question of the revival of the Irish language. The Minister expressed the view that with the setting up of Roinn na Gaeltachta it may be that the special functions and specialised work of that Department will add new vigour and efficacy to the drive for the revival of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make, and I do not think it is entirely irrelevant, is that this Government through the Minister for Education and through the new Gaeltacht Ministry, provided it has the active backing of this House, can go a lot faster towards reviving the Irish language.  Take for instance State advertisements, or, coming closer to the public, advertisements on C.I.E. buses.  There is a national concern, and I think we should make every effort to ensure that the advertisements on C.I.E. buses and trains will appear only in the Irish language.  In doing that, we will be doing something to bring the Irish language straight up to the ordinary people in the street whether they are bus users or radio fans, or whatever they are.  In the internal working of the Department of Education the Irish language is probably used exclusively.  I am not sure of that, but I imagine it is.  I think the same thing could be done in every Government Department.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there is very much more I have to say on this subject except that I believe that Deputies such as myself, and others also, could do a lot more than we are doing.  Many Deputies in this House are competent to contribute to the discussions here in the Irish language.  I certainly would welcome it if they did that and did that exclusively.  I might then find myself getting sufficient courage to follow their example.  It is a good example.  I think the Minister deserves to be complimented on the fact that in introducing this Vote he did it at length and did it entirely in Irish.  I hope that that will be held as a precedent for this Department and that it may be extended into other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole problem is a difficult one. <Col N="1384" /> It is easy to adopt a policy of proceeding cautiously, if you like, but from personal experience I feel that there is very little evidence in this city, in any event, that any real or any marked progress has been made, over the last decade or two.  I am one of those who were required to take Irish examinations in the course of their professional studies.  Deputies will remember&mdash;I think it was introduced by a private Deputy in this House&mdash; the Legal Practitioners' Qualifications Act of 1929 which required Irish examinations to be held, but my own experience has been that, while it was necessary to study Irish and have at any rate a reasonable command of the language in order to pass the necessary examinations, as a solicitor practising in Dublin for the last 15 or 16 years, there was only one solitary occasion over that period where it was necessary for me to know a word of Irish.</P>
    <P>I have never found it necessary in the course of my professional duties in the courts to know any Irish. There has never been any call for its use on my part except on one occasion in 15 years.  I should imagine that other professional men in this city have had the same experience.  I do not believe that that is true of professional men in other counties, either in Gaeltacht areas or bordering on Gaeltacht areas, but at least it is some standard by which individuals can measure whether any progress on the question has been made.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that General Mulcahy is presiding over the Department of Education and I think it was a very happy choice of the Government in its formative stages to couple, under General Mulcahy, the Gaeltacht Department with the Department of Education.  I know it is not intended that that should remain so indefinitely but I think that with his special knowledge of the problems, with his own enthusiasm and the calm systematic way in which the Minister for Education proceeds to deal with these problems, there is ground for hoping that the policy, and the systematic working towards that policy will be speeded by the Minister for Education. As I say, I am glad he took the opportunity <Col N="1385" /> in introducing his Estimate to introduce it in Irish and Deputies more courageous than I am, with a greater command of the tongue would, I think, do well to follow his example.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuilimid go léir ar aon fhocal gurb iad na bun-scoileanna na scoileanna is tábhachtaí sa tír.  Darnó, tá na hoidí oilte iontu.  Níl mórán de na tithe scoile chomh maith agus ba mhaith linn iad a bheith ach taobh amuigh de sin nuair a bhíos ag múineadh roinnt blianta ó shoin chuas ar cuairt chun na Stát Aontaithe agus chuas isteach ins na bun-scoileanna annsin.  Bhí focal agam leis na Bráithre Críostúla a bhí ag múineadh ann agus chuireas ceist orthu mar gheall ar na scoileanna in America agus na scoileanna in Éirinn, mar bhí taithí acu ar na scoileanna san dá áit.  Dúirt siad go raibh na scoileanna in Éirinn agus na páistí iontu chomh maith agus a bhíodar in America.  Dúradar go mbfhéidir go raibh na páistí in America níos tapúla chun ceisteanna do fhreagairt agus rudaí mar sin. ach bhí an t-eolas ag na leanaí in Éirinn chomh glan agus chomh soiléir agus a bhí sé ag na daoine óga sa tír úd thall.  Is féidir linn chomh maith comparáid a dhéanamh leis na scoileanna sa roinn thoir-thuaidh den tír seo.  Bíonn Cumann na Múinteoirí i dteannta a chéile gach Cáisc in áiteacha ar fud na tíre, uaireanta i mBéal Feirste agus uaireanta eile i mBaile Átha Cliath, i gCorcaigh agus i gCill Áirne agus is féidir leo sin comparáid a dhéanamh le chéile i dtaobh an sórt oideachais agus an méid oideachais atá á mhúineadh sna scoileanna.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil an caighdeán chomh hard agus atá sé in aon áit eile sa tír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rudaí áirithe go mba cheart féachaint isteach iontu.  Cuir i gcás, sílim go bhfuil na ceachtanna sna leabhra ró-fhada.  Mar adúirt an Teachta Seán Ó Maoláin agus daoine eile inné is fearr roinnt mhaith d'fhoghlaim i gceart ná a bheith ag iarraidh dul trí leabhar mór agus gan ach beagán a bheith foghlamtha as i ndeire na dála.  Ba cheart ceachtanna gairide a sholáthar agus ina dhiaidh sin roinnt ceisteanna ar ábhar na <Col N="1386" /> gceacht i dtreo go mbeadh caoi ag an múinteoir an rang a bhriseadh ina dhá leath chun ceisteanna a chur ar a chéile uair sa tseachtain nó b'fhéidir ag deire an cheachta.  B'fhéidir san tséú rang go mbeadh scéalta níos faide acu ach sna bun-ranganna ba cheart iad a ghiorrú.</P>
    <P>Aontaím go bhfuil na téacsleabhra matamaitice sásúil suas go dtí an ceathrú rang ach chualas go minic na cigirí á rá nach raibh na téacsleabhra sásúil ón gceathrú rang suas.  Tá a fhios agam gur chuir cigire áirithe leabhair amach ach ní raibh an toradh sásúil ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sár-obair á déanamh sna meán-scoileanna ach níl an méid Gaeilge go mba mhaith linn a bheith iontu á labhairt sna scoileanna sin.  Scrúduithe scríbhneóireachta go léir a bhíonn iontu agus ullmhaítear na daltaí ar an gcuma sin dá bharr.  Tá teangacha eile mar an Fhraincis á bhfoghlaim iontu agus is maith é sin. Bíonn a lán taistil faoi láthair idir an tír seo agus na tíortha i Roinn na hEorpa agus is maith an rud go bhfuil na teangacha sin á bhfoghlaim ar scoil.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the views I have expressed about the national schools.  I have reason to believe&mdash; and I have consulted others&mdash; that they are comparable with the schools in any of the countries around us.  Nevertheless if we are wise we shall try to improve on what has been done in our schools.  Fundamentally the education there is very sound and has proved itself over the years in giving to the Irish people a fundamental training so that they can face similar people, the peasantry of any other country, and have a standard of education which would be no disgrace to Irishmen whether at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>The teaching of Irish is very important because it is our native language.  Whether we have a specific mandate or not, we certainly have as good a reason as any other country in the world for preserving our own language.  Every one of the leaders, not Pearse alone, who struck for freedom in 1916 showed for years before that their sincerity in making the restoration of our language part of their programme, their policy and <Col N="1387" /> fight.  We want no other mandate than that, that it is our own language and consequently should be preserved.  The only thing is that we must set about preserving it in the right way, in the most satisfactory way for students and teachers and for the nation as a whole, so that an interest would be taken in it.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to the Minister&mdash; and I am speaking from my own experience&mdash;that the lessons in, say, the fourth and fifth standards are far too long and that, in a language with which students in parts of the country are not familiar at home, they are weary of those lessons before they come to the end.  I have suggested that there should be shorter lessons, that there would be a number of questions set out for the teacher so that he can divide the class into two parts and let them put questions across to one another.  Instead of merely listening to the teacher they would gain experience of using the language themselves and become familiar with the expressions.  Most teachers will agree that the books in mathematics from the fourth standard up are not as satisfactory as they might be.  Inspectors are of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>With regard to buildings, the difficulty local authorities have at the moment is that there is a request to bring water and sanitation to a school. That is brought as far as the school wall or school boundary.  There is no authority then evidently for bringing it right into the school.  Possibly a fountain is erected just outside the school, and the children use it.  In new schools this difficulty does not arise because, of course, the installation of water and sanitation is a fundamental in the erection of every new school. Now it will take some time to replace all the old schools.  Many of them will be there for years yet.  I appeal to the Minister to take some steps to rectify the present unsatisfactory position. Sometimes we get reports from medical officers about the sanitation in the old schools.  We may set about doing something to remedy the situation, but we find ourselves up against a stone <Col N="1388" /> wall because different Departments have different functions.</P>
    <P>In the secondary schools there is very little spoken Irish as far as the pupils are concerned.  There is no oral examination and consequently the pupils are trained to get the best results in the written examinations. If they are interested in Irish and are induced to join societies of one kind or another, they get a knowledge of the spoken language.  It is satisfactory to note that other languages are also taught in the schools, such as French, Spanish, Italian and German.  Intercourse with Western European countries is growing and the learning of continental languages is, therefore, something to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I have had a personal experience of the advantage of learning a foreign language.  Last year a student from a Cork secondary school went abroad. She parted from friends in Paris.  She was travelling to the Belgian frontier and, unfortunately, the people she was to meet failed to make contact with her and she found herself at a railway junction.  She was able to make her way quite well and quite satisfactorily and reached her destination successfully. That shows that the teaching of a foreign language is an advantage.  It also shows that the teaching itself is practical.</P>
    <P>A most extraordinary situation has arisen in one Cork secondary school. The services of an honours graduate in Irish cannot be procured.  Whether the fault lies with the Irish Faculty in the universities is something I do not know.  There was an honours graduate teaching in that school; she got married and now she cannot be replaced. Someone should be brought to task for that deplorable situation.  It is the universities which train the secondary teachers.  National teachers are trained in special colleges.</P>
    <P>We cannot admire too much the work that is being done in the vocational schools.  These schools are fulfilling an excellent function at the present time because they are keeping in step with industrial progress.  Cork vocational students sometimes go abroad.  Whenever they succeed in <Col N="1389" /> getting into some big industry in London, or elsewhere, others are sent for; they have proved so good that the employing industries send to Cork for more of them.  Sometimes these industries, such as Gouldings, ask that facilities be given for these employees to pursue a university course.</P>
    <P>Now, we anticipated the establishment of an oil refinery in Cork and we sent the heads of the chemistry department in the vocational school to England to go through the refineries there in order to find out what would be required in the way of education and instruction so that we would eventually have students qualified to take their place in that industry.</P>
    <P>Another trend is the fact that we have pass leaving certificate students seeking entry in large numbers to the vocational schools in order to take a commercial course to fit them for employment. This year there have been 120 applications.  That is a very welcome trend.  There is another aspect in relation to which there should be every encouragement given. Parish halls should be used to supplement the vocational schools.  Instruction could be given in such halls on plant growing, fertilisation of crops, soil testing and so forth.  Every encouragement should be given to education of that kind, supplementary to the ordinary education given.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about progress in the Irish language.  The Minister and his predecessors have come to the Comhar na Scoileanna in Cork.  They are held for a week every year and thousands of children take part in that festival, thousands of children with a competent knowledge of Irish.  Music and other cultural pursuits are pursued and we cannot but feel proud at the progress which is being made in the restoration of culture along these lines.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the parish feis of our young days has disappeared, except in isolated areas.  At all events it is not regarded, as it was in our young days, as one of the annual events.  School pupils were trained to compete for prizes for Irish conversation, Irish essays, for choirs and all the <Col N="1390" /> rest.  There was tremendous work done.  Somebody of standing addressed the people of the parish during the feis and encouraged them.  They could see the progress that was being made in the speaking of Irish.  Whether the people knew little or much of it, they spoke what they could of it.  I hope there will be a revival of such feiseanna.</P>
    <P>At the Tóstal in Cork this year one of the most pleasing features for any of us who had an interest in the Irish language and Irish culture was that all the announcements were made in Irish, in some cases repeated in English.  Strangers from all parts of the world who were present had to recognise that we have a language of our own which was spoken and understood by the people.  Even if some people were not very fluent in speaking Irish, it was apparent that progress was being made and that there was every reason to feel satisfied that the move was in the right direction, that the Irish language was an accepted fact, that it was part of our heritage and was being preserved.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one other word to the Minister in recognition of the teachers of the past who helped to promote the Irish language by teaching it as an extra subject and who went to great trouble to grasp the language in order to be able to teach it.  A small number of those teachers are still with us.  Many of them have gone to their eternal reward.  Those who retired before 1950 have been seeking a concession which was granted to their colleagues who retired perhaps only a month after the date of their retirement and which has been granted to teachers in the north-eastern corner.  The previous Minister for Education, Deputy Moylan, went a good part of the way.  He recognised their rights and spread part of the gratuity for which they are looking over three years.  I would appeal to the Minister to grant this concession to these retired teachers, even if he were to spread it over a few years.  It will not cost a great deal.  These teachers gave excellent service in years gone by and did excellent work. At great inconvenience to themselves, <Col N="1391" /> they went to special colleges to learn the language so that they could teach it efficiently.  The Minister should consider their case as favourably as he can.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, we can feel satisfied that the education given in this country in all branches is keeping well abreast of the times and that the outlook with regard to the preservation and restoration of the Irish language is satisfactory.  I went through Connemara last year and, as I have stated in the House already, I stopped for a while in Salthill.  A man drew up with a car and the sergeant of the Guards and the children around spoke to the man in Irish.  Right through Connemara on to Rosmuc, where Pearse had his little cottage, it was evident that with the slightest encouragement the people spoke in their native tongue.</P>

      <P>There may be but I am giving my experience of a short holiday I spent there.  On to where the electrical station is being put up and all around that area the people were able to use the native language more fluently than I could use it. There is no reason for despair and there is every ground for hope.  It is only faint hearts that can discourage the people of this country from again restoring their ancient language and culture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>A large sum of money is spent each year on education but I maintain that, large as that sum is, it is not half enough.  The State will have to cut down expenditure on other matters in order to spend more on education because, unless a man is educated, he will not get very far. There are only half the number of teachers required in the country available for primary or vocational schools.  School children could get a better education if there were more teachers.  Most of the classes in all branches of education are far too big.  We must aim at doubling <Col N="1392" /> the number of teachers at present available.  It is a high ambition but we must aim at that so that all our people may be properly educated.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the speeches made by other Deputies that things are not bad as far as education is concerned, that good strides are being made, that our people are just as well educated as other people throughout the world and, in many cases, better educated.  There has been a complex amongst our people that we are an inferior people&mdash;uneducated, illiterate, not fit to mix amongst other people. That is not the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. For 20 years I have been hammering at one project&mdash;the provision of a new national school in my parish.  The old school building was an eyesore.  I am glad to be able to say that we have now got a new national school, which will accommodate three teachers and 120 children, a school which is a credit to the Minister, to the Department and to the people who put up the money. We are happy that that good work has been carried out.</P>
      <P>With regard to new schools, I think the Department is going ahead as fast as the resources of the country will permit them.  I saw a dozen schools built in my own area.  I think that is good progress.  We ought to establish teachers on a sound footing.  Generally, our young teachers, when they come to a remote country area, stay there for a year or so and then they leave to go to the bigger centres.  They rarely settle down permanently in the remote areas.  That tendency of young teachers to go to the bigger centres is militating against a stable life in the rural areas.  After the clergy, the teacher is the most important element in the country areas.  Indeed, our whole national culture can be built round the teachers if they are the right kind and are content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been done for the teachers in recent years.  Many of their problems were solved although there are a <Col N="1393" /> few problems yet outstanding but time will solve them.  We have a Minister with a conciliatory outlook in connection with the settlement of disputes. He settled one dispute after another.</P>
    <P>The housing of teachers is another problem in the country areas.  Most of our young teachers, when they start out in life, have a small salary and are unable to build a house for themselves. I hope the managers and the clergy will make every effort to see that, where a new school is built, a teacher's residence is also erected.  If that is not done you will have this continuous movement of young teachers from the remote areas to the bigger centres of population with consequent ill-effects on the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to see that teachers are properly housed when a new school is built.  Many of our young teachers in the rural areas must spend a week or a month endeavouring to procure lodgings in poor surroundings where one would be ashamed to see them.  Young teachers, coming from the training colleges, should be provided with houses in order to allow them to settle down permanently among the people they have to teach.  I see too many of the teachers in my own area going to the bigger centres and leaving a void in the rural areas.  Where you have contented teachers you will have contentment all round.</P>
    <P>The teacher has always been a person of noble character&mdash;a person whom the people respect.  If you had contented teachers in the country areas at the present time, the results would be reflected in the type of pupil they would turn out.  Why should teachers have to seek work across the water when there is employment for them here?  In moulding the character of a child the teacher plays a most important role.  Practically nobody can mould the character of a child as well as a teacher and we should inculcate the conviction amongst teachers that their profession is a vocation rather than a way of getting bigger money.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to get thousands of teachers who will be attracted by the salary but the teacher who <Col N="1394" /> dedicates himself to teaching as a vocation has almost the same influence as the young man who goes in for the Church.  The teaching profession is almost a sacred vocation since the teacher has to deal with the education of children during their most formative years.  The teacher is of immense importance in the country areas and we should endeavour to see that our teachers are of the right type, quality and character.  To permit persons to enter the teaching profession because they have an eye on the salary is a bad thing.  They should regard their job as a vocation.</P>
    <P>If they have not the vocation they will never settle down and they will be of no use in moulding the character of people in the remote areas where the Irish spirit exists.  It is from these parts of Ireland that the real Ireland springs.  At the moment we are passing through a very weak period in Irish history.  For the past 15 or 20 years we have gone through a period of reasonable prosperity.  It was also a period of materialism.  Materialism is sweeping the country at the present moment and unless we can eradicate that spirit it will be very hard to resurrect Irish Ireland.  The national spirit at the present moment is almost gone.  We must resurrect that spirit if we want to get rid of shoneenism and everything connected therewith which makes for weakness in the Irish character.</P>
    <P>With regard to the revival of the language, good progress is being made. Great progress was made during the past 20 years and in the future, with very good pressure at all times, we shall make further progress in the revival of the language so that a generation will arise who will form part of an Irish-speaking Ireland.</P>
    <P>One great drawback in the country areas is the lack of parish halls.  The national school is most important but after that comes the parish hall.  Most of our country areas are too poor to build parish halls of their own.  A hall, no matter how small, costs a couple of thousand pounds to build and most of our parishes are all already in difficulties through having to contribute <Col N="1395" /> towards other projects.  I think the Government should, where there is not a parish hall and where the people cannot afford to build one, construct a hall which should be the centre of the social life of the rural community.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, most of our people in the country at the present moment go to the public house which exerts a very bad influence.  I should like to see a parish hall in every parish&mdash;a place where the youth could participate in the life of the rural community.  It would be worth while spending money on the erection of such parish halls and I would ask the Minister to interest the other Departments in the matter. It is sickening to see groups of people standing round the cross-roads or outside the public houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a different matter all right.  There was a most important debate on the question of the restoration of the Irish language. I am quite certain there are many things militating against the restoration of the Irish language.  First of all, for years we have had an enormous number of cranks who somehow always got to the top.  These cranks kept a large number of our people away from taking a full part in the Irish language revival.  I hope that with the passing of the years these cranks will fade into the background and that people of broad minds and good character will come to the front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a whole lot of codology about this language restoration.  A vast number of people learned the language in order to get good jobs; when they had got the jobs they never bothered about the language any more. You had that happening in every parish in the country.  You saw a man who was a great enthusiast in the restoration <Col N="1396" /> movement; you would see him on every platform and at every feis. Then when he got a good job you never saw him on a platform again. That bedevilled the efforts to restore the language.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about the language.  I believe all the talk about it is nonsense.  Side by side with the restoration of the language, you must also restore Irish culture and the distinctive characteristics of our people. We should cut out all this nonsensical talk and get down to the groundwork. There is more involved than the language.  We must get our people to learn the history of our country and to understand it perfectly.  There has been too much false history published in this country for years.  Let us now try to learn all that is good in our history and destroy all that is bad because we have had a whole lot of bad in our history too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We must lay a good foundation.  There is a weakness in the Irish character which we must eliminate. We have still an inferiority complex instilled into our people by centuries of oppression and tyranny.  Our people have been prone to deception, and that characteristic is still there. Many of our people will still tell a lie when there is no need for it.  We must get rid of that.  We are free now; there is no need to tell lies or deceive any more.  We must also teach our people our history, our folklore and our distinctive culture.  I am sorry that my colleague Deputy James Tully embarked on a certain statement which was unfair to my county and to this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the children of to-day are as well educated as the children of 30 or 40 years ago, when 35 per cent. of our people were illiterate.  At that time many of the parents could not read, <Col N="1397" /> write or think for themselves.  In those days, many children left school unable to spell.  That condition of affairs no longer prevails.  I am satisfied that children of the present-day are fairly well educated, even though they have to learn the Irish language.  There is hardly a boy or girl turned out by our schools at the moment who is not able to read, write and do arithmetic.  It is no use thinking, on the other hand, that all our children are scholars.  They are not.  Many of our children are dull and will always be dull, no matter what we do for them.  But the vast majority being turned out by our schools are well educated, and, if they are not bright, it is not the fault of the teachers but is due to failure to comply with the School Attendance Act.  Many boys can get away with going to school for three months of the year only.  How can we expect the teachers to turn them out as scholars?  When they are brought to court they say they have been slapped and that they are afraid to go to school, the poor, dear darlings.  Every child who has reached the school-going age should be sent to school every day.  If he is not it will ruin his chance of earning a livelihood later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully fell into another trap. Being a young Deputy it is not easy for him to see every trap that is set. Many people read the <i>Irish Times</i> and those anti-Irish writings which are always laying traps for the Irish people.  The whole ambition of the author is to see that this country shall not progress as a free nation.  I would ask Deputy Tully never to take seriously any of those articles in the <i>Irish Times</i> with those glaring headings.</P>

      <P>It was not the truth. That is only one of the traps set for young Deputies.  I am too old a dog <Col N="1398" /> to fall for that kind of thing.  Whenever the Deputy sees headings like these in any of those papers he should realise they are all traps and he should not fall for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he liked it or not, a colony of migrants was established in my county.  A large colony of Irish speakers from the West were settled at Gibbstown.  I am sure the Government meant well when they established a first-class school for that colony.  The school was established by the Fianna Fáil Government and I know they meant well in establishing such a school in the heart of the Pale.  The only weakness was that there was only one colony.  If they wanted to make that school a success they should have established a chain of colonies from Connemara to Meath.  Then there would have been some hope for success.</P>
      <P>I feel quite sure that the establishment of the school at Gibbstown was a genuine effort to do something for the restoration of Irish Ireland and for the spreading of the language.  It may be that there is a decrease in the number of pupils attending that school, that many of them, perhaps 100, have gone to another school.  The Gibbstown school is an Irish Ireland school in which, I expect, the teachers teach all subjects through Irish.  If you put a colony of Irish speakers into an area, it is only right that such colonies would make every effort to be Irish-Irelanders, speaking the language, learning the language and doing all subjects through the Irish language.  If that is the case I am quite happy about it.  There should be no inferiority complex when we are making every effort to do something to promote the national language.  It is only a small centre that we have in County Meath but from that area, as time goes on, perhaps the language can spread out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully said there was a poor, dilapidated school not far away which was always crammed with pupils.  I could believe that.  If the ordinary pupils do not want to study through <Col N="1399" /> Irish, they will naturally go to the other school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Gaeltacht pupils too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case, but I want the Deputy to realise that these people had the tradition of emigration to England when they were in the West of Ireland, a strong tradition handed down from father to son. That is something that will not die out overnight.  I am sure that when the boys in that colony now reach the age of 16 or 17, they are off to England to earn the big money.  Some of them settle down there, some come back. But I will not belittle the efforts made by any native Irish Government to lay the foundations of the Irish language in royal Meath.  I would ask this Government and succeeding Governments to make an effort to link that colony with the West of Ireland by a chain of such outposts all the way from the west to the east coast.  It would do a vast amount of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to have this inferiority complex and the feeling that our children are not half-taught because of compulsory Irish.  That is false.  Everything is compulsory.  No child will go to school if you do not make him go; no child will do the right thing. Children will do the wrong thing, if you let them.  There is no more compulsion in regard to Irish than in regard to writing or arithmetic, mensuration or anything else.  We have just come to the end of a period of some 16 years of the best prices that the world could give us for our produce during and after the war years and if the present generation cannot make an effort on behalf of their own country and their own language they should be ashamed of themselves.  They should be grateful that they have a country that is free, thanks to the efforts of Pearse, Collins, Griffith and all the other patriots.  The present generation should make a real effort to restore the native culture, the Irish language and if they do not, we are not worthy to be free but worthy only to be a subject nation.  I am, <Col N="1400" /> however, satisfied that we are worthy of our freedom and of the glorious heritage handed down over thousands of years.</P>
    <P>We hear of the persecution in Poland, Yugoslavia and other countries, but we went through all that for several hundred years and it is only now that we can see the sun shining. There should be no shoneenism.  A wave of materialism has descended on this country in the last five or ten years and it has destroyed the hope of the restoration of a real Irish Ireland. There is a minority of people in this country who are very hopeful, who are trained and educated across the water and who sneer and jeer at the very idea of Ireland or an Irish Republic. Those people were the leading lights in other days; let us see that they are not the leading lights in Ireland to-day but that they take their rightful place in the back seats.</P>
    <P>All over the country at the moment sectional interests are developing into powerful organisations and at the top of the majority of those we find educated English snobs.  It is time that we stopped that and made a real effort to give this country back its heritage.  I believe we have a mission, and our mission is to do the right thing for our community.  The English are proud of their country; let us be proud of ours.  Germany, Belgium, Poland, each has its own language&mdash;why should we not have our language?  But no, we are told that the poor, dear darlings are compelled to learn Irish.  I would almost say that if we were to drop teaching of Irish in the schools and teach French instead, the children would be brought from the back streets and the front streets to learn French, but because it is Irish we are trying to restore, it is said to be a terrible curse.</P>
    <P>I think that inferiority complex must be eradicated.  I believe we have a Minister, a Department and an outlook among the majority of our people which will help us to forge ahead.  The present phase in Irish history is the most dangerous that we have experienced in 700 years because the more materialism and comfort there is, the weaker the nation will become <Col N="1401" /> unless we can get a young leader in every parish able to stand up and declare that we must resurrect this country and build it up for the Irish people.  We have a heritage and a mission to spread the light in other lands as we have done in the past.  I want to see that mission carried on in the future.</P>
    <P>I would ask this House to be unanimous in seeing that everything we can do to restore the language and the culture of the Irish people is done. Otherwise, we are failing in our task, discrediting ourselves and dishonouring the dead.  I would ask, then, in God's name, that there should be no more of this whining and crying about our people not being educated and that we cannot give work to our people.  I believe tens of thousands of people have left the country who need not have left.  I saw them leave splendid jobs all because of that inferiority complex.  They felt there was something big across the water.  They were earning £6 or £7 at home but they wanted to earn £15 or £16 in England. They say we cannot stop emigration. I believe that as long as there is big money in England, the people will go there but they will come back when the big money is gone.</P>

I believe that, as the thousands went out in the past, so they will come back in a few years' time, perhaps sooner.  That will be a testing time as to-day is a testing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this Estimate is one on which every Deputy in the House should speak.  It is the most important Department of all because it is concerned with the moulding of the present and future generations and if the effort fails the nation will fail.  I think it has not failed and that we are slowly but surely forging ahead.  We should try to get rid of snobbery, pessimism and this inferiority complex. <Col N="1402" /> We should hold up our heads. There is more in life than materialism, money, comfort or wealth.  There is the spirit of the nation to be resurrected and a heritage to be handed on. Let us, in God's name, through the Minister and the Department, settle down to continue strenuously the work that is going on well at the moment and let there be an end to the whining and crying about the Irish language being the curse of the country.</P>
    <P>There is always a minority in this country who try to carry the country. Going back 30 or 40 years when there was a military movement here, we had not the majority behind us.  It was the minority that carried the flag and the gun, and from that minority we got a majority to come forward and take their rightful places in the nation.  It is the same to-day.  A vocal minority is a very dangerous thing and there should be a vocal majority to keep that minority in its proper place.  If there is, I believe we will win the day. This country is not down and out; it is a country which is doing reasonably well.  This nation has come through an Anglo-Irish war, a civil war and an economic war.  We have had enormous prosperity for not alone the farmer but the cottier and everybody else with huge amounts of money being poured into this country.  In the midst of those things it is hard for us to hold our heads high.  However, those things are passing and a new phase is opening up and so the Irish people have an opportunity to make this country worthy of its past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that those who were responsible for the foundation of the movement to which I, with others, have the honour to belong, the Labour movement, early adopted as one of the primary tenets of their political faith the motto: &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo;.  I suppose the word freedom has been used in this country in so many different forms that its true meaning has almost become obscured.  It is one thing to get an invader out of your country and to reach a situation where the people who live in the country and who are natives of it are running it <Col N="1403" /> themselves, but the essential freedom is the freedom to develop the intellect, to develop ability and to encourage whatever qualities are inherent in the nation.  That is the problem which besets educationists, successive Ministers for Education and successive Governments&mdash;how best to pursue a policy of education which will benefit our people and bring out the best in them.</P>
      <P>I have listened to debates here over quite a few years on this question and when the Irish language comes up for discussion as a hardy annual, everybody says pious things about it, how we should promote its use and how we should encourage it.  I admit it is very difficult to find any all-embracing solution as to how to bring Irish back at least as a spoken language amongst the majority of the people.  However, there is one thing I hold very firmly, that the policy which has been pursued of trying to teach subjects through the medium of Irish to students who have not got a firm grasp of Irish is a fatal one and one calculated to damage the cause of revival.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated before, I speak from personal experience in this matter.  How can any student be expected to learn difficult subjects such as I myself had the experience of trying to grasp, for instance, geometry, Euclid, through the medium of Irish, when he does not know Irish sufficiently well to follow it.  I think that has been very harmful and it has resulted from over-enthusiasm and no little fanaticism on the part of the advocates of revival.  All of us want to see Irish spoken throughout the country.  Deputy O'Higgins, in my opinion, was quite right in saying we should define what our objective is.  Do we want to see the complete extinction of English and the substitution therefor of Irish as the only spoken language?  Do we want to see our country bilingual, speaking both Irish and English?  Or do we want to go along as we are, pursuing a policy of <i>laissez faire</i>, not getting very far and not worrying very much from one day to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously we should seek to make <Col N="1404" /> our country bilingual.  We are living in a modern world where distances are not as far as they were 20 years ago. It is important to make contact with the outside world and the obvious way to make that contact is through the medium of the language spoken generally at least in Europe, America and other parts of the world, that is, the English language.  We must at the same time promote as far as we can the use and the love of our own language. That is where we fall down.  We do not seem to be able to get across to the children and the older people of this nation any love for the language or respect for it.</P>
    <P>I have seen, and so have other Deputies here, people who know the language being ashamed to speak it in public, for what reason I do not know. They are ashamed to be heard speaking it between themselves in public places, whether it be on the street, in restaurants, public houses or elsewhere. We have failed to inculcate into our people a respect and love for the language.  I do not know how it will be done.  I am not, any more than any other person here, an oracle in that regard.  Some people have very easy solutions for every human problem and they will propound them with all the glibness possible but I shall not do that.  I do not know how we shall solve this problem but until we succeed in getting our children to like the language, to appreciate the tremendous wealth of beauty that exists in Irish literature we shall not get very far with the revival.</P>
    <P>Compulsion in the form that we know it to-day, particularly the compulsory teaching of subjects through the medium of Irish, is very harmful. I have said that many times and I do not intend to be repetitive.  Those are my convictions and many will disagree with me.  One of the difficulties with regard to the revival is the fact that the majority of children who go to school here must necessarily leave at 14 years of age and go to work.  From then on, they are concerned with the struggle for existence rather than any recreation such as the Irish language might afford.  One of the reasons for <Col N="1405" /> that is that we have not yet reached the stage when secondary education is within the reach of the ordinary people.  The average working-class parents cannot afford to send their children to a secondary school.  They must leave long before they should to earn their living.  It may very well be in the future&mdash;we may not be here; the longer one is here the less confident one is in regard to progress in these matters&mdash;we shall be sufficiently enlightened to provide free education right up to leaving certificate standard for all our people.  Apparently it is too much to hope for now.</P>
    <P>So much for the language.  No doubt the various clichés will be repeated here <i>ad nauseam</i> and we shall wind up much the same as we are now.  I rose particularly in this debate to make one point to which I think the attention of the Minister should be drawn.  I am informed that there is in the basement of the National Gallery a life-size statue of a very famous Irishman.  It is a statue of the late George Bernard Shaw.  It would be no more than just, right and proper that that statue should be publicly displayed.  Shaw was one of the most outstanding Irishmen this nation has produced.  Whatever one may think of his views&mdash;and not everybody will agree with his opinions&mdash;nobody can quarrel with the fact that he was a writer of outstanding ability.  He stood by this nation at a time when this country had few friends.  He was an outstanding Dubliner.  To a certain extent, he can be said to contribute to our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Americans, and others, come here anxious to see the places where great international figures, like Shaw, lived and had their being, and possibly suffered not a little.  That is evidenced in the fact that there are conducted tours to the places where people like Shaw lived.  Shaw was a man whom the Dublin Corporation saw fit to make a freeman of their city.  Now, in the basement of the National Gallery there is a very fine statue of Shaw.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's <Col N="1406" /> opinion.  I have no doubt he would be delighted to leave it there.  Before Shaw died he wrote to a very prominent Dublinman, a Mr. O'Reilly, an employee of the Board of Works, and he expressed the desire that, in his native city, this piece of statuary should be on display, possibly outside the Municipal Gallery.  He also, in his modesty, said that it would be remembered as a fine piece of craftsmanship long after his name had been forgotten. I have sufficient temerity to make the suggestion that this statue should be displayed publicly and I hope that, in time, even Deputy Giles may come to realise that Shaw was a great Irishman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Giles is taking the <i>Irish Times</i> line. Shaw is not someone of whom we should be ashamed, despite the vilification of his enemies.  Dublin Corporation is a very responsible body. Dublin Corporation made another great Irishman, James Larkin, a freeman of this city.  They do not do these things lightly.  The freedom of a city is a very high honour.  That alone is an indication of the esteem in which Shaw was held by so many of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education has, of necessity, to be dealt with in a conservative manner. Very little change takes place from one year to another.  There have been many complaints about the condition of our schools in rural and urban areas.  Yesterday Deputy McQuillan dealt with what he considered to be a grievance, namely, the disparity between the treatment of urban areas and rural areas in the allocation of moneys. If it were not for the fact that we have here in Dublin an unfortunate annual influx of so many thousands from the rural areas, much more money could be made available for the building or reconstruction of schools in the rural areas.  Because of the influx into Dublin City and County an educational problem is created; more and more schools are necessary.  The population of Dublin at the moment <Col N="1407" /> is close on 750,000, nearly one-third of the total population of the Twenty-Six Counties.  In that situation there is bound to be a growing demand for more and more schools.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary situation now exists, and has existed for some years, that, whereas 20 years ago, the difficulty was to get children to go to school the difficulty nowadays is to get schools to which to send children.  The schools are overcrowded, particularly in the new housing areas.  These areas are developing to house in many cases, possibly, large numbers of Deputy McQuillan's ex-constituents, and ex-constituents of other Deputies too. These people seem to regard Dublin as an El Dorado.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>They by-pass Dublin on their way to Birmingham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately that is not altogether true.  It may be the half-way house on their way to Birmingham, but, on their way back, they stay and create a problem for the Dublin Corporation.  Dubliners <i>qua</i> Dubliners cannot get a house in their own city and they must look with a bleak eye at the situation in which people from the country with large families&mdash;and they do have large families; that is a good thing&mdash;get the preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is discrimination against the rural areas.  One must provide money where the demand is greatest.  The rural areas should, of course, be fairly treated too.  The problem of replacing all our schools is of necessity a big one.  Remember, that most of the schools were built under the British régime, within the last 100 or 120 years.  Most were built as an excuse; any kind of shelter would do into which to throw the children so that the people would not complain.  No doubt most of them were built with slave labour, or as near slave labour as made no difference, and of the worst possible material.  All these will have to be replaced.  Sanguine though some Deputies may be, one cannot remedy the effect of hundreds of years of British occupation <Col N="1408" /> inside 20, 30 or 40 years, not even materially, much less spiritually.  I know that the spiritual is far dearer to the heart of Deputy Giles than the material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate follows a pretty general pattern and I do not think I can usefully help by following that pattern.  The defects in our system were mentioned by some Deputies and then brushed aside, with a general attribution of them to compulsory Irish.  Now, that is simply evading the issue.  There are defects, but these defects are in no way due to either the teaching or the speaking of the Irish language.  Some time ago there may have been cause for complaint in that regard, but the cause was temporary in its nature and the ground no longer exists.  We are losing sight of the problem here by simply pointing out the things that are, perhaps, wrong; children to-day are being turned out with an insufficient grasp of some of the fundamentals and then there is the <i>non sequitur</i> of reference straightway to the Irish language problem.  Now these are two completely distinct issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal more generally, as far as I can here, with our educational system with regard to the product we are turning out.  I am afraid it is a fact&mdash;and the evidence for it can be adduced, perhaps, from people who are taking young people in for employment, particularly in clerical grades, and the evidence of such people will be reinforced in many cases by university teachers&mdash;that there is a complaint generally going around more or less on these lines: that the children who are being turned out to-day are deficient as compared with earlier generations, particularly the generations who were educated, say, 30 or 40 years ago, in such matters as the detailed implementation of a task, the ability to write a business letter&mdash;to take a simple thing&mdash;the ability to do a calculation and to follow it through. There seems to be a certain dislike to attend to a particular task in detail and to prosecute it through to a finish and the exclusion of other distractions. <Col N="1409" /> Perhaps that is a natural human tendency but people who have some experience say that that tendency is more obvious to-day than it was in the past and it is said that such a pattern is too uniform and too common to be accidental.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that one hears.  It is a type of thing that is, I confess, very difficult to assess.  In the case of any private Deputy getting up to speak on such a matter it is a very difficult thing to assess because it all depends on whom he has been talking to.  Too often one hears, particularly in regard to secondary teaching, parents complaining that their children cannot do sums, that they have not been taught to write, that they cannot spell, that they have been introduced to all sorts of wide fields but that they are unable to do these simple things that matter.  I must confess that there is certain corroboration of that to be found where people are interviewing or examining people for employment, say, in clerical grades.</P>
    <P>In seeking for a cause of all that, granting that that is a fair picture and trying to assess it, I think that possibly the root cause goes back to a violent change in our educational outlook here which took place about 1925. There was a reaction.  I know that that has been corrected to a large extent in more recent years but at that time there was a very violent reaction which, coupled with other things which happened in the country, had a very unfortunate effect.</P>
    <P>I may be permitted to go back a little to that time.  I have done it on a previous Estimate some years ago. In the period 1925 to 1929 the system and the programme were so diffuse and nebulous that the whole tendency was to turn out people from the secondary schools&mdash;I am confining myself to secondary schools for the moment&mdash; with a gentleman-dabbler's knowledge of nearly everything under the sun and a very serious deficiency in basic techniques and detailed knowledge of anything. It was the type of thing that tended to produce smart Alecks who <Col N="1410" /> were fundamentally inefficient and basically ignorant at the same time,</P>
    <P>I know that that was corrected to a large extent by the introduction of prescribed texts again, and so forth, but I still think that the impetus of that is not completely gone and that what is really wrong&mdash;I am talking about our secondary approach&mdash;is that there is too much prescribed, the fields are too wide, the courses are too ambitious, the demands on the child are so wide as to deprive him of the opportunity which he really should have of concentrating.  That had unfortunate consequences.  The plea I want to make, as I made on a previous occasion here, is to narrow down somewhat and then concentrate on detail.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what I put on the record in regard to that some years ago.  Is there a tendency in the Irish character towards slipshodness when it comes to prosecuting a task to completion?  There may be an initial brilliant flash; there may be a certain aptitude and ability for commencing a task and even conceiving how it should be put through.  All that is granted and I do not think our people are in any way behind others.  In fact I think they have advantages over many people in that regard.  But where the failure comes is in dogged detailed finishing of the job and the concentration on those details that make all the difference between a job well done and a job so badly done as to be hardly done at all.</P>
    <P>If we could restrict the curriculum, demand more in detail, insist on a smaller course, a more circumscribed course but a more detailed and a higher standard of efficiency in answering on that restricted course, we would be not only helping to solve a number of our educational problems but we would also be making a contribution to the moulding of the national character.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to some details in regard to these matters, particularly in regard to the leaving certificate of the secondary schools but, before so doing, there is another general aspect to be mentioned.  There has been a change <Col N="1411" /> in the last 50 years in human society and modern development.  There has been a very big change in technical development, in technical evolution and an increase in mechanisation in practically every department of life. There has been&mdash;and equally important&mdash;a very big change in communications. Naturally following from that, there has also been an inevitable tendency towards specialisation in the individual.  These are trends that I do not think should be overlooked.  Therefore, merely assessing the curricula in terms of, say, what was tried and successfully tried, I think, at the beginning of this century, the educational programmes and examinations need review in the light of the development I have indicated.</P>
    <P>You have this tendency to specialisation. In a nutshell as far as this Estimate is concerned, you have a much greater amount of knowledge to convey to the child to fit him for the ordinary run of life on the one hand and, on the other hand, you have the local problem of trying to educate children to attend to an isolated or particular task or activity and complete the task in detail with efficiency. These two things conflict to a large extent.  On that very general basis alone&mdash;I will particularise in a moment &mdash;I think a review of our secondary education programmes is indicated.</P>
    <P>Somebody else in regard to some other part of the debate said you have got to ask yourself what is the objective. As time will not permit going into every course and programme in this House in detail&mdash;at least not this session&mdash;perhaps the best course to take is the leaving certificate honours and try to see that course in relation to life at the moment here and the general approach which I tried to indicate a few minutes ago.  I take that course for the reason that it is the top, so to speak.  It is the ultimate that anyone can reach in the secondary school.</P>
    <P>That being so, it is natural to look at all other courses as regulated or graded towards that climax.  Let me read from the rules and programme for the secondary schools, 1955-56, in respect of the leaving certificate <Col N="1412" /> examination under the heading Note:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the leaving certificate is to testify to the completion of a good secondary education and to the fitness of a pupil to enter upon a course of study in a university or an educational institution of similar standing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the leaving certificate is to testify to the completion of a good secondary education.&rdquo;  That will be accepted but it may be well to question the meaning of the second part of that clause: &ldquo;And to the fitness of a pupil to enter upon a course of study in a university or an educational institution of similar standing.&rdquo;  What is to be understood by the phrase &ldquo;fitness of a pupil?&rdquo;  Does it mean they are to get a certain preliminary specialised treatment and education in a subject which they are going to pursue in the university afterwards or does it simply mean a general secondary education of a kind that will fit the individual profitably to follow a course in the university?</P>
    <P>Looking through the examination papers&mdash;I have them here in respect of three years&mdash;I rather think there is a certain lack of co-ordination between all the courses and the general aim.  I think that, if anybody were asked, they would say that the basis is to give the child a good all-round secondary education so that, when he goes to a university, a law school or into any other activity or business, he will have that basic education that will enable him to attack the job in hand.  In effect, you are saying that the aim would seem to be that specialisation is to come afterwards.  I think that is the answer that most teachers and people would give if one posed the question.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, reading the examination papers, one gets the feeling that the individual controllers of the courses and the people setting the examination have a much more specialised object in mind even though, perhaps, it is probably subconscious. It is a point though for the Department to examine and I think it is a point to be taken in relation to the <Col N="1413" /> general problem as to whether the courses are not too wide and too general in each individual subject, posing the ultimately impossible task to the student of mastering them all and leaving them in that unfinished condition of which I complained in the beginning.</P>
    <P>I know I am taking a line here which is not usually taken in this House but it would be no harm to examine the question in that light.  If one takes the particular subjects in detail, one is struck by two things.  First of all, in connection with some subjects which I will mention in a moment, I would invite the Minister to compare a degree examination&mdash;mark you, I say a degree examination&mdash;in a university with the leaving certificate honours examination. That comparison alone will show, if you like to use the current phrase, the very high standard of the leaving certificate examination.  I should prefer to describe it in less flattering terms myself because I think it is a mistake that that should be so but that is what you will be told.</P>
    <P>You will be told: &ldquo;Of course, the same standard of answering is not required.&rdquo; That is the whole trouble. The same standard of answering the question set should be required at all stages&mdash;the standard being sound knowledge, thorough knowledge and an ability to convey to the examiner that knowledge.  One hears sometimes, in answer to criticism of that nature, &ldquo;Of course the same standard of answering is not required.&rdquo;  The system that allows that to happen is indicted out of hand in my humble opinion.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to compare practically any of his leaving certificate examinations&mdash;I have the papers here in respect of three years and I will have a look at them in a moment&mdash; with degree examinations in these subjects and I venture to say that there are questions in the leaving certificate examinations that could quite easily and properly be transferred to a degree paper and, on occasion, to an honours degree paper at that.  If I am challenged on that, I have one question in mind which is certainly an honours degree question.  Is that a sound situation <Col N="1414" /> to have?  Would it not be better to circumscribe the course?  If you like to go back a little bit to the old intermediate viewpoint under the old education board, limit the course, prescribe the course, make your examinations more definite so that the answers must be definite, so that a child will have to answer in a definite way, rightly or wrongly, and that he will be able to show that he has mastered the basic techniques of the subject in question.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very urgent task for the Department and the Minister as far as secondary education is concerned. I shall postpone for a moment the following of that up because the details may, perhaps, get a little involved. There is another point I should like to make to the Minister in respect of this.  I pointed out that the standard appears to be almost, in some respects, a university standard.  People may argue that that is right but I think I have given the answer.</P>
    <P>There is another facet of the problem. When a person goes to a law school, a university, some institution in which he will specialise, or maybe into business, he will be a specialist in our modern society, and whatever educationists may say about it, after the child leaves school he will find himself in some rank of society in some specialised occupation and, thereafter, his energies, his studies will, for practically the whole of the rest of his life, be directed to that specialisation.</P>
    <P>That being so, I know that educationists will then say that is all the more reason why the secondary school course should be wide.  Evading that again for a moment&mdash;it is a subject for discussion in itself&mdash;and saying we will continue to give a fairly broad basis on which to build, what are we doing about it?  Again, on that ground, I am driven back to asking the Minister if he will restrict the courses?  Let us compare again the leaving certificate course with certain other courses, whether in law in a specialised institution, in economics in a specialised institution or in the university.  The groups of subjects will be homogeneous, related, more or less.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> If a boy is sent from a school to a university, to a branch of science, he will have a group of subjects that hang together.  If he does medicine he has a group of subjects that hang together. Of course the doctor can still deal in generalities, but with the exception of medicine, in every other department the subjects are not only related but they are closely related.  Specialisation goes on in all these lines.  When an engineer goes to college he has related subjects, in which he must have an interest, such as mathematics, mechanics and so forth.  The lawyer will take legal and political science which have a common interest.  That, in itself, helps in concentration, and helps the student at that stage to develop on a general line; in other words, the grouping tends to concentration.</P>
    <P>You have the reverse situation in the secondary schools, where you have, for the moment, the theory that you are giving the children a good general education by having a grouping of divergent subjects, a grouping of subjects which are not inter-related.  Concentration on one of those subjects does not help concentration of the other, and this makes the task much more difficult and places on the child a greater strain in the interests of specialisation afterwards.</P>
    <P>There is a psychological point involved. Most people have aptitudes and inaptitudes and I think a teacher will find in a school that children who find certain subjects easy and who will have a liking for some subjects, will very often have a distaste for others. It is the one for which they have the distaste which will cause the bother and, in specialisation afterwards, presumably the student's tastes will be suited to all the related subjects in the group he takes.  The net result of that approach is open to such interpretation that you should have a more restricted field of subjects, a more manageable field which you can use to equip the child with a certain basic knowledge in these subjects, a knowledge from which he can specialise afterwards, and, incidentally, a knowledge that will provide a certain amount of psychological balance afterwards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> Take that in relation to the leaving certificate.  According to the syllabus the children must take five subjects. A boy, you will find, will take Irish and English for a start, because they seem to be necessary prerequisites anyway for living in the part of the world in which we live.  After that, mathematics in some form are obviously necessary.  There is a choice of two other subjects.  What is the boy going to do there?  Some may take Latin.  There is a great deal to be said for the taking of Latin because there are many subjects afterwards where a rudimentary knowledge of Latin is useful. I have spoken of four out of five subjects.  Most people, if they have not got anything else in their minds, may take subjects such as music and drawing.</P>
    <P>I ask how can you work out a course like that?  On that basis, you are simply not going to be able to go into useful detail, detail that will last, and a wide course that will last usefully in these things as we apparently are attempting, in these examinations, to do.  A boy wants a modern language under modern circumstances.  Without one he will find himself handicapped. If he is doing law it would, as I have said, be very useful for him to have a rudimentary knowledge of Latin.  A modern language will not be lost anyway.</P>
    <P>There you have probably four out of five for any child, the basic general pattern&mdash;Irish, English, Mathematics, and, we will say, Latin, or a modern language.  When I say that, I am taking the average boy.  On the basis of that let us ask a few questions in regard to these basic things.  We will start with Irish.  What do we need in respect of Irish?  Do we not need a spoken knowledge&mdash;is not that what all are talking about&mdash;a spoken, active knowledge of the language?  Details of literature, what I might call Celtic studies in a specialised sense are, by and large, for the specialist.  What we want of the boy or girl coming out of school is a good, ordinary, spoken knowledge of the language.</P>
    <P>This question has been gone into in <Col N="1417" /> detail already and I do not want to delay upon it.  But, could we not in our secondary schools, right through from start to finish, concentrate on one simple thing, on encouraging the talking of Irish, by making it as simple as possible?  If that were done we would gain two very valuable things in our educational system, especially when we are not concerned with the specialised pupil.  The first valuable thing we would gain would be that we would probably do more for the revival of the language than anything else; secondly, there would be the useful education of the children in the idea of a second language.  It does appear that it is harder for people to learn a language if they know only one language than if they have two.  The very fact of being bilingual gives a certain facility for the understanding of what language is and for acquiring another language.  That seems to be indicated by the experience on the Continent, and the same thing should also apply here.</P>
    <P>If we just encourage the children to talk Irish&mdash;and we need not be too worried about a detailed knowledge, about poets or anything like that, but only about the spoken language&mdash;we will accomplish both of the things to which I have referred.  The pupils will not be Irish scholars, but they will be Irish speakers.  I know that that would mean a big administrative difficulty because it lays the emphasis on the tongue and not on the pen.  It means organising in the schools some method of examining the children orally, and, as I suggest, making the written examinations so simple by comparison with other subjects that all the children will love Irish because it is easy.</P>
    <P>This talk about the Irish language being more difficult than any other language is utter rubbish.  Every language is difficult if you do not know it at first.  I am sorry that the Minister is not present when I say this, but it would be worth while to organise a system by which we would have oral examinations each year for every student.  After all, it is possible in Christian doctrine to have children <Col N="1418" /> orally examined at the present time and the children, I am glad to say, know their Christian doctrine.  We should combine the two things&mdash;the emphasis on speaking and the easiness of Irish.  There should be an understanding on the part of the examiners that they will simply go in for making the examination papers easy and attractive.  Then, as I say, you will have done these two valuable things. So much for Irish.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to English, what we want, as I have said here before, is that the children should be able to express themselves in after life in English.  They have to read and express themselves in their ordinary activities through English.  I know that in saying this I may be accused of being too practical or too earthy, but the fact is that the ordinary child needs to be able to read and write English, to express himself in English and to be able to reason in that language.  Indeed, he should be able to do the same in Irish, and he will, if the approaches that I have indicated here are adopted.  In English, the child will need good grammar, good spelling, and good writing&mdash;I mean ordinary physical writing&mdash;and accurate expression.  These are the things that are needed, and I would go rather easily on some of the specialised and ambitious prescribed courses.</P>
    <P>It has often struck me&mdash;I do not know whether or not I am wrong&mdash;and everybody tells me, nowadays, that nobody reads poetry.  You can go round to people who have just left school, and we find that the knowledge of Shakespeare generally is pretty poor.  I wonder how much of that is due to our education?  How many of us have had &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; or the best part of Shakespeare ruined for us by the approach that has been taken in our educational system to these things?  I have often wondered whether the reading of poetry has declined in our population due to the fact that it is being shoved in a compulsory fashion down the necks of the children.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about compulsion in education.  If the Minister wants my opinion, compulsion of that nature, compulsion of this unnecessary nature <Col N="1419" /> is damaging.  I hope to come to that in detail and to the actual examination papers in a moment, but the plea I would like to make is that the approach should be from the point of view of the child, whether he is going to be a doctor, an engineer or in business, that a basic command of the English medium of expression would be essential.  It seems to me that it is very important from the lawyer's point of view.  I know a professor of law who has complained bitterly of the difficulties encountered because of the inadequate teaching in that sense, in the sense that the accurate using of words and accuracy of expression is not insisted on.  Children must be given the ability to express themselves accurately and to use words accurately in a way which does not seem to happen now as it happened under another system.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental thing, as I say, in regard to the law but it is equally fundamental in regard to practically any other subject.  Even in the case of mathematics one needs to be quite clear on points of basic education, quite clear and unequivocal in expression. Mathematics cannot all be expressed by symbolism.  The same applies in the case of any scientific job.</P>
    <P>I think perhaps there, more than anywhere else, I have put my finger on what is wrong with our education and the defects of character that have resulted from it.</P>
    <P>Moving from English to mathematics, I think that mathematics are completely over-prescribed.  I am going to ask a couple of simple questions.  Again I come to the papers.  Let any of us ask ourselves&mdash;that is anybody who has not specialised on those lines in mathematics or science&mdash;to what extent do we need these things?  Some of them we do need, and in fact, there is hardly anyone who does not need to be able to reckon a sum in money.  The lawyer needs to be able to do it; so does the economist and the businessman for whom it is almost part of his stock-in-trade. Practically every one of us needs this ability in addition even if it is only for the benefit of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It would be a very good education if the Minister were to dish out in this House the examination papers in, say, mathematics and let us all tackle them and see what answers we get.  In the leaving certificate standard for example, I would like any Deputy to tell me, no matter what he is&mdash;and this House is supposed to be representative of the people&mdash;of some case during his life, be it long or short, when an occasion arose in the course of his business for him to apply one of these trigonometrical conundrums that appear on our examination papers?</P>
      <P>I will go a little further than that. There are some people who, in actual lines that involve mathematical specialisation, do not frequently meet some of those things.  These are all very good from the point of view of specialisation and from the point of view even of discipline in method but what I am afraid of in this educational programme is that we are forgetting that we want to turn the child out basically fitted to undertake later a wide choice of specialisation and that if we wish to do that we cannot go into detailed specialisation in these subjects at school stage but rather should we have a more modest, and more general target, as far as these basic subjects are concerned.</P>
      <P>In connection with Latin, it is an extremely useful subject.  The lawyer will probably need it and there is a wealth of European history associated with it.  But what is the use of letting children out of our schools&mdash;and many of us were let out of school in this way &mdash;having been mangled with Horace and Virgil and things like that at the expense of time which should have been devoted to simple and accurate expression and what I might call the techniques of the language to enable us afterwards to expand on it as we wanted to, having been put on a sure footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again my complaint about the curriculum would be precisely as in the other case, that it is too ambitious having regard to what the child has to do otherwise.  You can only cover the course at the expense of time which would have been more profitably <Col N="1421" /> devoted to basic techniques.  That results in two things, first an incomplete knowledge, which could be a paralysing thing for many types of child, particularly the more intelligent type of child; you leave the child actually without the basis which he should have when he is starting off. Secondly there is the psychological factor that it appears then to the child to be much more difficult than it is and he develops a distaste for it. Surely if we do that in any subject we are defeating our whole aim in education.</P>
    <P>It is the same in regard to modern languages.  Again it is easy to ask the question: What is he doing them for? He is not doing the leaving certificate examination in order that he will know German, French or Spanish.  He will not know any of these languages well if he wishes to study properly the other subjects on the course.  Therefore, you ask: What is required in respect of that child?  You want him to know certain things about languages which will enable him perhaps to read simple matter in them, but more particularly you want him to be able to use that knowledge in a direction that will be useful or attractive to him afterwards. Supposing he specialises in science and he wants to read the literature of that subject or the current papers in a magazine or journal printed in that language.  If that boy gets a good basic knowledge of the language it will be useful to him afterwards.  The German he will know, for instance, will be the technical German that he will be able to read.</P>
    <P>He will not be able to claim a command of German but he does know enough German to do two things, first to use it the way he wants to and, secondly, if he is interested he has a good basic knowledge from which to learn the language.</P>
    <P>That is one type of child.  The other type, perhaps the more general type, will be the student who just wants to know it.  Give him a good basis and if he is interested afterwards he will go to Germany and he will learn the language there.  Lastly there may be the person who is as rare as the first <Col N="1422" /> type or more rare, the one who specialises in it as an academic subject, and so on.  You have given him a good basis, perhaps the best basis, on which to build.  These are the principles I should like to stress in these courses. We want to fit the child for his after-specialisation but we also want to give him the sound techniques and the character training that come from concentration in detail on the job, prosecution of the job and answering in detail to completion on a particular line.  That character training is necessary.</P>
    <P>In all this I may be accused of having concentrated on somebody who will be going further and of not considering the general education point of view.  From the general education point of view the answer I would give would be very simple.  You cannot, under the conditions I mentioned earlier, hope to give that detailed knowledge in everything to the child at that period of his life and in the time available.  It is no harm to remember that even 50 years ago and before that&mdash;and that is a fairly short time in its own way&mdash;&mdash;you had the classical and mathematical subjects. You had Latin, Greek and mathematics, and science was a much more restricted subject than it is to-day.  A great deal of time was spent on these and they were done with great thoroughness.  But all that was done without the problems of the present day and to a large extent ignoring the other types of subjects which are being attempted to-day.</P>
    <P>The fact is, therefore, that as well as being faced with the necessity for getting down to sufficient detail, to mould character and to give a good basis for jumping off into future specialised courses, you have the contradictory requirements that there is a much broader area of general knowledge to be included for the education of the child for this modern world of ours.  Even in the broader area of general knowledge, again one restricts oneself to basic techniques. I have here some examination papers and they may perhaps serve to illustrate the type of thing to which I have been referring.  Possibly it is a tradition, <Col N="1423" /> but one always finds Greek and Latin at the beginning of the books of examination papers.  I presume that is traditional respectability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those with a sense of humour can perhaps see some humour in it; but the unfortunate who has to cope with it at the examination table sees very little humour in it.  I would like to examine the Parliamentary Secretary in this paper.  I wonder what show any of us would make without a little bit of notice. This is the 1954 Latin paper.  There is a chunk of Horace with a little note: &ldquo;It was by farming stock that one gloried for Rome.&rdquo;  I do not know whether or not that was designed to increase our interest in agriculture.  I rather suspect it was not.</P>

      <P>I would invite those who sat for the Latin paper in 1953, 1954 and 1955 to ask themselves now what particular advantage it has been to them to have plumbed the depths of Horace, Livy and so forth? I am not criticising these great writers, but I am criticising the detail and standard of knowledge of their works which are required by the student.  Suppose the papers were set with the aim and object of finding out if the child can understand and translate simple Latin and express himself simply in that language, what an improvement that would be.  Suppose the child was helped to understand the Liturgy, would not that, in the case of the Catholic child at any rate, give him an immediate and direct interest in the Liturgy?  I know classical Latin is sacrosanct.  From the point of view of usefulness, even for the lawyer, later Latin is every bit as important.  It is certainly more interesting and in many ways easier. Why not cut down the prescriptions in the case of Latin and approach it in the manner I have indicated.  Concentration on the Liturgy would be <Col N="1424" /> very useful; it would give the child a real and immediate interest.  It would do a lot of other things, too, on which I need not expand here.  If that is done we will probably find people with a more detailed and useful knowledge of Latin.</P>
      <P>Under the present system of examination, one finds that the students are not as well grounded as were their predecessors under the old intermediate system.  If the change I have suggested is adopted the student will have a more sympathetic approach.  Latin will mean more to him.  It will mean a great deal to the Catholic child.  Pouring in chunks of the stuff I have here in my hand is not the way to make a child learn Latin.  It is not the way in which to interest him in Latin.  Why not teach the child some of the very simple and very beautiful poetry of the Liturgy? That would be a distinct improvement on the 1953 Latin paper; here is Horace with a note: &ldquo;Death is your destiny whether your life be sad or merry.&rdquo;  This may be exquisite classical Latin, but I venture to say that the higher spiritual values will be found along the line I have indicated. As a sufferer in the machine; I do not dare to quote this paper in case my quantities may be found wanting.</P>
      <P>So much for Latin.  If the idea is to make the child a Latin scholar, I would not have the temerity to criticise that paper.  But I do criticise it on the basis that it is too ambitious and the corollary of that too great ambition is that on the average no useful purpose is achieved.  Indeed, there is too often an adverse effect. How many of us who were tortured with Horace, with Livy, with Virgil and all the rest of them, ever used that Latin later?  How many of us have been able to use the knowledge we have acquired in later life?  It is only later in life that we find how hopelessly inadequate our education was because nobody had ever grounded us in nouns and verbs and so forth.</P>

      <P>The point is we could have had a much more facile training.  I will deal now with mathematics. Here we have a very clear case of what I have been talking about.  The difficulty in relation to the mathematical programme is that it is regarded from the point of view of the specialist, from the point of view of the person who is interested only in that subject.  The papers take one complexion.  The leaving certificate mathematical paper is much too ambitious.  Right through the whole course the basic techniques suffer.  In other words, if you take a child at the very beginning, in the elementary stage, and, having rushed him through addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, and maybe, the first couple of propositions in Euclid, and then rush him off and try to get him involved in trigonometry before he has grasped the others, you have left him with uncertainty about basic operations and he lacks facility and speed, which makes him suspicious of himself, undermines his self-confidence.  If you continue that process right through, he has an uncertain general knowledge; he is a bit afraid of himself and he is constantly handicapped from want of prosecution in detail.  That can only be the way if the course is as detailed and if what is required is as advanced &mdash;if you like the word&mdash;as you have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to interject this remark in regard to English.  There is one paper in the English papers, the first paper, which is more or less on the line that is required.  It seems to be a fairly down to earth, practical paper.  The second one, however, is the one of which I complained.  The same type of thing happens in regard to mathematics to some extent.  I think it would be much more useful, say, even for the leaving certificate, if you had some tests of arithmetical manipulation.  I do not complain about the algebra but <Col N="1426" /> I do complain about inserting what I would call unnecessary conundrums in the trigonometrical line and I doubt the wisdom at that particular stage of pursuing the calculus, certainly the integral calculus.</P>
    <P>In 1953 we had a paper in mathematics. Certainly no one can complain about such questions as the first question on that&mdash;the algebraic questions &mdash;it is headed &ldquo;Algebra&rdquo;&mdash;but it does seem to me that when you are asked to evaluate the integrals which are given in Question 8 you have gone over the line.  It is not that they are terribly difficult; it is not that, if mathematics were the sole consideration, you would not put them in there and that the child would not know them, but because you can only cover things like that at the expense of something else either in that subject or in another subject.  Consequently, I want to ask, in all seriousness, of what possible use to the general student afterwards is that?  If he is going to specialise in mathematics and in science he will rapidly get the knowledge of the area that will be covered by questions of that sort.  There is one of them on every paper.  If he is not, he will not miss it.  I am not going to read out the questions because they might cause a printing problem, but there are four integrals here to be evaluated in the 1953 paper.  They presuppose the covering of a certain field.  That means time. But also I would far prefer to see that the basic principles in relation, say, to a curve, were covered and I fear that only too often is there a rush to cover that type of question at the expense of the basic principles and fundamentals that are intended to be done.</P>
    <P>You will find the same type of question on the other courses.  Next, coming to the geometry paper, I think I could make my complaint more specific. What do we require in geometry?  The ordinary man probably will get by if he knows Pythagoras' theorem but, even if you are going to specialise, again, you want the fundamentals, again, you want facility in manipulations. You can only get that by giving time and, if you broaden the course unnecessarily, you will not have the <Col N="1427" /> time for the basic things and they will suffer.  My complaint about this is, again, that it seems to be too ambitious in some of these regards.  Triangle solution, it seems to me, may be shoved to a fetish.</P>
    <P>Question 8 on that paper is typical. I think one gets lost in that type of thing at the expense of some other things which might be more useful. Again, Question 8 on that paper is the type of thing that I think could be contracted.</P>
    <P>I would probably be delaying the House if I were to indicate all the papers.  On the other hand, for the record, I would like just to draw attention to that particular type of question which will be found in nearly every examination paper.  In fact, they are always more or less of a pattern.  There is a question of a particular type put down in these subjects.</P>
    <P>In general terms then, would I be unreasonable if I made the plea to restrict the course, demand a high standard of answering, a complete standard of answering within the restricted course; make it as difficult as you like, within reason, but cut down the actual course and, in regard to questions like Question 8, say, on the geometry paper, which seems to me to be more or less the pattern every year, limit the scope there and particularly Question 8 on the other paper which again seems to be too wide.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should not go into this detail in the House.  I take the actual syllabuses as outlined which, I understand, are merely as an indication of an idea of approach, not as positive recommendations. For instance, taking geometry for the leaving certificate, one finds: Ceva's theorem, Menelaus' theorem, fundamental theorem relating to harmonic ranges and pencil, coaxial circles, poles and polars, mean centre (centroid), inversion.  Mean centre, you may leave all right, but I think the other is a relic of another time.  I had better not go into that.  Then there are elementary analytical geometry of straight line, circle and parabola, referred to rectangular axes; solution of triangles; solution of trigonometrical equations.  These are all, I think, for <Col N="1428" /> this purpose, rather over the ordinary. The point in relation to the calculus is, simply, can you do it?  Certainly, I think, judging by the questions, the target is too wide, that one could limit it.</P>
    <P>Take any one of these courses then. If there was nothing else to be done, I suppose they could be justified; one could not over-complain about them. I want to stress the fact that the child who has to do all these subjects together has not even the advantage of the university student of working in one specialised group.  When you add up all that you have a problem which is not adequately catered for to-day.</P>
    <P>I know that all these papers are set by specialists.  I should like to ask the Minister another question in relation to that.  It is certainly true to say that the leaving certificate in certain subjects at any rate duplicates very much, say, the earlier university courses in these subjects, particularly in science.  I have one question which I said is of honours degree standard and I am prepared to meet any challenge in that regard.  Many of the questions are of that standard.  They are nearly all at least of first year honours standard.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose?  What children are going to do that?  If they are going to specialise they are going to do these subjects over again. Does not that only reinforce my argument in favour of the plea I am making that it would be better on the ground level to prepare the basic techniques for that?  I knew one university professor in physics who always maintained that he preferred to have the student who got a good general education and a good grounding in mathematics than the person who had done science before in school. I would not go so far as that.  I think that the basic amount of science done should be related to the point where the child is going to start rather than to the point where he is going to finish.  There is a suggestion in these papers that they certainly cover the first year course.  If the children were merely specialising in these things the bottom would be knocked out of much of what I have to say, but since he has to do them all and do the job effectively, what I am saying has, I think, all the more weight.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> Again, there are some subjects here which will be wanted as a basis for nearly everything the child does in life afterwards.  The major probability there is that he will not pursue them as subjects ever again.  That goes particularly for Irish, English and mathematics. I put Latin in that category as an extremely useful subject.  Therefore, in these subjects there is justification for concentrating more on them.  There is justification for giving more attention to them but I think that is all the more reason why the basic part of these subjects should be done very thoroughly indeed.</P>
    <P>It is all summed up in this.  The problem is not so much the subject itself.  All of these courses and curricula are very excellent no doubt from the point of view not merely of the person who is controlling that course and setting the paper and carrying out the examination, but what has to be balanced is the correct requirements for the child.  It is, of course, the natural inclination of the specialist perhaps to involve the child in overmuch specialisation in the subject. That is a most natural tendency.  It takes a very strong mind really on the part of the educationist to say where one is going to stop, the field is so attractive in any subject.  The manner in which I make these criticisms to-day takes into account that fact.</P>
    <P>But in all sobriety and seriousness I would strongly recommend that in the secondary programme the courses should be even still further restricted. Prescribed, yes, detail attended to and perhaps not only would we not hear the complaints that one hears about the education of children but perhaps do something else as well.</P>
    <P>I have taken the secondary school programme as typical and I took the leaving certificate as an example.  The same general approach&mdash;I should like to emphasise the word &ldquo;general&rdquo;&mdash;may be necessary in other Departments. Certainly in regard to primary schools the teachers would be helped if that outlook permeated in that direction. I sometimes think that perhaps we do not pay enough attention to the actual individual teacher's point of view on these things and the parents' <Col N="1430" /> point of view on them.  That may be real commonplace but remember we are dealing with a very commonplace problem, a problem for the whole community. It is an everyday problem. Their views on these subjects can be very enlightening and their approach can in the last analysis be often much more practical than the theoretical educationists or the specialists either in education or in any particular line. I would ask the Minister to give the points I have tried to make here some consideration.  There are a number of other examination papers which I have marked here but I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to pursue them all in detail.  I think I have indicated generally what is necessary.</P>
    <P>To turn away from that matter I want to refer to another part of the Minister's speech upon which I should like to comment.  It deals with vocational education.  I take it that it is in order.  The Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I expect to be pressed very hard during the year to approve of many schemes for which the necessary capital is not available.  I hope that committees who may be faced with difficulties arising out of the delay in giving such sanctions will appreciate the position and will be able to maintain a constructive patience born of a secure hope and purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Am I to take that as meaning that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What does it mean?  That is the point.  Does it mean there is to be a cessation of activity?  That sentence just struck me.  In his introductory remarks the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A further point of interest in this regard is that the Department of Agriculture, the vocational committees and my Department are at present in consultation on the best method of utilising the services of some of these teachers under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there some particular scheme envisaged in relation to the two?  Are education and agriculture to be combined, and how far are the two activities <Col N="1431" /> to be merged?  I think the answer to these questions would be of considerable interest to a number of people.  I hope that when replying the Minister will give us some idea on them.</P>
    <P>When replying, I hope the Minister will also say where these curricula could perhaps be re-examined.  This is a most important aspect of the community's activities which comes up once a year.  It is only once a year that the Minister for Education has an opportunity of coming in here and discussing this subject with the members. I do not believe in committees and commissions unduly; I am afraid they are all too often an escape mechanism. I think, however, that before the next Estimate is presented, the Minister should take an opportunity of looking into these syllabuses of courses.  When all is said and done, Riallacha agus Clár i leith na Meán Scoileanna is a continuing document amounting to the same thing from year to year.</P>
    <P>I think it would not be a bad idea at the moment if the Department stopped to have a complete look into the whole matter.  I am not suggesting any revolutionary changes would come out of such an examination.  However, I think these syllabuses could be recast into something in a stronger form, more restricted if you like, and that the examination papers could be issued on that line.  I think a good day's work could be done there.  I do not think my approach to this Estimate has been a utilitarian one; it is not aimed at depriving people of knowledge or of liberal education.  In fact it is a sure key to a more liberal education.  All of us must specialise, and if we had a sound basic training in the early stages of our education we would be all the more ready and able to improve our minds, if you like to put it that way, when we branch out later, either for our pleasure or for our livelihoods, into whatever field attracts us.  If we have not got that basic training, no matter how much we would like to do these things, we shall not be able to get over the initial barriers which will be much too high for us.</P>
    <P>That is why I strongly press for the teaching of elementary portions of <Col N="1432" /> such subjects as Latin or modern languages.  At least with these we shall be able to go forward.  These are the pleas I would make to the Minister on this Vote and I hope we will be able to see some progress in these matters before this time next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one last word in protection of myself.  I had not intended to do more than to indicate the line of approach to a problem that is there.  I think it is a good way of approaching it.  Let me not be accused of a definite commitment in detail, because, in the very nature of the problem it would be a very rash thing, in one short period here in the House, to pontificate on any one aspect of the problem.  However, I repeat that the matter calls for examination.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that whatever is wrong with our educational system&mdash;and there are many things which call for remedial action&mdash;it has not been caused by the teaching of Irish.  The fault lies in another direction, and that is what I am inviting the Minister to consider.  There is a lot to be done about our educational system.  There is a fault in the basic character of our system, but whatever fault that is it has not been caused by the teaching of Irish; in fact, the teaching of Irish can be co-ordinated into an improvement of the present system.  That is one of the things I should like to emphasise for the benefit of the Minister.</P>

      <P>A great deal of the debate on this Estimate has centred around the teaching of Irish.  There were divers opinions expressed on this question. Authorities were quoted here to prove the futility of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish.  I think that matter could best be left to the schools and colleges which have tried out this experiment with success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are schools and colleges where the whole programme has been taught through the medium of Irish and the pupils of these institutions have more than held their own. This has been regarded as a physical impossibility but it has been done, and I know it is capable of being done.  It is a tribute to these schools that they have been able to secure that.  Much of the time devoted to teaching Irish in the primary schools is devoted towards trying to impart a colloquial knowledge of the language.  I know of schools&mdash;I had them myself &mdash;where boys qualify for the Fáinne and then they leave the national school and when they go on to the secondary school they are faced with such an exhaustive literary programme that the possibility of having time for the spoken language is entirely precluded.  There the whole programme falls down.</P>
      <P>If we are to preserve the language, we shall have to be satisfied with a lower literary standard in our intermediate schools and to provide time in these schools for attention to the spoken language that has been imparted to the children in their more junior years.  That is my humble experience over a long number of years.  I have finished with schools now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards education generally in the schools, it is becoming more and more difficult for teachers to maintain proper discipline in their schools.  We know that and we must face up to this fact of the present day.  There is a loosening of parental control.  The <Col N="1434" /> teachers could deal with minor misdeeds but they have no authority and no power.  The parents have failed to correct their children and the law forbids the teacher to do it.  I think there should be some unified approach to this problem by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  Certainly, every Deputy who picks up an evening paper here in Dublin is appalled by the lengthy litany of petty larcenies committed by boys from eight to ten years of age. This problem is becoming very serious and unless the teachers are provided with the means of dealing with some of these things in the course of their duties these children will eventually grow out of control when they come on to the mature years.</P>
    <P>The question of school buildings has been mentioned here.  We are all anxious to see proper, hygienic, bright school buildings in the country but I would say that&mdash;and it is the conviction of many teachers, many managers and many public men&mdash;some schools which were perfectly capable of being renovated or reconstructed have been replaced by new buildings.  With our limited resources we should be careful not to go too far in that respect.  It is better to provide schools of a mediocre type all over the country than to have a few very attractive in design while others can still be classified as hovels.  Our architects should be more practical in their designs considering our limited resources.  If we have a bright comfortable building capable of being heated, well lighted, it will satisfy us very well for the time being.  We cannot expect to do in a few years what would ordinarily take a generation to do.  We started with a great handicap when we obtained our freedom 35 years ago but we cannot be expected to do all that is required in a few years.</P>
    <P>Candidly I believe we have moved too fast in many respects and we have lost sight of fundamentals.  Character training is more important perhaps than education sometimes and provision should be made in the schools for the teaching of civics.  Our young people to-day seem to be utterly regardless of their neighbours' property. <Col N="1435" /> They seem to have no conception of their obligations to their elders or even to their own contemporaries. Children should be impressed with the necessity of being more considerate where others are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I would like to speak although it might be a contentious matter.  It has been spoken of by other Deputies.  I should like to follow on their lines and ask the Minister once more to do something for that body of people who gave loyal service as teachers in this country and who retired before 1950.  I know it is a delicate matter and I appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  We are all aware of the difficulty of providing revenue and of the scarcity of capital for many purposes, but when one thinks that these people started on their teaching careers when a foreign Administration existed here, it must be annoying for them to find that their confreres in the Six Counties have got a greater measure of justice than they have been able to secure in their native land.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to mention has connection with the primary certificate examination about which Deputy Tully spoke yesterday.  He said he was surprised at the few pupils presented for this certificate.  We are all aware of that.  Every child in sixth standard who has put in 100 attendances must be presented for the primary certificate examination.  That regulation is a bit unrealistic.  If a child has 99 attendances, there is no compulsion on the teacher to present him.  If the child has 101 attendances he must be presented.  There are many schools, especially where children are a little below average standard of ability, and it is impossible for a child to cover the primary course with 101 attendances during the year.  Some latitude and some discretion should be allowed to teachers in this matter because they are the people who know the capacity of the children.  No teacher is going to hold back a child or prevent him from getting an opportunity of qualifying for the primary certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>, I know that has been the cause of irritation to teachers; it is the reason why they have not thrown themselves wholeheartedly behind the primary certificate examination.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and ease the position in that respect. I do not know how Deputy Tully got the opinion that children of ten, 11, 12, 13 and 14 and over have been presented for the primary certificate examination. Neither do I know whether the statistics that guided the Deputy to form that opinion have taken cognisance of these facts I have mentioned. I believe that the average age at which children do the primary certificate is around 12 years.</P>
      <P>In connection with this regulation it may also be mentioned that no teacher likes to keep back or retain a child in a class for the second year because it has an impact on the sensitiveness of a child who feels humiliated when he cannot follow his companions of the previous year.  For that reason, teachers are always prone to give a child the benefit of the doubt even against the child's best interests. They allow the child to go on and sometimes a child will reach sixth standard without having adequately covered the programme in the lower standards.  That is done in order to save the child the humiliation of being retained a second year in the same class.  For that reason also, I suggest the Department should consider this question of compulsion in regard to the primary certificate examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to relieve the House by saying that I intend to be as brief as possible in anything I have to say.  Principally what I want to say is in relation to the retired teachers who have a grievance regarding their allowances, those who retired prior to 1950.  Many of those Deputies who have spoken have stressed their case and the details and the facts of the case are well known to the Minister, so that it will suffice for me to say that I want to add my voice to those of Deputies who made an appeal on their behalf to have the teachers' case reconsidered sympathetically.  It is only necessary to stress the change in the cost of living to justify the soundness of their case.  Perhaps the Minister met them to some extent but I think the case should not be regarded as being closed.</P>
      <P>They can substantiate the case that there is real hardship in many instances and that they are unable to exist on the miserable pittance which has been allowed to them.  In many cases teachers who gave 40 years' service in the cause of primary education are living on £3 10s. a week.  That is not just, and morally they are entitled to something better.  The changing circumstances even since the Minister's predecessor made some amelioration in their position, would in itself justify the case being reconsidered and something worth while being granted to them.  Like many other sections of the community they are becoming fewer day by day and the imposition on the Exchequer by any increase given would not be very considerable.  I believe&mdash; and I am voicing a purely personal opinion&mdash;that any steps in the direction of improving the position of these people would get the unanimous support of the House and I would urge on the Minister the reconsideration of their claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest taken by so many Deputies in this Estimate is in itself indicative of the fact that Deputies generally are aware that any progress being made or likely to be made in the future must be primarily related to our educational system.  It is the fount from which all progress must necessarily spring.  I do not intend to <Col N="1438" /> go into the academic details like Deputy de Valera or to stress points in relation to the setting of papers for the various examinations, but speaking on the broad principles of primary education, I would say that one is sometimes led to believe that too much is expected from primary education. Few people realise that primary education is only a fundamental from which the child may equip himself for the future.  As Deputy de Valera said in his long educational lecture here a short time ago, it is intended to turn a child out basically fitted for future life.  At its best that is all that one should expect from primary schools. When people expect that all the subjects involved should be thoroughly taught and want to add to a curriculum which is already overcrowded in primary schools, they are placing an impossible burden on them and aiming at the impossible.  If children are made to realise that primary education is merely a springboard for future development in their mental outlook, in the moulding of their characters and in their further pursuit of general knowledge and education in whatever sphere they may have a particular aptitude, then they will develop a greater love for primary education as such and we will thereby make much greater progress.</P>
    <P>In regard to the points about which Deputy de Valera complained, the complexities of the various papers set for examinations, I think the desire is to make them more and more complex and more and more competitive with a view to eliminating as far as possible many of the people who are seeking admission to the professions. We have very few openings in this country for people in the professions and a desire to make these papers competitive for the purpose of eliminating and controlling admission to the professions has created too high a competitive spirit and that does not ultimately tend towards the greatest good.</P>
    <P>Some people who are sceptical come along and ask: &ldquo;Why do we bother spending money on education for any child since its only outlook is to emigrate?&rdquo;  That applies to counties on the western seaboard very much <Col N="1439" /> but my answer is that no matter what the child's future is to be, whether he spends the rest of his life in England, America or any other country of his adoption we should send him out as well fitted as possible so that he will be a credit to the country, less of a burden to himself and will in future life find any training he has got in his youth of the greatest possible benefit. I do not think our problem of emigration should in any way make us reluctant to seek as far as possible the best education we are able to provide for our children.  I mean that we should place at the disposal of the greatest number of children the chance of furthering their education beyond the primary school.  There is only one way that that can be done and that is a point on which I want to lay particular stress in the few words I wish to say here.  I refer to the vocational educational system.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of children in this country can never have the pleasure of reaping the benefits of secondary education, nor furthering the education they have received in the primary schools if they are not given a chance of furthering their education in the technical schools.  Therefore we are convinced on the western seaboard that any money devoted to the furthering of vocational education is well spent and is basically the answer at least in many cases to all the problems which exist in those areas. I think that in 1956 it is a sad commentary on our educational system that we are not able to say that vocational education is at the disposal of any child who wishes to avail himself of it.  We still have many areas in the heart of the Gaeltacht where such facilities do not yet exist and we in Donegal have been repeatedly appealing to the Department and to the Minister for more generous contributions from the Central Fund for the expansion of the vocational educational system in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot compliment the Minister on having given us anything special in that direction.  We shall keep on trying and endeavour year by year to get all the support we can from the Central Fund until such time as we have provided minimum facilities at least, which would be a <Col N="1440" /> school within the reach of all the children who wish to avail themselves of it.  If we take the history of vocational education in the country as a whole, we discover that other counties have been much more generously treated than we have.  We are told, of course, that we have not availed fully of the facilities at our disposal; in other words we have not taken up the full rate available to us.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to bear in mind that in a poor county like Donegal, where the rate is already 42/- in the £, it is not easy to go as far as we would like, in order to finance an expanding vocational programme and it is only natural, therefore, that the people would look to the Exchequer for greater support.  I do not want to labour the subject further than to say that we shall not be content until we have got what we believe is ours of right, namely, a more generous contribution from the Central Fund to enable us to carry on a more extensive programme than we can undertake at present and to provide us with at least the minimum facility of a school within the reach of every child who would like to avail of that facility.  If these children do not get the opportunity of developing whatever aptitude they may have, then they must simply be cut out; and when they go abroad, as many of them must, since they are not as well equipped as they might be, they do not do this country the credit they might do, had they been given the chance in life to which they are entitled.  For that reason, I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to consider the extra special case we have presented and can substantiate through the Donegal Committee and give us more generous support.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the primary certificate.  I want to voice one grievance which exists in Ulster, at least in those counties under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  There is dissatisfaction with the setting of the Irish papers in this year's primary certificate in so far as the Ulster dialect was not used.  That proved a handicap to many children.  The same is true in other instances where the examiner in oral Irish is not an Ulster man and does <Col N="1441" /> not speak the Ulster dialect.  We have cases on record where children competing in the preparatory examination failed in oral Irish simply because they did not understand the examiner.  They were children who had been receiving the deontas all during their time in the primary school.  They were native speakers but they failed to reach the required standard in the oral examination simply because the examiner did not speak the Ulster dialect.  When children grow older they can more easily distinguish between the different dialects but at 14 and 15 years of age they have not become accustomed to nuances or attuned themselves to anything other than the Ulster dialect and it is criminal to have them orally examined by an inspector who does not speak their dialect.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that that does not happen in future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the deontas.  Deputies from Donegal will bear me out when I say that we have frequent complaints from parents because their children are not given the award in a particular year.  I understand the reason invariably given in these cases is that the inspector is not satisfied that Irish is entirely the spoken language of the home.  I suspect that what happens is that, in order to encourage the use of the language in the homes, the inspector now and again picks out a few, from a particular school, and deprives them of the deontas.  For the purpose of giving a warning he does seem to select a few children from each school and deprives them of the award in a particular year.</P>
    <P>While that may be designed for the purpose of giving the necessary impetus to the speaking of the language in the homes, it very often has the opposite effect.  It very often sours the people and I have known it to happen in cases where children in the house did not actually understand English when it was spoken to them.  I think the greatest possible caution should be exercised in the elimination from the award of certain families unless the inspector is perfectly satisfied that he is doing the right thing.  I am not saying that he is always wrong but I sometimes feel that he thinks certain <Col N="1442" /> of the children are more familiar with English.  In that case he gives a warning by witholding the award for a particular year.  The children are then examined in the following year to see if the position has improved and receive the deontas.  Sometimes one finds justification for the suspicion that the non-award was due to the desire to cut down on the amount of money being awarded.</P>

Now, while this may be done in the interests of creating in the minds of the people a feeling that they must definitely keep Irish as the spoken language in the home, I believe that the inspector sometimes withholds the award; that victimisation can very often have a certain effect, a certain bad effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the inspector has a very difficult job to do and that he does it effectively and <Col N="1444" /> conscientiously.  If there is any complaint and the Deputy feels that complaint is not investigated fully enough or factually enough, I will see that it is investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My complaint is that the inspector does his work too conscientiously.  I am not suggesting that he is slipshod.  I believe that he is too conscientious.  His desire to ensure that necessary warning is given sometimes has the opposite effect to what was intended.  I would ask the Minister to approach the matter from that point of view and to investigate the cases which I will give him in the course of the next week.</P>
      <P>The other matter with which I want to deal briefly is the building of schools.  We should all like to see schools built more quickly and a heavier programme of rebuilding undertaken but that means capital.  If anything could be done to accelerate the school building programme from the present slow-moving rate, it would be one of the most useful things that could be done in the whole field of education. From the day on which the initial move is made to have a school built or rebuilt until the day the key is turned in the door there is usually a lapse of three years.  That is wrong. We are told that the delay is due mainly to lack of staff in the Board of Works, that it is a matter which could be more appropriately discussed on the Estimate for that office, but it is sufficiently related to this Estimate to merit consideration and notice by the Minister who is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk about unemployment and the need for a more vigorous capital development programme. Yet, there is a crying need for some few thousand schools which could be undertaken to-morrow if the necessary finance could be raised for that work.  In the whole matter of nation building there could not be a more essential or a more laudable object than a big scheme of school building which would envisage, say, the building of ten schools for the one that is undertaken at the moment.  The Minister's predecessor at one time doubled the programme of school building, aimed <Col N="1445" /> at building two schools for the one that was previously undertaken.  The number of schools yet to be rebuilt, according to the figures the Minister gave last year, goes into thousands, and that is a state of affairs which should be remedied with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The building of schools, their future maintenance, upkeep and repair, is a most important matter.  I think the Minister will agree with me that, when a school is built, a certain amount of land should be acquired on the site, which would provide a playing pitch or facilities for games.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate has hinged on the question of compulsion.  Deputies have referred to compulsory education. That is a mistake because the word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; has not a good sound, particularly for children.  We should aim at inculcating in the minds of the children a love of education and of school life, rather than compelling them to go to school, rather than that they should be beaten out in the mornings, as has often been the case and is still the case, I am sure, in many homes.  We should try to create a desire to go to school rather than to remain at home.  The ominous word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; should not enter into it.  The provision of amenities in the primary schools, such as there are in secondary schools, for the playing of games, should be aimed at.  When a school is being built or when an old school is being rebuilt, if there is land available on the site it should be acquired.  That land might not be developed immediately but could be developed at some time and the enthusiastic teacher, who is always anxious to co-operate and to make the most of the school time, would find means whereby the little pitch would be developed to provide an outlet for the children and to brighten their school life. Extra money might be involved but it would be justified.</P>
    <P>The question of the language has been dealt with by every Deputy who has taken part in the debate.  I only want to say that the question of compulsion should not enter into this debate or be considered in relation to the language in any respect.  It is a <Col N="1446" /> word that does not sound well.  It always creates opposition.  If we could recapture the spirit which existed in the years from 1920 to 1923, there would be no need to talk about compulsion in regard to the language. Most Deputies remember the time of the Truce when voluntary language classes were established throughout the country and the young and old flocked into them in hundreds.  There was no question of compelling them to go at that time.</P>
    <P>Many people who have a good basic knowledge of the language to-day acquired it then.  The proper spirit existed.  The people regarded it as a national duty to learn the language. They regarded a knowledge of the Irish language as a weapon in their hands.  They were determined to acquire that knowledge, irrespective of how it might upset their ordinary life.  If we could recapture that spirit, there would be very little need to talk about this as a problem.  The word &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; would not enter into it nor would the question of any doubt as to the future of the language arise. It might not be so easy to recapture that spirit but if an effort were made to inculcate that spirit we certainly would be getting places. &ldquo;Compulsion&rdquo; is an ominous word, particularly where children are concerned.  Children should be made to realise that the learning of the language is something in which they should take a particular interest.  They should be made to realise that it is not just merely something which they have to swot while at school and forget about it thereafter. I agree with those who said that the people who were most amiss in this respect were the professional people, those who get a thorough knowledge of the language and, when they pass on to do their university courses and graduate, they are inclined to forget they were ever taught the language during the course of their earlier education.  Sometimes a better example could be given in that respect.</P>
    <P>Primary education should be designed for the purpose of basically fitting the child to equip himself for future life.  For many people it will be the only opportunity of education <Col N="1447" /> they will ever get but, if they avail themselves properly of it, there is no reason why they should not be fitted to learn everything afterwards in the field of education.</P>
    <P>We naturally expect an agricultural bias in rural schools and I think it is only right to say that most teachers are already aware of that fact and do what they can in that respect.  As well as having an agricultural bias, the system should permit of giving the children a love of their own country. That is just as essential as giving them an education with an agricultural bias. We all remember the opening stanza of a poem in the fourth book years ago, after the first effort was made to recapture the proper spirit.  The opening lines are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Land of my birth we pledge to these Our love and toil in the years to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are various other poems designed for that purpose.  We had such poems as the one from which I quote the following extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Breathes there a man with soul so dead</P>
    <P>Who never to himself hath said:</P>
    <P>This is my own, my native land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We find that Goldsmith and others gave us example of love of country.  It is in the primary schools that we should concentrate upon having that spirit inculcated into the minds of the children.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Major de Valera said, primary education should be to fit the child basically for future life so that, if he wishes, he can expand his education as far as it is humanly possible. There are many in this House, even on the Front Benches of the Government, who had merely the advantage of a primary education&mdash;and all credit to them.  They were self-made men who educated and fitted themselves afterwards for life on the good, sound, foundations which they got in the primary schools.  If our primary schools continue to perform that work we shall have no worry about the future generation and even though they may still have to emigrate they will go out better fitted for life and play their <Col N="1448" /> part as men and women of the Irish race.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that first strikes one, reading the Minister's introductory speech, is that it appears more money will be spent in the coming year than in the previous year. While we might have no grouse in that direction in this instance as in many other instances in regard to the various Estimates which came before the House, we find a greater amount of money being spent and the public getting very little extra return for that extra money taken out of the taxpayers' pockets.  That is as true of this Estimate as of the Estimates we have already discussed.  That brings me immediately to the matter which I particularly want to talk about on this Estimate, which is the financing of vocational education.</P>
      <P>Whereas at the start of the Minister's speech, we find a greater amount of money being spent in the Department for the coming year, we find also in regard to the vocational educational branch of the Department a clamping down and slowing up of the building programme and the extension of that very necessary and useful system of vocational schools.  When I talk of schools, I am thinking primarily of the schools and the need for schools in my own county.  We in the Donegal Vocational Education Committee have reason to be very dissatisfied with the trend which we find is uppermost in the mind of the present Department and the Minister for Education whereby we are being refused sanction to build schools at the moment, schools which we were given to understand, even in the previous term of the Coalition Government when the present Minister was Minister for Education, would be built and which are now regarded as not being sufficiently important or urgent to receive priority in regard to the moneys to build them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that is one of the points upon which we have a grouse with the Minister, we also have recently a further grouse.  Not only have we not been getting the money or will not get it in the immediate future for the building <Col N="1449" /> of schools in the county but recently we were refused sanction to employ further teachers to service the schools in centres already established. It was at a meeting only two days ago that I heard that sanction was refused for the employment of five further teachers in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Donegal, I think, is typical of the rural community as a whole.  All of us who know anything about the situation realise fully that if the people in rural Ireland are to get any chance outside of the primary schools, then the vocational school programme and system is the only thing that holds out any bright prospects for them.  Instead of getting every encouragement, we are not getting that encouragement nor have have we been getting a fair do in rural Ireland, so far as this matter is concerned over the years.</P>
    <P>In Dublin you have secondary schools and many of the universities, all of which are subsidised in one way or another out of the taxpayers' money. Despite all these facilities for secondary and higher education you also find that, in relation to vocational education, they are getting what the people in rural Ireland, who have no secondary schools or universities, are being refused.  I refer to the situation wherein for every £1 of the ratepayers' money put up in Dublin, £4 of the taxpayers' money is added to it in order to give a vocational service.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the big centres which have got the facilities that are denied to the people of rural Ireland in regard to vocational education should get two, three or four times as much money from the taxpayers as we should.  That was in the process of being remedied in the last Act introduced by the predecessor of the present Minister, Deputy Moylan.  There was in that Act provision by which the matter of financing technical and vocational education throughout the country was to be remedied and levelled up, but the present Minister did not avail of that instrument to do the levelling up in any satisfactory manner.  Accordingly, we find ourselves in the position to-day in which we are asking the Minister for more <Col N="1450" /> money from the Exchequer in order to relieve the rates.  No consideration, apparently, has been given to this vital matter of the ratio of State advances as against advances from the rates for vocational education in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another matter was provided for in that Act introduced by Deputy Moylan. It dealt with the question of schools and services in the Gaeltacht areas.  I think the relevant section was Section 103.  In my county, and in other seaboard counties, we felt we would come under that section and get very great benefits from it in order that we would be able to give to the Gaeltacht and congested districts the services that are so much needed there in regard to vocational schools.  With all due respects to the present Minister, he has not given us anything worth talking about under that section. In fact, I wonder why the section remains in the Statute Book at all since so few benefits flow from it.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we expected to get something substantial under the provisions of Section 103 of that Act.  Actually, we got an additional £750.  That was the sum total of our benefit as a result of that section.  I am not talking in any partisan manner when I refer to that £750 because a colleague of mine in the local authority, a prominent supporter of the Minister and his Party, was the first man on his feet at the meeting proposing that we should send the money back.  That showed how little we thought of that additional sum.</P>
    <P>We have not got a fair deal in the past in this matter and we are not getting it now even though there is legislation to remedy the problem.  There is no excuse whatever why the Minister and the Department should withhold what rightly belongs to the people of rural Ireland.  It is the right of those people to have within easy reach a technical school to which children, not well enough off to avail of secondary education, can go to get a grind.  We are not getting a fair do here.  We have not been getting it and apparently we are not to get it in the future.</P>
    <P>I would again point out that the big centres of population, with all the other facilities they have, are getting an unfair <Col N="1451" /> share of public money as compared with the poorer districts where we have no facilities outside the national schools.  This question affects not only the Donegal Gaeltacht but the whole western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the primary schools very briefly.  We are spending millions of pounds on health schemes, on public sanitation and water schemes throughout the country.  At the same time it is ridiculous to see our schools in rural Ireland without either water or flush lavatory services.  That is surely a queer, incongruous position. We spend millions of the taxpayers' money providing new water schemes and giving health benefits, and yet we ask our children to spend the greater part of their waking hours in national schools which are unserved by way of water or sanitation.  Perhaps the public water scheme is passing the school gates; perhaps it is not.  Whether it is or not, this is one thing that should be looked into.</P>
    <P>Another matter that should be considered is the question of cleaning the schools.  They are not all kept as they should be.  In other cases we will find that schools are not properly heated. How can we ask our children, the future generation of our citizens, to spend the greater part of their day in a school that is not properly cleaned or properly heated and which has not a running water supply or proper sanitation?</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties, but whatever they are I believe they should be overcome in this matter.  I should like to add my voice to those of other Deputies on behalf of the pre-1950 retired teachers.  The Minister's predecessor made some effort on their behalf by giving them one-third of what is apparently due to them. Before the last election, a circular was sent to candidates asking them what their attitude would be to these retired teachers.  If I am wrong in this the Minister can correct me but my recollection is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As stated by me in reply to a question on 10th April, 1956, imports of waste paper have been reduced to the minimum level consistent with existing contracts and with the maintenance of essential export connections.  There has been a progressive reduction in the quantities of waste paper imported each month during the current year: in May, 1956, imports were down to 355 tons as compared with 1,089 tons in January, 1956, and as compared with an average monthly import figure of approximately 2,000 tons in 1955.  In these circumstances the imposition of a tariff on waste paper would not serve any purpose.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of organisations exist in this country for the collection and sale of waste paper and that as a result of the recent refusal by the mills to take waste paper a number of these well-organised bodies that have been collecting waste paper for charitable or commercial purposes have now become slightly disorganised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that a number of organisations have gone into the business of collecting waste paper in the past year or two to such an extent that they were offering to the mills here quantities of waste paper in excess of the requirements of the mills and that it is paper which the mills could not use because, in the main, it is paper of one particular variety of which the mills had an excess.  The mills can only use wastepaper in proportion to their hold on the export trade and they have been finding it difficult to maintain portion of their export trade.  In fact, if export orders do not improve substantially there probably will be less outlet in the mills for the waste paper collected here.  The present position is that imports of waste paper are down to the minimum.  They are less now than at any time for the past two years, and such imports as are coming in are in fulfilment of contracts or are part of an arrangement by which the firm which imports the waste paper is finding a market to take the waste paper.  If that ceases, then exports of the finished article also cease and it does not in any way aid those who have waste paper of another kind to sell to the mills here.</P>

      <Col N="1457" /> Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme which was introduced on 1st September, 1954, aims at the clearance of the country of tuberculosis in cattle, area by area.  At the start three areas, viz:&mdash;County Sligo, County Clare and the Bansha area, were selected for intensive eradication measures on this basis and, concurrently, herd-owners in the rest of the country, collectively referred to as the general areas, were offered facilities for clearance of the disease on an individual herd basis, thus providing for a gradual build-up of tuberculosis-free herds in all districts so as to pave the way for future eradication on the area basis.</P>
    <P>The scheme has so far relied on the purely voluntary co-operation of herd-owners whose response has been widespread and highly satisfactory, particularly in the intensive areas.  Up to 30th June, 1956, over 60,500 herd-owners, or 21 per cent of the total number in the entire country, had applied under the scheme, almost 16,000 of these applicants being in the three intensive areas.  The degree of application in each area was:&mdash;Sligo, 67 per cent.; Clare, 54 per cent.; Bansha, 79 per cent.  In the general areas the highest application rate is in County Kerry where it is 39 per cent. and County Mayo is the next highest with 30 per cent.  In 12 other counties applications already range from 11 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>By the date mentioned, 47,700 herds, comprising 620,000 animals or 14 per cent. of all cattle in the country, had been given their first test and over 15,200 of these herds had also been tested for the second time.  The initial tests disclosed that slightly less than 18 per cent of all animals tested failed to pass the test.  Over 16,200 herds, or 33 per cent of those initially tested, proved to be entirely free of the disease.  In the intensive areas where the removal of reactors is mainly effected through direct purchase by the Department, the number so disposed of up to the end of June, 1956, was 5,284 at a cost of over £184,000. Almost all those in the intensive areas whose herds have been initially tested decided to participate further in the <Col N="1458" /> scheme; in the general areas the degree of participation is 90 per cent. Arising out of participation in the scheme, over 28,800 applications for grants for byre improvements have been received and are receiving priority treatment.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the House during the debate on my Department's Estimate for the current year, other countries have been able to travel further and faster than ours in the matter of dealing with bovine T.B.  As regards Great Britain, to which the Deputy specificially refers, the position is that eradication measures were first introduced in that country in 1935 when an attested herds scheme was initiated under which, however, the herd owner was obliged to test, and clear his herd of reactors entirely at his own expense before the herd would be accepted for official supervision.  Only when a high percentage of herds in an area had thus become disease-free was area eradication embarked on.  This commenced in 1950.  I understand the position at the end of March, 1956, was that some 62 per cent of all cattle in Great Britain were then in attested areas and herds.</P>
    <P>As a result of our efforts since the scheme was introduced in September, 1954, we may, I think, claim to have got off to a good start, but the eradication of the disease is going to be a slow, painstaking process and only the fullest co-operation of the individual herd owner can bring it to complete success.  The tuberculin test merely identifies the reactors in a herd.  The herd owner must make his contribution by removing them in the shortest possible space of time in keeping with the circumstances of the herd, by isolating them effectively while they remain on the premises, by disinfecting the cowhouses, by improving byre accommodation and boundary fences and, of vital importance for the future, by bringing into the herd none but tested stock.  These measures have to remain the responsibility of the individual farmer.  Strict observance of these measures also constitutes the most reliable way to ensure that, after clearance, a herd will remain disease-free.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> As regards future development, I am convinced that the most urgent aim of our endeavours should be the early creation of at least one accredited area of good size.  The high degree of progress already achieved in County Sligo merits the selection of that county for clearance as the first accredited area. Fresh legislation will be necessary to enable the necessary steps to this end to be taken and I accordingly propose to introduce a Bill in the coming session.  I announced in an address to Sligo County Committee of Agriculture on 26th March last that, subject to the passing of the legislation, the necessary measures to complete the final clearance of that county will commence in the summer of 1957.  These will, perforce, include powers to safeguard the interests of those herd-owners who by that time will have voluntarily progressed towards eradication.</P>
    <P>At the same time the surrounding zone, comprising part of Donegal, Leitrim, North Roscommon and East Mayo, will be treated as an intensive area.  It is hoped to declare County Sligo as our first accredited area in 1959 and to link up with County Clare, which by then should be in the final clearance stage, with a view to the clearance as soon as possible of the whole area west of the Shannon.  While this programme is in operation it is also intended to introduce the necessary measures in County Kerry, where voluntary participation has already reached a high level, leading up to its declaration as another accredited area.</P>
    <P>It is also intended, in the light of experience to date, to introduce some modification of the existing measures in the general areas.  It has become apparent that the removal of reactors by participating herd-owners is not proceeding in many cases at the rate necessary to ensure clearance of their herds within a reasonable period, while another matter that is not receiving adequate attention is the isolation of reactors.  Under the revised measures now being considered each participating herd-owner will in future be obliged to comply strictly with a yearly programme in accordance with standards formulated by the Department for the removal of reactors, and other <Col N="1460" /> matters connected with the clearance of disease.</P>
    <P>Should the owner default, his voluntary participation in the scheme will be terminated.  Another intended change is the introduction, at the request of the National Farmers' Association, of an accredited herd scheme to cater for owners who desire speedily to rid their herds of reactors and to take the other steps necessary to earn official accreditation status for their herds and premises.  Under this scheme the herd-owner, in order to qualify for registration at the earliest possible date, will carry out some of the testing at his own expense.  As a corollary to the grant of registration to an accredited herd it is hoped that it will be feasible to provide some special facilities in connection with the export of stock from such herds.</P>
    <P>The eradication of bovine T.B. will, as I have already informed the House, be a long-term project.  Apart from the very heavy financial expenditure involved, a major obstacle to speedy results, particularly in the breeding areas, is the difficulty of replacing the animals reacting to the test.  To meet this need, I would urge all farmers to concentrate on the production in the years ahead of a good foundation stock of Shorthorns so that the herd-owner who cannot supply all the healthy replacements he may need from within his own herd will find that suitable stock is on offer.</P>
    <P>Another vital adjunct to the eradication measures is the pasteurisation of separated milk returned to farms from creamery premises.  Despite the offer of a generous grant to creameries for the installation of plant for this purpose, there are still over 400 premises not equipped.  It is eminently desirable that the creamery societies concerned should install the necessary plants as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the availability of veterinarians, the present position is that there are approximately 600 veterinary surgeons on the register, but only some 400 of these are engaged in private practice.  There is no doubt that this number is very small in relation to the demand that arises for professional <Col N="1461" /> veterinary services.  The general shortage of veterinary surgeons has been reflected in the difficulty which has been experienced in recent years in recruiting veterinary inspectors for the Department's staff, on which there are still unfilled posts.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession is affording valuable and unstinted assistance in the operation of the scheme but such assistance is necessarily limited by the extent of the call of ordinary private practice on the veterinary surgeons. It is hoped that the greatly increased volume of professional work arising in connection with the eradication programme will continue to encourage the return of Irish veterinary surgeons at present working outside the country&mdash;already there is a trend in this direction&mdash;and that those who qualify annually at the Veterinary College of Ireland will take up practice here, where their services are now so urgently required.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some difficulties were experienced by housing authorities in determining what classes of houses could be regarded as eligible for grants under Section 12 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1954.  In order to resolve these difficulties a general ruling was given in a circular letter issued on 12th April, 1956, to the authorities concerned. I am not aware of any other difficulties of a general nature in relation to the interpretation and implementation of the section.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health why 36 per cent. of the population of County Westmeath have qualified under the provisions of the Health Act, to have their names placed permanently on the general medical register, while only 8 per cent. of the population of County Donegal have similarly qualified; and whether such comparative percentages indicate the presence in County Westmeath of a greater number of persons than in County Donegal who are unable to provide health services for themselves by their own industry, or whether the percentages only reflect different methods in each county of determining family income under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell (for the Minister for Health)</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of the population which qualifies in any particular county for entry in the general medical register depends on a number of factors, an important one being the number of applications made.  For example, in County Westmeath a higher percentage of the population have so far applied to have their names and those of their dependents entered in the register than in Donegal.  It does not follow that the figures quoted in the question represent the actual number of persons in the counties in question who are entitled to entry in the register or whose names will eventually be entered therein, as many persons may not apply until they actually need medical help.  The present system of registration has only come into force recently and is not yet fully in operation. <Col N="1468" /> It replaces a system which was in operation for many decades and it would be premature to draw deductions from comparisons of the numbers entered in the register to date in various counties.</P>

      <P>It is time that this Dáil, the Department of Education and every public representative concerned <Col N="1469" /> should declare war on the insanitary schools which are still in existence.  In doing that I am asking for the wholehearted co-operation of school managers and everybody concerned. I would ask the Minister to expedite the removal of the shocking conditions which prevail in many schools and to do everything possible to assist school managers and the people of the parish to build schools and to do away with the red tape that is involved in all these matters.  I have been trying for a number of years to expedite the building of schools in County Dublin.  Some machinery should be introduced so that teachers and children will be able to work under healthy conditions.  I hope the Minister and his Department and the Office of Public Works will do all in their power to improve the position.  I must say the Department of Education and the Board of Works have succeeded in building hundreds of good schools all over the country. I do not intend to take any credit from them that is their due, but in regard to County Dublin the position is not satisfactory.  I have been trying to get a school built in one area in County Dublin for ten years and the site has not been chosen yet.  We are building sanatoria and hospitals and trying to look after the health of our people by building houses, and yet we have these insanitary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a number of teachers in this country who are, in my estimation and from certain reports I have had, not pulling their weight.  People such as we who are public representatives are expected to be conscientious about serving the people, and if I fail in my capacity as a Deputy to answer a letter from any of my constituents I hear all about it.  A teacher who is not doing his job is acting criminally towards the children of this country.  I must say that we have excellent teachers in the country and I include my own county in that.  They deserve the praise of this House and of the country as a whole for being national heroes trying to uplift the fortunate children who happen to be in their charge.  However, I have no use for teachers who fail in their duty and I am sure that this Dáil would support me in that.  I <Col N="1470" /> may be asked questions outside about what I am saying now but I do not mind who is vexed or pleased.  Any teachers who are not pulling their weight should understand that this will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I will go a step further and say that the inspectors should be supported by the Department of Education and by this Dáil in doing their duty.  I do not want an inspector to do an injustice to any teacher.  It may happen that a teacher may be in a school where the children are exceptionally dull and he may find it impossible to bring them up to a certain standard, but I speak of the case where it is proved that a teacher is neglecting his job, that he has no interest in his duty towards the children under his charge.  If those children are allowed to grow up for five, six or seven years in that state, then having to go out and earn a living without being able to write their names, that teacher should not have any sympathy from this Parliament. He is paid for doing his duty and we should see to it that he does it.  I do not think any honest-minded man can say I am uncharitable in speaking like that.  We have been hiding our heads in the sand too long.  There is too much petting of people when they are asked to do a particular job.  I hope the Minister will take note of my remarks in that regard and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>With regard to pensioned teachers, the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Moylan, did something to alleviate the position of teachers who retired prior to 1950.  A number of these have retired on small salaries.  Every civil servant and every employee of a local authority received 18 months' salary on retirement, but these pensioned teachers got nothing except what Deputy Moylan as Minister for Education gave them; he gave them one-third of the amount they would normally have got.  That was a generous gesture.  I appeal to the present Minister to be equally generous to the few who are left.  Remember, with every day that passes their number is decreasing.  The Minister should follow the good example set by his predecessor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> There is a somewhat strange position as between Dublin City and Dublin County where teachers are concerned.  Teachers within a certain radius of the city receive a higher rent allowance.  Rents in any part of County Dublin to-day are very high and I think all teachers should be brought into line so far as rent allowances are concerned.  So far we have not achieved the object of providing our teachers with houses.  Until we do, we should make the allowances commensurate with the services rendered and the conditions prevailing in the locality.  These anomalies should not exist.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the County Dublin Vocational Committee and our chief executive committee on the magnificent work they are doing.  They are doing their utmost to promote vocational training.  That is most essential.  Every child should have an opportunity of attending these vocational schools to equip him or her to take a position in life.  Deputy Moylan was very keen on vocational education when he was Minister for Education.  He did everything in his power to encourage the building of vocational schools.  Technical education is an asset to any child.  It is a definite advantage in the case of the young boy or girl who is compelled to emigrate.  I would like to see a vocational school in every parish.  Naturally that would be a long-term policy and I appeal to the Minister to do everything he possibly can to expedite the building of more vocational schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting debate.  Many useful points have been made.  We are most fortunate in this country in that we are descended from people who had a real Christian outlook.  It would be well for us to do everything we can to foster that tradition.  Other countries have not had the same fortunate experience as we have had in that regard.  Many of our teachers, both lay and cleric, are descended from people who had a really good Catholic and Christian outlook. The majority of our teachers are first class.  We should express our appreciation of them.  Their work is hard.  They work long hours.  They <Col N="1472" /> work under the disability sometimes of monotony.  Each year they have to start all over again on the same programme, cope with the same type of children, the brilliant, the less brilliant, the mediocre and the stupid.  They have to do all they can to equip them for the battle of life.  They have done very well so far and I want to express my appreciation of their magnificent work.</P>
      <P>The teaching of Irish has been debated at some length.  I agree with the viewpoint expressed.  Irish should be taught in our schools.  I think, however, that it is difficult both for the teacher and the student to cope with other subjects taught through the medium of Irish.  I am all for Irish. I think the salutations alone&mdash;Dia dhuit, Dia agus Mhuire dhuit, 'se do bheatha&mdash;are well worth adopting in daily life.  The language is worthy of preservation if only for the salutations alone.  I doubt if there are equivalent salutations in any other language.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly and very keenly that we should do everything humanly possible to foster the Irish language.  I have always believed that.  Like Deputy Michael O'Higgins, who spoke last night, unfortunately, I have forgotten quite a lot of the Irish I learned as a young man, due to not having sufficient practice.  Perhaps some of the fault is my own.  Perhaps the same could be said of other Deputies and of the general public.  We should do everything possible to encourage our children to speak Irish and to play Irish games.  The generations who came before us did these things and we will be failing in our time if we do not live up to these traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national school is of primary importance.  Next in importance to the good parents in the home is the national school.  I have already complimented the national school teachers and other teachers on their great work but their work is being hampered to a large degree by reason of the fact that they are expected to teach Irish to English-speaking children immediately they arrive at the national school.  Many of these children may not have heard a word of Irish at home.  They are confused when they attend school for the first time and hear what is to them a strange <Col N="1473" /> language.  In many cases the parents cannot be blamed for that.  Many of the parents have to emigrate to England, America and other countries where English is spoken.  Personally, I would prefer that a child would not be compelled to learn Irish or to learn through the medium of Irish until he has reached the second or third class.  As the child grows older and hears the children at school speaking Irish, he will become interested and will learn the language more enthusiastically and will not find it as difficult as he might if he were compelled to learn Irish from the first day he arrives at school.</P>
    <P>The national school is commonly called the poor man's university. Unfortunately, the majority of our people cannot avail of any other form of education, even technical school education.  Many people who attended only the national school have distinguished themselves, to the credit of themselves, their teachers and their parents.  Everything possible should be done to maintain the good standard of our national schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had an opportunity of hearing various suggestions made by Deputies and he can consider them, with his advisers, and try to put them into practice where feasible.</P>
    <P>The question of sanitary accommodation has been referred to.  My experience in North Mayo is that the situation is deplorable.  There are many national schools in North Mayo that have no proper sanitary accommodation. That is a very regrettable state of affairs.  The cost of removing a child to hospital and maintaining him there for a long period is very high.  It is much better business to spend £100 or £200 in providing running water and proper sanitary accommodation in the schools.  That matter has been dealt with already and I join with those Deputies who stressed the importance of providing proper sanitary accommodation.  These amenities are provided in most of the schools around the City of Dublin but they are not provided in many of the rural schools.  It is not beyond the capacity of the Government to remedy this <Col N="1474" /> matter.  The generations who came before us had to erect churches, bridges, schools and a thousand and one other things.  We in our time should face up to our responsibility. The health of our children is a most important matter and we have grave responsibility if we neglect it.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the question of school meals.  In the City of Dublin the standard of school meals is far superior to those provided in the country.  That is most unfair and very wrong.  I have heard from most reliable people about the meat sandwiches and other types of sandwiches supplied to children in the various national schools in this city.  The quality of the food is very high.  The quality of the milk provided is very good.  It is a very lavish lunch that the children get in the City of Dublin and some other places.  I do not grudge these children that food.  I am glad to think that they are provided for in that way but, if one contrasts that with our experience in the country, one finds a great discrepancy. We hear of bread vans going out and delivering 2 lb. loaves or 4 lb. loaves to the children in the country districts. These are cut up and sometimes are broken up by the children and sometimes the bread is thrown around the school yard.  Bread supplied in that fashion is not very palatable and the children are not inclined to eat it and there is a lot of abuse.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is one system of supplying school meals for the city people and another system of supplying them for the rural people. That can be carried into many other aspects of administration in this country.  The Minister should look into that matter and see that there is proper supervision.  He should also ensure that there is a high standard in the supply of school meals and see that, whoever delivers the bread, will have it conveyed under proper hygienic conditions and so forth and not run the risk of spreading some disease among our children.  In this matter it is necessary to have more fair play as between country and town.</P>
    <P>In regard to school buildings, we have in our area some very fine schools.  We also have schools whose <Col N="1475" /> roofs are not in the best state of repair and whose windows are not in very good condition.  The rain comes in and you may have very low temperatures.  Breezes blow around the schools.  I suggest that many of these defects could be remedied by a repair gang who would carry out temporary repairs.  We should have a repair gang system whereby a squad of competent men in a county town, on receipt of a report that a school was in a bad state of repairs, would carry out temporary repairs.  Our children should not be left standing in a cold school-room from 10 o'clock in the morning until 3 p.m. or 3.30 p.m. in the afternoon.  That is not good for the children no matter how you may look at it.</P>
    <P>With regard to technical education, we in the County Mayo are very happy about the progress we have made.  Some of my neighbours, not in my immediate vicinity, cannot avail of the valuable education that is there for people who are anxious to avail of it.  In that regard I should like to pay a compliment to the County Mayo Vocational Education Committee for the fine work they have done.  Deputations have come to see the Minister from time to time.  Sometimes they go away disappointed when they do not get all the money they would like to get to extend the work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to know that we in the County Mayo are anxious for his fullest co-operation and all the consideration he can possibly give us.  Secondary education is beyond the reach of many of our people.  They cannot afford it as it is very expensive.  Vocational education is a cheaper form of education.  It is very useful and it equips those who receive it for the battle of life.  It provides the type of education which is eminently suitable for the people in my county.  The majority of the people in Mayo are smallholders living on the mountainsides or, perhaps, on the bogs and, owing to the smallness of their holdings, the majority of them cannot provide secondary education for their children.  A special case can be made for such areas.  In fact, the congested areas should, at all <Col N="1476" /> times, get special consideration in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the Minister could devise a system whereby he would take specially under his wing the congested areas and give them prior consideration, it would be very helpful.  The people living in cities like Dublin, Cork, Galway and other centres have the advantage of being able to send their children to school and the children can have their meals in the morning and come back in the afternoon. Contrast that with the position of the people living in areas remote from universities and you will appreciate the task of educating a child in those areas as compared with what it is in the city and suburbs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consider that we have a special problem.  It is generally recognised that children in the Gaeltacht and mountainous areas are usually brighter.  They are a hardier type and are very fond of education and those facilities should be provided for them. The majority of the people just cannot have university education provided for their children except the children win scholarships but even there the matter does not finish as there are other aspects to be considered also.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when the County Mayo Vocational Education Committee apply to him for money, to realise that thousands of our people are emigrating to England and America, and it is from these areas in particular that the majority of the people are fleeing.  The Minister should give us special consideration.  I am prepared to pay the Minister this compliment. He has all down through the years been a great believer in Gaelic and everything Irish.  He has proved that in many ways.  I was only a young boy coming to the City of Dublin when I heard of his activities in connection with the Gaelic movement.  I would say that of other members sitting on the other side of the House.  The Minister now holds the responsible position of Minister for Education.  If he appreciates&mdash;as I know he does&mdash;the value of the people living in these areas in Mayo and what they have done for the <Col N="1477" /> Catholic faith, Irish traditions and culture down through the years, he will give special consideration to them.  I now ask the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>I consider he is sympathetic towards these people.  We have a special problem and when the County Mayo Vocational Education Committee comes to him for grants to build technical schools, no matter from what part of the congested areas they come, I would ask him to give them favourable consideration and see that there are no Civil Service delays or red tape.  I am not reflecting in any way on the Civil Service.  I know they have to be very cautious and are answerable to this House.  I would ask the Minister to see that any applications coming from my county or from any of the congested areas, where Irish has been spoken for a long number of years, will receive favourable consideration.</P>

    <P>Is deacair aon roinnt faoi leith a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo agus tagairt fé leith a dhéanamh di.  Sé mo thuairim gur fearr dom tosnú leis na bun-scoileanna. Tá daoine ann atá ag déanamh iarracht breis abhar a chur dá mhúineadh ins na bun-scoileanna. Táimse go mór ina choinne sin agus tá súil agam nach ngéillfidh an tAire <Col N="1478" /> do na daoine atá ag cur suas na hargóna sin agus atá ag tathaint air na bun-abhair a mhéadú.  Tá daoine ann a cheapann gur féidir linn chuile rud a bheith againn ins na bun scoileanna. Níl ciall ar bith le sin.

Is dócha go raibh siad i ndon na nuachtáin a léamh.  Cheap na daoine an uair sin go raibh na scoileanna go maith, nuair a bhí furmhór na mbuachaillí i ndon na rudaí sin a dhéanamh.

    <P>In éineacht leis na rudaí a bhí le <Col N="1479" /> fóghlaim ag na daltaí an uair sin, tá an teanga náisiúnta acu anois le fóghlaim agus is obair throm í sin. Teanga nua is ea í sa Ghalltacht.  Sé mo thuairim nach féidir cur leis an méid ábhar ins na bun scoileanna gan díobháil a dhéanamh.  Is fearr beagán, agus é a bheith go maith.  Ní féidir linn ach an beagán a dhéanamh má tá orainn é a dhéanamh go maith, agus ba cheart dúinni gcónaí ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun an beagán sin a dhéanamh go maith.  Má cheapann na múinteoirí go bhfuil siad i ndon níos mó a dhéanamh, caithfidh siad cuimhneamh go bhfuil rudaí riachtanacha eile le deánamh, agus go bhfuil ortha iad do dhéanamh go maith.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh anois do cheist na Gaeilge.  Sílim go mba cheart an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh ón gcéad lá.  Ba cheart tosnú a dhéanamh an chéad lá le comhrádh agus gan bacadh leis an ngramadach go fóill&mdash;tosnú a dhénamh le comhrádh ceart.  Tagann an chaint roimh an ngramadach; bhí an chaint ann i bhfad roimh an ngramadach agus bhí daoine ann a bhí i ndon comhrádh ceart a dhéanamh gan aon eolas acu ar an ngramadach.  Má tá an chaint cheart ag an mhúinteoir, beidh sí ag na páistí.  Má deireann sé &ldquo;barr an dorais&rdquo; in ionad &ldquo;barr an doras&rdquo; agus &ldquo;cnap an dorais&rdquo; déarfaidh na páistí an rud céanna.  Beidh an tuiseal ceart acu agus gan aon eolas acu ar ghramadach nó ar an tuiseal geinideach. Ba cheart go dtósnódh na múinteoirí ag múineadh na teangan an chéad lá agus leanacht leis an scéim sin go ceann trí nó ceithre bliana.  Tá fhios agam go mbaineann múinteoirí áirithe an-úsáid as leabhair.  Ba mhian leo an focal scríofa a bheith ós a gcomhair i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Baineadh an iomarca úsáid as leabhra go dtí seo agus b'fhéidir go raibh fáth maith le sin.  Ní raibh sé ar chumas na múinteoirí ar feadh tamaill fhada an teanga do mhúineadh mar theanga bheo.  B'fhuirist í d'fháil ins na leabhra, í d'fhoghluim roimh ré agus aiste nó ceacht as an leabhar a mhúineadh. Rud eile, do bheadh an focal oiriúnach dhá choimeád ar bharr a theangan i gcónaí agus bheadh sé i ndon a rá leis <Col N="1480" /> na daltaí é seo nó é siúd a dhéanamh. Ní deacair múineadh as leabhair agus sin é an fáthe, sílim, gur baineadh an iomarca úsáid as leabhra san am a caitheadh.</P>
    <P>Scéal eile atá ann anois.  Tá togha na Gaeilge ag na múinteoirí ag teacht amach as na coláistí dóibh.  Uair amháin, bhíodar i ndon comhrá nó agallamh a dhéanamh le duine eile, ach anois tá sé ar a gcumas léachtaí nó óráid a thabhairt uathu gan deacracht ar bith agus ní gá dhóibh bacadh leis na leabhra chomh minic is a dheineadar san am a caitheadh.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh sé ar chumas na bpáistí an Ghaeilge a léamh agus a scríobh ag fágaint na bun-scoile dóibh agus ba cheart go mbeadh fonn orthu, fé mar a bhí orainn féin, bheith ag léamh an saghas leabhair sin ar a dtugtar Buffalo Bill i mBéarla. Tá gá le leabhra mar sin.  Do chonaic mé sreath amháin ach do bhí sé beagáinín ró-dheacair, agus fé mar a dúirt duine éigin cheana, sí an Ghaeilge shímplí is fearr.  Sin é an bhuadh a bhí ag an gCraoibhín.  Bhí a chuid Gaeilge an-shímplí agus nuair a bheitheá ag labhairt leis ar feadh tamaill cheapfá go raibh an Ghaeilge go maith agat féin, bhí sé chómh símplí sin.  Bhí na pundits, mar a déarfá ag magadh faoi, toise nach raibh Gaeilge aige den tsaghas a bhí acu féin, ach bhí an bhuadh sin aige, go raibh na daoine i ndon é a thuigsint, agus cheap na daoine mór thimpeall air ná raibh sé ró-dheacair an Ghaeilge d'fhoghluim dóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh leabhair mar sin i gcóir na nárd ranganna, leabhair a thabharfadh taithneamh do na scoláirí ag an aois sin, scéalta ina gcuirfidís suim.  Do chonaic mé páiste ag léamh leabhair i mBéarla agus dá mbeadh an saghas céanna leabhair le fáil i nGaeilge dhéanfadh sé mórán maitheasa.  Sin é an rud is mó atá ag taisteál uainn faoi láthair do réir mo thuairime&mdash;leabhair i gcóir na bpáistí atá ag fágaint na scoileanna.  Tá an saghas sin leabhair le fáil in mBéarla ach ní cuimhin liom ainm an údair anois.  Is dócha go bhfuil sé ag an Aire nó ag muintir na Roinne.  Tá an gá níos géire maidir leis an saghas leabhair sin ná maidir leis na leabhair <Col N="1481" /> a bhíonn ag an gClub Leabhar.  Dar ndóigh táid san ag teastáil chomh maith i gcóir daoine áirithe, ach tá leabhair ag taisteál ó na daltaí atá ag fágainst scoile agus ba cheart go mbeadh siad acu i dtreo is go bhféadfaidís iad a léamh agus, mar sin, bheith ag cur leis an méid Gaeilge atá acu cheana.</P>
    <P>Sé an gá is mó ná go rachaidís i dtaithí na léitheoireachta go mbeadh siad i ndon comhrá a dhéanamh le duine eile.  Cuireann sé faitíos orm i gcónaí nuair éirím chun óráid a dhéanamh i nGaeilge, ach ní bhíonn faitíos in aon chur orm ag déanamh óráid i mBéarla.  Is dócha aon uair a labhraim i nGaeilge nach dtagann na smaointe, pé saghas smaoineamh a bhíonn agam, chómh héascaí agus chomh tapaidh is a thagann siad i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go ba cheart dom focal a rá i dtaobh caighdeánú.  Níor thuig an Teachta a labhair ar an rud sin an cheist in aon chor.  Níl éinne ag rá nach ceart na canúintí a choimeád ins na ceantair ina bhfuil siad.  Níl éinne chómh díchéillí sin.  Is maith an rud é canúint an cheantair a choimeád ach ni hionann sin is a rá nach ceart caighdeán éigin a bheith ann.  Tá canúint na Scots ag muintir na hAlban, canúint Yorkshire agus canúint Lancashire i Sasana agus an saghas canúinte atá acu i Londain. Tá siad go léir ann, ach ní hí sin an chaint a cloistear de ghnáth.</P>
    <P>Sé an rud atá in aigne na ndaoine atá ag iarraidh caighdeán ná módh cainte a thuigfeadh na daoine i ngach áit san tír.  Caithfimíd cuimhneamh nach bhfuilimid ag tagairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta amháin ach, táimíd ag iarraidh an teanga náisiúnta a thabhairt thar nais ins an nGalltacht. Is deacair do pháistí atá ag fóghluim na Gaeilge ins an nGalltacht; go minic ní thuigeann siad cad a deirtear i ngach cás nuair a chloiseann siad nó nuair a chíonn siad rud éigin i módh amháin agus arís an rud céanna scríofa nó ráite i módh eile.  Cuireann sé deacracht nach ceart a bheith orthu.</P>
    <P>Níor léas an rud go ndearnadh tagairt dó ach is dócha gurb é sin an rud atá i gceist.  Ba mhaith leo an deacracht atá i bhfoghluim na Gaeilge, <Col N="1482" /> an deacracht atá i bhfoghluim gach saghas teangan a leigheas nó a laghdú. Ceapann roint daoine dá mbeadh saghas caighdeáin ann agus dá bhfeicfeadh na páistí na focla scríofa san modh céanna i gcónaí go bhfeadaidis an teanga a fhoghluim níos fearr. Níl na daoine seo ag smaoineámh ar na canúintí a scrios amach na saghas teanga nua a cheapadh.  Caithfimid cuimhneamh go bhfuil gach teanga beo agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge, cosúil le gach teanga san méid sin. Blianta ó shoin, bhí mise ag foghluim na Gaeilge as leabhra agus nuair a chuaigh mé don Ghaeltacht agus nuair a chualas na daoine ag caint, cheapas go raibh siad ag déanamh dearmad gramadaí agus nach raibh siad ag caint mar ba chóir.  A mhalairt de scéala a bhí ann.  Níor thuigeas an t-am sin é ach thuigeas tar éis tamaill eile go raibh an teanga beo agus go raibh sí ag fás mar gach rud beo.  Bhí sí ag athrú agus cuid de na foirmeacha a bhí ann fadó, bhí siad imithe.  Cuir i gcás nuair a chloiseann duine cainteóir ag rá &ldquo;ar an bhfuinneog&rdquo; fiafraíonn sé: &ldquo;Cén fá ná duirt sé: &lsquo;ar an bhfuinneoig&rsquo;.&rdquo;  Ní raibh an tuiseal tabharthach le cloisint.  Nílim ag rá nach bhfuil sé le cloisint i gcorr-áit ach le h-imeacht aimsire imeoidh an tuiseal sin ar fad.  I mBéarla bainim úsáid as an módh fó-shuíteach, subjunctive mood, mar bhí sé in úsáid sa gcuid den tír in ar tógadh mé.  Cé go mbainim úsáid as tá an módh fó-shuíteach imithe as an mBéarla ar fad.  Mar sin cén fáth nach féidir linn simpliú a dhéanamh ar ár dteanga? Mar adúradh, ní féidir daoine a thuigsint ag labhairt na Gaeilge uaireanta mar go bhfuil Gaeilge na leabhar acu.  Ní labhrann siad ins an gcaoi is simplí go minic agus tá cuid de na sean-fhoirmeacha á úsáid acu.  Níl fhios agam cén fá a labhair mé faoi sin ach go rabhas ag éisteacht le daoine ag trácht ar chaighdeánú na teangan.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na mbun-scoileanna, tá a lán déanta agus ba chóir níos mó suime a chur as seo amach i labhairt na teangan agus gan scríobhnóireacht nó gramadach nó aon rud den tsórt sin a thabhairt isteach go dtí na blianta deiridh, agus ansin léitheoireacht a <Col N="1483" /> mhúineadh agus más féidir leabhair suimiúla a sholáthar ní dóigh liom gur gá níos mó a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí caint freisin faoi abhair áirithe a mhúineadh tré Ghaeilge.  Ón gcaint a chualas ó dhaoine áirithe cheapfá nach raibh ciall ar bith i gceann an Aire ná in oifigigh na Roinne.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart a rá go mbeadh múinteoirí chomh dichéillí agus abhair a mhúineadh do páistí i dteanga nár thuigeadar.  Agus ní dóigh liom go raibh na cigirí chomh dichéillí sin agus a rá le múinteoirí na habhair a mhúineadh tré Ghaeilge, cuir i gcás geograf nó aon abhair eile, do páistí nach raibh an Ghaeilge acu.  Nuair a thagann na páistí ar scoil, timpeall sé bliana d'aois, ní bhíonn mórán á mhúineadh dóibh. Ní bhíonn ag teastáil ach suim na bpáistí a mhúscailt chun an lá a chaitheamh, ach is féidir teanga a mhúineadh dhóibh.  Sin é an t-am is fearr chun teanga a mhúineadh do pháistí.  Nuair a chloiseann siad rud cúpla uair, tuigeann siad é agus foghlamaíonn siad an teanga mar sin.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá níos mó a rá faoi na bun-scoileanna.  Mar adeir gach duine, siad na scoileanna is tábhachtaí sa tír agus má bhíonn siad ceart beidh gach rud eile ceart.  Ins na bun-scoileanna, tá deire le scolaíocht do n-a lán daoine.  Ní théann a lán acu go dtí aon scoil eile.  Sílim dá bharr sin go bhfuil an t-am tagtha nuair ba cheart dúinn aois fágtha na scoile d'ardú.  Tá fhios agam gur deacair é ach ba chóir dúinn, cuir i gcás i gceann chúig bhliana, a shocrú go mbeidh deis ag gach páiste leanúint ar scoil go dtí timpeall cúig bliana déag d'aois.  Tá fhios agam go bhfuil slí ag teastáil ins na scoileanna agus go bhfuil breis múinteoirí ag teastáil b'fhéidir.  Mar adúirt a lán daoine a bhí ag caint ins an saol atá inniu ann is tábhachtaí iad na ceard scoileanna agus ba chóir deis a thabhairt do na buachaillí agus na cailíní a fhágann na bun-scoileanna freastal ar na gairm-scoileanna munar féidir leo dul níos fuide go dtí na meán-scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam an fíor é ach dúradh nach bhfuil cead ag na ceard-scoileanna talmhaíocht a mhúineadh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> Ní dóigh liom gur fíor é sin.  Do bheadh ionadh an domhain orm má bhí cose ortha an talmhaíocht do mhúineadh, más mian leo, ins na scoileanna sin.  Níl sé riachtanach, freisin, go mbeadh feirm ag na scoileanna sin chun talmhaíocht do mhúineadh.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuli aon chiall leis má ta bac ar mhúinteoirí na ngairm-scoileanna talmhaíocht do mhúinadh Má ta bac ortha faoi láthair, ba chóir an scéal a réiteach ach níl fhios agam cén fá go mbeadh.</P>
    <P>Is ins na mbun-scoileanna is ceart tuath-eolaíocht agus abhar mar sin a thabhairt isteach ar dtús agus, gan aon agó, tá daoine ann atá ag iarraidh é a thabhairt isteach ins na scoileanna sin.  Tá súil agam nach gceapfadh aoinne ón meid atá ráite agam nach dtuigim a thábhachtaí agus tá líníocht. Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhíos im bhuachaill sa bhun-scoil gur theasbáin buachaill a bhí ina shuí in aice liom conas bosca a dhéanamh leis an &ldquo;perspective&rdquo; ceart.  Is minic a bhain mé úsáid as an tslí sin ó shoin i leith.  Dob fhéidir le múinteoirí rudaí mar sin a theasbáint agus má tá buachaillí nó cailiní ann a chuirfeas spéis faoi leith i rud mar sin, ba chóir go dtiurbhfaí cabhair éigin dóibh. Bíodh sin mar atá, ni dóigh liom gur ceart é a thabhairt isteach mar abhar scoile go mbeadh ar chuile dhuine é dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir le meán-scoileanna, tá an Comhairle Oideachas ag scrúdú na ceiste seo.  Níl fhios agam cén tuairim a bheas acu ag deire an scrúdúcháin atá ar siúl ach tá mé beagnach cinnte go ndearfaidh siad: &ldquo;Caithfimid na habhair a dheighilt.  Caithfimid a admháil go bhfuil tarraingt níos láidre ag eolaíocht inniu agus, san am chéanna, gur cóir daoine go bhfuil suim acu ins na healaíona a bheith i ndon nios mó ama a thabhairt dóibh ná mar a bhí ar a gcumas go dtí seo.&rdquo;  Déarfaidh roint daoine eile: &ldquo;Ta na &lsquo;classics&rsquo; imithe as saol na ndaoine.&rdquo;  Deireann roinnt daoine gur caillúint ama bheith ag scrúdú na &ldquo;classics,&rdquo; ach ní hé sin mo thuairim féin.  San am chéanna tá fhios agam go maith go gceapann daoine áirithe gur cailliúint ama a bheith ag déanamh staidéir ar an Laidean agus ar an <Col N="1485" /> nGréigis nuair atá an oiread san rudaí eile le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte gur abhair tábhachtach é an Laidean.  Déarfainn, mar adúirt duine eile, go bhféadfadh an Laidean a bheith níos cóngaraí dúinn in ár saol ná mar áta sí fé lathair.  Is Caitlicigh furmhór mhuintir na hÉireann agus tagann an Laidean isteach go mór i saol na gCaitliceach. Is féidir tosnú agus leabhar do réiteach i dtreo go mbeadh ar chumas daoine úsáid a bhaint as an Laidean gach lá sa bhliain nó gach Domhnach. Ba chóir, dar liom, feidhm a bhaint as Laidean na hEaglaise ar dtúis.  Má theastaíonn uathu, ansin, dul go dtí na &ldquo;classics,&rdquo; do b'fhéidir leo na leabhair a scríobh Ovid, Virgil, Horace, Livy, agus mar sin, a léamh.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh orm an Laidean do mhúineadh do bhuachaillí do thosnóinn dá mbfhéidir liom, le Laidean na hEaglaise.  Do mhúinfinn na paidreacha ar dtúis, agus, nuair a bheadh siad de ghlan-mheabhair acu, do mhúinfinn na duanta diadha dóibh de ghlan-mheabhair.  Ansin do thosnóinn leis an ngraiméar, na paradigms, agus mar sin.  Do dhéanfann leabhar as na focla ins na paidreacha agus do thiurbhfainn somplaí dóibh den ghraiméar as na paidreacha a bheadh de ghlan-mheabhair acu.  Ansin, ag a dheire, do bheinn i ndon an Missal a léamh.</P>
    <P>Bhíos sa bhuíon Laidean le honóracha le sé nó seacht de bhlianta.  Bhí díomá orm, blianta in a dhiaidh sin, nuair a bhí Missal beag agam agus gan ach an Laidean inti nuair a fuaireas amach go raibh mórán inti nár thuig mé tar éis an méid ama a chaitheas ins na buíonta onóracha. Dúras liom féin go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr tosnú agus an leabhar sin a bheith mar théacsleabhar.  Dúinne in Éirinn, is teanga bheo í an Laidean. Fé mar is eol do chách, is ón Laidean a thagann préamhacha formhór na bhfocal sna teangacha Eorpacha.  Fiú amháin, tóg, an Béarla mar shampla. Tá mórán focal Béarla cosúil leis na focail Laidne mar is ón Laidean a thagas na préamhacha.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir liom tagairt do gach abhar mar sin ach, im thuairim, do bfhéidir na teangacha is tábhachtaí atá ins <Col N="1486" /> an Eúroip inniu a thógint.  Ansin tá an Laidean agus, más maith leat, an Ghréigis freisin.  Ceapaim go bhfuil an t-am chomh gairid sin agus go bhfuil an oiread sin le foghluim nach gá an Ghréigis a thabhairt isteach inniu don ghnáth-dhuine.  Mar sin, bíodh an Laidean ar thaobh amháin agus ansin na teangacha beo.  Ansin bíodh mathematic&mdash;is bunús í de gach sort eolaíochta&mdash;áireamh, ailgéibar, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá &ldquo;specialisation.&rdquo; Ní bheadh rudaí den tsaghas sin riachtanach muna mbeifí ag dul níos fuide.  Sílim go mba mhaith an rud ealaíon ghinearálta den tsaghas sin bheith ann.  Dá mbeadh an méid sin againn ins na meán-scoltacha, sílim go mbeadh deis ag na daoine a bheadh ag fágáil na scol sin, gan dul isteach ins an ollscoil nó in aon scoil eile, cur leis an eolas atá acu.  Ní dóigh liom gur féidir bheith ag smaoineamh ar níos mó ná sin.</P>
    <P>Is minic a chuala mé ollamh san ollscoil a rá gur bhfearr, i bhfad nach mbeadh aon tosnú déanta ag cuid de na daoine a théas chun an ollscoil, gur fearr leo, cuir i gcás i n-ealaíon, na daoine nach raibh aon eolas acu a mhúineadh agus a chur ar aghaidh ná na daoine a raibh roint eolais acu cheana ar an gceist sin.  Níl fhios agam mar gheall air sin ach, ar chuma ar bith, b'fhéidir an bun-eolas ceart a thabhairt do na daoine atá ag dul isteach.  Maidir leis an gcuid is mó de na daoine a théas chuig an ollscoil, ach amháin na daoine a théas isteach in &ldquo;Arts&rdquo;, tá fútha ceard faoi leith nó gairm faoi leith a leanúint agus ón am a théas siad isteach bíonn siad an-ghnóthach ag déanamh na hoibre sin agus ní doigh liom gur féidir an tsean-chuspóir a bhíodh ag na h-ollscoileanna fadó a bheith againn &mdash;oideachas leathan a bheith ann. Specialisation ar fad atá ar siúl ins na hollscoltacha anois agus más mian linn eolas leathan nó cultúr leathan a thabhairt do na daoine óga is tríd na meán-scoltacha a caithfear é a dhéanamh.  Dúirt mé é sin cheana agus bhí a lán daoine ag rá nach raibh aon chiall ann ach sin é mo thuairm-se.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt mé go minic cheana, is féidir le saor cloiche má tá sé féin oilte, oideachas leathan a thabhairt don <Col N="1487" /> phrintíseach a bhéas aige agus má tá cultúr ceart ag an ollamh atá ins an ollscoil, agus má tá suim cheart aige sa léann agus i gcultúr, is féidir é sin a scaipeadh go réidh.  Na daoine a théas isteach san ollscoil, de ghnáth, tá an oiread sin le déanamh acu chun céim dochtúra nó céim innealltóra nó céim eile mar sin do ghnóthú, nach bhfuil am acu le tabhairt d'aon obair speisialta.</P>
    <P>Ós rud é go bhfuilim ag tagairt do na hollscoltacha, is dócha go bhfaca an tAire an gearán a bhí á dhéanamh ag Uachtarán Choláiste na hOllscoile i mBaile Átha Cliath agus, ina dhiaidh sin, an gearán a rinne Uachtarán Choláiste na Gaillimhe.</P>

      <P>Is dócha go bhfaca an tAire é.  Tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann sé an scéal.  Beidh tubaiste déanta muna féidir cúnamh a thabhairt dóibh agus tá sé anriachtanach agus é sin go tapaidh. Ní dóigh liom gur gá dul isteach sa cheist sin anois ach tagairt a dhéanamh dí.  Dob fhéidir liom a rá leis go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach agus go bhfuil géar-ghá le cúnamh ar an bpointe.  Ní féidir é chur ar an méir fhada ar chor ar bith.  Má cuirtear ar an méir fhada é loitfear an scéal ar fad.  Tá cáil mhaith, agus bhí le 100 blian, ar na Scoileanna Leighis againn anseo.  Ba mhór an náire an cháil sin a chailliúint agus tá faitíos orm, muna ndéantear beart go tapaidh, go gcaillfear é.  Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire, ós rud é go bhfuil deis agam é dhéanamh, go ma chóir dul isteach sa cheist ar an bpointe, nach féidir é chur ar an méir fhada.  Tá fhios agam an ganntanas airgid atá ann ach, má tá priority ar bith ann, ba chóir priority a bheith annsin. Ma cailltear é, beidh sé caillte b'fhéidir, go deo orainn.  Ní dóigh liom gur gá níos mó a rá faoin scéal sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Táim cinnte go gcuirfidh an tAire suim ins na rudaí adúradh anseo. Tá brón orm nar chualamar tuairimí <Col N="1488" /> na ndaoine nach bhfuil aon bhaint acu leis an &ldquo;machine.&rdquo;  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr bheith ag éisteacht le tuismitheoirí a rá céard iad na tuairimí atá aca d'réir an eolais atá acu ar a gclainn féin agus ar a muintir.  Níl aon áit eile 'nar féidir leo é sin a dhéanamh. Tá a lán Cumann-múinteoirí agus mar sin de&mdash;agus tá siad i ndon a dtaobh féin den scéal a chur in iúl don tír.  An t-aon áit amháin gur féidir leis na tuismitheoirí a dtuairimí a chur in iúl sé an Teach seo é, ach amháin an bhaint atá againn go léir mar thuismitheoirí leis na múinteoirí ins na scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Dúradh, nuair a bhí an toghachán ar siúl, go raibh an tír seo ró-bhocht chun bheith spriúnlaithe i gcúrsaí oideachais agus chun an t-airgead atá riachtanach a sholáthár.  Sílim go raibh sé sin fíor.  Do chuir ár sinsear an-tsuim i léann agus in eolaíocht. Bhí tóir acu ar na rudaí a bhain leis an intinn.  Tá súil agam nach bhfuil an tréith sin caillte agus, mura bhfuil, ba chóir a shocrú anois an méid airgid is féidir a thabhairt do chúrsaí oideachais. Tá súil agam, pé ganntanas airgid atá ann, nach mbeidh an Rialtas spriúnlaithe i dtaobh nithe den tsórd sin.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag éirí chun rud d'fháil amach nach bhfuil tugtha síos ag an Aire san ráiteas lenar chuir sé ceann air an díospóireacht.  Feicim rudaí ins an Leabhar Meastacháin, rudaí a bhaineas le dhá mhír-cheann&mdash;bónus na Gaeilge, agus deontaisí le haghaidh scoláireachta a chaitheamh sa nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Maidir le bónus na Gaeilge, do réir na bhfigiúirí, tá an méid atá dhá sholáthar i mbliana laghdaithe do réir cúig is fiche faoin gcéad ar an méid soláthair a bhí ann anuraidh. Is deacair a thuiscient cad chuige go mbeadh laghdú chomh mór sin in aon bhliain amháin, go mór-mhór nuair atá sé ráite ag an Áire go bhfuil méadú 5,000 ar an méid daltaí scoile ar fad atá ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Le blianta beaga anuas tá siad ag méadú na scoileanna agus fiú amháin na séipéil sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht mar gheall ar an méadú atá ar an líon daoine.  Ar ndóigh, más fíor é sin&mdash;agus is fíor é&mdash;sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht san <Col N="1489" /> Iarthar is deacair a thuiscint cad chuige a mbeadh an laghdú seo ann.</P>

      <P>Tá sin. sásúil agus is maith liom é a cloisteáil Buíochas mór le Dia, tar éis a bhfuil de chlamhsán agus de chnáimhseáil cloiste againn ar fud na hÉireann agus ó na Teachtaí, is fíor ará go bhfuil líon na gcainteoirí sa nGaeltacht ag méadú.  Ní hiad na scoileanna, na séipéil agus na tithe amháin atá dá bhfairsingiú.</P>
      <P>Tá mír-cheann eile&mdash;mír-cheann C.8 &mdash;agus maidir leis an mír-cheann seo níl ach méidín beag de laghdú ann&mdash; £1,500 éigin.  Ach tá sé laghdaithe rud beag ach ní hé an laghdú is cás liom anois ach ós rud é go mbaineann an dá mhír-cheann sin&mdash;bónus na Gaeilge agus scoláireachtaí chun laethe saoire a chaitheamh sa nGaeltacht&mdash; le sábháil na Gaeilge sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus le labhairt na Gaeilge a leathnú ar fud na hÉireann, ba cheart an dá sholáthar sin a mhéadú.  Ba cheart, más féidir é, é a mhéadú chuile bhliain, bliain i ndiaidh bliana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí Treoraí an Fhreasura ag caint mar gheall ar labhairt na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna.  Tá gach duine a bhfuil spéis aige i bhforbairt na Gaeilge taobh thiar den chaint sin.  Tá triail sáthach fada bainte amach anois as na leabhra agus ba cheart tús áite a thabhairt don bheo-caint.  Tá sin á dhéanamh ins na scoileanna.  Do thosnaigh sé i mBaile Átha Cliath ar dtús agus tá sé i náiteacha eile ar nós Chorcaighe agus Gaillimh.  Scoileanna faoi leith atá iontu atá fé stiúradh na ngnáth-bhainisteoirí agus daoine eile.  Tá mé ag ceapadh go dtugtar &ldquo;model schools&rdquo; orthu.  Tá siad ag déanamh sár-oibre maidir le caint na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn, agus tá cruthú le fáil ar éifeacht na hoibre sin ach éisteacht leis na daoine ag dul ar scoil nó ag teacht abhaile ón scoil. Sin í an teist is fear ar éifeacht na múinteoireachta.  Do chuala mé na páistí seo i nGaillimh agus iad ar a mbealach ón scoil agus is íontach an méid Gaeilge a bhí dhá labhairt acu. <Col N="1490" /> Ní dóigh liom gur féidir é sin a rá i leith páistí ar bith as aon scoil eile.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cad é an bhuadh fé leith atá ag na múinteoirí ins na scoileanna seo.  Is gnáth-mhúinteorí iad a tugadh isteach as na scoileanna eile agus más féidir leo siúd an obair sin a dhéanamh ba cheart don Aire ceist a chur chuige féin faoi cad chuige nach féidir leis na scoileanna eile ina bhfuil na múinteoirí céana ionntu an dul chun chinn céana a dhéanamh.  Dá mbeadh cuile scoil chomh maith, nó leath chomh maith, leis na scoileanna sin, tá mé ag ceapadh nach mbeadh ceist ar bith faoin rud sin ar a dtugtar &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; sa Teach seo agus i náiteacha eile.</P>
    <P>Mar adúirt Teachtaí áirithe, ar ndóigh níl aon rud ann mar &ldquo;compulsory Irish.&rdquo;  Níl &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; ann ach an oiread is atá &ldquo;compulsory arithmetic,&rdquo; nó fiú amháin &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; freastal ar scoil.  Má chuireann na tuismitheoirí in a gceann gur féidir leis na páistí déanamh amach gan aon abhar ar bith, fiú amháin, ní bhacadís leis chor ar bith. Tá sé ráite go minic ag daoine as an mBreatain, daoine a bhfuil eolas ar leith acu ar chúrsaí oideachais, go bhfuil an caighdeán oideachais anso i bhfad níos aoirde ná mar atá sé thall.  Bhí mise ag caint le múinteoir ón mBreatain Bhig roint bhlianta ó shoin.  Bhí sí anso ag iarraidh cailíni a fháil chun obair a dhéanamh i Sasana i rith an chogaidh.  Do chuír sí cailíní ó Thír Chonaill go Loch. Garmain fé scrúdú agus chuir sé ionadh mór uirthi an difríocht a bhí idir an caighdeán oideachaid anso agus thall.  Ba mhaith liom a rá nach gcuireann an Ghaeilge as chor ar bith do dhaoine óga a chuireann an spéis cheart ina ngnótha.  Na daoine óga a chuireann spéis ins an nGaeilge, tá tuismitheoirí aca a bhfuil spéis mór aca i chuile ábhar.</P>
    <P>Deir an tAire faoi an gComhairle Oideachais:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sé dualgas atá orm, le linn dúinn aon pholasaí i leith an oideachais a chur chun cinn, féachaint chuige go dtiubharfar áird mar is ceart, ní hé ámháin ar thuairimí na Comhairle <Col N="1491" /> ach ar thuairimí na ndreamanna eile, leis, go bhfuil suim aca sa cheist.</P>

Níl lena aghaidh seo ach £300.  Ar Mheastachán an Iascaí, rinne mé tagairt do chomh tábhachtach is atá sé fir ceannais na mhád iascaigh a oiliúint d'réir an dlí chun go mbeidh ar a gcumas faoin dlí sin na báid a thabhairt amach ar an bhfairrge.  Go dtí seo níor tharla aon timpistí le go gcuirfeadh na cóluchtaí árachais isteach orainn i ngeall ar na fir seo a bheith gan cáilíochta ceart.  Tá mé sásta an cheist seo a fhágáil faoin Aire.</P>

Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach an bhfuil aon cheann acu ag foilsiú i nGaeilge thar an méid a bhfuil íocaíochta le fáil acu air.  'Sí an cheist í, an bhfuil siad ag déanamh aon rud go deontach.

    <P>Tá a lán déanta acu do na daoine a d'fhoghluim an oiread Gaeilge ar scoil agus a chuir ar a gcumas Gaeilge a léamh agus, ós rud é go raibh litríocht i nGaeilge le fáil bhí siad i ndon a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú ar an gcaoi sin. Ní bhaineann sé sin pioc den chaint i dtaobh chomh tábhachtach is atá sé na daoine óga a thosnaíos ar scoil a chur ag caint na Gaeilge ón tosach. B'shin é bun-chloch múineadh na Gaeilge agus, ag baint leis sin, ba cheart a thuille airgid a sholáthar agus tuille páistí a chur chuile Shamhraidh go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Tá dhá éan le marbhadh le chéile: an chéad cheann, labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn <Col N="1493" /> agus an tarna rud, go bhfuil cuid mhaith de pháistí scoile ag fáil laetheanta saoire faoin tuaith, cuid mhaith acu nach mbeadh ar a gcumas laetheanta saoire ar bith a fháil taobh amuigh de na cathracha ina bhfuil cónaí orthu.  Tá dhá chuspóir mhaithe ceangailte ansin le chéile.  Is cuma cén méid airgid a caithfí ar an rud sin, b'fhiú é é.  B'fhiú é é ó thaobh amháin, agus b'fhiu é é ón taobh eile.  Iad sin, agus na daoine sa nGaeiltacht a spreagadh chur an Ghaeilge atá acu a choinneáil beo.  Cuidíonn chuile strainséar agus cuairteoir a théas go dtí an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht leis an spiorad sin a chothú agus a choinneáil beo sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Council of Education, if that is the reason for referring the Estimate back, I can understand the disappointment on Deputy Moylan's part that more was not said about it.  I did say last year that inside a couple of months I expected to have the final reports on the recommendations that I had asked for and in fact I did not get the final report until early this year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan has asked me to philosophise, to give my views on educational technique or educational practice.  I do not regard that as my function in the Department of Education in the circumstances of the educational set-up in this country.  You have your teachers, your managers and your Churches and I regard the position as Minister in the Department of Education as that of a kind of dungaree man, the plumber who will make the satisfactory communications and streamline the forces and potentialities of the educational workers and educational management in this country.  He will take the knock out of the pipes and will link up everything.  I would be blind to my responsibility if I insisted on pontificating or lapsed into an easy acceptance of an imagined duty to philosophise here on educational matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Council of Educathábhachtac <Col N="1495" /> tion is a factual document.  The Council of Education was set up for constructive purposes and various people have attempted to push it aside and to find fault with it.  I asked the council to report on the function of the primary school and the programme suggested by the primary school up to 12 years of age, I did that without prejudice as to what age the primary school should cater for, because, as I have indicated, there had been, as Deputy Derrig knows, departmental bodies that had examined the general education position and they did indicate that 12 was an age at which a change should take place.  In the light of that, I thought that the programme up to 12 was something that could very well be settled first and that it was not prejudicing in any way either the age to which the child should attend the primary school or the subsequent stages of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>I regard it as a matter of urgency to give clear decisions as to what the Government and what I, as Minister for Education, suggest would be done in consequence of that report, so that teachers, managers, and everybody concerned with education would know what the foundation there is.  The fact that certain matters have been put before the Dáil and discussed here by Deputy Vivion de Valera and the Leader of the Opposition indicates to me, and I am sure they appreciate it themselves, the soundness of the fact that I have asked the Council of Education while I am dealing with their report on primary education, to consider the curriculum that ought to be pursued in the secondary schools in so far as the secondary schools are paid State grants.  I think it is most important that a body such as the Council of Education would consider that matter and make a report and let that report and their suggestions be examined in relation to secondary education.  I would like it to be clearly understood what the process of this consideration is.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the work of the Council of Education on the grounds that they did not receive witnesses for oral examination.  They <Col N="1496" /> were open to receive statements and recommendations and memoranda of all kinds from all interested parties and they received them, as the report says, from a very considerable number.  Then when the report was made, as I have indicated, I sent a copy of that report to every ecclesiastical body, the association of school managers and all other educational and teaching bodies for the purpose of bringing formally to their notice that certain recommendations had been made, and asking them, with their first-class touch with every aspect of the educational programme concerned, to comment on the recommendations made by the council and to let me and the Department have the benefit of their criticism.</P>
    <P>It is interesting just to read out the list of the bodies that replied to that invitation.  We had the benefit of comment and suggestions on the recommendations made by the council's report from the Irish Hierarchy, the General Synod of the Church of Ireland, the Board of Education of the Presbyterian Church, the Catholic Managers' Association, the Dublin School Managers (Church of Ireland), the Diocesan Synod of Dublin, Glendalough and Kildare, Conference of Convent Primary Schools, the Christian Brothers' Education Committee, the Faculty of Education, University College, Cork, Our Lady of Mercy Training College, Cumann Oiliúna gColáiste Oiliúna, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, Irish School Masters' Association, Central Association of Irish School Mistresses, the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that whatever decisions are taken it is very important that the decisions would be taken in the light of such criticisms and suggestions on the actual recommendations by bodies that are so placed as these are.  Anybody who has any contact with Irish education and its organisation will realise the position of the Church, the managers and the teachers in relation to the management and the programme of the schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to those people who criticise certain aspects of the <Col N="1497" /> Irish position that the recommendations that are made here are subject to the same comment and the same scrutiny as any other aspects of this report.  We had some criticism of the alleged position in regard to the use of Irish in the schools which rather muddied the atmosphere.  We had a number of speakers on this subject and they reminded me of a maid out of sorts going around flapping a duster, here, there and elsewhere and raising more dust than she was laying.  Deputy Declan Costello, on the one hand, and Deputy Cunningham, on the other hand, had statements to make which were completely wide of any experience of what is happening with regard to teaching through Irish in the primary schools.  Deputy Declan Costello quoted the Irish National Teachers' Report of 1941 and in doing so he seemed like a cold voice out of a world that did not exist, because that world does not exist.  So far as Deputy Tully is concerned, he makes the statement that in at least 50 per cent. of the national schools in this country children are taught through the medium of Irish from the day they go into them until they leave.  These descriptions are entirely wide of the mark.</P>
    <P>Those interested in the extent to which Irish is used as a medium of instruction in the ordinary primary schools can look at pages 54 and 55 of the Department of Education's Report for 1952-53.  They will see there in what counties there are schools outside of the Gaeltacht areas in which the Irish language is used to a certain extent as a medium of instruction.  I would ask them, or anybody else, to give the name of any particular school where Irish has been used as a medium of instruction for other subjects and where it is suggested that the use of Irish as a medium of instruction for other subjects is either an imposition on the children, on the one hand, or is injuring education, on the other.  I do not want to point to the fact that there are schools where Irish is the medium of instruction and where remarkable academic achievements have been brought about.  I accepted there was something in the statements being made and I now pass on that challenge <Col N="1498" /> to any other Deputy or any other person.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the report generally is that it is under my close personal examination.  Apart from these matters and the proposals that arise out of them there is a financial implication, but I hope at the earliest possible moment to make it perfectly clear to all concerned what the Government's approach is towards taking a decision and moulding policy for the primary schools up to 12 years of age on that basis.  I think it is regrettable that any Deputy, and particularly a Deputy asserting he was working on evidence and working from personal observation, would call the report of the council in relation to the Irish language pusillanimous.</P>
    <P>Whatever any person may think of the particular type of selection I have made for the Council of Education, I think they are a group of experienced and responsible people who, having listened to the opinions of others, have put down in black and white a clear line of statement and a clear line of recommendation for all of us to go on. I think we are all very deeply indebted to the members of the council for their work, which is an arduous and exacting work; and I think nobody, no matter what their personal ideas may be and no matter how they would wish to tackle a job, wishes to think in terms of education of any kind unless they have a base line to which they can refer, if only by way of criticism.  I do feel that it would be a very good thing to accept that in the planning of our educational work it is a very valuable thing to have matters put down in black and white.</P>
    <P>You have now a report on the primary schools up to 12.  You will have a recommendation from the Council of Education on what the syllabus of the secondary schools should be.  Much has been said in relation to that syllabus to-day and a very considerable amount of stress has been laid on the fact that we want more science and more preparation in the technical schools because the technical make-up in the world to-day is increasing.  That is a very important matter and I am quite sure it will have the full examination <Col N="1499" /> and full attention of the council in their report.</P>
    <P>I asked them to report on the secondary school system because that is a system that is completely detached from either the primary system or the vocational system; it is a system that could be examined, that could be reported on and in regard to which decisions could be taken.  Instead of creating difficulty, it would clear the air once you have a report on the primary system up to 12 and a report on the secondary system, and, if you like, a joint consideration over the whole field as to what should happen in the primary schools after 12, and up to what age, and what the relationship there should be between that instruction and the instruction given in the continuation end in the Céard Scoil. I am quite clear myself, and I feel it should be clear to everybody generally, that we are clearing the ground by way of revision and by way of examination and recommendation.  I feel that the recommendations that are being made from these reports give us a co-ordination from which we can measure up the best line of approach by reference to these recommendations.</P>
    <P>In the same way a scheme for conciliation and arbitration has been introduced for primary and secondary teachers and, I hope now, for vocational teachers, that will again order the atmosphere in which an important aspect of educational work will be done.  It will both free the atmosphere and the officials of the Department, on the one hand, and will free teachers in whatever branch of education they are engaged, on the other hand, to deviate considerably more of their time to matters that are of technical importance or are of general educational importance.  While there have been matters that are regrettable in relation to arbitration dealings, nevertheless these are the growing pains of that system, and I look to the stabilisation of this conciliation and arbitration for the ingredients to effect the atmosphere in which educational thought will go ahead and in which educational work will be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> Another aspect of the council's report, which has implications in regard to finance, is the provision of teachers.  Questions have been raised as to the number of teachers available from the training colleges.  I indicated in my statement introducing the Estimate that, thanks to the co-operation of the training college authorities and the ecclesiastical authorities, an improvement has been achieved in so far as availability of women teachers is concerned.  The Convent of Our Lady of Mercy in Blackrock has accommodation for 360 lay students. That means that we get 180 trained teachers every year.  The Convent of Mary Immaculate in Limerick has accommodation for 210.  That gives us 105 teachers every year.  As from 1st July, 1958, we will have a total of 285 women teachers, plus 50 nuns.  In St. Patrick's, there is accommodation for 216, with an annual output of 108.  In the Protestant training college for women only, the total number in training is 56 and the annual output is 27.  From the De La Salle and the Irish Christian Brothers, there is an annual output of 36.  There is an annual output of nuns from Blackrock and Limerick of 55.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made that these will only meet the situation in so far as present wastage is concerned, but that they will not solve the difficulty of the untrained teacher.  In a period of time, at any rate, the proposals of the Council of Education will lead up to our not having to depend on untrained teachers any more.  The position with regard to junior assistant mistresses is that they will remain on in the service, until such time as they retire or marry.  According as the output of trained teachers increases, J.A.M.s will be replaced by trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised as to the maintenance and provision of schools. Deputy McQuillan complained that more attention is given to the city areas than to the rural areas.  I stated emphatically, when he made the suggestion, that there was no foundation for the suggestion.  Dublin is the capital city.  It has grown very substantially.  Apart from the increase <Col N="1501" /> in population, it has had to meet the problem of slum clearance and the development of large new housing areas.  The provision of schools in these areas has been met very satisfactorily. The ecclesiastical authorities and the religious houses have made a very substantial contribution to the provision of first-class schools in and around Dublin.  That has not in any way deprived rural areas of the attention they should get.  The charge, however, was made so positively and so bluntly by Deputy McQuillan, and one or two others, that I want now to give the position in relation to the grants for the year 1955-56.  Particulars of these grants can be given for years back.</P>
    <P>There have been new schools built; there have been enlargements of existing schools; and there have been improvements.  In Donegal there were ten new schools and four enlargements at a cost of £57,681; in Monaghan, there were five new schools and one enlargement, costing £64,900; in Sligo, three new schools and one enlargement, £10,790; in Leitrim, four new schools and one enlargement, £18,754; in Cavan, two new schools and one enlargement, £9,100; in Louth, two new schools and two enlargements, £16,142; in Mayo, six new schools and five enlargements, £34,230; in Roscommon, nine new schools and two enlargements, £38,886; in Longford, three new schools, £85,400; in Westmeath, five new schools and one enlargement, £66,150; in Meath, five new schools, £24,730; in Galway, seven new schools and two enlargements, £43,740; in Offaly, six new schools and two enlargements, £61,408; in Laois, three new schools and one enlargement, £19,360; in Kildare, four new schools and six enlargements, £116,860; in Clare, seven new schools and one enlargement, £52,273; in Limerick, three new schools and one enlargement, £85,950; in Tipperary, eight new schools and 12 enlargements, £70,688; in Carlow, two new schools four enlargements, £32,315; in Wicklow, six new schools, £33,220; in Kilkenny, four new schools and one enlargement, £79,360; in Wexford, three new schools, £59,175; in Waterford, five schools, and three enlargements, £41,109; in Cork, 12 schools and seven enlargements, £70,456; in Kerry, <Col N="1502" /> 11 new schools and two enlargements, £165,897; in the City of Dublin, three schools and five enlargements, £178,897; and in the county, three schools and one enlargement, £65,500. I offer that to Deputy McQuillan and anyone else who feels that the problem is being neglected in so far as the rural areas are concerned and that Dublin is making inroads on moneys which should be available for the rural areas.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>There was a complaint, too, in regard to the delay in carrying out work. The question was raised as to what can be done to speed up that work.  My predecessor, Deputy Moylan, had the same type of difficulty with which to contend, a difficulty which showed itself immediately after the war.  In setting the target for the building of new schools and the carrying out of major improvements, he felt it was necessary to get additional staff to deal with the technical side of things in the Office of Public Works.  Though there has been a reduction of staff in the Department of Education, that reduction has been carried out in such an effective way that it has resulted in increasing the efficiency of the Department.</P>
    <P>On that side of the Department which deals with these matters, we have increased the efficiency of departmental machinery 100 per cent.  On the Office of Public Works side, the former Minister, Deputy Moylan, succeeded in getting agreement to an increase in the technical staff there.  The machinery for the recruitment of technical staff was a bit on the slow side and the work of the Civil Service was also slow in that regard.  The result was that on many occasions, when persons applied for positions as architects in the Office of Public Works, by the time the Civil Service machinery got working and the people could be taken on, it was found that they had got other jobs and were no longer available.  I had to arrange that the Office of Public Works would take on architects direct without going through the Civil Service machinery and also that, in some of the work involving remodelling or the carrying out of major improvements in school works, the work would be done by local architects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The position has been that, while the allocations from the Department of Education on the basis of work required have been provided, much of the work has not been done over the years since 1948.  The allocations were in those years since 1948: £481,000; £495,000; £480,000; £699,000; £917,000; £1,500,000; £1,387,000; £1,750,000 and £1,543,000, respectively.  In the years leading up to 1948, there has been a lag in the carrying out of actual work, so that, in March, 1951, there were these arrears in the Office of Public Works.  In 1951, the arrears were £1,270,000; 1952, £1,059,000; in 1953, £2,400,000; in 1954, £2,500,000; in 1955, £3,200,000 and in 1956, £3,500,000.  That is a serious position and everything possible has been done, and will continue to be done, to see that the necessary technical staff is provided to get that work done and the matter is continuing to have my personal attention and has been having my personal attention for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The general position with regard to the replacement of defective schools is good at the present time.  I should like to refer to the fact that questions have been raised by Deputy MacQuillan, I think, as to what has been done in this regard.  In this matter, we are dealing with a definite and concrete situation.  We are in the happy position, at any rate, that there is local managerial control, together with the effect of public opinion and the position in regard to teachers, and I do not think there is any case of very serious neglect.  I do not think there are any insanitary schools existing which would justify some of the statements made here.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there are 822 schools that require replacement at the moment.  There are 139 of these for which grants have been sanctioned by the Department of Education, and plans have been received from the Office of Public Works.  There are 83 cases in which plans and estimates have been received from the Office of Public Works, but the grants have not yet been sanctioned, but they are being dealt with by the Department of Education.  There are 207 cases in which sites have been offered by the <Col N="1504" /> local managers, but the plans and estimates have not been forwarded by the Office of Public Works.  It will take time to do that.  Then there are 393 cases in which sites have not yet been offered by the managers.</P>
    <P>That is the position with regard to the arrears of work.  That gives an indication of what it amounts to from the point of view of work, on the one hand, and the point of view of finance, on the other.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the fact that about seven times as much money is allocated every year for primary schools as compared with the vocational side of things.  At least the average is seven or eight times more. It is desirable perhaps, in view of the suggestions that have been made, that in the matter of vocational school building the Department is dilatory and cut down to the minimum, that I should make some reference to this matter.  There has been an awakening and a developing interest in the development of the vocational side of education, encouraged by the position arising from the war period, on the one hand, and encouraged by a quickened interest in agricultural development, and technique, and the encouragement of the many voluntary societies throughout the country on the other.</P>
    <P>Taking the allocations from 1950; that is, the allocations by way of sanction from the Department of Education for the building of technical schools, and the amounts actually drawn from the Local Loans Fund, we find that a considerable part of the moneys were not withdrawn.  I give now the estimate from the Department of Education of what it was expected would be withdrawn from the Local Loans Fund in relation to their allocations and the amount actually withdrawn.  We find that in the year 1949-50, £71,000 was allocated and £28,000 was withdrawn; in 1950-51, £216,000 was allocated and £58,000 withdrawn; in 1951-52, £237,000 was allocated and £138,000 withdrawn; in 1952-53, £255,000 was allocated and £160,000 withdrawn; in 1953-54, £285,000 was allocated and £128,000 withdrawn; in 1954-55, £208,000 was <Col N="1505" /> allocated and £178,000 withdrawn; and in 1955-56, £190,000 was allocated and £93,000 withdrawn.</P>
    <P>That implies that there is a considerable amount of work in the building of vocational schools that has been sanctioned and which has accumulated by way of arrears.  I made reference in my opening statement to this, to the extent that I said that I am afraid there will be, as a result of this, a clamour for going ahead with this work, just at a moment when the procuring of money to finance these and other capital works is a bit on the difficult side.  There was nothing more sinister in my remarks.  I merely referred to the existence of difficulties in finding money for this development at the moment, but our desire to find the money is as keen as ever it could be.  We realise very much how necessary it is and what is the importance of production in the country, and the importance of providing the facilities required in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition said that he understood it was not in order to teach agriculture in technical schools.  I do not know exactly what he had in mind as covered by agriculture, but rural science is a subject that, at any rate, is the basis of any subsequent instruction in agriculture. It could be regarded as teaching agriculture, and, around the teaching of rural science, has developed the discussion group idea which is, in fact, a very practical way of transferring information and developing interest in application.  With the machinery that is being provided, any practical or useful development in the teaching of agricultural science can be easily grafted on to the foundation that is there, subject to what may be done on the side of the Department of Agriculture as well.</P>
    <P>I have said that there was co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and ourselves in certain matters, and the Department of Agriculture are looking to the vocational education committee in certain areas to lend instructors in building construction for the purpose of instructing some <Col N="1506" /> of the Department of Agriculture's officers.  It may be recalled that a rather interesting development has taken place in certain counties in the work of building instructors, in that they actually go out, and, with the co-operation of the rural community, are building houses by grant from the local authority or the State.  The houses are built as class work and the group of men who want houses built co-operate to build one house after another.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of houses have been built in Culdaff, County Donegal, and in the Achill area, in a systematic and helpful way.  It is, perhaps, hoped to do something on the side of the Department in helping farmers to build their own outhouses and to give such instruction as that.  The idea is only in its development stage at the moment, but it is an indication of co-operation between the Department of Agriculture and the vocational education committees for doing good practical work; work of production, on the one hand, and making it a medium of good practical instruction on the other.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about technological development and the necessity for improving it.  The work of the vocational education committee in Dublin, and the basis on which it is set, has been commented upon very favourably, and properly so.  Recently a committee was set up, under that vocational education committee, to examine and report on technological training.  That report has reached the Department and will be fully examined to see what satisfactory developments can take place under the vocational education committee, to improve technological instruction.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of doubt and difficulty as to whether certain schools which are in process of completion in Dublin will be ready in time for the autumn.  I am advised that schools at Crumlin, Emmet Road, and Killester, will be in time for the autumn, and that the committee have overcome some of the financial difficulties with which they were faced.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Donegal Vocational Education Committee, raised by some of the Donegal Deputies, it is <Col N="1507" /> complained that they are not allowed add to their teaching staff and that they were squeezed down in their school development.  I had several conversations with groups from Donegal and I thought I had come to a rather satisfactory and progressive arrangement.  At the moment the Donegal Vocational Education Committee get from the Department £28,250 as compared with £18,750 from the local authorities and student fees are £950.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Department would not sanction a commercial teacher for the Dunfanaghey area because it was thought that it was not particularly desirable or urgent.  They also have had to decline to sanction two manual instructors and one rural science instructor.  They withheld sanction of the rural science teacher for the reason that there is no qualified teacher available at the moment. The matter will be considered again in October, when rural science teachers will be available.  The reason for not sanctioning the appointment of two additional manual instructors is that the committee's current income and expenditure is out of joint and it was felt that it is undesirable that the committee should be allowed to run into debt.  All of these matters are fully and sympathetically considered by the Department and there is no undue interference with, or turning down of practical proposals.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider revising the system of grants so that poorer areas might get a better allocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. There is a graduated system by which the poorer areas do get greater grants from the State and under which a city like Dublin gets a two to one grant.  That is arrived at traditionally out of the circumstances and expenses, and on careful examination, it will be found that it is an equitable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond complained that there was victimisation of certain people in relation to the preparatory <Col N="1508" /> colleges.  The position with regard to them is that 50 per cent. of the places are given to those with an 85 per cent. mark in oral Irish.  Fifty per cent. of that 50 are reserved for Gaeltacht children, which means that 25 per cent. is thus reserved for Gaeltacht children, provided they get 85 per cent. in oral Irish.  When you consider both what the people coming from the traditional Irish speaking homes have to give, on the one hand, and the extent to which they are without ordinary facilities for secondary education, on the other, and when you consider the general standard that is required for the examination, I do not think anybody, say, in Cork or Dublin, could complain that they are being victimised simply because that type of concession is given to people from Irish speaking districts.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Desmond who said that laboratory grants were rather small.  If you take experimental science in the preparatory classes of secondary schools, the grant is £16, irrespective of the number of pupils. In the intermediate classes, it is £16 for ten pupils or under; £25 for 11 to 24 pupils; and £30 for over 24 pupils. In leaving certificate classes, it is £20, £30 and £35 for corresponding classes, except in the cases of botany, physiology, and hygiene, for which the corresponding rates are £16, £20 and £22.</P>
    <P>I expect that the report of the Council of Education may call for a new slant on the general progress of science in secondary schools and I think it would be better to wait for the report.</P>
    <P>I think it was an Teachta Mac Pharthaláin who raised the question of the nautical colleges, and asked the reason why there was a decrease there.  There is a decrease of £4,170, but that is due to the fact that last year £3,300 was provided for non-recurring capital expenditure for the improvement and decoration of the college.  There is a small falling off in the grant required there by reason of the fact that the total number of hours of attendance has been somewhat reduced.</P>
    <P>The question of the reduction of the moneys available for the building of colleges in the Gaeltacht has also been <Col N="1509" /> raised.  Deputies will understand that there is no planned policy of setting out to build colleges in the Gaeltacht. What happened was that under the inspiration of Comhaltas Uladh, a body which has been doing very good work for many years, a grant was given to add to some money which they had of their own, to build a college in Rosguill and another in Teelin.  Then, following the very excellent work which was being done for some of the boys in Cork, a grant was given to have a college built in Ballinteigue and after that in Coolea.  They were examined on the merits and it was a case of helping those who, over a number of years, had shown they were able to help themselves and who were doing constructive work.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised as to the reduction in the grant for scholarships in the Gaeltacht.  That has a bearing on Coisde na bPáistí. The total amount voted to Coisde na bPáisti last year was not taken up and the amount that is made available this year may not even be taken up.  Last year, there was £1,600 allowed; this year the provision is £1,400.  That will meet the demands that will be made.  The demands arise out of the actual work that Coisde na bPáistí is doing.</P>

      <P>I want to commend a very satisfactory experiment carried out in Cork this year with the co-operation of the National Gallery authorities.  They lent a number of pictures from the national collection for a temporary exhibition in Cork.  It was a very successful venture.  I want to commend to the Minister for his consideration the proposal that this should be extended to the whole country.  We have a large number of pictures in the national collection which are not on permanent exhibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that what was done in Cork this year should be done in every other provincial centre where there are facilities for the showing of such pictures. This is a very important matter.  The collection is very fine and <Col N="1513" /> very valuable.  I was delighted to note how well attended the temporary exhibition was in Cork.  I think the Minister should indicate to the Director of the National Gallery that it is in the national interest, in the interest of our people and our students, that this collection of pictures should be more readily accessible to people in the provincial centres.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,485,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for 1956/57 amounts to £8,585,000 being a gross total of £9,108,150 less Appropriations-in-Aid of £523,150.  The net provision represents an increase of £592,500 on that for 1955/56.  As indicated on page 283 of the volume of Estimates that figure takes into account the additional provision for 1955/56&mdash; £85,000&mdash;made by the Post Office Supplementary Estimate and the Department's share&mdash;£200,500&mdash;of the Vote for Remuneration, both approved by the Dáil on the 22nd February last. In making comparisons between sub-heads of the Estimate this additional provision for 1955/56 has been taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>The more substantial variations&mdash; those of £10,000 or more&mdash;occur on the following sub-heads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Sub-heads A (1), A (2), A (3) and A (4)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances: The increase of £225,200 is due to salary and wage awards, offset by a reduction of one day in pay days and by savings on retirements.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Purchase of Sites, etc: Increase £26,000.  The higher amount is required mainly for the purchase of sites for a central garage, an engineering workmen's headquarters and stores depot in Cork, new District Post Offices in Dublin and a new South Dublin City Engineering headquarters.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1)&mdash;Conveyance of Mails by Rail: The increase of £30,100 is due to higher charges by the railway companies for the carriage of letter mails and to higher payment to the companies in respect of increased parcel traffic which is offset by increased revenue from the traffic.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (1)&mdash;Stores: the increase of £15,300 is mainly due to the transfer to this sub-head of the cost of petrol which was formerly borne on sub-head K.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H (3)&mdash;Incidental Expenses: the increase of £10,300 is mainly required to meet additional publicity for Savings the cost of which is recovered as an Appropriation-in-Aid, sub-head T (5).</P>
    <P>Sub-head I (1)&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances (Engineering): increase £13,000, arising from Salary and Wage Awards offset by a reduction of one day in pay days.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;Engineering Materials: the increase, £89,000, is due to reduced use of Emergency reserve stocks and to an increase in the Non-Capital Engineering programme, offset by the cost of petrol transferred to sub-head G (1).</P>
    <P>Sub-head L (2)&mdash;Contract Work: the increase of £35,600 is required for new equipment for the more economical working of the Telegraph service and for the renewal of equipment at Malin Head and Valentia Coast Wireless Stations.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments: increase, £104,074.  Funds for the development of the telephone system are provided under the authority <Col N="1515" /> of the Telephone Capital Acts (1924 to 1951) which authorise the Minister for Finance to issue sums out of the Central Fund for this purpose.  Repayment of these funds is made by means of terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance provision is made each year under sub-head M for the repayment of the instalments of principal and interest on the annuities created.  The increased provision in the sub-head is an indication of the continuing expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1) Superannuation Allowances, etc: the increase, £39,800, is mainly due to higher pensions, retirement allowances and marriage gratuities arising from salary and wage awards.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O (2) Civil Aviation and Meteorological Wireless Services: the increase, £32,400, is required for the provision of Radar equipment at Dublin airport and an emergency generator at Shannon airport.</P>
    <P>Sub-head T Appropriations-in-Aid: the increase of £28,274 is mainly due to anticipated increased receipts from the Social Insurance Fund and the Savings Bank Fund for administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>Postal Service: mail services worked satisfactorily during the year and a good standard of regularity and puncuality was maintained.  There was an upward trend in the volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>Letter traffic last Christmas again created a new record.  The public responded well to the Department's appeal for early posting.  As a result the huge volume of mail was handled expeditiously and that posted by the advertised dates was delivered before Christmas.</P>
    <P>In the foreign parcel post service the maximum weight limit was increased from 15lb. to 22lb. as from the 1st December 1955 with all countries which accept parcels up to the higher limit. This extension of the weight limit should prove of benefit to users of the post engaged in the export trade.</P>
    <P>The general reorganisation of postal delivery services in rural areas was <Col N="1516" /> continued.  A daily frequency of delivery and a better standard of service were provided in the head office districts of Bandon, Castlerea, Enniscorthy, Galway, Killarney and Tralee. The reorganisation of the Limerick head office district is well advanced and it is hoped this year to undertake the reorganisation of the services in the head office districts of Bantry, Castlebar, Ennis, Mallow, Waterford and Wexford.</P>
    <P>During the past year seven new sub-offices were opened and money order and Savings Bank facilities were extended to 19 existing sub-offices.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to issue a special postage stamp in connection with the presentation to the nation by the United States Battle Monuments Commission of a statue of Commodore John Barry which is to be unveiled in Wexford next September. The stamp will be issued in two denominations, 3d. and ? and will be produced by the recess process.</P>
    <P>Last year, following the report of a departmental committee, I circulated a White Paper to Deputies dealing with the problem of the increasing losses on the telegraph service.  It also outlined the measures proposed to be taken to reduce expenditure on the service and to increase telegraph revenue.  Most of these measures, including rate increases, either have been, or are being, implemented.</P>
    <P>There has, as anticipated, been a further decline in telegraph traffic, the number of telegrams handled during the last financial year being 2,860,000 as compared with 3,160,600 odd during the previous year.</P>
    <P>The modernisation of operating methods in order to secure economies is going ahead as rapidly as the necessary equipment can be obtained and brought into service.  A telegraph automatic exchange had already been installed in Dublin to enable teleprinter centres to exchange telegrams directly with each other or with any teleprinter centre in the Six Counties or Great Britain, thus eliminating a considerable volume of retransmission work.  Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford are already working through the new exchange.  The other <Col N="1517" /> offices will be connected to it according as line equipment on order is delivered and installed during the course of the next year.</P>
    <P>Savings in staff and increased revenue have already reduced the deficit by a fairly substantial amount, but there has been an offsetting rise in basic costs due to the general wage increase in November last.  The loss on the service is still of considerable magnitude and efforts to reduce it further will have to be continued and redoubled.</P>
    <P>A telex service, which enables subscribers to communicated directly with each other by means of tele-typed messages, was opened in Dublin in January last.  This kind of service had been developing rapidly abroad and there appeared to be prospects that firms here interested in adopting the most modern telecommunication methods would be interested.  The venture has been justified; there are already 30 subscribers and messages are being transmitted to and received from Great Britain, the Continent and distant parts of the world.  The initial installation of equipment is now being doubled to cater for more subscribers and traffic.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year it is proposed to inaugurate a greetings telegraph service which will make provision for the delivery on an ornamental form in a special greetings envelope of messages of greeting, congratulations, etc.</P>
    <P>The growth of the telephone service continued during 1955.  Trunk calls totalled 13,734,000, an increase of 7.5 per cent. over the 1954 figure.  Local calls increased by 5,000,000 to 88,000,000. A total of 7,841 subscribers' exchange lines and 10,203 new telephone stations were provided and 7,000 miles of new circuit were added to the trunk network. At 31st December last the number of effective waiting applications was about 4,200.  The latest estimate is 3,600.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin automatic area the recabling of the underground network has been proceeding as rapidly as available skilled staff resources have permitted and the scheme as a whole is now more than half-completed.  The <Col N="1518" /> central city business areas were tackled first and it is hoped that this part of the recabling scheme will be finished this year.  Underground schemes are also proceeding in the suburbs, but it will take a considerable time to reach all the suburban areas in need of relief.</P>
    <P>Of the total waiting applications only about one-third are in the area outside of Dublin and the bulk of these were made within the past year.  At most of the larger provincial centres, applications are attended to promptly or within a few months.  Considerable progress has been made in clearing arrears of long outstanding applications, involving abnormal work, which were deferred in favour of the rural call office scheme.  I am glad to say that this scheme has been completed apart from two offices which we hope to provide with telephones before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, some 7,000 miles of trunk circuits were added to the system during 1955.  These included additional circuits on some 200 main and other routes throughout the country.  The underground cable scheme to Sligo will be completed this month and there should be a considerable improvement in trunk services at exchanges along the cable route and in adjoining areas served by the cable. Additional circuits will be provided on a large number of other routes where relief is most needed.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, extensions of automatic equipment were carried out at Terenure, Rathmines, Clontarf and Ship Street exchanges and Lucan, Leixlip and Greystones manual exchanges were converted to automatic working.  Subscribers in the latter areas are now able to dial Dublin numbers.  A new permanent automatic exchange has recently been brought into service at Whitehall and temporary exchanges are being installed at Walkinstown and Nutley Lane in advance of permanent exchanges required to meet development in the surrounding areas.  A further development this year will be the conversion of Castleknock exchange to automatic working.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, new automatic exchanges have been brought into service at Mullingar and Cobh and at <Col N="1519" /> some smaller places.  Automatic conversion schemes at Drogheda, Sligo, Limerick and Longford are expected to be completed within the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>Extensions or replacements of switchboard equipment were carried out at 120 manual exchanges.  These works included installation of modern switchboard equipment at Ballina, Tralee, Monaghan and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The number of kiosks erected during 1955 was 69.</P>
    <P>As I explained at some length very recently on the Telephone Capital Bill, our telephone construction programme will have to be restricted while current capital difficulties persist.  I shall not take up the time of the House by covering the same ground again beyond saying that we will try to make the best use of the limited funds available for both urban and rural areas and that the position will be kept under continuous review so that normal development may be resumed as soon as circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>New departmental buildings were completed at Kilrush and Rathluire and others are nearing completion at Drogheda, Naas, Cootehill, Limerick and Sligo.  Schemes of extension and improvement, including the provision of new public offices, were completed at Ballina and Monaghan Post Offices. Improvements were also made at Cahir, Fermoy, Roscommon and Ballymote Post Offices and similar work is in progress at Carrick-on-Suir, Dundalk, Kilkenny and Longford Post Offices.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that work will start during the year on the erection of new buildings at Galway, Athenry, Letterkenny, Loughrea and Crumlin (Dublin). Improvement schemes at a number of other post offices and the erection of several small automatic exchange buildings are also scheduled to commence. Progress is being made in the planning of new post offices for Wicklow, Droichead Nua, Thomastown, Youghal and Callan and on schemes of improvements at Carrick-on-Shannon and Ennis.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently <Col N="1520" /> acquired a substantial property in Cork City which is to be used as a central garage and engineering workmen's headquarters and stores depôt.</P>
    <P>Preliminary sketch plans for the new Dublin Central Sorting Office have been agreed with the Commissioners of Public Works and an estimate has been worked out as to the cost of erecting and equipping the proposed buildings.  I am hopeful that the position will shortly be reached when it will be possible to commence the preparation of contract drawings.</P>
    <P>Deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank rose from £14,515,000 in 1954 to £15,401,000 in 1955 and withdrawals from £11,099,000 to £12,632,000, a net surplus of £2,769,000 as compared with £3,416,000 for the previous year.  Interest earned during the year is estimated at £1,677,000 and the total amount standing to the credit of depositors on the 31-12-1955 is approximately £71,186,000.</P>
    <P>Deposits during the year by the Trustee Savings Banks amounted to £1,208,000 and withdrawals to £756,000, an increase of £45,000 in deposits and £248,000 in withdrawals.  The balance to credit of the Trustee Savings Banks at the end of the year, including £310,000 for interest, is approximately £10,991,000.</P>
    <P>Appreciable amounts were withdrawn from the banks about the times of the opening of the C.I.E. and E.S.B. Loans floated in 1955 and it would appear not unlikely that these withdrawals were made for the purpose of reinvestment in these loans.</P>
    <P>The estimated combined balances, Post Office and Trustee Savings Banks, on 31-12-1955, amounted to £82,177,000 compared with £76,967,000 on the same date in 1954.</P>
    <P>Business for the year showed a decrease as compared with the previous year.  Receipts from sales amounted to £2,105,000, repayment of principal to £1,438,000 and interest to £478,000.  Corresponding figures for 1954 were £2,361,000, £1,318,000 and £445,000.  The decrease in sales was very probably due to the natural decline in purchases in the fourth year of the fifth issue.  As in the case of <Col N="1521" /> the increased withdrawals from the Savings Bank, the increase in repayments of certificates&mdash;judging from the time when they were sought&mdash;would appear to have been largely due to certificate holders investing in the E.S.B. Loan.</P>
    <P>The amount of principal due to investors at the end of the year stood at £13,646,000 compared with £17,976,000 at the end of 1954.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in staff relations in my Department which employs about half the civil servants in the State.  I am glad to say that the conciliation council which was set up under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Civil Service has contributed much towards maintaining and developing good relations between the Department and its staff.  The council has considered wage claims on behalf of nearly all the departmental grades in the Post Office and only a small number of cases had to be referred to the arbitration board.</P>
    <P>During the past year the council has reached agreement on increased wage rates for post office clerks, postal sorters, telephonists (male and female), boy messengers, cleaners, doorkeepers and a number of smaller grades.</P>
    <P>Consideration of wage claims is not the only purpose of the conciliation council and I have recently asked it to examine the question of staff redundancy arising out of the reorganisation of the telegraph service.  We have already taken some steps to meet the situation.  Recruitment to the clerk grade has ceased since 1952 and a number of officers previously employed on telegraph duties have been transferred to other work.  The problem is to absorb the redundants into alternative jobs with the minimum of hardship and disturbance to the staff concerned. It seems inevitable that some of the staff will have to be transferred and that the prospects of promotion for the clerk grade will be worsened. I have brought the matter before the departmental conciliation council in order that the Administration may have the benefit of the staff's views in trying to find the best solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> I have recently established a sub-postmaster's consultative council which provides a means of formal consultation between representatives of the Department and of the sub-postmasters' union on matters affecting the remuneration and conditions of service of sub-postmasters.  As sub-postmasters are not civil servants they are excluded from the scheme of conciliation and arbitration which was designed exclusively for, and is entirely confined to, serving civil servants.</P>
    <P>The revision of working methods generally in the Department with a view to increasing efficiency and reducing costs continues to receive close attention and some very worth-while results were obtained during the past year.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimate for the Department last year I referred to the overall deficit on the working for 1954-55 and estimated that it would show an appreciable improvement compared with the deficit for the previous year.  While the year's working did, in fact, result in an improvement this was not as substantial as had been anticipated. The overall deficit turned out to be £246,000, roughly £50,000 higher than expected.  The year's working was, of course, affected by the increased cost which had to be met in respect of wage increases secured by certain grades of the Department's staff, particularly postmen, through the conciliation and arbitration machinery, in connection with value of work claims.</P>
    <P>These claims are on behalf of particular grades on the grounds that their particular work is underpaid and are to be distinguished from the general cost-of-living claims put forward from time to time on behalf of civil servants generally.  Since the introduction of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service practically every grade in the Department coming within the scope of conciliation has made such a claim and each year some of them have been settled or arbitrated. The cost of these in 1954-55 amounted to £33,600.</P>
    <P>In the year 1955-56 the Department had to meet the full yearly cost of the previous year's conciliation and arbitration <Col N="1523" /> settlements which amounted to £126,000 and part of the annual cost of the awards on value of work and other purely departmental claims dealt with, amounting to £106,000. Furthermore, it had also to meet the cost-of-living increase in wages and salaries granted to the Civil Service generally which operated for five months from 1-11-1955 and amounted to £202,500.  As a result of these heavy increased staff costs, the overall financial position of the Department has very materially worsened.  For the year 1955-56 the deficit is estimated at £510,000, approximately, made up of:&mdash;</P>

    <P>These figures show that, whereas last year the deficit on the working of the telegraph service decreased by £70,000, the loss on the postal service increased by £250,000 and the profits on the telephone service fell by £81,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I am sure, agree that this serious disimprovement in the overall financial position of the Department could not have been allowed to continue.  Indeed, if steps had not been taken to halt it, the financial position at the end of the current year would have turned out to be substantially worse than for 1955-56 because the full yearly cost of the general Civil Service cost-of-living settlement, £491,000, has to be borne together with £125,000 in respect of value of work and similar claims settled last year.</P>
    <P>Having given very full and careful consideration to the problem, I satisfied myself that the Department's serious financial position could not be improved unless the services it affords to the public were drastically restricted or the charges for its services were increased.  Restrictions of services, to have any substantial effect on the loss would, however, have had to be very extensive.  They would have involved a very serious worsening of the facilities afforded to the public and the discharge of very large numbers of the staff.  For these reasons I was not prepared <Col N="1524" /> to restrict services and I was forced to the conclusion that the Department's charges would have to be increased.</P>
    <P>As regards the telegraph service, I considered the improvement in the deficit as satisfactory and I am hopeful that, with the reorganisation of the service and the more economical methods of working to which I have already referred, the improvement will be continued.  I decided, therefore, that, for the present at any rate, no increase in telegraph charges should be made.</P>
    <P>The growing postal deficit and the fall in the profit on the telephone service were, however, most disturbing, and to meet these I recommended to the Government that increases in certain of the charges for both services would have to be made.  Having considered the matter, the Government decided that there was no alternative but to increase charges in order that the Department's unsatisfactory financial position should be very substantially improved.  Increases in certain postal charges were accordingly introduced on the 4th June and revised charges for telephone calls on the 1st July.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation of the zealous and efficient services given by all grades of the staff during the past year.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being flippant I should like to thank Deputy Doyle who apparently is acting as chaperon to the Minister and myself in this otherwise deserted House. Apparently we have been left the job of getting through this Estimate almost entirely without assistance.  I want to say that I regard Deputy Doyle as a very excellent chaperon for myself and the Minister and I hope it is a position he will not often have to occupy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has brought his Estimate here to-day and I think we are in a rather different position to that in which we would normally be in discussing the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because the financial position of the country is very serious, in spite of what the Minister <Col N="1525" /> for Defence continues to say in various parts of the country.  The Government costs have gone up by £8,000,000.  The country itself is indulging in personal savings of only half the value of the 1953 savings.  The savings put into the Post Office have been entirely inadequate for the first three months of this year, and before the year is spent I prophesy that the country will experience the full effects of the reckless spending of our savings since the war.  We have only just begun to see the full result of what has taken place since 1947.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is a commercial service&mdash;I mean it should be, as far as possible, a commercial service.  It should try to pay its way.  It is a form of transport service of an essential character and it should set an example to the whole community of being efficiently and well run.  The three services, the telephone, telegraph and postal services lost some £680,000 between 1939 and 1952.  They have lost since then £1,500,000, and it is time that trend stopped.  It is time that the continual loss should be arrested and that the Post Office should be made to pay its way like any other commercial service.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the reasons for its not paying its way are of a purely sentimental and frivolous character which have been completely deflated by all the economic events in this State since 1947.  As I have said, we have not yet seen the results of sentimental attitudes towards all sorts of State developments, which have neither had the effect of allaying emigration nor of increasing production but have simply left this country in a financial mess.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister the policy of being as tough as he likes in regard to any efforts made to him to increase the losses on this service and to resist every appeal made to him to give something for nothing; to resist all appeals of a sentimental character, and all appeals, which under ordinary circumstances might be justified, but which would have the effect of increasing the losses.  Let him set an example to the other State Departments of saving money and saving more money; let him set an example <Col N="1526" /> of insisting on efficiency, of getting more work out of the officers in his service&mdash;getting them to do more work in order to make the service more efficient.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties to be faced is the fact that the Government, for its own reasons, has not set the example to the community of saving itself. They are spending some £8,000,000 more on current services than last year, while the Minister for Finance has gone around the country telling the people that, if they do not save money, there will not be any more capital services.</P>
    <P>I want to keep this issue clear of politics, at least in the case of the Post Office.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is now in a position to support the desire of the Minister for Finance and not to allow that loss to increase and to accept the position that greater production should bring greater receipts to the Post Office. When those greater receipts come to the Post Office, then he can see what he wants to do in the way of improving services that relate to production.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will examine everything in the postal, telegraph and telephone services which do relate to production.  If there is anything in the services which impedes production or makes exports too costly or slows down transport and communications for trade and for industry of any kind, let him examine those services and let him make any improvements that may be necessary.  It may be possible in certain cases that he may actually have to face some very small initial loss in improving a service which relates to the country's trade, but apart from that, I do give him every encouragement only to expand reproductive services&mdash;services that will ensure that this one Department of State, which for a number of years was able to show either a profit or no loss, in the future will be able to overcome the present deficit and to go ahead working on a proper commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the contrasting alternatives of C.I.E. on the one hand, with its progressive losses, and the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna on the other hand, who pay their way and <Col N="1527" /> who are examples of State bodies, which are able to operate, after, perhaps, an initial period, without losses. I hope he will not allow the postal, telegraph and telephone services to slip in the direction of C.I.E. and that he will keep as far away as possible from that position.</P>
    <P>In connection with the telephone service, I asked the Minister a question, around about the period when the Telephone Capital Bill was being discussed, in regard to the work of the industrial consultant.  The Minister gave a very general reply, but I would like to ask whether the major part of the recommendations, which had been placed before the chief engineer, shall we say, by early April, 1954, have now been implemented or what are the major types of proposal which are still left for decision?</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there were only two really difficult proposals requiring consideration by the Minister and his officers.  One was the change in the positioning of the district offices of the engineering services.  There was a proposal made to alter the districts.  It related to the fact that the Blessington telephone service, so far as I know, is still administered from Waterford; and that related to the travelling of inspectors along railway lines and to other factors which operated in the days before motor transport became available.  That was a difficult matter. It involved the consideration of personal interests such as the residence of engineers, the acquisition of buildings and all sorts of other matters.</P>
    <P>The other point that had to be considered was a more difficult one: the giving of an incentive bonus to certain types of engineering staff.  The Minister for Finance has been claiming that he will have an outside inquiry made into the efficiency of the Civil Service in general.  There is an air of desire to insist on economies in the State services and to make them more efficient.  I think it would be a splendid thing if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were to provide an incentive bonus to one section of his staff.  It would be one of the only examples of its kind, so far as I know, in Europe although <Col N="1528" /> I believe that the British Post Office grant certain incentive bonuses to staff.  The proposal may not be entirely practicable.  It was not possible for me to examine it in detail; in fact, I do not think it had been even fully presented at the time.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he intends setting a headline in regard to this desire for economy and efficiency by putting that proposal into operation so that for the first time some officers of his staff would be paid not only a basic salary but on the results they achieve.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to say a word about the work of the consultant and, in regard to general categories, how far his proposals were accepted.  One of the statements made by the consultant, and it appears quite natural to anyone with business experience, was that when workers were recruited for the lower grades of the engineering staff, it would appear to him that too high a percentage were retained permanently on the staff, and that, as in the case of a private concern, there was not the inevitable weeding out of the less efficient members.  I should like to ask whether that proposal has been accepted, that the Post Office engineering staff should adopt the standards of private companies when they recruit new workers and insist on efficiency, and that, in common with the general experience of private companies, there would be certain eliminations of people not showing efficiency who would be replaced by others.  That was one of the consultant's proposals which seemed to be wholly reasonable; that when persons join the service and become pensionable and enjoy the other privileges of State service, such persons should not be allowed to continue in the service, if after a two-or three-year initial period of trial, they are not going to be good servants of the State.</P>
    <P>There was nothing of unusually critical character in anything the consultant said.  In fact, one of the remarkable things about his work was the fact that, although he produced many reports, he made no report reflecting on the efficiency of the engineering staff and he could only make the same <Col N="1529" /> kind of suggestions as were made by him when dealing with a private company paying high profits and dividends.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what progress has been made in connection with the improvement of the telegraphic service and the reduction of costs.  I notice that the teleprinter service still seems to be slow in developing on a line from Dublin to Galway, and northwards.  Can the Minister explain why it is that the development of the teleprinter service in the northern part of the Twenty-Six Counties seems to be delayed?  I am glad that some progress is being made and I hope the Minister will press on with the work of reducing the loss on the telegraph service&mdash;a loss, which, of course, is being made good from elsewhere. If I remember rightly, the British Post Office, in spite of the higher density of population was at one time losing £5,000,000 per annum as compared with our £300,000 and they were forced to take measures to reduce that loss.  I hope that the Minister will try to get rid of that very big loss in his service.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on deciding to adopt greeting telegrams.  I hope that they will pay, as they have paid in other countries.  The inquiry in regard to them, if I recollect aright, started in 1951; it has taken a good while to produce them.  I hope that they will be tastefully designed and prove successful.  I hope that they will be properly advertised so that the Minister can be quite sure that he will not lose money by placing them in circulation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat everything I said on the Telephone Capital Bill in relation to the Minister's decision to accept the restriction of capital.  From the standpoint of making the telephone service snowball in profits, it is a very dangerous decision on the part of the Minister for Finance, just as, when the Minister for Finance put a tax on the oil used by the E.S.B., that was a very doubtful expedient from the point of view of ultimately saving money to the State or achieving a higher net revenue.  Equally, unless the Minister <Col N="1530" /> is very careful in any other restrictions on telephone development, he may only reduce the existing profit or prevent an increased profit being made. Then the Minister will find that he will have to subsidise the three services to a greater extent from the taxpayers' money by an amount almost equivalent to the interest and sinking fund.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister for Finance has worked out that problem properly.  I wonder has he worked it out even notionally, because it could very easily work the other way.  If there is restriction in development, the telephone service may not gather momentum as it should and as it has gathered momentum in every other country.  If it does not gather momentum, there will be less profits.  If there are less profits there will be higher taxation to make up the deficit and those higher taxes may equal the interest and principal on the amount of capital saved.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will get all the advice he can on that subject to ensure that this restriction of capital will not have the worst possible effect. I think it sets a bad example to the community.  State services that pay should not be restricted in their capital, even at the cost perhaps of some other form of capital service which may be more desirable socially but in relation to which, in the light of present events, the Minister should perhaps take a more realistic attitude. He should adopt a more realistic attitude towards this whole business and insist on a State service which is paying, will continue to pay and will, in fact, pay more.  Maybe we shall have to wait another year or two before people really come to appreciate what they will have to face in order to get over our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should like now to ask the Minister a question which he was unable to answer on the debate on the Telephone Capital Bill.  In connection with that Bill, the Minister gave as one of the examples of restriction in capital development the slowing-down in the development of automatic exchanges in the smaller towns.  I asked him at that time&mdash;it was difficult for him to reply then&mdash;whether or not I was right in <Col N="1531" /> thinking that the decision to delay the provision of automatic exchanges in towns of 4,000 to 7,000 inhabitants was made before there was any restriction on capital and on a basis of purely intelligent development?  As I understand it&mdash;I want to repeat this so that the Minister can perhaps give me a reply now&mdash;when there was a no-delay service in Drogheda and Dundalk, Dundalk being a new automatic exchange and Drogheda somewhat older, there was no greater increase in the number of local subscribers in Dundalk than in Drogheda and there was no greater increase in the number of trunk calls made in the Drogheda exchange as compared with Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The savings in salaries, therefore, were not nearly equivalent to the capital cost and sinking fund involved in providing the exchange&mdash;I understand the decision was made and confirmed by the present Minister&mdash;and if that is so, it would be more economic to wait until a large number of smaller exchanges around the area can be automatised at the same time.  We would have to wait until the total volume of traffic reached a certain level and, when it reached that level, then this conversion could be undertaken. In the meantime subscribers would have a relatively good no-delay service and an efficient service.  The telephone service cannot afford the piecemeal construction of automatic exchanges in rural districts.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, that decision was made before the restriction on capital. Will the Minister tell me now whether that is the case or whether the matter was reconsidered and he decided to go ahead with the automatic exchanges, and then decided to cancel them because of restriction of capital?  As I have said, that was a matter that interested me very much.  I did not like to postpone the growth of small automatic exchanges in the country districts and, yet, I felt the facts showed that, in the long run, the service would be cheaper and better if a larger area were automatised.</P>
    <P>I know that the Dublin central sorting office is grinding its way slowly towards fruition.  I believe the plans <Col N="1532" /> for that office started some time about 1949, or ten years prior to this.  I see that now at last there are certain plans drafted by the Office of Public Works.  I hope that the Minister will be able to speed up the development of the central sorting office.  The Pearse Street office is not exactly a credit to the nation.  It is a pretty appalling place to work in.  I would like the Minister to say how many years he thinks will elapse before whoever is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, be it he or anybody else, officially opens the sorting office in Amiens Street.  It has been a very long time coming to a head.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that over successive years of negotiation the remuneration of the postal staff has been improved. I think that every Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has always felt in his heart that the remuneration of postmen was shockingly low for the financial responsibilities they had.  I am glad to see that the final result has been at least some improvement in the pay of these men.  It is interesting to recall that in 1939 a third-class postman was paid 36s. 9d. at 21 years of age and, in time, he reached the glorious maximum of 59s 6d.  Now a third-class postman begins, at 21 years of age, with £5 16s. 4d., and reaches a maximum of £7 15s. 7d.  That is still a very modest salary compared with even unskilled labourers in certain areas in Dublin.  I realise it will be very difficult to improve the position still further in view of the present financial stress.  But I am glad we have been able to reach at least that level.  A postman in a first-class office has a maximum of £8 10s. 7d.</P>
    <P>I hope some steps will be taken with regard to other grades of staff.  I am glad to hear that the conciliation work is proceeding satisfactorily.  I hope the Minister will be able to devise new methods of improving the efficiency of the service and of enabling postmen to gain something from new methods of speeding up the deliveries of letters. If the Minister could devise new methods of speeding up deliveries then of course in common with all modern industries run on modern principles the postmen should be able to share in the improvements effected by way of increased remuneration.  I <Col N="1533" /> found as a result of experiments in deliveries by light cars and motor-cycles that we did not get very far, but I wonder whether these experiments have been carried out with sufficient determination.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in view of the new types of transport now available he still has under consideration the provision of more mechanised transport for postmen and whether he thinks it would be successful.  We have many new types of motor transport available including motor-cycles and scooters. There are over 1,000,000 people in Italy using scooters; they make a horrifying noise but at least all these new types of transport are available.  I think the Minister should have experiments conducted particularly in the rural areas to see whether these forms of transport could be utilised to give greater efficiency and to speed up deliveries.  If these experiments are successful the postman might then gain by increased remuneration as is the case with other workers in modern factories run on modern principles.  I should like to ask the Minister to say whether he will try some experiments on these lines.  Experiments could also be carried out in other directions.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which arises annually on these Estimates and that is the question of the proportion of postmen on the permanent staff as compared with the auxiliary postmen. I know the Minister has great difficulties even when he tries to increase the number of postmen in a given area. A revision arrangement takes place to improve the service at no greater cost and that frequently occurs in cases where an effort is made to replace an unestablished man by an established man.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has been able to make greater progress this year than in other years in arriving at a solution of that problem.  I have always felt and every Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has felt that the number of unestablished postmen is too large and is not what one would wish to have in a modern Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the continuance of the <Col N="1534" /> arrangement under which sub-postmasters are appointed on a nonpolitical basis and on adhering to the proposals made to him by the committee. I am quite sure that in the long run we shall all be glad of that system and that it will prove satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has anything in mind in regard to savings but I hope that the Minister, with the Minister for Finance, will endeavour to provide more imaginative propaganda.  I understand that the grant has been increased for the director of savings.  It seems to me that still greater efforts need to be made to carry out imaginative propaganda. I understand a new savings committee has been appointed.  I do not know whether it is entirely under the direction of the Minister for Finance or whether the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has some function in the matter, but, so far as the number of savings groups established is concerned, it does not seem to me that they have proceeded very far.  It would seem to me, if we are going to get some results from the savings campaign, something will have to be done about it.  The director of savings will have to be given further encouragement or inspiration to go ahead with the savings campaign.  At the moment we just have the radio campaign, that is the Radio Éireann sponsored broadcast, which I think could be changed in character from time to time to give it greater interest.  We have also the poster campaign but I think a great deal more could be done.  I think there will have to be much more imaginative propaganda; one could make dozens of proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I have to say at this late hour because as I have already stated one could make many suggestions for the improvement of the service in the interests of the taxpayer.  I am not going to be hypocritical and charge the Government with not carrying out expensive schemes for the improvement of the service at a time when we cannot afford it and when we have to have one common determination to improve the financial position.  This is a time when the one commercial <Col N="1535" /> Department of the State can set an example for the rest of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to endorse what has been said by Deputy Childers, and what I said when I first set foot in the Post Office, namely that the Post Office has to pay its way.  I am still convinced that as it is giving a useful service, the Post Office ought to be able to pay its way. If we were a commercial firm, we could have cut off services that did not pay, completely and entirely, but we are a national service, the best we can do is to make an effort to cut our losses.  We have some items on which there are losses as, for instance, the telegraph service, which has been run at a loss for many years.  It is, however, a service which is essential and all we can do is to reorganise it.  If we were a commercial firm we could completely cut out that service.  Instead we have provided a good telephone service to replace it.</P>
      <P>I endorse everything that Deputy Childers has said to the effect that we must pay our way, and, if we do not pay our way, we should get the money from the people who use the services and not from the taxpayers.  I can assure Deputies that we are aware of our responsibility to the taxpayers and the nation.  I can assure Deputy Childers that there is a very efficient system in operation in the Post Office and the best possible efforts are being made to operate the services as economically as possible.</P>
      <P>We have had to cope with circumstances outside our control such as the increases of wages given to staffs&mdash;in common with others in the Civil Service&mdash;and the increasing costs of materials.  Although we have been set back by the difficulty of getting the capital we needed for capital works, we are, nevertheless, not going to be diverted from our original plans.  Some will have to be deferred and others may have to be modified until times get better.  For instance, we may have to abandon the idea of putting in automatic telephone systems in some places for which they had been planned originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will just have to go more slowly <Col N="1536" /> in the direction of expansions and that is the worst that will happen from the lack of capital.  There will be no reduction in the way of current employment, but the people we are hoping to employ on an expanded programme may not be employed.  We are not going to reduce or worsen services, and we will keep them up to date.</P>
    <P>We are not going as fast as we would like with the telegraph reorganisation, particularly in the West, but that is partly due to lack of equipment.  Some of the equipment is on order and will be delivered in a few months.  Development is held up because we have to await deliveries.</P>
    <P>The reports from the industrial consultants covered the whole field of our engineering methods and organisation. The reports are under examination and many matters in them have to be discussed with the trade unions.  The incentive bonus suggestion is under consideration.  The recommendations of the consultants where accepted will be given effect as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On the question of motorised transport, various problems arise.  If we had to deliver only along long straight roads, motorised transport might be the answer to our problems but our country is such that we have many by-roads and boreens which also have to be serviced.  A man living on a by-road on the side of a hill has got to be serviced and it is not easy to do that by means of motorised transport. The problem of delivery is complicated by the existence of so many by-roads. We must have men on foot to go up the boreens.  Motor transport is however, being used as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The sorting office was mentioned and I do not think I can say a word more than what I said in my speech, that we are moving towards providing the the Dublin sorting office.  Preliminary sketch plans for the new sorting office have been agreed with the Commissioners of Public Works and an estimate has been worked out of the cost of erecting and equipping the proposed building.  I am hopeful that the position will shortly be reached when it will be possible to commence the preparation of contract drawings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> On the question of establishing postmen and other temporaries, I agree with Deputy Childers as to the desirability of establishing as many as possible and we have been working in that direction.  Steps have been taken to try to eliminate some of the more lowly paid posts, to try to make the posts more economic and to have established as against unestablished men. The departmental conciliation council is considering the problem of establishment in relation to all grades.</P>
    <P>On the question of savings, the Minister for Finance set up a committee last December with the object of organising a campaign for promoting savings generally.  The responsibility lies with the Minister for Finance, but I can assure the House that my Department is co-operating as fully as possible.  The savings campaign is a national campaign to meet a national necessity and we are gladly co-operating with the committee.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can assure Deputy Childers again that no effort will be spared in the Post Office to get it back to a position where it will pay its way. We are striving to put it on a paying basis, notwithstanding the difficulties of the present times, and I am hopeful it will not be long before we do get it back.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £287,000 be granted to complete the sum <Col N="1538" /> necessary to defray the Charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for salaries and other expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including public concerts.</P>
    <P>This is the annual stocktaking of the broadcasting service.  I say annual advisedly, because members of all Parties in the House have continued to observe the gentlemen's agreement entered into in connection with the reorganisation of Radio Éireann in 1953 to refrain from putting down questions about details of broadcasting activities, and to confine their inquiries to matters of substance or general policy.  In 1953-54 there were 34 parliamentary questions about broadcasting.  In 1955-56 there were only 11.  This did not prevent Deputies from getting any information they wanted from the Director, but the absence of Party sniping about sins of commission or omission in the news bulletins or in other speech programmes has had a tremendously good effect on the standard of Radio Éireann.  It enabled news bulletins and talks to be prepared and broadcast quite objectively without the fear that they would be held to be supporting one Party or the other.  I hope Deputies will say that they agree with me on that point.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Estimate, in accordance with normal arrangements the amount voted for the working operations of Radio Éireann corresponds to the estimated amount of receipts from licence and sponsored programme fees, with some smaller additional receipts from such sources as concerts.  The anticipated licence receipts in the current financial year are £411,000 and from sponsored programmes and miscellaneous receipts £93,400.  The total in sub-head A of the Estimate is £510,900 which approximates to the sum of the receipts.  The subsidy for equipment in sub-head B is £13,000. The sponsored programmes are keeping at a very steady level.  All the time permitted for these programmes has been constantly filled except for short breaks while new contracts were being prepared.  Of course the Hospitals' Trust, which broadcasts for half an hour each night of the week, provides <Col N="1539" /> the largest single contribution to sponsored programme revenue.</P>
    <P>The licence receipts are still increasing, the estimated number for this year being 470,000; that is 15,000 higher than the estimate for 1955-56. The bulk of listeners pay the licence fee promptly without any special pressure, but I must again complain about a fairly substantial minority.  I am not referring to the people who forget to take out their annual licence in time.  That will happen to anybody, and reminders are sent.  I am speaking of the people who deliberately decline to take out any licence.  In a special campaign taken in 1948, there were 70,000 people who had radio sets, but ignored their responsibility for the small fee.  In another campaign in 1952, 30,000 people were found without licences.  One would have thought that the &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; situation would have been cleared up in these two special drives and in the ordinary inspections which are taking place every year.</P>
    <P>As a result of the last special campaign which took place early this year a further 16,000 new licences were taken out.  My Department has no patience with people who deliberately flout their obligation for the sake of 4d. a week, which they would pay for a single Sunday newspaper, and prosecutions have to follow discovery in such cases.  Early this year the Oireachtas passed an Act amending the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, in order to remove doubts which had been raised about the powers to issue licences and collect licence fees in respect of wireless sets in vehicles.</P>
    <P>There are one or two general matters with which I would like to deal before I refer to programme activities.  A proper broadcasting headquarters is, of course, still a major need, but the heavy cost of providing it will, I am afraid, defer the matter for some time further.  In the meantime, we are carrying out such improvements as are possible in the existing accommodation. A continuity suite has been provided in the G.P.O. and has been in operation for a few months.  All programmes from the 11 studios in the G.P.O., from outside studios in Dublin, and from programme sources anywhere <Col N="1540" /> in Ireland or abroad now go to the transmitters through that control point.  A continuity announcer has been provided to watch the programmes in transmission, to fill any gaps that may occur owing to underruns, programme failures, emergencies, etc.  This new suite has enabled both the technical and announcer staff to supervise the current and following programmes in a way that was not possible before.</P>
    <P>A scheme of improvements in the Phoenix Hall Orchestral Studio has been completed except for the installation of equipment in the Control and Announcer's booths.  It has been found necessary, however, to exclude audiences from the hall for what I hope will be only a temporary period. Within the past year or two a couple of rather serious fires occurred in premises in the vicinity of the hall, and the Radio Éireann officials are now examining the position, in consultation with the Dublin Corporation and the Office of Public Works, to see to what extent it will be safe to permit the public to be present at concerts.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting studios in Cork, which are incorporated in the new School of Music, are nearing completion so far as the building work is concerned, but it will take some months to lay internal cables for the broadcasting equipment and to install the equipment itself.  We hope, however, that the studios will be ready to open at least by the end of the present financial year.  I shall now say a few words about the main programme activities.</P>
    <P>A broadcasting service which is adequately organised and efficiently run must be able to meet the demands both of the ordinary day-to-day programme and the extraordinary festival or anniversary.  Radio Éireann meets the festivals and the anniversaries in the course of its work and comes, I think, rather well out of the test. There were, in the year of broadcasting on which I am looking back, tests of this sort in the very different fields of religious observance, national commemoration and tourist effort, and it is a reasonable claim that they were met by Radio Éireann with professional <Col N="1541" /> competance and flexibility.  I am thinking, as Deputies will probably have guessed, of the Holy Week programmes, of those commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Rising of 1916, and of those in which the Tóstal was mirrored on the one hand and given a broadcasting expression on the other.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might linger for just another minute on this point, since few things demonstrate the advance which we may say Radio Éireann continues to make, better than the response it makes to special calls upon its ingenuity.  The Pageant of Cúchulainn in Croke Park was, this year, as was the Pageant of Saint Patrick last year, remodelled from an open-air visual entertainment into a pure broadcasting show.  The international events in Cork&mdash;foreign choirs and film festival&mdash;were covered in newsbulletins and feature programmes; the Currach Races in Galway were highlighted on the air: in a word, Radio Éireann bound together the Tóstal events of the four provinces.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting here that one of the great advances made by Radio Éireann in the past few years has been in the gaining of additional mobility&mdash;and I would ask Deputies who think that Dublin gets too big a slice of the broadcasting cake to note this carefully. Apart altogether from the fact that the number of local correspondents contributing news-stories has been greatly increased in recent years, the mobility of the headquarters staff is now such that not a week passes without the representatives of Radio Éireann appearing in a dozen towns and villages of Ireland.  Many of the Deputies will have had personal experience of these &ldquo;flying columns of modern Ireland&rdquo; and I need not, therefore, go into details about their work.  I may just mention as one development, however, the quite extraordinary revival of traditional music which is going on at present: and it is freely conceded that the regular broadcasts from Radio Éireann's special recordings constitute a primary factor in the revival.</P>
    <P>Traditional music is, by and large, an entertainment for and by the countryman; and there was a time, before <Col N="1542" /> broadcasting, when variety or music-hall&mdash;or, as the Americans call it, vaudeville, was a cityman's amusement. Possibly it still is more a townsman's than a countryman's pleasure; but the countryman among our listeners has shown that, provided his special tastes are given due consideration, he will respond as cordially as the programme-planners could wish.</P>
    <P>As I said last year, Deputies, or many of them, will know as much about programmes as I do, since I have followed my principle of nonintervention in the daily affairs of Radio Éireann: so you are aware that in this very important sphere of popular entertainment Radio Éireann attempts many different things.  I will mention only two, selecting them because Deputies will have a special interest in them.  I mean that an effort is made to enable professional artistes to earn a due reward for their talents, and, at the other end of the scale, that an effort is continuously made to come upon every grain of talent among the young.  From Jimmy O'Dea in &ldquo;Meet the Mulligans!&rdquo;  or Din Joe or Joe Lynch on their respective platforms, from these to the young soprano or accordion-player in &ldquo;Beginners Please&rdquo; is a far cry: but, &ldquo;Beginners Please&rdquo; is going to Galway and Cork and Drogheda and so on, seeking and finding talent, and in this way it is, like the show built entirely on professionals, doing a national job.</P>
    <P>A national job of a very different sort is done in the Thomas Davis Lectures, with which many of you will be familiar.  The steadily-growing attention which is given to these broadcasts, with their always serious and often difficult matter, is most gratifying.  The newspapers are now beginning to compete for permission to print certain of the lectures, though their length is somewhat greater than newspapers usually handle.  The recent series, on &ldquo;The Shaping of Modern Ireland&rdquo; had, of course, many special points of interest, and this series has had a particular success.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need specify in any great detail what Radio Éireann is doing for music: last year's debate showed that Deputies were well aware <Col N="1543" /> of the activities of the music department&mdash;the symphony concerts, proms and tours included; the assistance to opera companies and festival promoters; the development of such groups as the Radio Éireann Singers and the like.</P>
    <P>I might just mention one prolonged series which shows how resources are concentrated for an important purpose. In &ldquo;Round the Counties&rdquo; we have had, every week for well over a year, the songs and music of one county after another talked about, sung and played.  Only those who engage in such a task will know the difficulties; but those who listen must know that they would not readily find such matter elsewhere.  The Radio Éireann Choral Society, a voluntary group of about 80 singers, supplemented as required by the staff singers, did a number of excellent broadcasts during the year, including Mozart's Mass in C Minor which was not previously done in this country for a long time&mdash;if ever.</P>
    <P>I might add a word at this point about the recruitment of professional instrumentalists.  There are at present 65 Irish players (including temporary players) and 32 continental players in the two Radio Éireann orchestras.  If highly qualified musicians cannot be got for the orchestras at home they must be got elsewhere.  The availability of suitable Irish players is a teaching problem.  It is not a Radio Éireann job to teach but, of course, the Director of Broadcasting is very interested in the teaching facilities provided.  I am glad to say that because of steps taken in recent years in the Royal Irish Academy of Music, and the Municipal School of Music, the situation has improved very much, particularly as regards violin and viola teaching.  During the past five years Radio Éireann employed 27 players, mostly young string students of the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Municipal School of Music, either in a full-time capacity, or part-time for students who were still completing their studies.  The number employed included, however, a small number of wind players, mainly men who had been members of the Army School of Music.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> Some of the young players have since left Radio Éireann, either to continue their studies abroad, or because they got married, but there is still a good number in the orchestras. Before that time Radio Éireann would have been lucky to get two or three players of sufficient standard for the orchestras in the five years' period. That is a remarkable change for the better.  Five of the continental members of the Radio Éireann orchestras are employed as part-time teachers in the academy, and the Municipal School of Music, principally to teach wind instruments, and others are teaching privately.  The situation about violin teaching is now, I think, on a firm foundation, although all the Radio Éireann vacancies cannot yet be filled at home, but the position as regards wind players can still only be described as bad.  Radio Éireann cannot get suitable players in these instruments and must continue to engage them from abroad.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, this is a teaching problem, and I admit it is a difficult one, because in the ordinary course the number of students for wind instruments is very much smaller than for instruments like the violin which can be played as a solo instrument in the domestic circle.  However, teachers are now available for most of the wind instruments in the music schools, and between Radio Éireann and the Army School of Music there should be a good &ldquo;market&rdquo; for the finished students.  I earnestly hope the teaching institutions will be able to overcome the difficulties that exist about the maintenance of wind classes.  Radio Éireann will be glad to co-operate in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Last year Radio Éireann broadcast a series in the Irish language which was the longest continuous series of Gaeltacht broadcasts ever achieved. They were greatly relished by lovers of the language and, this year, I am glad to say, Radio Éireann is going one better.  You will, I hope, forgive me for referring to programmes still to come, but I am anxious to illustrate further the idea that the increased mobility, and hence its coverage of the country, is the chief advance which has been made in broadcasting here <Col N="1545" /> in the past few years.  For some weeks now, programme officers of Radio Éireann have been making their way to the islands of the Gaeltacht, accompanied by technicians and bringing with them recording equipment; and in another few weeks listeners may hear Aran, Tory, Clare Island, Cape Clear Island and other outposts of the language talking to the country through the tape-machines of Radio Éireann.  That is a great step forward, and I need not argue about it.</P>
    <P>I said on the Broadcasting Estimate last year that I proposed to have investigations made as to whether the use of V.H.F. transmitters would solve the problem of poor reception in certain parts of the country.  Since then an experimental test transmitter has been obtained and transmission tests are being carried out from high hills in various parts of the country.  These tests will, however, take a considerable time to complete as the shadows cast by almost every hill of any considerable size in the country will have to be taken into account in determining suitable transmitter locations.  The advantages of placing transmitters on high mountains will have to be balanced against the cost of providing roads and power to such places.</P>
    <P>Discussion of broadcasting inevitably raises the question of the establishment of a television service here.  As I have indicated previously, my Department has been keeping in close touch with developments in television so that we may have a body of reliable information on the subject.  Naturally, the possibility of having a television service of our own has been constantly in our minds.  The major obstacle has been the costs involved.  Apart from the heavy capital costs, there would be very heavy running costs for a number of years at least.  Moreover, unless prohibitive expense were incurred in providing a national network from the start, only partial coverage from a station in or near Dublin could be given initially.</P>
    <P>That was the position when there was no question of a shortage of capital moneys for essential and desirable capital requirements.  To-day, when <Col N="1546" /> we are having the greatest difficulty in procuring money for housing, agricultural development, etc., we are even less favourably placed to entertain seriously considerable public expenditure on a television service.  Moreover, the Government must have regard also in present conditions to the nature of the additional expenditure by the public which the establishment of a television station here would certainly encourage.  A boom in television sales &mdash;which would inevitably follow the establishment of a local station&mdash;would mean increased imports of luxury goods, to the detriment of the national economy, and a reduction in personal savings on which a continuance of the capital programme for national development depends.  For these reasons the Government has decided not to establish a television service while present financial difficulties persist.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided not to accede to certain proposals which have been received to set up commercial television stations here.  At present the establishment of a commercial station would be open to the objections I have already mentioned of encouraging an undesirable kind of spending.  Moreover, the Government is satisfied that any television service in this country should be one based on public ownership and management.  In our circumstances any service established would, for obvious reasons, be a monopoly service, and apart from the general objection to entrusting any monopoly to private interests, there is a particular objection to doing so in such an important medium as television.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that there is no prospect at the moment of having a television service here&mdash;we simply cannot afford it.  If and when television does come, it will be a public service of some kind, probably integrated with the present sound broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the House that the Government have been looking into the question of whether Radio Éireann should be set up as a fully statutory public service broadcasting organisation.  At present I can only <Col N="1547" /> say that the matter is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>To conclude my statement I wish to thank the members of Comhairle Radio Éireann for the close attention they have given during the year to matters of policy, and the director and his staff for carrying out this exacting, practically non-stop service without any serious hitches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word of commendation to the director and council of Radio Éireann for the many pleasant programmes they have produced during the past year.  The improvement has been so great that one's standard of criticism also increases.  I hope that everything will be done to improve still further the programmes in the coming year.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a comment to the Minister in relation to the persons who now form the council.  When I obtained the consent of my colleagues for the establishment of the council, I made it very clear, both in this House and to the persons concerned, that it would not be one of those perpetual councils.  Every member of the council understood that, if he was replaced at the end of two years, it would be no reflection against him.  I made it absolutely clear in two successive speeches that, whatever other councils existed in this State and no matter how frozen the members thereof were, there would be some innovation in this connection.</P>
      <P>In a service like Radio Éireann where innovation, new ideas, speculative ideas, are the life and soul of the whole business, I think the council should be one whose members could frequently be changed, however good they might be.  So far as I know, all the members of the council have done extremely well. They have been of very great service to the director.  They have all worked harmoniously.  The council consist of persons of widely different views, ideas and standpoints.  Nevertheless, I think there ought to be an element of innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to take his courage into his hands and carry out what were my original wishes, namely, <Col N="1548" /> that the members of the council would change from time to time.  The Minister could make a commendation whenever there was a change.  He could refer to the good service of the person who was replaced.  I am quite sure that all the members of the present council clearly understood from me that they were not there for a long period and that what was needed was innovation, imagination, changes of ideas, with the object of helping the director and his officers. I hope it will not be taken that I have any criticism to make of the council. In connection with this service, something different from the ordinary is needed.  Directors continue to be renewed in the case of certain State companies.  Political nominees are frequently replaced only for political reasons by successive Governments.  I do not mean anything of that kind.  I am sure the Minister will continue to show them the impartiality of which he is capable in any new selections he makes.</P>
    <P>So far as the development of Radio Éireann is concerned, I wish the Minister would be able to think along the lines of increasing the educational service of Radio Éireann.  We have just concluded a debate on education, on which the Council of Education reported that the present primary school programme is insufficient for the people.  We had a report from a large number of primary pupils who were not able to complete the primary course of education.  We have the Commission on the Institute of Agriculture, consisting of farmers, professors and others, who insist that there should be far more adult education in relation to country life and farm life and the development of agricultural production.  The committee that made that proposal was a very representative one.</P>
    <P>On all sides we hear demands for more and more education.  No one ever contests the statement I make, and no one contested it in the course of the Estimate just passed, that we have the worst technical education and post-primary education of any country in Northern Europe at the present time.  We have the fewest facilities, <Col N="1549" /> fewest number of teachers, fewest number of buildings and the fewest number of pupils.  The very good efforts made by certain trade unions for the extension of education for their workers is only a drop in the ocean compared with what is given to people in Denmark, Holland, Belgium and so forth.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann offers an extensive field for that purpose.  I know there have been some broadcasts of an educational character, but there is an immense opportunity there, and I venture to say that providing a proper series of educational broadcasts would be cheaper than providing the teachers and buildings for them, even with all the difficulties of having to instruct existing teachers to educate pupils through radio educational teaching. Nevertheless, the project is worthy of consideration.  If the Minister for Education has to increase educational expenses, as I am perfectly certain he has, regardless of what that may mean financially, I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should encourage Radio Éireann to enter more into the picture.</P>
    <P>I know the deficiencies of broadcasting education.  Nevertheless, it has succeeded in many countries.  Education by television and broadcasting has extended enormously in the United States and a great number of universities and colleges have their own completely independent broadcasting system&mdash;in some cases paid for by wealthy sponsors and in other cases by State funds.  It is a new and inevitable means of education that is going ahead and we need to have far more done about it in this country.</P>
    <P>That is my principal criticism.  I was unable to succeed in making any change in my time any more than the Minister has up to now, but I hope the Minister, with this tremendous pressure for education from all sides, will succeed where I did not, in extending and promoting the educational services of Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>We have too little history taught to our people and very little appreciation of the country's needs.  In every other country, the young people are <Col N="1550" /> getting basic training in the agricultural needs of the country, the agri cultural productivity of the country and of what country life should be and all the ideals of a good, rural civilisation. The whole of that is taught as a regular subject in a great number of countries which compete with us on the foreign market.  There is a very good moral reason for this rural teaching, quite apart from any other trade reasons, as the Minister knows.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to think about the use of television and of radio for educational purposes. Tastes differ very greatly and there are a lot of people who object to the sponsored programmes because of the music played in them.  I made it clear that the sponsored programmes would have to be more varied.  I should like to congratulate the Director of Radio Éireann, through the Minister, on the greater variety of sponsored programmes. We no longer have two hours of Tin-Pan Alley raucous jazz as we had one time.  There is now a great variety of programmes and I should like to hope that the Minister would encourage the director to go still further.  The longer the waiting list for the sponsored programmes, the more pressure can the director exercise to insist on variety programmes, imaginative ideas producing the programmes so that we can get away from continuous jazz which, I think, eventually becomes boring even to those who love to hear jazz.  There has been an improvement and I hope it will continue even still further.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish music, I noted during the year the number of programmes giving traditional music, and I note in the Minister's statement the plans for the future.  I still think that not nearly enough is being done to popularise Irish music amongst those who are beginning to be even ignorant of its nature.</P>
    <P>We have a number of associations encouraging traditional music and one of them has had considerable success at various concerts throughout the country.  There is a whole group of people in this modern age who do not entirely appreciate songs sung in a traditional way.  A great many more <Col N="1551" /> arrangements could be made in respect of Irish traditional music and song.  I do not mean arrangements of a vulgar character, but arrangements which can be appreciated by the ordinary young person.</P>
    <P>Irish music will continue to lose interest among our community and I think Radio Éireann should spend still more money on preparing arrangements of folk songs of every type&mdash; arrangements for voice, trios, quartets, light popular orchestras and arrangements of every kind, with a view to popularising Irish music among the younger generation.  A great many of the young people do not want to listen to music sung in its original form. That may be wrong, but there it is.</P>
    <P>There are still volumes of melodies and traditional songs in the Irish manuscripts of the Folklore Commission's archives which ought to be brought out and popularised, so that not 20 per cent. but 100 per cent. of the young generation will appreciate them. I am afraid it is true to say that traditional music and songs are more appreciated in countries like Germany and Italy and other such countries than they are here because of the tremendous Anglo-American movement here, with its influences.  I suppose we cannot prevent that, but in these countries there were a great number of arrangers of these tunes.  Composers like Strauss, Lehar, and a great many others too numerous to mention, popularised and perpetuated the folk rhythm music of these countries.  We have to do that here.</P>
    <P>I do not simply mean the nineteenth century Irish type of song which is being very much overdone, songs such as the &ldquo;Rose of Tralee&rdquo; which, though very pleasant, have a very limited field from the point of view of real traditional music.  I mean all sorts of songs and music which are rarely heard.  I hope that work will continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to hope that the Radio Éireann Choir would travel more.  The orchestra travelled very successfully. The light orchestra, so far as I can gather, has ceased to travel and the Radio Éireann Choir either travels very little, or not at all.  I <Col N="1552" /> would hope that the radio choir would travel because Radio Éireann cannot only use the broadcasting medium&mdash;it has to advertise itself by appearing, so to speak, at events where the players themselves perform. That is inevitable in a small country like ours where we will have such difficulty in preserving our native culture and where our development of a free country is of very recent date.</P>
    <P>I should like to hope that the radio choir would therefore travel more frequently than it does.  I have not seen it in my constituency at all.  I should like to think that the choir might be broken up into various sections which would sing different kinds of songs, always with the emphasis on well arranged Irish music with plenty of gaiety and plenty of innovations, music that is not heard by people at every benefit concert and of which the people have become so tired. If the Minister goes to the Folklore Commission and listens to the records there, he would know what an immense amount of work has to be done. The people do not want to listen to the seanachaí type of folk music but to something a little more akin to that to which the modern ear is accustomed, retaining at the same time all the melody and atmosphere which our own music has.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about political debates and I shall speak absolutely frankly, without any political feeling whatever.  I think it is an appalling thing that the political debate idea has died down in Radio Éireann, simply because members of this House cannot be brought to the debates.  I understand that certain restrictions have been placed by the heads of Parties on both sides.  I do not know who started it&mdash;it may have been either side&mdash;but it seems these restrictions were laid down by committees in control of Parties who are terrified that T.D.s on the air might say something which would be construed as the official policy of the Party.  I hope the director will consult T.D.s from all Parties and that he will get agreement that if a member of any Party appears to say something that might not be in accordance with the <Col N="1553" /> policy of the Party, that the opposite Party will not then hurry around the country, saying: &ldquo;That is their official policy.&rdquo;  Are we a collection of school children or are we adults?  Are we to continue to be the only Parliament in this position in the whole of Europe, where there are not constant political debates over broadcasting systems of every kind?  I understand that the Radio Éireann Director found the greatest difficulty in getting members of the Dáil on either side to take part in these debates.  Broadcasting is inevitably going to become a far more important medium for conveying political information and giving political views.</P>
    <P>When I left office in between general elections I understood there were to be stated political Party broadcasts in the winter months such as take place in very nearly every civilised democracy in the world.  I understand that those stated political broadcasts have not taken place because the director feels there is a general lack of interest and difficulties of all kinds were raised in regard to the matter.  I am quite sure, speaking on behalf of my own Party, that if the director starts again, if he would send a report to the heads of the Parties as regards the programme and asks for co-operation, or if he meets the heads of the Parties, some kind of an agreement can be threshed out for the coming winter. We can forget about the autumn season when harvesting is going on and the Dáil is not in session.  I believe that, by asking the heads of the Parties or representatives of the heads of Parties to thresh out some form of agreement on this matter, he should be able to get it.  I can hardly believe that members of the Parties forming the Government would be so reluctant that they would reject that idea.</P>
    <P>Let the director do as the director of the B.B.C. does.  Let him invite these people to a pleasant dinner at the Gresham Hotel.  He has expense money, and he can do it.  Let the whole matter be threshed out and some agreement reached.  I understand that all Parties in the House have behaved like school children on <Col N="1554" /> this whole question of political broadcasts and political debates.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the Minister's views about television seem to be grimly pessimistic.  I do not know whether the Government will stop some new type of motor car from coming into the country on the grounds that it is too modern for us to be able to afford it.  It seems to me that television is inevitable and the pessimism of the Government, apparently, is reflected in the present Minister's statement that the country cannot afford the luxury of television. The Minister knows that we would be very lucky if any proper sort of television service could be set up, within three years from the time plans were commenced.  If the country, three years from now, cannot afford to import television sets, we would be in a pretty poor way.  I wonder whether the Minister reflects that rather vague sort of negative ineffective pessimism of all his colleagues on the present financial situation.  Three years from now, we shall be the only country probably in the world without television. Apparently we shall not be able to afford it even then.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no use in my suggesting that television is not a luxury from the point of view of the balance of payments?  The importation of television sets is undoubtedly a luxury at the moment and it can only be regarded as not a luxury, if one of the Minister's major objectives in promoting it was for educational purposes, in order to overcome the appalling scarcity of teachers, classrooms and courses of instruction.  I know very well that the B.B.C. regret that television did not start soon enough for them to provide instruction by television rather than by sound broadcasting to classes up to 100 who can see television on a wide screen.  I believe they are making plans to extend the television educational service. It might even be the least expensive means in the long run of extending the whole sphere of general education in this country.  I have not worked out the costs and how they could be compared with all the costs of buildings and recruiting of teachers, who are difficult to recruit, but I suppose if the Minister feels he cannot <Col N="1555" /> include education in the idea of television, he may consider it an expensive luxury in regard to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>In my view, the Minister is going to find it very difficult to afford a complete State television service within the next five years.  He may be forced to look for some alternative, and I do not believe the Minister will have to provide the capital for a television station, if he sets about it the right way.  I do not believe the State would have to find the capital and there still could be a very satisfactory television service here, with Irish programmes and everything else, without the balance of payments being involved in its promotion.  Nothing can really happen for about two or three years in any event, and if, by that time, we are still to be deprived altogether of something as inevitable as the new satellite which will circle the world, well, the outlook is grim and the Minister and his colleagues evidently do not seem to have much feeling of optimism in promoting increased exports or increasing production by which we could afford this inevitable development.</P>
    <P>May I also point out to the Minister that this will not prevent people from receiving foreign programmes?  The commercial programme in Britain is to be extended and, as far as I understand, more of it will be seen.  The B.B.C. programme is already being viewed in a very large part of the northern part of this country.  The sale of television sets to see purely English programmes continues to grow.  The programme is very satisfactory from the Irish point of view, for the most part, but it is in a purely English connotation.  That television service is about to extend, and long range television is now in the experimental stage, television which could be beamed 150 miles away.  That may affect this country, but it is simply putting off the day when the Minister has to face the necessity of having some kind of television service, if it is to be attuned to our own ideals, our own culture and our own way of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> As I have said, any decision made by the Government now will involve the Government in possibly no expense for nearly two or three years from the time the whole thing starts.  The Government will not be making a decision for 1956.  They are making it for 1959 or 1960.  The public should be aware of that.  It is only in those years that the balance of payments will be affected by increased importation of television sets, which, of course, should be manufactured here and would be manufactured here where there would at least be the labour element involved in making them, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I should like also to say to the Minister, without any reason of being accused of being personally prejudiced, because I am associated with the radio industry, that he had better face this situation that the saturation in the production of domestic radio is gradually increasing.  In addition to that, as the Minister knows, there are emergency levies upon domestic radios and television sets.  All this is bound to have a repercussion on an industry which, in the main, has been very economic, in that the price of radio sets produced by a number of firms has been the same as the English price, a very rare thing in Irish industry.  This industry is associated with exports. Some of the traders export up to 50 per cent. of their production.  The exports naturally depend on the home market and so the Minister's decision is not making it easy for the few companies in Ireland who do this, to face the future.  They fear they will have to play a particularly important part in the general campaign to reduce imports, although they are an industry which is associated with exports. My objection is that the Minister's pessimism extends to two or three years from now.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a word about the incorporation of Radio Éireann. Radio Éireann has been so successful under its new direction that incorporation seems to me to be inevitable. There have been virtually no complaints from this side of the House about political partiality and there have been only fugitive complaints of the character of the Minister's in other <Col N="1557" /> respects.  Therefore, will the Minister say why he will not make arrangements for incorporating Radio Éireann?  I have a suspicion it is because he still wants to keep his finger on broadcasting, that he thinks perhaps we are not sufficiently adult in this country to have an independent broadcasting service, that he thinks that there are still elements in the community which make it difficult for us to have an independent broadcasting unit in the same way as other countries have.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to dispel that idea.  There is no reason why the incorporation of Radio Éireann should be still further delayed.  Does he not believe that an independent broadcasting service would not be competently conducted, provided always the Minister had exactly the same vetoes as the British Postmaster-General or the Belgian Minister of Communications has, vetoes of an ordinary common-sense type, where he could intervene at other times than on the renewal of the licence to the corporation, for special reasons to insist on political impartiality, to insist on a given proportion of the Irish language in the programme or to insist in cases where some foreign country is being offended by broadcasts?  I think these are the principal reservations.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied in his own mind that there is any special reason for delaying the incorporation of Radio Éireann, as I would hate to feel he would think we were not sufficiently adult in this country to have a service of that kind?  He knows how well the present makeshift arrangement has operated and how impartial the service has been.  The present principle on which Radio Éireann operates is in some ways a hypocritical one, in that the Minister delegates powers which in fact he cannot legally delegate, without a Bill being passed through the Dáil.  It is one of those curious examples of some unconstitutional acts by a Government which succeed very admirably and work very well.  Is there anything at the back of the Minister's mind about that or is it simply the pressure of business in the Government? Is it the administrative diffities of incorporation, the difficulty of <Col N="1558" /> changing over staff and giving such of them as must have it the transfer of their Civil Service rights to an independent corporation?  Or is there any difficulty about paying pensions in incorporated institutions which surely would be the desire in respect of the permanent staff of Radio Éireann for persons like the deputy director and his staff, who have given magnificent service and who are going out without any pension when they reach the retiring age, unless incorporation is effected?  Is it the financial difficulty? Is it the difficulty of accumulating in advance the sum that will be required to pay pensions?  If they have only been incorporated for a short time, the paid up value of the insurance which would be prescribed for members of the incorporated body would be very low by the time these people retire.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give a very frank answer about this, because I would hate to feel that they were purely political or personal reasons, or reasons whereby he wishes to retain some control that is not retained by, for example, the Belgian Minister for Communications.</P>

      <P>Not having the opportunity of hearing many programmes on Radio Éireann or elsewhere, I may be in a difficult position in speaking on this Estimate, but there are a few points to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  While I agree with many of the remarks made by Deputy Childers, there are other points on which I would disagree.</P>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate a few years ago, I said that radio is, as it were, the shop window of the nation and I think it is right for me to congratulate the announcers of Radio Éireann.  Each and every one of them is, not only to me but to many people down the country, a typical example of a well educated, well spoken Irishman and Irishwoman.  It is something to know that whoever may tune in to Radio Éireann, from North or South or from across the water, we can let them see that, as well as putting over a good programme, our officers can do it in an admirable fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One item not touched on by Deputy <Col N="1559" /> Childers, because probably it does not affect people in the east, is the question of reception.  Deputy Childers talks about television, but the complaint of the people down in the South is that, although they are paying 17/6 for a radio licence, after 8 p.m. they cannot hear the programme from Radio Éireann at all.  It has been the complaint, year in year out, in this House in relation to our programmes that in the South and South-West the reception is very poor.  In spite of these complaints, and in spite of whatever attempts have been made to make an improvement, the same dissatisfaction is being experienced.  In his statement the Minister mentioned the pirates who refuse to pay their radio licences.  I should like to tell him about the people who have been consistently paying their licences and who have been consistently making complaints about bad reception.  These people are entitled to better reception.  The reception is not so bad during the lunchtime programmes and again in the evening from before 6 o'clock up to 8 o'clock.  At other times, however, they might as well switch off Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers raised the point about using the radio for educational purposes.  I am afraid there are very many difficulties in relation to that suggestion which it will be very hard to get over.  Our people at the moment have a desire to get as close as possible to the subject of the broadcasts; they want to know whether a broadcast on a subject is given by a lecturer on educational subjects from the schools' viewpoint or otherwise.  I would suggest that the Minister and his Department should seek the cooperation of rural organisations like Muintir na Tíre and Macra na Feirme in arranging these lectures.  These organisations have many branches throughout the country.  If they are in a position to provide a panel of speakers on subjects which affect the people of the country, I think the Minister should avail of that panel, if he found it suitable.  The local branches of the organisation from which a speaker was picked could listen to the lecture and, in their spare <Col N="1560" /> time, hold discussions on the subject they had heard on the radio.  Such discussions would help to brighten the social side of rural Ireland and might arouse amongst rural communities an appreciation of the use that could be made of information disseminated through the radio.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers did not agree with the Minister on his statement about television.  I am now speaking about television as an individual and not as a member of a political Party.  I believe that our problems in rural Ireland&mdash;I do not know about Dublin&mdash; do not include the question of the provision of television at the present time.  While I have always appreciated the views of Deputy Childers as a person who is very conversant with such subjects, I should like to know if he read a report of a group of Americans on the reactions of television on the American people.  These people thought Americans would be much better off without it, that the children do not know what it is to enjoy God's fresh air because of it and that adults seem to have their eyes glued to the sets.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is the least of the problems of our rural community at the present time.  May I say to the Minister that if he had come out this evening with an announcement in favour of television it would not gain a single vote for him in the forthcoming Cork bye-election.  We have many more important problems in rural Ireland having regard to the present cost-of-living position.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Deputy Childers' point about political debates on the wireless.  I agree with him but I should like to say that the Labour Party was not consulted, as a Party, about such debates.  I am speaking now as a member of the Labour Party. Perhaps such suggestions were made to individuals but, as a Party, we never discussed it.  I think it would be disgraceful for any political Party to try to gag its members in this way.  I agree with Deputy Childers that statements by individual political speakers during such radio debates, cannot be taken as being the views of the Party; I agree also it would be disgraceful if <Col N="1561" /> another Party tried to make use of such points for political purposes.  I believe Deputy Childers was justified when he said that our reason for being afraid to express such views over the wireless is that we are immature. This matter should be treated in such a way that no matter what points a member of a Party might make over the wireless, they would be taken as his views only and not as that of his Party.</P>
    <P>The last point I should like to make was also the last point made by the Minister and by Deputy Childers.  I do not, however, agree with Deputy Childers when he asks for the speeding up of the incorporation of Radio Éireann.  People tell us that it would be a great success but I should like to tell the Minister that many people look with grave suspicion on the suggestion that Radio Éireann should be incorporated. Advocates of incorporation have spoken about the desirability of having Radio Éireann turned into an independent body but I do not think it would be a good idea to have our Radio authority divorced, if you like to put it that way, from the Minister and this House.  People talk of incorporation of the radio as a desirable experiment in this country and very often these people try to make a case by pointing to the great success of other semi-State bodies such as the Sugar Company, C.I.E.&mdash;if that is so successful&mdash;Bord na Móna, and other bodies.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is not a case of insisting that the Minister should keep a grip on radio, but we consider it our inherent right that this House should have a firm grip on the radio.  That is where we differ.  Deputy Briscoe may consider that the Minister, irrespective of what Government may be in power, may be anxious to hold the reins.  I do not agree.  The Minister might agree with the policy formulated by this body and at times might not exert pressure where it was needed.  I do not want to indulge in any criticism in relation to this Vote, because I appreciate the approach of the announcers and all concerned, but I must tell the Minister that, whether it is Roche's bird that tells us or not, it is common knowledge through rural <Col N="1562" /> Ireland that there is picking and choosing in relation to the artistes employed in Radio Éireann.  If we were to give the Minister more freedom of action, it would be a very unsatisfactory hour's work for a Minister or a Government to agree to that.  I am not satisfied with the present policy, but I do not intend to wash dirty linen in public.  I believe it is my duty to say to the Minister that, in turn, it is essential that he should check on how the policy of Radio Éireann is being operated in relation to artistes, musical or otherwise.  I want the Minister to understand that the people in rural Ireland believe that there is a small circle, which it is very hard to enter, which has the giving of programmes to whom they like.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhféadfaimis mórán locht a fháil ar Radio Éireann.  Cé'r bith cúis atá leis, níl amhras ach go bhfuil feabhas anmhór ar na cláir.  Is dóigh go bhfuil an moladh sin tuillte ag an riaracháin nua a cuireadh ar bun agus go bhféadfaí a rá gur mar gheall ar go bhfuil an tseirbhís rud beag neamh-spleách go bhfuil ag éirigh chomh maith leis ins na blianta seo.</P>
      <P>I think it can be claimed that the improvement which undoubtedly has taken place in Radio Éireann in recent years, and which is fairly generally acknowledged in the country, is in great measure due to the fact that a type of organisation was set up which enabled that service to become semiautonomous and to take decisions more speedily.  If we were to imagine the position if the daily newspapers, for example, were to be handed over to a Government Department, I am quite sure that there would be very extraordinary results.  There would probably be very large gaps in times of publication.  The radio must keep up to date.  Above all the services, including even the Post Office, it is the service to which the public looks to respond almost immediately to certain needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that Radio Éireann has acquitted itself very well in many respects in reporting in the way that only the radio can <Col N="1563" /> report in giving accounts of important events, whether social or otherwise. Of course, if Radio Éireann went into the social and fashionable sphere seriously, I have no doubt that it would make the daily newspapers tremble for their circulation.  However, that is a matter that, perhaps, we will have to postpone until television, to which Deputy Childers has referred, becomes part of our radio organisation.</P>
    <P>It is most valuable that the radio service is able to give publicity to local festivals, in relation to inland festivals in particular.  It is most satisfactory that they have been able to give such publicity to the currach races in Galway and to the recent festival in Ennis, which is thoroughly characteristic of the Irish countryside.  I hope that during the coming year we shall have many more of these festivals, if that be possible within our resources.</P>
    <P>We know that the authorities of Radio Éireann should be able to do a good deal for these festivals by the encouragement they give by advance publicity.  That is very important.  It is all to the good that any important festival, cultural, social or athletic, should get advance publicity.  There is also an advantage to the competitors. Even country fiddlers, dancers and singers, while they may not be of the standard required for recitals, have an opportunity of being heard over the radio in programmes which, if properly arranged, can give more enjoyment than one sometimes gets from soloists.</P>
    <P>The recent folk music production in Dublin showed what can be done.  The means were very simple, but the results were extraordinarily effective.  That was entirely due to the way in which the production was arranged.  These country performers were trained and adapted themselves to the requirements of the occasion.  They sang their songs, conducted their conversations and played their music and anyone who saw the show enjoyed it most thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Last year, I asked the Minister to do what he could to assist the Feis Ceoil. I think that has been done and I am very glad to know that the organisation is assisting young instrumentalists <Col N="1564" />&mdash;in the first place those who are learning&mdash;and even if further steps are necessary in the way of prizes and scholarships, why does Radio Éireann not try to give these to those who are studying the violin or wind instruments, in view of the fact that it is so very difficult to get these instrumentalists? We should certainly give them every encouragement.</P>
    <P>The same applies to singers and actors.  There is the matter of country plays.  Unfortunately, they generally do plays which have been done over and over again in the Abbey Theatre and which do not have very much appeal; but perhaps more can be done to induce authors to produce suitable plays and sketches for radio production by country groups.  In that way, the country people would have an interest in them; and, of course, the radio counts a great deal more with them than it does in the City of Dublin.  Therefore, we ought to have the country represented as much as ever we can.</P>
    <P>The present organisation is doing very well.  It is setting a very high standard generally.  There is good variety, which is very essential so that all tastes are catered for.  The proponents of jazz, of course, would be in a minority in this House at the present time, and persons like Deputy Childers and myself might be regarded as rather high brow.  Perhaps it is a good sign that folk singing, not alone from our own country but from other countries, even on records, is getting a better showing.  Perhaps it is a sign that the more raucous and horrible forms of jazz are being gradually allowed to disappear.  Most people do not object to a mild dose, provided, of course, that it is not too noisy.</P>
    <P>The folk music enables our people to see what could be done by themselves. On occasions like An Tóstal, surely a small number of performers could be got together in any Irish country town?  If we keep at it steadily, over a period of years, we shall have something to our credit&mdash;something lasting that will help to build up country life, which is so necessary, and make people feel that they can do something for their own amusement and culture <Col N="1565" /> locally and not have to depend entirely on Hollywood and other such importations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the programmes in Irish, as I said last year, I am very pleased indeed with those which have come from the Gaeltacht, and I am sure the Gaeltacht people are delighted to have the opportunity of taking part in these productions and having their voices heard.  I believe it will do more for the Irish language than a great many things being done at present. I should like the young educated men in the Comh-Caidreamh, representing the universities, and bodies like the Keating Branch to be associated even to a greater degree with this work; and that, in the same way as the Gaeltacht are represented, these young men who are highly educated in Irish, would be given opportunities of having discussions in Irish on serious subjects.</P>
    <P>Where you have men and women forming discussion groups, you can have very good results; and the Minister for Education, on the Education. Vote, pointed to the fact that in the vocational schools where we are trying to develop agricultural education&mdash; Deputy Childers has referred to it frequently and this evening also&mdash;that the discussion group is the natural development of the teaching of rural science.  There is a great deal to be said, therefore, for Deputy Childers's point of view that we should have more discussions.  We ought to try to grow up; we ought to try to look at ourselves a little more critically perhaps, to carry out an examination of our position occasionally and see how we can improve matters, exactly as we are doing in the Dáil, or as we are supposed to be doing, but not on a political basis.</P>
    <P>I think something could be done in Irish.  As well as the type of programmes for learners, there should be programmes for those who have got a good primary or secondary school education and who are able to follow simple Irish dialogues and discussions. For example, I thought that the programmes of &ldquo;The School Around the Corner&rdquo; which I heard were very amusing indeed, but the trouble is to maintain the atmosphere of spontaneity in the answers of the children. <Col N="1566" /> The listeners expect that the repartee and humour will be as good as would come from the professional artist.  Of course, that is not possible in the case of children.  But the idea certainly is a very good one, and I was only sorry that we had not something like it for Irish where the younger people would be able to participate in the programmes.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Davis lectures were considered to be a very fine feature indeed, and I hope they will be continued.  There are many other aspects of what we might describe as adult education, which I think could be explored in these lectures. You have local history.  In every county, for example, you must surely have people who are able to give a good account of their local history, and that applies particularly to the City and County of Dublin.  That could be worked in with programmes for younger listeners also.</P>
    <P>Then there are the social and economic considerations.  Like Deputy Childers, I believe very strongly that there is a large listening public for intelligent, informed and objective discussion on social and economic questions. The trouble with political broadcasts, of course, is that they tend to go over the same ground as we go over here in the Dáil, and also that the persons who might be the best broadcasters might not be regarded as the best exponents of Party policy or <i>vice-versa.</i></P>
    <P>In connection with savings, across the water information is given almost every evening on that matter.  That is the way in which savings and the general problems with which the country finds itself faced can be brought into perspective so far as the public generally are concerned in such manner as to ensure that the individual can see the bearing they may have upon him or her in his or her adult life.  Hearing these matters discussed by responsible persons would be an advantage.  Of course people of university standard should have first preference in such discussions.  These would be important now that we appear to be faced with a bad summer and people will be compelled to sit in <Col N="1567" /> and listen to the radio; in those circumstances it would be better for them to learn something which may be of advantage to them.</P>
    <P>The agricultural discussions are very instructive.  In such discussions, bearing on agriculture, industry or social problems, it is important that we should have people of practical experience. For example, we should have farmers to tell us what is being done on the land.  It is personality and experience that lend pith to such discussions and give them vigour, life and reality.  Men talking from practical experience, who know the problems fairly intimately, with now and again a specialist brought in to discuss a specialised branch of the work, are always assured of an audience.  It is in that way that one can get the best results.  I hope that policy will continue. I would like to see it extended to other branches of adult education, if I may use that expression once more, in relation to social problems and emigration.  If we could have programmes of particular interest to our emigrants, so much the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to An Foras Tráchtála, as a member of the Dáil I am very interested in the question of our trade with America.  One would like to hear that discussed by those who have been dealing with it.  We have had a recent report and, if Government Departments concerned are willing to place their information at the disposal of whoever would be selected to take part in that discussion, we would learn what can be done in regard to trade with America, what can be done about tourism and what are the feelings of American visitors who come here. That type of programme was a prominent feature for many years on radio across the water.  Of course I do not believe in the type of interlocution when the interviewer asks: &ldquo;Now what do you admire most about our city?&rdquo;  The visitor is not given an opportunity, even if he wished to find any fault, to express any criticism.  It is assumed that he should not have any fault to find and he would certainly need to be a very courageous man to offer criticism in such circumstances. <Col N="1568" /> I do not think the views of visitors would be of very much value unless the persons taking part were reasonably well-informed people, prepared to give a fairly objective, but perhaps not altogether too candid, view because, if they went into all our shortcomings, it might be rather difficult for us to listen.</P>

      <P>Deputy Childers raised the question of alteration in the personnel of An Comhairle.  I have been deferring making any changes.  I recognise it is neither a permanent nor a perpetual institution but, in the circumstances, I consider it wise to hold the present team together pending consideration of the question of whether Radio Éireann should be given greater freedom.  That is the reason I have been holding off making any changes.  I assume we shall not have the same Comhairle for all time. I agree we have a very excellent team &mdash;I think that is conceded&mdash;but at the moment we are not swopping horses crossing the stream.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the sponsored programmes and I think they are entitled to the compliments they have been paid.  The producers are making every effort to keep a balanced programme, with a bit of variety in it.  That has been the constant aim of the director.</P>
      <P>With regard to educational programmes, Radio Éireann provides programmes to supplement the teaching of school subjects.  Much has been done in that direction.  But the initiative must come from another Department and a due balance must be preserved between education and entertainment.  We are prepared to cooperate and we are co-operating as far as we can, but somebody else must give the initiative and lead.  Otherwise, we shall have the Department of Education coming down on us and telling us we are outstepping our duties.</P>

      <P>With regard to arranging Irish music, I think more is being done in that direction now than ever <Col N="1569" /> before.  A series of programmes is being prepared composed almost entirely of new arrangements for orchestra and singers.  I think this year and next year will mark a definite step forward in that direction.  That should meet with the approval of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers suggested that more travelling should be done.  I have been putting that before the director. Travelling involves a lot of very hard work for the music section quite apart from the cost and so forth.  I shall certainly pass that suggestion on to the director, not as my suggestion, but as the suggestion made by someone else. I am sure the director will give it very careful attention.</P>
      <P>I shall also pass on the suggestion made by Deputy Childers and Deputy Desmond about political broadcasts.  I am not so sure how I will come out of that.  However, I understand the net point involved in the suggestion and I will put it before the director for his serious consideration.  The suggestion of a consultation with local rural committees and councils for rural debates is an excellent idea and one of which advantage could be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to television, it is open to the Government to reconsider their attitude at any time.  With all due respect to Deputy Childers, I think the Government decision was a wise one at this juncture.  There is a drive on to try to secure savings owing to the financial position.  We cannot escape that drive more than any other Department. I think it would be inconsistent, when that drive is being made, if we were to launch out on television and encourage people to buy expensive sets.  It may be said that television would take a few years to materialise and mature but we are not in a position at the moment to know when the depression will lift or turn into a boom. Remember, television would largely benefit Dublin.  I believe that in rural areas it would be looked upon as though we were doing everything for Dublin and, while that would not influence me, I am stressing the point that I think it would be unwise at this juncture when we are trying to get <Col N="1570" /> savings to go ahead with a nonessential service.  It would be taking away from those savings; in other words we would be giving away with one hand what we are trying to take with the other.  I cannot say when the matter will be reviewed because we do not know when the financial position will improve.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised, and perhaps I should say disturbed, at the statements made by Deputy Desmond about the selection of artists.  I am not aware of anything to justify those statements.  On the contrary I have been under the impression that the activities of our people in that regard were perfectly above board and that there was nothing to complain of.  I would be very anxious to get any available evidence on these matters.  I can definitely say that I am unaware of anything of that sort taking place in the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond complained about bad reception in certain parts of Kerry and Cork.  I am not an expert on these matters and have no technical knowledge but I understand that certain changes take place in the atmosphere at night which make it more difficult to get a good reception in the remote areas and which cause a great deal of interference from outside stations.  We have been considering how this situation can be remedied and very high frequency seems to be the most satisfactory answer.  I mentioned in my statement that we are making tests with a very high frequency transmitter which we hope will give us a lead as to how we can cure this bad reception in the remote parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig stated that he thought a good deal of the improvement in Radio Éireann was due to the fact that they are now a quasi-autonomous body.  I think that is so. I do not understand what Deputy Childers was referring to.  He seems to think that I want to keep my finger on Radio Éireann, but I can assure him I do not.  I do think that a body like Radio Éireann requires a good deal of elasticity and flexibility as does any broadcasting station.  They cannot <Col N="1571" /> work efficiently if they are tied to a machine like the Civil Service and they will not get results.  They want more flexibility and they are getting that now.  There are certain practical difficulties that have to be got over but I do not think there are any of the difficulties suggested by Deputy Childers.</P>

I think Radio Éireann has <Col N="1572" /> been doing a very decent job in the encouragement of the Irish language and music.  That is very desirable and I think they will continue to do that work with great success.  We all know the work they are doing and we are critical of them only to keep them on their toes.  This annual revision of their work helps to bring forward new ideas and I shall bring these ideas and suggestions to the notice of the director.</P>
