    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1956&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill makes provision for further issues from the Local Loans Fund in respect of local loans. The existing statutory limit on aggregate issues as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1954, is £90,000,000.  The Bill extends this limit to £110,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues from the fund from the 1st May, 1935&mdash;when it was established&mdash; up to 31st March, 1956, amounted to almost £76,500,000 of which £62,500,000 was for housing loans, nearly £10,750,000 for sanitary services and public health loans, nearly £1,500,000 for vocational educational loans, over £780,000 for a temporary advance to <Col N="1129" /> Dublin Corporation under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1945, in connection with redemption of stock, and £1,000,000 for loans for other services.</P>
    <P>Over the same period sanctions for loans from the fund&mdash;including a carry-over from before 1st May, 1935&mdash; came to approximately £88,250,000. The difference between the figure for sanctions and the figure for issues is accounted for by the fact that while loans are normally sanctioned in full they are issued in instalments as required by the borrowing authorities.</P>
    <P>Included in the figure of £88,250,000 for loans sanctioned is a sum estimated at £1,000,000, representing loans sanctioned since the establishment of the fund which will not be required because of the abandonment of proposed works or their completion at a lesser cost than originally estimated.  The total of commitments at 31st March, 1956, therefore, stood at £87,250,000, or within £3,000,000 of the present limit of £90,000,000, which should be reached before the next session.  The additional margin of £20,000,000 provided for in the Bill should suffice to cover commitments for approximately three years.</P>
    <P>The extent to which loan finance can be made available through the Local Loans Fund depends on the availability of capital for State financing in general.  It was indicated in the Budget statement earlier this year that at present capital is not only scarce but also abnormally dear and that in the ordinary course it would not be possible to meet all our desirable capital requirements in the absence of a marked change in the savings trend.  I regret I can as yet see no evidence of a sufficiently marked change in that respect.  The fact must, therefore, be faced that the capital funds available, even for the most essential projects, are scarce and are likely to continue to be so in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>This situation must inevitably react on the finances of the Local Loans Fund and for the present at least all projects requiring to be financed from <Col N="1130" /> the fund must be closely scrutinised. In relation to capital outlay as a whole every effort is being made to preserve a reasonable balance between social and economic considerations but in our current circumstances it is vital to devote far the greater proportion of the available resources to productive investment.  Housing is the main claimant on the Local Loans Fund. Requirements under this heading are being accorded a high priority and I hope it may be possible to provide for the continuance of all essential local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The fact that the needs of local authorities outside the Dublin and Cork urban areas have been largely satisfied and may be expected to taper off rapidly in the years ahead should afford some relief, but unfortunately, any relief in this way for 1956-57 is more than offset by the necessity to come to the assistance of Dublin and Cork Corporations who have been unable themselves to raise all the capital they need to meet their current requirements.  Similar assistance has been promised to Dublin next year, if necessary, but it is to be hoped that the difficulties are only temporary and that in the years ahead both Dublin and Cork Corporations will be able to raise their full requirements of capital independently as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to increase the amount of money available from the Local Loans Fund by £20,000,000.  Having listened to the Minister's speech, most people will agree with me that the Bill is little more than an empty gesture.  The Minister&mdash;and I do not criticise him for this; in fact I commend him for it&mdash; has told the country that capital is scarce and interest rates high and that this scarcity of capital and those high interest rates are likely to continue for a considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the committee which I set up to inquire into the effects of taxation on industry has disclosed one startling fact&mdash;that out of the £100,000,000 odd raised in recent years &mdash;I am speaking from recollection and may be out a million or two at one side or the other&mdash;which has been devoted <Col N="1131" /> to expenditure generally described as capital expenditure&mdash;and whether all of it was entitled to be so described is a questionable matter&mdash;almost 98 per cent. has been absorbed by the State and the local authorities in financing their own enterprises, whether they were or were not productive.</P>
    <P>In June, 1951, just five years ago, I had to make, as Minister for Finance in the new Government, a statement in this House.  In it I pointed out the direction in which the country was going.  I emphasised that it was essential that we should conserve our capital resources and devote them, as far as possible, to productive expenditure. If I were sitting on those benches over there and the Tánaiste and the present Minister for Finance were sitting on these benches, this is the sort of trash we would hear this morning. I am quoting from Volume 126, column 1906 of a speech made by the then Leader of the Labour Party&mdash;I assume he still holds that position&mdash;the present Tánaiste.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I listened to the Minister's speech for a considerable period this evening.  He was obviously in a very bad physical condition when he attempted to prepare the speech himself....  I have never listened to a worse dirge than I listened to this evening from the Minister....  So long as Deputy MacEntee is Minister for Finance you are going to get hair-shirt economics and a policy of austerity for the next three years....  The Minister believes that this is bound to be a distressful country with an impoverished standard of living....  You will have to put up with low wages, bad houses, intolerable social conditions, underemployment, irregular employment and home assistance....  This is 1951, not 1851.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to endorse those remarks. I am going to congratulate the Minister on following my example and endeavouring to put before the country the facts of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have seen our external reserves, this mass of economic manoeuvre, the sheet anchor of our independence, as they were described by Deputy McGilligan in 1951, dissipated and, as the commission to which I have referred has reported, little more than £2,000,000 of them have been devoted to really productive enterprises in this country.  It is because of this that to-day we have people in irregular employment; it is because of this that to-day we have a growing number of unemployed; it is because of this that to-day the Minister for Finance has warned us that we cannot continue to spend our capital resources on things which are not in themselves economically reproductive.</P>
      <P>I am not going to condemn the Minister for that.  I know he has a hard task.  It is a grave and serious picture which he has presented.  It is a problem which cannot be solved merely by talk.  We all know the parlous position in which our national transport industry is.  It is one which requires immediate action by the Government. But what has been their proposal? They propose to deal with that problem in the same way as they dealt with the emigration problem&mdash;to set up a commission and keep people talking so as to give them an excuse for doing nothing.</P>
      <P>Then there is the Dublin housing problem.  Last night we heard the Minister&mdash;and this is relevant, Sir&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is all part of the problem, and I only made a passing reference to C.I.E., but do not forget that the Coalition set up another commission in 1951, and the effect of that commission was to delay, for years, the one remedy that might have enabled the national transport undertaking to become a profitable concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, Sir, and I thank you for the indulgence you have shown me, but the Minister has been, not provocative, but a little seductive <Col N="1133" /> in his interruptions.  I was saying that last night when the question was put by my colleague, Deputy Smith, to his successor in charge of housing, the present Minister for Local Government, as to what moneys would, in fact, be available for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, we had a spate of words from the Minister which reminded me of nothing so much as a snow-storm.  One cannot see very much through a snow-storm and one could not gather what was in the mind of the Minister for Local Government and what was the true position in regard to the Small Dwellings Acts from the statements he made last night.  He did say that there will be plenty of money available from the Local Loans Fund for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  The Minister for Finance who controls the purse, and I am glad to say that this Minister for Finance does, I think, control the purse, announced this morning that we must go slow on housing.  The Minister for Local Government said that there would be plenty of money available and when he was challenged to say where the money would come from he turned to Section 9 of the Housing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 is the section which provides that insurance companies and building societies are now to come in and do the work which had formerly been regarded as the work of the Department of Finance.  They are to come in and provide the moneys which were formerly regarded as being a proper charge on public funds.  What is to be the effect of that in the light of what the Minister now says, that capital for productive investment has become very scarce and very dear? Everybody knows that one of the principal objects of investment for insurance companies is in industrial buildings, that is in housing the industries which will enable our people to earn their living and to produce the commodities which we require if we are ever to get back to the position in which we can maintain ourselves as a creditor country.  These moneys which normally are regarded as being the principal source of capital for industry <Col N="1134" /> and productive purposes are now to be diverted out of their proper normal course to other purposes which had been regarded hitherto as being a proper charge upon public funds.</P>
    <P>I did not intervene in the debate last night and I am not going to continue in this trend for very long except to point out that the proposals contained in the Housing (Amendments) Act, particularly in Section 9, cannot be reconciled with the statements which the Minister for Finance has made this morning in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>I do not think so.  At least I hope not.  There is work to be done and if it had not been, of course, that we had wasted two whole days upon a petty little measure dealing with greyhounds, at the instance of the Minister for Agriculture, we would have got it done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will give a good example now by coming back to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I was saying that the statements which the Minister for Local Government made last night could not be reconciled with the statements made by the Minister for Finance this morning.  I want to go further and say that one of the purposes of these Local Loans Acts has always been to provide the funds to enable the local authorities to carry out their housing programmes.  Last night the Minister for Local Government <Col N="1135" /> said that all the money that the local authorities required would be available for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts from the fund; he said in substance that no local authority had been impeded in dealing with its housing problems because of lack of funds. That statement was challenged by the present Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Briscoe.  It was repeated, I think, by the Minister for Local Government to such an extent that the former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Deputy Larkin, got up and contradicted the statement which the Minister for Local Government had made.</P>
      <P>I mention that only to bring out this point: what is the use of bringing in a Bill to increase the Local Loans Fund by £110,000,000 when, in fact, in the present circumstances, in view of the Minister's speech, the Government has not any hope that it will be able to provide these moneys?  Has the time not come when we should stop bluffing and the country should be told what the situation is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the Taoiseach in Cork saying that we were making capital out of the present difficulties that the Government has to face.  There never has been a Government in this House that was treated with such consideration by the Opposition as we have treated the present Government in the debate on the Budget and in the Financial Resolutions last year and in the finance debates again this year. The reason for that was that we did think that the Minister for Finance, whatever about his colleagues in the Government, has been doing his best. But we think also that the position is now so serious that the people should be told plainly that we cannot continue to pursue the policy which has been pursued hitherto.  The people should be told, in fact, that we are at the end of our resources; that every person who is engaged in industry, in productive industry, in the industries which are making the goods which we must export to live or which we could utilise here to maintain our own standard of life, is facing difficulties.  These difficulties have been created very <Col N="1136" /> largely by, and flow from the precedent which was created in the year 1949 when this Coalition Government abandoned the practice which all Governments had followed in this country hitherto, not excluding the Fine Gael Government which was in office from 1922 to 1932, that anything which is done purely for a social purpose must be paid for out of current revenue. That was the practice which we followed. It was on this basis that the Local Loans Fund was built up year by year, so that in 1939, when the war broke out, the fund had amassed a considerable amount of capital.  All that capital had been provided out of current revenue.  None of it had been borrowed.  I am sorry, Sir; that is an overstatement.  I should say that a considerable amount of it had been provided out of current revenue and only an inconsiderable fraction of it had been borrowed.</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, we departed from that sound practice in 1949 and we decided that all sorts of things that, year in, year out, the State must meet would be classified as capital and, instead of asking the community to set aside that money year after year, we borrowed for it.  The consequence has been that our external assets have been dwindling, and the rate of non-reproductive expenditure has been considerably accelerated.  Nobody can say to-day that for all such expenditure we are getting more than the merest fraction of the return which we would have got, if our resources had been more wisely employed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for his livelihood and for the maintenance of himself and his family on what he is able to sell and what he will get for it in the market. There is no use trying to conduct this debate as if it were a petty little debate in the literary and historical society in some university college.  This is the Assembly of the nation and the sooner that we wake up to the fact that we have got to deal with these problems, whether they are politically pleasant or unpleasant for us, the better.  For it is only when we decide that we will do what is right, irrespective of the political embarrassments which it may involve us in, that the country has any chance of being saved.</P>
      <P>We tried to do that from 1951 to 1954 and we did succeed in redressing the situation to a measure.  I am not going to described how our attempts to do that were met.  Suffice it to say that, if the Government will face up to their problem now, their difficulties will not be taken advantage of in the same way as the difficulties of the country were taken advantage of over the period from 1951 to 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now got to the stage in this country in which, for good or ill, the basis of our public finances is the 1952 Budget.  There has not been a single reduction in tax&mdash;not one single reduction in tax.  On the contrary, additional taxes have been imposed, taxes which we know are crippling some of the main instruments of industrial progress in this country, some of the things which are essential if industrial progress is to continue.  I have said on other occasions that it is better that taxes should be imposed rather than that we should borrow to meet a current deficit.  I have said that.  I maintain it because, if we keep on borrowing, pumping money into circulation, this inflationary position in which we are living will get worse. Prices will go higher; unemployment, despite anything that our people may do, will get worse.  We shall be put in a much less competitive situation and the position which we shall be facing in a very short time, perhaps within 12 months, is that the Irish £ may be, <Col N="1138" /> like the Australian £, standing at a discount 20 to 25 per cent. <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling.</P>
    <P>We have heard people talk about breaking the link with sterling.  The only thing the link with sterling meant was that an Irish £ could buy as much as and was as negotiable an instrument in a foreign market as the British £. Let us not continue on the path which we have been treading for the past seven or eight years, because, if we do, inevitably the day will come when the Irish £ will be devalued <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling.</P>

      <P>I am saying, and it is not the first time I have said it&mdash;I said it before in this House when I was Minister for Finance&mdash;that the problem we have now to face is to restore the credit of this country, to reduce the overheads which are pressing upon our main industries and, despite whatever discomfort or embarrassment it may involve for any political Party, we should take the steps necessary to redress the situation which has been created, which has, at least, been aggravated very considerably, over the past two years.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee ended on a note which suggested, perhaps, that this Government, and I in particular, will not take the steps that we deem necessary because of political considerations.  Let me say, quite categorically, that so far as this Government is concerned and so far as I am concerned as Minister for Finance I will take, and the Government will, I know, join with me in taking, such steps as we deem necessary to rectify the national economy, regardless of any Party political embarrassments that may be caused thereby.  We put the nation above political Party and we intend to ensure that that will be the aim and the object and the primary purpose of this Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee, justifiably perhaps, widened the scope of this debate on the Local Loans Fund into what one might perhaps describe as a debate on the national economy as a whole.  I do not want to follow him down certain lines that he took.  In relation to our transport problem, for example, the House will have an opportunity on the Supplementary Estimate that is to be introduced, if it so desires&mdash;the Supplementary Estimate that arises because of the fact to which I referred in my introductory speech on this Bill that capital is at present abnormally scarce and dear.  There are certain things he did say to which I must make some reference because, if they were to go uncontradicted, it would be extremely bad for the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not hesitate to agree that the Government are perturbed about the situation in relation to our balance of payments.  I did not intend to develop that on this Bill but, having regard to what Deputy MacEntee said, I must make a slight and passing reference to <Col N="1140" /> it.  The import figures for June did not show the decrease which we had hoped might be shown.  While exports showed some buoyancy, the rise, £450,000 in the value of our imports for June over June of last year was a change in the trend that had been operating for the past few months since the imposition of the special import levy in March.</P>
    <P>That change is a change which necessitates serious and active consideration by the Government in relation to our balance of payments position.  I want to make it perfectly clear that so far as I am concerned and so far as the Government is concerned we are determined that we will take any and every step that is necessary to rectify our balance of payments because we appreciate that it is vital to the national economy to secure that in the years ahead the resources of the country will be maintained to their fullest degree.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear beyond question that the Government are determined to take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the disaster such as was foretold by Deputy MacEntee. I think with adequate steps and the co-operation of the people as a whole we will be able to surmount the difficulty that everybody can see there at the present time.  In fact, I am confident that we will be able to surmount those difficulties but we can only do so by accepting the fact that there are difficulties there and by the appropriate measures being taken to surmount them.</P>
    <P>If I understood Deputy MacEntee correctly, particularly the end of his speech, I think it was unfair, unjust and prejudicial to the economy as a whole to suggest that I, as the Minister in charge of this Bill and the Government, were not going to take such steps as would be adequate to deal with that situation.  The Deputy and the House can rest assured that such steps, if they are necessary, will be taken.  I do not propose at this stage to go back over the ground that we covered in an earlier debate and the difference between July, 1951, when Deputy MacEntee and the Fianna Fáil Party took office and April of 1952, when he took his first measure.  I did not wait <Col N="1141" /> as long as that.  I acted much sooner. I did not wait for the Budget to act. I acted in the spring although my problem arose much later in point of time than Deputy MacEntee in his Government suggested their problems arose. They suggested their problem arose in July.  I do not agree.  It arose later on in that year, when, by freeing and releasing the balance of the Marshall Aid money, they set inflation afoot.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee says he saw in July of 1951 a serious situation.  He did not move until April.  Any situation that arose in respect of the current year arose much later than July but I did not wait for the Budget.  I moved before the Budget.  I merely mention that in passing to make it clear beyond question that so far as I am concerned and so far as this Government is concerned we are determined to take all such measures as may be necessary and adequate to correct a dangerous trend in our balance of payments.  We are determined to do that because we believe that if the appropriate measures are taken the country can and will surmount the present difficulties.  If that is done&mdash;and it will be done&mdash; then there will be no danger&mdash;let me emphasise that&mdash;of the results to which Deputy MacEntee made reference at the conclusion of his speech.</P>
      <P>It would be disastrous if it was felt that there was any possibility of arriving at the position which the Deputy foretold.  No matter who may like it or not I want to make it quite clear that I appreciate Deputy MacEntee made that statement in an anxiety to point out the dangers which the national economy could reach if they were not averted.  I think Deputy MacEntee must agree with me also when I say that his speech could be misunderstood and I want to make it clear beyond question that so far as I am concerned there is ample evidence that the appropriate measures will be taken and that if the appropriate measures are taken to rectify the economy, then there is no danger whatever of any developments such as the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <Col N="1144" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the provision of grants for private water supplies and sewerage and there is just one matter which I want to raise.  In sub-section (3) of Section 10, this question of valuation crops up. The Minister guarantees that there will be no increase in the valuation of the property for seven years after the completion of the work.  That is a usual stipulation where a premises is reconstructed or repaired, a new roof put on, an extra room or bathroom added, but surely the Minister will agree with me that it is paradoxical to contemplate that the Valuation Commissioners will increase the valuation of any holding where a private water supply is installed, for which the Minister is giving a grant of £40, or where a private sewerage system or septic tank is installed, for which the grant will be £20.  Surely the Minister will drop this section entirely or rather change it in such a way that there will be no increase in the valuation, if he has such power.  I do not know whether he is empowered to do that or not, but my point is that it is entirely fallacious and actually paradoxical to say that, on the one hand, the Minister is giving these grants and, on the other hand, that a small farmer will be faced, after seven years, with a heavy increase in valuation.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the increase in valuation as a result of installing a private water supply or a septic tank will be infinitesimal, but we must remember that the Valuation Commissioners will come along to a property which may not have been valued for a considerable number of years.  They may then avail of that occasion to revalue the property <i>in toto.</i>  That is what happens.  I think the Minister will agree with that view. This is one of the main complaints of people who, down through the years, write in to the newspapers from rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said by certain Deputies last <Col N="1145" /> night that it was unfortunate that these services and grants were not being availed of to the full extent.  I think members on the Minister's side of the House will agree that it is this fear of an increase in valuation after seven years which is responsible for a lot of people not availing of the grant.  It would be all right if a small farmer had only 5/- or 10/- put on his valuation&mdash; and even that I would be against&mdash;but we have had cases, and the Minister should know of them more than anyone else, in which a person with a £10 valuation does a small job meriting a grant.  That person often finds afterwards that he has property valued at £25 or £30.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider putting in a section here, or changing the existing section, to ensure that if a person does avail of a water supply or a sewerage grant, he will not be liable for an increase in valuation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misconstrues the meaning of the section. His speech was entirely related to the Valuation Acts and I have absolutely nothing to do with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have absolutely nothing to do with the Valuation Acts or the Commissioners of Valuation, but I am ensuring that if a small farmer wants to take advantage of this measure, they will not increase his valuation for a period of seven years.  It is but fair to my predecessor, Deputy Smith, to say that he had a similar section and a similar provision in the 1952 Act.  We have, however, no control over the Valuation Commissioners. It is entirely a matter for another Department, and all I am doing is ensuring that if any farmer takes advantage of the grants provided for in this measure, the Commissioners of Valuation will not penalise him for a period of seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the division of the £60 grant, that is, the proportion of £40&mdash;£20.  Under this section as amended, a person who installs a water supply will get £40, whereas the person who installs a <Col N="1146" /> sewerage system gets only £20.  I think there is a maladjustment there.  If the grant were to be kept at £60, I think it would be better to have it on a £30-£30 basis rather than a £40-£20 basis, because I think the major part of the cost goes into the installation of sewerage.</P>
      <P>Seeing that both are separate&mdash;I agree that it is a good thing to have them separate&mdash;there might be a danger, on account of the maladjustment of the amounts, that a person might be enticed or compelled to put in water and neglect sewerage.  This would be a grave danger in the case of new houses.  Up to now, if a person wanted to get a grant at all, he had to do both, but this allows him to do one or the other and the one that will most commonly be done will be the installation of water, and water only.  That is something new and the Minister is committing himself to that.  I think some steps should be taken to see that, where water is installed, there will be sewerage also.  Alterations could be made in this legislation to ensure that both will go hand-in-hand as heretofore. I entirely agree with Deputy O'Malley who says that revaluation of premises should not take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know, but there was no alteration except boring the hole.  In the similar section in the old Act the applicant had to install flush lavatories and he had to have a sink in the kitchen but now that is not necessary to get the £40 grant.  All that he has to do is to take water through a one-inch or two-inch pipe into the sink in the kitchen and for doing that he will get the £40 grant. As I say, that entails no alteration to the house except boring a hole through the wall.

They will come to the premises at any time that is convenient for them and they will revalue not only the house, but the entire premises, if it is an agricultural holding, and if there were any buildings erected since it was valued before, they will be taken into account.

      <P>Unless there was some general approach to revaluation it is <Col N="1149" /> hardly fair that the fact of getting, say £20, for the installation of sewerage should result in having this revaluation, which might not take effect in relation to the improvements carried out to one particular building.  Suppose the valuation officer found that a number of alterations had taken place since the previous valuation, to premises not attached to the dwelling-house, how would that go?  I do not know how you can get over this difficulty.  It is there and it will have a frightening effect.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith says that if somebody bores a hole to bring water into the house he will get a grant merely for that and that the valuation officer will come along and, finding other buildings, he will increase the valuation.  The valuation officer has access to such information in several other ways.  One of the ways lies in the fact that anywhere to-day you have to ask your county council for permission to build and following that, when you do build, it is the duty of every county council ganger in the area to report a new building to the county council.</P>

      <P>We all admit that the installation of water is one of the most desirable amenities for rural dwellings.  If we are serious in our purpose of encouraging people to avail of the grants now available, we ought also to be ready to reduce or do away with the impediments which are preventing these installations.  This is a very serious matter.  Even when an additional yard of space is taken in in the reconstruction of a room and an <Col N="1152" /> improvement carried out, the valuation officer comes along and revalues the whole premises.  That is one of the most serious impediments to reconstructions of dwellings all over the country.</P>
      <P>We ought to tackle that problem.  I would say the Minister is not responsible; but instead of making the exemption period seven years, he ought to make it ten years, or at any rate increase the period.  He should try to reduce the impact of this provision on people who want to bring their dwellings up to date and in order to encourage the women folk to have these amenities in their homes.  He should encourage people to continue to improve their dwellings and to continue to live in rural Ireland rather than to go away from it.  At present they cannot have these amenities without having an intolerable burden placed upon them, and it should not be the case.</P>

I indicated to him that it had come to my notice that the local authority had refused a grant for the installation of water, in a case where the public supply was deemed to be too far distant from the house to be connected.  The distance was about 200 yards or thereabouts. I do not know exactly how the provisions under what is known as Section 12 apply.  I think we all know these Section 12 cases.  All the applications go, in the first instance, to the local authority and are dealt with there.  If, in fact, the application for the water is from an applicant who would come under Section 12, I want to find out, in the first place, if the local authority refuses the application for a grant for the installation of water, does that automatically disqualify the applicant for the Government grant also?</P>

It is purely a question of fact, and the Deputy knows that as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, I referred to the question of the vesting of cottages.  The Minister has made provision in this section in regard to notice to tenants and so on.  I should like if he would clarify the position further in regard to the question of tenants who claim that due notice was not served on them when cottages were being vested and when repairs were being carried out prior to vesting.  I understand the system that was adopted, and which was given as being in order at the time, was that the engineer concerned made out a list of repairs to cottages due to be vested and that, without giving the names of the tenants, the list was submitted to the Department for approval, that the Minister's sanction was obtained in that way and that subsequently, when the lists were submitted, these people were informed they were vested without having signed anything.</P>
      <P>I submit that was entirely irregular and unfair to the tenants concerned. Would it be possible that the Minister would consider making some provision in the Bill to cover such tenants?  I know certain provision has been made because the section mentions a period of time, but in Kerry we have an outstanding grievance in this respect.  The number of tenants who claim they did not get fair treatment is limited, but I would appreciate it if the Minister would do something for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is letting himself in for a great deal of trouble under this section.  I also think he will put extra trouble in the way of county councils.  I am not clear on what the position was heretofore, but I have an idea it was something as follows: the county engineer decided what repairs were to be carried out and the applicants for vesting were then notified that vesting was about to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1155" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Now what happens under this section?  I can visualise that even where the procedure in operation heretofore has been carried out a tenant can come along and say he is not satisfied.  He can appeal to the Minister and, after having inspections by the housing engineer and the county engineer, and after the repairs have been carried out, we still will have a further inspection, possibly by an engineer of the Minister's Department and possibly a further inspection later by the county engineer, with the result that more money will be spent on inspections than on the actual repairs.  I know many local authorities are very anxious to have the large number of houses which they own transferred to the tenants and vested in them.  That is specially desirable in the case of old cottages where the rents are small and where repairs may cost a good deal. Under statute, the local authority must carry out the repairs where necessary.</P>
      <P>In some cases, a good deal of expenditure is incurred, yet the tenant can come along and appeal to the Minister and sometimes, perhaps mischievously or for some flimsy reason, say he is not satisfied and involve both the Department and the local authority in considerable expenditure.  In some counties vesting has been very slow up to now.  In my county there is a big drive afoot to have most of the old cottages vested.  That would relieve the county council and the ratepayers of a great deal of expenditure in regard to the upkeep of these cottages. I also know that tenants are willing and anxious to take over these cottages without any repairs because families have grown up and are anxious to avail of the Department's grants for reconstruction and for the installation of water and sewerage.  It is only when they are the owners of the cottages that they can avail of these grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to pretend here that we are doing something that will encourage the occupants or the tenants of these old labourers' cottages to become the owners of them.  The reason why these people will not purchase these cottages is very simple. The rents are around 1/- to 1/6 a week; these houses are getting old and becoming hard to maintain.  If the people purchase the houses, they will get a 50 per cent. reduction on the present rents which would mean in the case of the cottage with the rent of 1/6 that the rent would then be 9d.  In turn, they would have 52 ninepences to keep the cottage in repair.</P>
      <P>Everybody who is on a local body knows that it takes much more to keep that cottage in repair than the tenant would be saving by having the cottage vested in him, and the tenant realises that he is better off as he is than he would be if he purchased the cottage. Members of local bodies in this House, Ministers and ex-Ministers and everybody else, who pretend that we can induce the wholesale purchase by the tenants of these cottages by sections in Housing Bills, know quite well that we might as well be idle.  Except in a few cases in a few counties where people have purchased, the whole campaign has been against purchase for the reasons I have stated.  Local bodies know the solution to that problem, if they want to take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In all cases they know it and, having regard to the housing difficulties of various sections of the community, I often thought they were entitled to take a far more keen interest in this matter than simply to ask would the engineering repairs or the engineering inspection be fair, and so on.  I agree that when the cottage is <Col N="1159" /> repaired for vesting there is something in giving the tenant the right of appeal in the event of his being dissatisfied with any of the work that is undertaken, but it is a dangerous thing.  If the officials of the local body, the county engineer, the assistant engineer, who might be charged with making an inspection, make a report on the condition of a cottage and supervise the carrying out of the work they thought was necessary in order to put it in shape, having regard to the conditions that are laid down in the 1936 Act, I cannot see, since they are officials paid from the rates, that any of them would just set out to do the tenant an injustice in that regard.</P>
      <P>Just on the off-chance that an injustice might be done, we are providing for an appeal that can be very cumbersome and very costly from many points of view.  There are counties where cottage repairs are carried out by direct labour.  Direct labour repairs can be a very cumbersome method of dealing with this problem. Let us suppose that the council decides to have 50 or 60 cottages repaired.  I cannot speak of my own county because we have not got that system, but in County Meath they have and the council would propose sending down a direct labour squad to repair, let us say, 60 cottages in a particular area for the purpose of vesting.  That squad will go into a house and complete the job there.  When they have completed their work, they take away all the materials and go into another district.  The Minister's representative gets a letter from the tenant of the cottage and he goes down to inspect it, and who is it who could not find some little flaw even in a new house and say: &ldquo;There is something that should have been attended to?&rdquo;  Therefore, not only have you the cost of the engineering inspection but the cost of the squad coming back, with all the necessary materials, to deal with the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Theoretically, I know this amendment seems fair.  It appears to provide justice, to provide what is regarded as a court of appeal, but my contention is that while you can justify an expensive <Col N="1160" /> court of appeal as between two citizens, or as between two groups of citizens, it is a different thing when you are providing an expensive court of appeal as between a local body and one of those ratepayers.  In that case I would not suspect there would be any temptation to steal a march on the tenant by underestimating the amount of work required or scamping the work when it was in progress.  The amendment may look all right in theory but I do not think it will help to solve the problem, and while it does appear to give a right to a tenant which he had not previously, it will give it to him at great expense to all concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome this section because it is the only opportunity the individual tenant will have of getting justice.  I represent a county in which possibly more money is spent on cottage repairs than in many other counties.  We have the position in County Dublin that a good deal of money has been spent on cottage repairs. In fairness to the local authority, to the ratepayers and to the tenants a number of those cottages should have been pulled down altogether instead of being repaired. During the last few months, Dublin County Council has raised the rents of these cottages.  The tenants have, of course, been told that, when the cottages are repaired, they can purchase them at 50 per cent. of the old rent.  I am in the position that a number of people have been coming to me and saying that the local engineer went out and only half repaired the cottages.</P>

      <P>I was in one house recently in Bellview, Tolka Park.  If one wanted to ensure that somebody would develop T.B., I would say that would be the house into which to put him.  The doors and windows were repaired, but the floor is seeping with water.  Yet, it was said the cottage was repaired.  Suppose that tenant did not have the right of appeal to the Minister, where would he be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of these cottages were <Col N="1161" /> built 50 and 60 years ago, without any supervision, and they are not fit for human habitation to-day.  Dublin County Council can spend only a certain amount of money on them. Candidly, it would be a thousand times better if money were made available to pull them down rather than spend money trying to repair them.  I welcome this section because it affords some protection to the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that one change in the existing system. When the list of repairs is notified the tenant should have the right of appeal before the repairs are undertaken rather than afterwards.  The position would be the same as heretofore except that the tenant would have the benefit of this section.  The other situation is not workable and will inevitably, if it is left, involve very heavy expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the method of doing the repairs that is often the cause of the appeal.  I will give the Deputy an example.  Down in Carrick, in Deputy Brennan's constituency, I know an unfortunate tenant there who had repairs carried out to his cottage every few years.  On one occasion he notified the county council that he was anxious to have the cottage vested. The repairs were done in the ordinary way and, when they were done, a certain gentleman presented the tenant with a document and asked him to sign it.  The tenant signed.  Now he was not satisfied with the manner in which <Col N="1162" /> the repairs had been carried out.  I personally had an opportunity of examining them and I say it was malfeasance on the part of the person who carried them out.  Nevertheless, because the cottage had been vested in the meantime, the tenant had absolutely no redress.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with Deputy Brennan and Deputy Smith.  I am surprised that Deputy Cunningham should suggest that the county council spend too much money on these repairs. The Deputy thinks the cottage should be repaired and that should end it. That was his original suggestion despite the fact that State grants and supplementary county council grants are being made available to the farmer to have his house repaired.  A short time ago Deputy Cunningham advocated that tenants should not pay any rates at all on these repairs. In other words, the tenant who becomes master of his own house will be expected to do all his own repairs, pay his rent and pay his rates.  I am surprised at Deputy Cunningham.  I am surprised that he does not think more of the people in his constituency who are tenants of labourers' cottages. They are as much entitled to consideration as the big farmers in his constituency. I am astonished that he does not think of them.</P>

I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Smith who says it may be necessary to bring a squad of workmen back from one area to re-cover an area which was done before.  If the method I suggested were adopted, everyone would be clear on what repairs were to be carried out.  The Minister's loophole in that regard was to the effect that the contractor did not do his job properly.  As the Minister says, there are ways and means of dealing with that situation.  If a contractor goes into a housing scheme or into a rural <Col N="1166" /> area where there are a number of cottages and carries out repairs, our quarrel is not with the repairs but with the manner and method of carrying them out.  Why should the Minister bring in all this cumbersome machinery to deal with a contractor who did not do the work properly?  Is there not machinery there already?</P>

      <P>I think this is a very good section.  One of the reasons I welcome it is because I think the Minister has agreed that there are people who deserve houses but cannot get them because they did not qualify as agricultural labourers.  There are various classes that found it very difficult to qualify.  I should like to take the largest section first of all, that is, the women.  Suppose a woman is a widow.  Her ordinary work is to look after her family and her house by cooking, washing, and so on.  Because she was engaged in those occupations, she was not qualified as an agricultural labourer.  However, a bus conductor &mdash; who, to my mind, has very little connection with agriculture &mdash; could qualify although the job of a woman who was cooking the produce of agriculture was not regarded either as a trade or a handicraft for the purposes of being qualified as an agricultural labourer.</P>
      <P>Old age pensioners could not be qualified because, I understand, they were no longer working or, if they worked, they could not be insured and, therefore, they would not qualify but they also might need houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very deserving class of people are the blind pensioners.  A man might become blind when young. <Col N="1167" /> In fact, by the time he reached 30 years of age he might be getting the blind pension.  He might be married with a family.  Because he could not work, he could not qualify as an agricultural labourer and could not get a house.  His wife could not qualify and his daughters could not qualify either because if they went and helped a neighbour to wash and clean the house that is counted as domestic service and is ruled out specifically under the definition.  These people quite often need houses and it is found very difficult to qualify them for houses.</P>
    <P>I think this section recognises that there are these people and, though I had an amendment down which I am not allowed to move, I hope the Minister will read it and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>while I welcome such fresh devolution of authority on the elected representatives, it seems strange to me that a completely minor matter of this sort should be made a matter for the councils, when so many matters of greater importance are taken out of their hands.

      <P>That would be a more desirable way of dealing with it.  It would make for a more efficient and expeditious working of the local authority.  If the manager made a decision in the matter which was followed by the local authority, it would obviate the necessity of bringing a large number of these applications for discussion by the elected authority. Such a procedure might introduce lack of uniformity into their decisions. That is the only danger I would see of having a full-dress discussion on all these applications.  The county manager, if he drew up a rule about them, would have brought about some sort of uniformity.</P>

      <P>On the point about the classes of people who would qualify for a cottage, I should mention to the Minister that in County Kerry we seem to have a different interpretation in regard to applicants.  One instance I will mention is that in which a widow applies for the tenancy of a cottage of which her deceased husband was the tenant.  She will qualify for the tenancy, but a widow who applies for a new cottage is not regarded as qualifying.  I understand that in most other counties widows are regarded as being eligible for the tenancy of cottages.  This question of uniformity which has been referred to by Deputy Bartley should be considered by the Department and by the county managers.  It seems very peculiar that each county manager can put a different interpretation on this matter.</P>

In Section 35 of the 1948 Act, the question of priorities is referred to.  At one time, applicants afflicted with T.B. received a preference, but now I understand they are being graded down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That does seem peculiar to the ordinary person &mdash; that persons must be of a certain type to qualify for a cottage, in the first instance, and then widening the scope for vesting so that any person who becomes a vested owner of a cottage must be a tenant of that cottage or already is a tenant of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is probably brought in to clear up the legal difficulty which arises when the vested owner of a cottage was a qualified person, but where, after his death, the person resident in the cottage is not a qualified person.  There is a major difficulty there.  I understand that a case has been decided in the courts where the local authority found it difficult to eject a person who occupied a cottage after the death of the previous owner.  The decision went against the local authority.  I think this section is possibly brought in to cover up that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know that local authorities are very hesitant to take proceedings where a cottage has come into the hands of a person who is not qualified under the regulations.  It is a pity that the Minister did not go further with regard to the letting of cottages to that <Col N="1171" /> class of agricultural worker who earns £5 or £6 a week.</P>

      <P>(2)  In a case in which, by virtue of this section, a confirmation to which Section 17 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931 (No. 50 of 1931), relates is effected in two or more stages, that section shall have effect as if&mdash;</P>

      <P>(c)  sub-section (4) provided that the Order shall, as respects the land to which any such stage related, become operative at the expiration of six weeks from the date on which notice relating to that stage is published.</P>
      <P>(3) In a case in which, by virtue of this section, a first or second confirmation within the meaning of Section 43 of the Act of 1948 is effected in two or more stages, that section shall have effect as if&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  sub-section (3) or sub-section (4) (as may be appropriate) required publication of notice, in relation to each such stage, stating that the Order has been conferred <Col N="1172" /> in so far as it related to the land to which that stage related,</P>
    <P>(b)  sub-section (6) provided that the Order shall, as respects the land to which any such stage related, become operative at the expiration of three weeks from the date on which notice relating to that stage is published, and</P>
    <P>(c) in the case of a second confirmation, sub-section (5) applied in relation to each such stage as if that stage were the second confirmation.</P>
    <P>I indicated on the Second Reading that a further amendment to Section 17 might be found necessary for administrative reasons.  In the sub-section it is proposed to deal with administrative procedure and to apply the same administrative procedure to each separate confirmation as if it was a separate confirmation.  That has been brought in to meet the wishes on all sides of the House.</P>

The purpose is to enable confirmation to be given for each section of the acquisition as if it were a separate transaction.  The parliamentary draftsmen examined this section and the new sub-section has been drafted to meet the position. It proposes to apply the same administrative procedure to each stage of the acquisition as if that stage was a separate confirmation itself.  Deputies will appreciate that in a compulsory purchase prior to this it was necessary to wait for a complete decision before making a comprehensive Order.  It was not possible to make a separate Order for each portion of the land being acquired.</P>

Will the Minister now say that these people who are caught and who made application in good faith prior to the 10th March, 1956, will be covered?  Will he amend the section on Report Stage to give an opportunity of clearing themselves to the people who have already made application for loans and who have been refused loans now owing to the changed conditions and who are in a very bad way?  It will not cost the country very much to take them out of the predicament in which they are.</P>

      <P>Is there not some substance in the point raised by Deputy Burke?  The Minister has not indicated the full implications.  Is it not a fact that a local authority may propose to lend money at any interest rate they wish for a certain period but the catch is that if they lend it at a lesser rate of interest than the rate at which they borrow from the Local Loans Fund or some other source the onus is on them to find the difference in some way, which is evidently from the rates.</P>

      <P>This could have far-reaching results.  The local authority might say: &ldquo;The administration of the supplementary grant of £137 10s., or whatever it may be, costs us&mdash;not a lot&mdash;but such and such an amount. Now, instead of giving a supplementary grant to people in our local authority area, we will scrap the supplementary grant in future but we will lend money under the Small Dwellings Acts loans at a lesser rate, in other words, at a corresponding rate, which would <Col N="1178" /> save the local authority finding the £137 10s. and that will be made up to the borrower over 35 years by a lesser rate of interest.&rdquo;  That is the point I am driving at.</P>

      <P>It said that the local authority may charge not more than ½ per cent. over the rate at which they borrowed, for administrative charges.  For instance, in the case mentioned by Deputy Burke, the Limerick Corporation decided to lend the money at the rate at which they borrowed from the Local Loans Fund and added nothing for administrative charges.  I want to put this point: Under the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1956, is it not a fact that if Deputy Burke or any other Deputy or any local authority wishes to-morrow morning to cater for those who had entered into commitments before the 10th March, the local authority, whatever it costs them, can lend the money to those people?</P>

      <P>This is a class of people who are being excluded from the benefit of loans from the Local Loans Fund and, therefore, they are compelled to go to building societies.  That takes me to the experience that we have of the operations of building societies outside of Dublin.  So far as I know, they are not prepared to make loans to people outside the larger towns, the reason, presumably, being that in case of their having to foreclose, the sale-ability of the houses is in question <Col N="1180" /> outside the larger towns.  It seems to me that the throwing over of the provision of these loans to building societies will greatly restrict the number who now qualify for such loans. The freedom to fix the rate of interest will, because of these special difficulties, mean, possibly, the fixing of what will be tantamount to a penal rate of interest in a good many cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There were, as those of us who took part in this discussion know, only two matters which resulted in keeping us here much longer than we thought on these stages of the measure.  One of them was the amendment <Col N="1181" /> proposed in respect of Section 10 and the other was Section 9 of the measure now about to become law.  In spite of our efforts here yesterday, I still do not know why the Minister so abruptly came in to this House with a proposal to amend Section 10 without having some regard to Section 9.  The Minister has not given this as a reason but I suspect this is what he had at the back of his mind.</P>
      <P>In our discussion on Section 9 we were not able to get much assistance from the Minister as to the circumstances of an applicant who would be likely to be successful in an application under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  According to the Minister, he could not be a rich person. Then we got to the stage that he had to be a person of modest means. Then we got to the stage that a person of modest means was not a national school-teacher.  Then we got to the stage at which we were when we started when nobody knew, nor yet knows, what type of person was involved or in what circumstances an applicant must be in order successfully to make an application for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
      <P>I was listening to Deputy Larkin last night and he gave me a clue as to what was in the Minister's mind.  The Dublin Corporation were given money to finance activities under these Acts with the stipulation that only those who would qualify for supplementary grants were to secure advances.  From the stipulation which was attached to the £1,000,000 advanced from the Local Loans Fund to the Dublin Corporation, that only those who had received supplementary grants from that body could get these loans, I assume that the Minister amended Section 10 so as to keep, in spite of the change of circumstances, the same groups within the different categories so that every local body in the country would ultimately be pinned down to giving small dwelling loans only on the basis of persons who would qualify for these supplementary grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is what the Minister had at the back of his mind, as I suspect, one would have expected that in the course of all this discussion we would have <Col N="1182" /> got from him a clear statement to that effect.  Instead of that, we have been moving about and switching from one foot to another.  If an assurance given by the Minister, on the advice of his technicians, was found to be a wee bit generous or extravagant, then the Minister proceeded to mend his hand. The result of it all is that we are still in the dark in spite of all the time we spent in discussion here.</P>
    <P>If it is the Minister's intention to rule out from participation in the small dwelling loans all those who are outside the valuation limits or wage-earning capacities, as set out in Sections 9 and 10, and if the rest of the people who want to build houses are to be thrown over to the building societies, we know what the Minister's idea of &ldquo;modest means&rdquo; is.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, local bodies were sceptical about giving these loans except in cases where it was clear that the recipient was in a position to repay. Now apparently the Minister and the Department have at the back of their minds a ceiling which they have not openly revealed and all those who would be outside that would have to approach the building societies and insurance societies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay, a young barrister, was, on Second Reading, full of enthusiasm, and so was Deputy Esmonde, for the manner in which all these new moneys were to be released to the private builder.  These societies in the past usually made whatever funds they had surplus to their acquirements available to the Minister for Finance in his public issues from time to time.  These moneys were always available in one form or another.  Yet we listened to efforts being made by some Deputies who had not the faintest idea of what is involved in this housing proposal.  They paraded themselves one after another to justify a course of action that could only have a disastrous effect on private building.</P>
    <P>What does the guarantee in Section 9 of the Bill mean?  It means that the insurance companies or the building societies will have the right to vet the applicants, in the first instance.  They will have to approve of the giving of <Col N="1183" /> advances to applicants, and if they decide that the applicant is not a person to whom they would give money, this question of the guarantee does not arise at all.  Just imagine that we are reduced to the position in which an applicant applies for a loan to a building society or an insurance company and these institutions have a policy under which they give only 80 per cent. of the market value of the house.  That fact might prevent certain applicants from taking advantage of these loans because they would not have the other 20 per cent. to put down in order to acquire a house.</P>
    <P>We are actually coming forward in that case where the societies must first approve of the individual &mdash; and, mark you, he will have to be a very credit-worthy individual before they will approve him &mdash; and if they do not approve, this guarantee mentioned in Section 9 is not worth a jot.  But when they approve of the applicant, this section provides that the applicant's local authority may give to the insurance company or building society a guarantee &mdash; the security of the rates &mdash; for the repayment of the additional 15 per cent. the applicant would get if the money had been made available to him under the Small Dwellings Acts, in order that the company concerned will have no doubt that everything is in order.</P>
    <P>Then the State says to the local body: &ldquo;You have underwritten this 15 per cent. for applicant A; we will now underwrite you to the extent of 7½ per cent. of that 15 per cent.&rdquo;  Just imagine that the local body has to go to all these rounds to underwrite an applicant who has already been approved by the lending organisation and to whom the company or society would give 80 per cent. of the estimated value of the house.  Yet the credit-worthiness of the local authority and the State is at such a high level now that the two of them will have to sign on the dotted line before the society will give the additional 15 per cent.!  God knows it is terrible to be here and to have had to listen to and look at the things that have been going on in this place for the past few years!</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. O. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The House will recall that the Irish Sea Fisheries Association, Limited, which was incorporated in 1930 under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1913, ceased to exist in 1952 when, under the provisions of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, it was replaced by a corporate body, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, upon which the Act conferred wide executive functions and powers in relation to the development of the sea-fishing industry.  Among the financial provisions made in the latter enactment for the purpose of enabling the board to exercise or perform their functions are Section 17 which empowers the making of grants from voted moneys and Section 18 which enables the making of repayable advances subject to a limit of £500,000 in the aggregate from the Central Fund from time to time to the board.</P>
      <P>The advances already made to the board and their immediate needs are are such that the statutory limit to such advances will have been reached early in the current financial year.  Up to 31st March, 1956, advances totalling £431,612 had been made to the board leaving a balance of £68,388.  The board's requirements from the Central Fund in the current financial year are estimated to be £215,000.  The purpose of the present Bill is, therefore, to increase the present ceiling of advances that may be made to the board from the Central Fund from £500,000 to £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>Deputies will naturally wish to know the use to which the advances made to the board up to 31st March, 1956, have been put.  These advances have been utilised as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>I should explain that towards the cost of the projects at (d), (e) and (f) namely, the Killybegs fish processing station and the improvement of certain of the board's marketing depots and boat-building yards, grants to an aggregate amount of £11,110 have also been provided through the Fisheries Vote in view of the element of pioneering effort involved and of the consequential unlikelihood of its being possible to repay the cost in full from operational results.  All instalments on advances already made to the board from the Central Fund have been paid according as they fell due; the total amount repaid up to 31st March, 1956, was £15,523 12s. 2d.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provision of boats and gear and the shore development works as indicated have contributed greatly to the expansion in the sea-fishing industry which has taken place in the past few years.  The increase in catching power due to the building up of an efficient fleet of modern fishing boats is resulting in a marked improvement in the supply of demersal fish, that is, fish other than herrings and mackerel, which includes the varieties mostly required for the consumer market.</P>
    <P>The board's sales of all classes of fish in the past financial year amounted to 161,377 cwt., valued at £447,342, compared with 107,983 cwt., valued at £414,006, in the preceding year.  The shore development works carried out <Col N="1186" /> have proved of great advantage in the expansion of the board's marketing business and have made it possible to dispose of increasing quantities of fish at local centres whereas formerly almost all the landings were transferred to the Dublin and Cork wholesale markets for sale.  In the financial year 1955-56 sales at the depots established at Killybegs, Dingle, Limerick and Galway came to close on £80,000.</P>
    <P>The position of the sea-fishing industry now is that the first stage in development has been almost completed, i.e., the catching efforts of our own fishermen are now sufficient for the supply of home demand for fresh fish at the existing level.  Progress must be continued if the fishing industry is to contribute its full share to the economic life of the country by taking advantage of our fishery resources and promoting their development and use to the fullest possible extent.  That progress can only be maintained by still further increasing the catching power and by creating additional outlets including particularly the expansion of home consumer demand, employing processing methods to improve distribution and the utilisation of heavy landings of fish such as herrings and mackerel for the production of fish meal.  In this connection, the board have submitted to me a provisional advance programme of shore development works to be spread over the next five years.  These embrace facilities for improved handling and processing of fish and the extent to which a beginning is proposed to be made with them has already been given by me to the House in my opening remarks on the recent debate on the Fisheries Estimates.</P>
    <P>While the total estimated cost of carrying out the long term programme is put at £377,565, this figure cannot, in view of the possibility of labour cost and commodity price increases, be taken as any more than an indication of the order of cost of the proposals. The board in their submission of the programme suggested that about £160,000 of the total cost might be provided as grant in view of the pioneering nature of some of the proposals thus leaving the estimated requirements to be met by way of advances <Col N="1187" /> from the Central Fund at, say, £220,000.  Included in the programme is provision for the establishment of fishmeal plants.  In this connection I am glad to say private enterprise has already shown an interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards boats and gear, I am satisfied that the present rate of issue of boats to fishermen under the board's hire-purchase scheme should be maintained for some years to come.  The present cost of the issues is about £160,000 per annum and, allowing for the fact that approximately £45,000 becomes available to the board from cash sales, prepayments on boats issued and certain repayments by the fishermen, the sum required from the Central Fund for this purpose is put at £115,000 a year.  I am convinced that our fishing resources could sustain much more intensive fishing effort with adequate return to the fishermen in view of the plans envisaged for the utilisation of heavier landings.  It is essential, therefore, to provide for issues of a further sum of £500,000 for the execution of the board's proposals for shore installations and the issue of boats and gear to fishermen.  This sum will, I expect, be adequate to provide for the board's requirements by way of advances for a further period of about four years from 1st April, 1956, at the end of which period I sincerely hope that, through the employment of the moneys now sought, our sea-fishing industry will have made further substantial progress with corresponding benefit to the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the 1952 Fisheries Bill was going through, it was not possible to give details of the shore development work that would be undertaken.  However, the sum of £500,000 was mentioned as being adequate for the purposes of the Act. The Parliamentary Secretary has now been in a position to state how the money was spent.  He has read out a list of things which have been done, costing in all, £431,000.  That practically exhausts the £500,000 which was then voted.  He has also indicated that the board presented him with a further programme which will cost, in <Col N="1188" /> round figures, about £400,000.  Credit is due to the board for what they have done and the preparation of this further programme.  I doubt if the provision of £500,000 is sufficient, but I am quite satisfied that the progress that is now being made in the development of fisheries, or that has been made in recent years, will be sufficient to induce Dáil Eireann to make any further advances that are necessary.</P>
      <P>On the question of advances, I do not think the Department in charge of fisheries and the board immediately charged with the administration of sea fisheries, ought to be afraid to incur advances as against grants. There is no reason why they should not seek advances rather than grants for all the development work.  In respect of the five-year programme which was prepared by the board, I notice that £160,000 is to be sought by way of a grant and the reason given for it is that it is of a pioneering nature.  That is true, but it is advisable that we should be in a position to keep, in handy form, year by year, the up-to-date cost of all this development work.  The danger is that part of it, provided for it by way of grant, may be lost sight of and if we finance it by way of advances, these will always be an accumulated figure and we will always have a knowledge of what development costs are when the matter is under discussion.</P>
      <P>I am saying that because I have confidence in the future of the fishing industry that it will repay the advances which will be made for it.  I have no doubt that the former story of collapse in the fishing industry will not be repeated.  As I remarked on the occasion of the recent annual Estimate, I feel reasonably confident that the time may come when a great deal of the fruits of the pioneering work, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's expression, can be put on the market for private enterprise to acquire and carry on from that point forward. That is why I favour the financing of all this work by advances rather than by grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One or two points in the statement are worthy of repetition.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1189" /> Secretary states that all instalments on advances already made to the board from the Central Fund have been paid according as they fell due.  I think that statement is worthy of repetition and shows that the board has not defaulted in its repayments to the Central Fund of the annuities built up on the advances already made to them.  That is in striking contrast to the experience of the Sea Fisheries Association, particularly in regard to the pre-war period.</P>
    <P>Another fact which arises from the statements is that of all the sales of fish made by the board, practically one-fifth, or a little more, were made from the board's depots around the coast.  Practically one-fifth was entirely disposed of on the western coast between Kerry and Donegal.  That is also a development which is praiseworthy and which will lead to the rationalisation of marketing, which was badly needed.</P>
    <P>Another statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary which deserves emphasis is that the first stage in the development of the sea-fishing industry has now almost been completed, that is, the catching efforts of our own fishermen are now sufficient to supply the existing home demand for fresh fish.  That is a very satisfactory achievement and imports of fresh fish have been practically eliminated. I do not think that I should delay very long on this matter.  It is a case of renewing the moneys payable out of central funds for the purposes of the board; and these purposes are, as has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, capital purposes.  The money which has been spent is showing good fruit and the money that is now being asked for will be spent in a continuation of that developement work.</P>
    <P>In spite of the complaints which one comes up against in the public Press and elsewhere about certain inadequacies in the distribution of fish, nevertheless these inadequacies are being overhauled one by one.  As I remarked on the Estimate, certain private interests are not, perhaps, too well pleased with the developments, but I <Col N="1190" /> think these private interests have nothing to fear.  If their interests are being impinged on for the time being, I am quite satisfied that, when this industry has been finally put on its feet and is able to stand alone, these private interests will then see that, not alone the nation, but they themselves have benefited.  I think it will be a great achievement and a justification for what has been done by the public authority up to the present, when the time is reached that the State can say to these private interests: &ldquo;Now, you take over and carry on from where we left off&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that that stage will be reached, and reached in the foreseeable future, if the present progress which has been initiated by the board is continued; and I do not see any reason why it should not continue.</P>

Go dtí so, is amhlaidh a bhí Roinn an Oideachais gníomhach agus lánghníomhach in athbheochaint na Gaeilge, idir obair na scoileanna agus gach aon bheart eile dá raibh ar siúl aici.  Séard a tháinig as sin gurbh éigin do Roinn an Oideachais riar a dhéanamh ar na riachtanaisí fé leith a bhain leis an nGaeltacht, agus do dhein Roinn an Oideachais an riar san, ina cuid clár léinn, ina cuid scéimeanna agus ina cuid riaracháin i gcoitinne.</P>

An scéim Eagraíochta is Modhanna a thug ann an laghdú san, tá sé i mbun na h-oibre sin i gcónaí agus na h-oifigigh a bhfuil an Scéim acu á stiúradh, bíonn siad ag déanamh fiosrúcháin de shíor féachaint conas is fearr na modhanna oibre agus riaracháin a fheabhsú, i dtreo nach amháin laghdú fóirne a thagann as an síor-fhiosrúchán san, ach méadú éifeachta ins an obair, leis.</P>

Fé mar atá ráite agam cheana, sé is mó is cúis leis an méadú ná gur ghlac an Rialtas leis an moladh aontaithe <Col N="1195" /> a tháinig ó Chomhairle Idirréitigh na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta i leith éilimh a dhein na múinteoirí náisiúnta ar ardú tuarastail a fháil a bheadh ag teacht leis an ardú a bhí tar éis teacht ar an gcostas maireachtála agus le staid na múinteoirí sin i gcoitinne.  An t-ardú tuarastail a tugadh dá bharr sin, tháinig sé i bhfeidhm ón chéad lá de mhí Samhna, 1955.

Sa bhliain atá fé bhreithniú againn, áfach, sé sin, 1954-55, thuit an figiúir go dtí 84.6%.  Tar éis gach aon sórt a chur san áireamh, ní miste dúinn bheith sásta go maith leis siúd mar thinnreamh.</P>

Gach aon bhliain ó 1948 i leith, ba mhó de pháistí a bhí ag tinnreamh ná sa bhliain roimhe sin, i dtreo gur mhó de 44,000 an tinnreamh sa bhliain 1954-55 ná sa bhliain 1946-47.

An líon iomlán de mhúinteoirí breise a bheidh ann de bharr an dá sciathán nua a chur leis an dá Choláiste, beidh siad ag dul i mbun oibre ins na scoileanna fé cheann dhá bhliain eile.  Is amhlaidh a bheidh an scéal fén am sin ná go mbeidh 110 de bhun-mhúinteoirí oilte breise ag teacht amach gach aon bhliain&mdash;sin 335 ar fad de bhan-mhúinteoirí oilte in aghaidh na bliana.  Ní h-olc an líon é sin.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú nua ann, leis, chun Céimithe oiriúnacha, idir lucht Pas agus lucht Onóracha, a ligint isteach ins na Coláistí Oiliúna chun cúrsa bliana a dhéanamh.  Go dtí seo is amhlaidh ná maithtí leath an Chúrsa ach do na Céimithe Onóracha.  Cé ná fuil ach beagán de na Céimithe ag cur isteach ar an gcúrsa bliana so, mar sin féin tá dóithin díobh á dhéanamh lena thoradh a fheiceál i bhfreastal na práinne.  Idir an dá am, go dtí go mbeidh freastal iomlán déanta ar an bpráinn sin, sé sin, an ganntanas múinteoirí oilte, tá cead á thabhairt do mhúinteoirí a bhfuil na cúig bliana is trí fichid slánaithe acu agus iad ina sláinte agus dea-sheirbhís tugtha acu, tá cead á thabhairt dóibh sin leanúint den obair, ach a gcuid Bainisteoirí bheith sásta, go dtí deireadh na ráithe ina mbeidh ocht mbliana is trí fichid bainte amach acu.  An síneadh seirbhíse sin agus an méadú ar an líon múinteoirí oilte atá ag teacht amach, sa mhéid nach leor é sin chun freastail ar a bhfuil de <Col N="1197" /> phostanna díomhaoin ann, is amhlaidh atáthar ag glacadh go sealadach le daoine nach bhfuil an ghnáth-cháilíocht mhúinteoirí acu.  Táthar ag ceapadh gur cheart gur leor a mbeidh de mhúinteoirí oilte ann fé cheann dhá bhliain le riar, do réir na rialúchán atá ann fé láthair, ar an riachtanas.</P>
    <P>An tuarastal agus an sochar atá ag na múinteoirí Náisiúnta, bhí cur is cúiteamh i measc an phobail ina dtaobh san i gcaitheamh na bliana. Is amhlaidh a chuir Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta dhá éilamh fá bhráid an ghléas Idirréitigh agus Eadrána, an gléas úd a rabhas féin agus Aire an Airgeadais rannpháirteach ann.  Ar an gcéad áse, do bé rud a d'éiligh an Cumann ná tuarastal na múinteoirí Náisiúnta bheith ar aon dul le tuarastal na Meán-mhúinteoirí agus na gCeard-mhúinteoirí.  Níor éirigh le Comhairle an Idirréitigh teacht ar aonfhocal ina thaobh san agus chuir na múinteoirí an scéal ansan fé bhráid Bhord na hEadrána.  Bé Cathaoirleach a bhí ar an mBhord san ná a Onóir an Breitheamh Conroy, Cathaoirleach a ceapadh le h-aontú an dá thaobh, fé mar a bhí leagtha amach sa Scéim. Bé breith an Bhoird ná gan glacadh leis an éileamh san ach a mholadh coigeartú áirithe a dhéanamh ar na scálaí tuarastail.  Do ghlac an Rialtas leis an moladh san.  Ba mhaith liom bheith i riocht a rá gurbh shásúil iad imeachta an Bhoird agus gach ní dár bhain leis an scéal ina dhiaidh sin, ach ar an drochuair is amhlaidh a chuaidh na múinteoirí ag cáineadh go géar agus ag déanamh agóide in aghaidh cuid den fhianaise go raibh an taobh oifigiúil tar éis é a thabhairt sa tseisiún poiblí den Bhoird.</P>
    <P>Le linn dom an scéal a chur i láthair na Dála i mí Shamhna so caite agus mé ag tabhairt isteach an Mheastacháin Breise ba ghá chun moladh an Bhoird a chur i bhfeidhm, do thugas ráiteas uaim in ar phléas an cáineadh agus an agóid úd tríd síos, agus bhí súil agam go bhféadfaimís ansan ár mbeannacht a scaoileadh leis mar scéal. Do b'abhar buartha dom, dá réir sin, a thabhairt fé ndeara gur deineadh an scéal a chur fé dhíospóreacht agus gur deineadh ábhar rúin de sa Chomhdháil <Col N="1198" /> Bhliantúil de Chumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta a tionóladh um Chaise.  Is maith liom, áfach, bheith i riocht a rá gur éirigh leis an gComhairle Idirréitigh teacht ar aonfhocal i mí na Nollag so caite i dtaobh an dara h-éilimh a tháinig ó Chumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta, éileamh ar scálaí tuarastail ní b'fhearr a thabhairt dóibh.  Cúis áthais dom iseadh é bheith lena rá agam gurbh é sin an dara h-ócáid in-ar thánathas ar aonfhocal i dtaobh scálaí tuarastail na múinteoirí Náisiúnta a athrú go tábhachtach.  Bé chéad ócáid i n-ar thárla san ná mí Eanáir, 1951, gairid tar éis an chéad Chomhairle a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom an dea-scéala bheith agam don Dáil gur tréan atáthar ag cur tithe scoile nua in áit na dtithe scoile seana-chaite.  Sa bhliain darbh chríoch an t-aonú lá triochad de mhí Mhárta, 1956, do cheadaigh an Roinn deontas le 92 do thíthe scoile nua a thógail agus le mórshíneadh a chur le 43 eile nó bail eile den saghas san a chur orthu, agus fós le mion-bhail a chur ar a lán eile títhe scoile.  Sé iomlán na ndeontas a ceadaíodh i leith gach aon tsaghais acu san ná £1,543,590, agus sé an costas iomlán ná £1,796,798 tar éis an £253,203 a bhailíonn na Bainisteoirí san áit (14.1% den iomlán) a chur le deontaisí an Stáit.  An obair atá i gceist leis an airgead san, ní h-iontuigthe, ar ndó, go bhfuil sé déanta fós.  Ach sé gnó Choimisinéirí na nOibreach Poiblí brící agus moirtéal a dhéanamh den airgead san in am trátha.</P>
    <P>Sé iomlán ar chaith na Coimisinéirí ar thíthe scoile a thógáil agus ar bhail a chur ar thíthe scoile sa bhliain darbh chríoch an t-aonú lá triochad de mhí Mhárta, 1956, ná £1,043,488 agus sé líon tithe scoile nua a criochnaiodh le linn na tréimhse sin ná dhá cheann is dachad.</P>
    <P>Tar éis do Chumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta bheith á áiteamh orm an córas cigiríochta ar na scoileanna Náisiúnta a athrú go bunúsach, do dheineas socrú chun dul in agallamh leis na Bainisteoirí agus na múinteoirí ar an aonú lá triochad de mhí Eanáir seo caite.  Bhí a Ghrása, Ard-Easpag Bhaile Átha Cliath, i láthair thar <Col N="1199" /> ceann na nEaspag agus i dteanta ionadaithe na Roinne agus na múinteoirí do bhí i láthair, leis, ionadaithe ó gach aon dream bainisteoirí scoileanna nach mór.  Do bé Rúnai Roinn an Oideachas a bhí sa chathaoir.  Do lean na h-imeachta ar feadh dhá lá agus na pointí go léir a bhí fé dhíospóireacht táid á mbreithniú go cúramach fé láthair.</P>
    <P>Is mór an sásamh dom a bheith le h-insint agam go bhfuil ag méadú ar an soláthar atá á dhéanamh i gcóir na leanbhaí go bhfuil éalaing orthu. Má chuirtear san áireamh scoileanna i gcóir leanbhaí atá dall agus leanbhaí atá bodhar, tá timpeall caoga scoil ann anois atá nascaithe le h-ospidéil, le sanatoria agus le h-ioclanna (clinicí). I ngach aonscoil acu san tá an clár leagtha amach go speisialta chun bheith in oiriúint do na riachtanaisí fé leith a bhaineann le gach saghas des na saghasanna san leanbh.  Tá soláthar ann, leis, d'fhoirinn bhreise. Is mór an t-áthas a chuireann sé orm buíochas a ghabháil le bainisteoirí agus le múinteoirí na scoileanna san as ucht na sár-oibre atá acu á dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Sé Meastachán atá ann do Bhóta 41 ná £1,082,110 glan.  £71,420 de bhreis ghlan is ea é sin ar Mheastachán na bliana so caite.  Siad an dá mheadú mhóra ná an t-airgead breise atá le h-íoc i leith na ndeontas caipitíochta agus i leith incrimintí tuarastail.</P>
    <P>An £30,000 de bhreis atá dá sholáthar i leith na ndeontas caipitíochta, sé is cúis leis sin ná líon níos mó de dhaltaí bheith ag tinnreamh ar na meán-scoileanna. Sé líon a bhí ann sa bhliain 1954-55 ná 56,485 agus 59,306 a bhí ann sa bhliain 1955-56, sé sin, 2,821 thar an mbliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>An £39,000 breise atá á sholáthar i leith incrimintí tuarastail, is é is bun leis sin ná an méadú is dual ar na h-incrimintí bliantúla agus fós an méadú atá ar líon na múinteoirí atá ag tarrac incrimintí.  2,584 des na múinteoirí sin a bhí ann sa bhliain 1955-56, sé sin, 106 thar mar a bhí ann an bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>An chuid eile den mhéadú atá ar Bhóta an Mheán-Oideachais, sé is cúis leis ná an fás a tháinig fén líon ranganna ar a dtugtar deontas fé leith <Col N="1200" /> i leith na hEolaíochta, na hEolaíochta Tís agus na Siúinéireachta, agus ina theanta san an fás atá fén líon iarrthóirí atá ag cur isteach ar na Scrúdaithe Teistiméireachta.  Is riachtanach de bharr an fháis sin níos mó ionad scrúdúcháin bheith ann agus níos mó feitheoirí agus scrúdaitheoirí a cheapadh.</P>
    <P>Is é líon ranganna Eolaíochta ar ar tugadh an deontas fé leith ná 2,392, sé sin, 179 de bhreis ar an méid a bhí ann an bhliain roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>An líon iarrthóirí a thug fén dá Scrúdú Teistiméireachta i mbliana, chuaidh sé beagán thar 20,000, sé sin, 1,000 de bhreis ar an mbliain seo caite.</P>
    <P>Ceithre chéad seachtó is a ceathair de mheán-scoileanna aithinte a bhí ann anuraidh.  As an méid sin bhí 229 ina raibh an teagasc iomlán nó cuid den teagasc á thabhairt tré Ghaeilge, agus as an 229, san bhí 88 gur tré Ghaeilge a tugadh an teagasc iomlán iontu (ach amháin sa chuid den teagasc ins na nua-theangacha a tugtar ins na teangacha san féin).</P>
    <P>Ní airítear puinn ó cheann ceann na bliana i dtaobh na h-oibre a bhíonn ar siúl ins na meán-scoileanna, ach an dream dílis dúthrachtach atá i mbun na scoileanna san, más ciúin féin iad, is é ciúineas an tsrutháin doimhin acu é.  Pé léirmheas is féidir a dhéanamh ar chóras na meán-scoileanna&mdash;agus an córas oideachais atá gan locht tá sé le ceapadh fós&mdash;is deimhin gurb é an dea-spiorad a bhíonn taobh thiar den obair agus a bhíonn á mhúnlú, is deimhin gurb é an dea-spiorad san an chuid bhunúsach den saothar.  Ina thaobh san tá an saol mór á adhmáil gur maith a thuigeann lucht stiúrtha ár meán-scoileanna a ngnó.  Is é gnó é sin ná fir agus mná ionraice dúthrachtacha a dhéanamh des na buachaillí agus na cailíní a bhíonn fén-a gcúram. An dea-shaothar úd atá ag na meán-scoileanna á dhéanamh, níl aon chuid de shaol na hÉireann ná fuil a thoradh len n-a bhraith ann.</P>
    <P>Cloistear ó am go h-am an gearán go bhfuil an iomad den acadúlachas ag baint leis an meán-scolaíocht.  Iad súd a mbíonn an port san ar siúl acu, is baol go ndearmhadann siad gurb é nádúir agus gnó na meán-scoileanna <Col N="1201" /> bheith acadúil.  Dá mb'amhlaidh a bhéadh na meán-scoileanna tar éis na leabhair a chaitheamh uathu agus na cearda láimhe agus cearda den saghas san a chur ina n-áit, ní meán-scoileanna in ao'chor a bheadh iontu.</P>
    <P>Is é is dóichí, áfach, gurb é brí is minicí leis an bport úd i dtaobh na meán-scoileanna bheith ró-acadúil ná gur tharla a lán daoine óga ag freastal ar na scoileanna san agus go bhfuil cuid des na daoine óga san gur mhó a raghadh sé chun tairbhe agus chun sásaimh dóibh bheith ag gabháil do chúrsaí ceirde ná na leabhair.  B'fhéidir gur fíor san, ach chaithfí dul rud beag níos sia leis an scéal.  Sa chéad chás de, tá ceart bunúsach ag na tuismitheoirí a gclann a chur ar a rogha féin scoil, ach thairis sin arís, is fíor-annamh nach ag na tuismitheoirí féin is fearr 'fhios cad í an scoil is oiriúnaí dá gclainn.  Go deimhin féin, ins na h-áiteacha úd ina bhfuil an Stát ag toghadh na scoile, ní hé a thuigim gurb é rogha an Stáit an rogha is fearr i gcónaí.  Bíodh san mar atá, áfach, ní hé ba mhian liom a rá gurb iad na leabhair tús agus deireadh clár léinn na meán-scoileanna. Ina thaobh san táim tar éis a lua cad é an tsuim bhreise atá á lorg sa Bhóta so chun na saotharlanna Eolaíochta a chothabháil agus chun fearaistí a chimeád leo, agus fós chun abhair eile ceirde a mhúineadh.</P>
    <P>Tá beart eile agus cé nach féidir a rá gur abhar.  &ldquo;úsáideach&rdquo; atá i gceist leis, is deimhin gur maith linn go léir go bhfuil ag éirí leis fé mar atá. Sé abhar é sin ná an oiliúint a tugtar sa Cheól, idir chóracha ceoil agus ceol-bhuíonta.  Sa bhliain 1948-49 do b'é lion na gcóracha ceoil agus na gceoil-bhuíonta a bhí fé scrúdú ná 193 agus 53, fé seach.  224 (dhá céad, fiche is a ceathair) de chóracha ceoil agus 64 de cheol-bhuíonta a bhí fé scrúdú anuraidh.  I rith na n-ocht mblian úd, a luas, do bé an meán-líon a chuir isteach ar an scrúdú ná 217 de chóracha agus 57 de cheol-bhuíonta. Rud is fearr arís ná san, má ghlacaimíd na cúig bliana so caite, bé meán-líon na gcóracha ceoil ná 225 de chóracha agus 59 de cheol-bhuíonta.</P>
    <P>Gné eile den mheán-oideachas gur ábhar sásaimh é isea gur mhéadaigh <Col N="1202" /> ar an líon A-scoileanna.  Is fíor gurb é a raibh de mhéadú ann aon scoil amháin, ach is fíor leis gur ag dul i laghad a bhí an líon A-scoileanna roimhe sin.  An trághadh úd d'iompódh ina thuile mar sin, b'fhéidir gur chúis amháin leis gurbh eadh na beartanna a deineadh le bliain anuas chun deontais áirithe a thabhairt go mear tapaidh ar Bhóta 41E chun a chur ar chumas do lucht foilsithe taobh amuigh den Roinn téacsleabhair oirúnacha, go mórmhór téacsleabhair Laidne is Staire, a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge.  Tá beartaithe agam leanúint den chabhair sin a thabhairt imbliana ar feadh ar féidir é sin a dhéanamh taobh istigh den Bhóta.</P>
    <P>Nil aon bhreithniú fé leith agam a dhéanamh anso ar chlárléinn na meán-scoileanna. Rud amháin ba chúis dom gan é sin a dhéanamh do b'eadh an rogha ábhar bheith comh fairsing sin, i dtreo nach ionann clár do gach aon scoil ná fiú do gach aon dalta san aon-scoil.  Sé is príomhchúis dom gan bheith ag breithniú an chláir go ró-mhion ná go bhfuilim tar éis a iarraidh ar an gComhairle Oideachais, fé mar adúrt cheana, é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe amháin eile i dtaobh an mheán-oideachais nach miste a lua. Sé pointe é sin ná gur bunaíodh sa bhliain seo caite Scéim Buan Idirréitigh agus Eadrána dos na Meán-mhúinteoirí. Tá gach aon mhuinín agam gurb é a thiocfaidh as an mbuan-scéim san ná an tuarastal incriminteach agus gach sochar eile a bhíonn á saothrú ag na Meán-mhúinteoirí aithinte a riar is a shocrú feasta le lán-ord is eagar.</P>
    <P>Tá £61,350 de mhéadú ar an meastachán glan i gcóir an GhairmOideachais. £1,118,160 a bhí ann anuraidh agus £1,179,510 atá á iarraidh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>An £79,751 de mhéadú atá ar na deontais bhliantúla atá iníoctha le Coistí Gairm-Oideachais, sé is bun leis ná an riachtanas atá ann an borradh atá fés na scéimeanna do chimeád ar siúl.  An méadú san, tá ann, i dteanta gach éinní eile, soláthar chun tuarastal níos fearr a thabhairt dos na múinteoirí, chun a thuille múinteoirí d'fhostú, chun riar ar fhás <Col N="1203" /> na n-incrimintí atá iníoctha agus ar chostaisí eile a bhaineann le cúrsaí tuarastail i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>An leathnú atá fén nGairm-Oideachas, ní fearra slí lena mheas ná cuimhneamh gur b'é suim airgid a ceadaíodh sa bhliain seo caite lena chaitheamh ar thíthe scoile a thógáil agus síneadh a chur le títhe scoile áirithe ná £234,080 agus gurbh é suim a ceadaíodh lena chaitheamh mar an gcéanna sa dá mhí tosaigh den bhliain airgeadais seo ná £187,850. Ar ndó, an tsuim a ceadaítear in aon bhliain áirithe, ní dóigh go gcaithfear é go léir sa bhliain sin ná in aon bhliain áirithe eile.  Ní foláir nó beidh aga áirithe idir an uair a ceadaítear an caiteachas agus an uair a chaithfear an t-airgead tirim a chur síos i leith na tógála.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain airgeadais 1955-56, áfach, is amhlaidh a críochnaíodh tógáil deich dtíthe nGairm-scoile agus a cuireadh síneadh le deich gcinn eile.</P>
    <P>Comhartha eile den bhorradh atá fés na Gairm-scoileanna is eadh an méadú úd ó £39,700 go dtí £45,000 atá measta fé Mhir-Cheann H ná an 50% d'aisíoc a dheineann an Stát leis na h-Údaráis Áitiúla ins na h-iasachta a gheibheann na hÚdaráis sin fé réir Ailt 51 den Acht.  Is amhlaidh a gheibheann na hÚdaráis Áitiúla na h-iasachta úd chun deontais a chur ar fáil dos na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais chun a chur ar chumas na gCoistí títhe scoileanna a thógáil agus síneadh agus méadú a chur le títhe scoile eile.</P>
    <P>An tsuim airgid atá ceadaithe a chaitheamh go dtí seo, ní beag an riaráiste de atá fós gan caitheamh, agus idir sin agus a dheacracht is atá sé teacht ar bhun-airgead fé láthair i gcóir tógála agus a leithéid, is baol nach féidir bheith ró-fhial ar fad i mbliana le scéimeanna a cheadú, gur ghá bun-airgead ina gcóir, ach amháin i gcás scéimeanna atá fíor-phráinneach.  Táim ag ceapadh gur mó san scéim go mbéifear ag brú go dian orm ina thaobh i rith na bliana agus gan an bun-airgead ann chuige.  Na Coistí a mbeidh ceataí den saghas san ag cur isteach orthu, tá súil agam go dtuigfidh siad conas mar atá an scéal agus go mbeidh siad sásta <Col N="1204" /> brughadh fúthu go fonnmhar foidhneach gan chás gan cheasna le lánmhúinín go dtiocfaidh an uair ina mbeidh an scéal ar deil arís.</P>
    <P>Beidh tugtha fé ndeara ag na Teachtaí go bhfuiltear ag súil go mbeidh £14,915 de laghdú ar chostas oiliúna Gairm-oidí ón £44,565 costais a bhí air anuraidh.  Sé is mó is cúis leis an laghdú mór san ná go bhfuarthas nár ghá a thuilleadh de na Cúrsaí fada oiliúna le haghaidh múinteoirí a bhunú i rith na bliana airgeadais seo.</P>
    <P>Ar na Cúrsaí Oiliúna a bhí bunaithe agus atá ar siúl fós, tá Cúrsa sa Mhiotalóireacht (sé dhuine dhéag á leanúint) agus Cúrsa sa Tuaitheolaíocht (fiche duine á leanúint).  Do tosnaíodh ar an dá chúrsa san mí Dheireadh Fómhair 1955, agus cuirfear críoch leo i ndeireadh mhí an Mheitheamh, 1957.</P>
    <P>Ar na cúrsaí go mbeidh críoch á chur leo ag deireadh an tSéisiúin seo, tá Cúrsa san Adhmadóireacht (duine 's fiche á leanúint) agus Cúrsa sa Mhiotalóireacht (cúig dhuine dhéag á leanúint).</P>
    <P>Ar a bheith críochnaithe do na cúrsaí san beidh an scéal sa riocht agus nach miste don Roinn a rá go bhfuil freastal déanta ar na riaráisti a bhí ann maidir le dóthain mhúinteoirí do chur ar fáil le haghaidh na n-ábhar teicniúil.  Ní hé atá agam á rá go bhfuil réiteach iomlán déanta ar cheist múinteoirí a sholáthar mar, de bharr a bhfuil d'éileamh ann i ngnóthaí tionscalaíochta, tá ganntanas ar fuaid an domhain den sórt áirithe daoine sin ar a dtabharfaí múinteoirí teicneolaíochta. Ní thánathas ar réiteach sásúil fós i dtír ar bith i dtaobh conas ab fhearr a fhéadfadh na scoileanna dul san iomaíocht leis an saol tionscalaíochta ar son seirbhísí an lucht teicneolaíochta so agus gan tranglam í dtaobh tuarastail agus nithe eile a thabhairt i bhfáth.</P>
    <P>Do dheineas tagairt anuraidh do chríoch a bheith á chur an tráth san le cúrsa oiliúna do mhúinteoirí Foirgneolaíochta. Triail-iarracht ab ea í gur éirigh go hard léi agus is geal liom a rá nach raibh deacair ar bith ó thaobh fostaíochta ar na múinteoirí nua-oilte san ach gur amhlaidh a bhí Coistí ag sárú a chéile ag iarraidh a gcuid seirbhísí. <Col N="1205" /> Is mór an chreidiúint dóibh go léir é sin, idir Choistí agus mhúinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Níl aon easpa tuisceana ar an Roinn i dtaobh a mbaineann de thábhacht leis na múinteoirí Foirgneolaíochta san mar ghrúpa.  Tá á bheartú gearr-chúrsa speisialta sa Lámh-Oiliúint agus sa Chaibinéideacht a chur ar siúl dóibh i gColáiste Charman mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Rud eile is fiú a lua ina dtaobh isea go bhfuil an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais agus an Roinn seo agamsa ag déanamh comhairle le chéile féachaint cad é an tslí ab fhearr a fhéadfaí seirbhísí cuid des na múinteoirí sin a chur chun tairbhe fé chúram Roinn na Talmhaíochta.</P>
    <P>Ar na gearr-Chúrsaí a déanfar a reachtáil i mbliana tá Cúrsa Samhraidh sa Tuaitheolaíocht agus Cúrsa sa Ghaeilge agus in Ábhair Leanúna.  Tá san á dhéanamh ionas go mbeadh de chaoi ag múinteiorí áirithe iad féin a cháiliú i gcóir buan-phostanna lánaimsireacha.</P>
    <P>Ar na Cúrsaí Athchleachtaithe atá á mbeartú, tá Cúrsa sa Ghúnadóireacht a tionólfar i gColáiste Oiliúna Chaitríona do cheathrar agus fiche d'oidí Tís a roghnófar chuige; Cúrsa sa Líníocht agus Dathadóireacht a tionólfar i gColáiste Náisiúnta na hEalaíon do dhá dhuine dhéag d'oidí a roghnófar chuigesin; Cúrsa d'oidí múinte ábhar a bhaineann le Grósaeireacht agus Dáiliú Mionreice go ndéanfar é a thionól i gColáiste Oiliúna Phádraig i gcómhar le Cúrsa Samhraidh lucht R.G.D.A.T.A.; agus Cúrsa sa Leictreonaíocht a tionólfar san Institiúid Eolaíochta agus Teicneolaíochta i Sráid Chaoimhín.</P>
    <P>Is as an ioncam atá ag teacht de bharr Tiomna Hardiman a díolfar na costaisí le haghaidh na léachtaithe eachtracha a bheidh ag teastáil chun an Chúrsa sa Ghúnadóireacht agus chun an Chúrsa sa Dáiliú Mionreice.</P>
    <P>I gcaitheamh na bliana so caite do chuathas chun cinn go maith maidir le Córas Idirréitigh agus Eadrána a chur ar fáil do Ghairm-mhúinteoirí.  Sé staid atá ar an ngnó fé láthair ná go bhfuil dréacht-scéim de chuid na Roinne curtha fé bhráid chumann na gCoistí <Col N="1206" /> (ós iad na Coistí údarás fostaíochta na múinteoirí) agus fé bhráid Chumann na Múinteoirí freisin, agus tá an dá pháirtí tar éis glacadh leis an dréacht-scéim ó thaobh prionsabail de.  Tá dóchas láidir agam gur gairid eile go mbeidh scéim chomh-aontaithe ar bun dá réir sin.</P>
    <P>An £20,541 de laghdú glan atá sa Bhóta so, tarlaíonn an chuid is mó de de bharr £9,000 de laghdú fé mhírcheann B. 9. féna ndeintear deontaisí a sholáthar chun Coláistí Gaeilge a thógaint sa Ghaeltacht agus, ina theanta san, de bharr gurbh éigin £9,731 de Mheastacán Breise a thabhairt ilíthair i rith na bliana anuraidh chun go gceannófaí bailiúchátach, luachmhar de earraí airgid den seandéantús Éireannach mar, muna ndeintí san, ba ró-bhaol go n-imeodh na hearraí luachmhara san as seilbh an náisiúin go brách.</P>
    <P>An £9,000 san de laghdú fé Mhírcheann B.9. (Deontaisí do Choláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht), tarlaíonn sé de bharr go raibh comhlánú déanta um dheireadh na bliana airgeadais seo caite ar na scéimeanna go léir a bhí ar láimh.  An £500 atá á sholáthar sa bhliain airgeadais reatha so, sé gnó atá dhe ná chun ioc as mionchostaisí a bhain leis na scéimeanna san ach ná raibh tagtha chun aibiúcháin roimh an aonú lá tríochad de mhí na Márta seo caite.</P>
    <P>Tá breis bheag agus £4,000 de shábháil a dhéanamh fé Mhírcheann B.1 (foilseacháin i nGaeilge) agus sé is cúis leis ná go dtáinig foilseacháin áirithe costasúla chun láimhe ins na blianta roimhe seo.</P>
    <P>Níl aon athrú eile ab fhiú a rá ar an Bhóta le haghaidh Eolaíochta agus Ealaíon, ach amháin an £500 is gnáth a thabhairt gach bliain mar dheontas i gcabhair don Ard-Mhusaem chun samplaí a cheannach (Mírchann A.5.), go bhfuil san á ardú i mbliana go dtí £1,500 agus go bhfuiltear ar intinn go ndéanfar amhlaidh gach bliain feasta.  Sé aigne atá leis sin ná go gcuirfí ar a n-acmhainn do lucht údaráis an Mhusaem ciste beag a chur le chéile ionas go mbeadh ar a gcumas tairiscint a dhéanamh dá dtagadh cuspa éigin luachmhar a bhain le <Col N="1207" /> seandaíocht nó eagnaíocht dúchais na tíre ar an margadh agus gan moill a chur orthu mar is éigean a tharlaíonn nuair is gá Meastachán Breise a iarraidh go speisialta chun a leithéide.  I rith na bliana so caite, mar adúirt cheana, dob éigean Meastachán Breise a thabhairt i láthair ag iarraidh £10,000 chun bailiúchán fíor-luachmhar d'earraí airgid don sean-déantús Éireannach a cheannach, mar muna ndeintí san, bheadh an tír á n-uireaspa go brách. Sa tslí chéanna, i rith na bliana seo caite, tháinig bailiúchán neamhchoitianta den ngloine Éireannach ar an margadh go hobann agus de bharr an nua-réitigh seo le haghaidh deontas i gcabhair, d'éirigh le lucht údaráis an Mhusaem an bailiúchán a fháil ar luach réasúnta agus níor ghá aon Mheastachán Breise chuige.</P>

      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration, not in any general criticism of the Department of Education but because the rules of this House sometimes preclude our discussing matters that are really relevant to an Estimate and thus make the discussion on the Estimate less valuable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1210" /> A Deputy occupies a specific position in this House and I hold the view that Deputies on all sides of the House should insist on the privileges that are their due as representatives of the people and that they should not be put in this House in any secondary position. No matter how we may hope that our intellects remain clear, the attrition of the years imposes certain physical disabilities on all of us.  Even at the best of times I find it difficult to follow the turgid Gaelic prose of the Department of Education, particularly as read by the Minister.  It has been the customary courtesy to distribute a copy of the Minister's brief to those who intended to take part in the discussion. The brief was handed to the officials of this House.  It was handed to the Press and it was only as an afterthought that the courtesy was extended to the Deputies.  That should not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is true. I would not make the statement if it were not true.  I resent it on behalf of the members of the House.  I should expect that the speech of the Minister for Education should be something other than a mere iteration of facts that are discoverable elsewhere and that he should give us something of his ideas on the philosophy of education. He speaks at the outset about the Council of Education and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not feel, therefore, that at this stage I can usefully say any more about the council's report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an educationist.  I have certain views on education which are supported in general by educationists. One of these is that in the primary schools it is better that pupils should be taught a few subjects effectively and not secure a useless smattering of a number of subjects.  As far as I remember, instead of cutting down or attempting to cut down the number of <Col N="1211" /> subjects taught or half taught in the primary schools, the Council of Education simply recommended the addition of two other subjects to the curriculum in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>Surely the people who ought to know best about teaching children are the trained teachers.  They are everlastingly making protests against the over-loading of the curriculum.  Surely even the Minister at this stage should have very decided views as to whether there should be a greater or lesser number of subjects taught in the primary schools.  I think that in recommending the addition of two extra subjects to the curriculum in the primary schools the Council of Education condemns itself and might reasonably be abolished now.</P>
    <P>I have been very much concerned with the condition of school buildings. The equipment in itself, the furnishings and decorations are all part of the child's education.  They influence the child's character.  We have so many schools really unfit for human habitation I am rather surprised that, no matter what other difficulties in which the Government may find itself, it should not be pressing more hardily forward towards the destruction of the defective school and replacing it by the new school.  I am not by any means satisfied that we are making the progress we should make with the matter.</P>
    <P>I realise the difficulty of the Minister in regard to the securing of finance for the work of education and I think a completely new outlook in regard to the costs of education is eminently desirable.  The money provided this year may be adequate for education as undertaken to-day but if we are to provide sufficient teachers and reduce the number of children in the over-crowded classes it will cost a good deal of money.</P>
    <P>I had the view until recently that in kindergarten classes it was not very material whether there should be 30 or 40 but reading some articles recently I realise that children of a tender age in the kindergarten require as much supervision as anybody else.  If we are to avoid accidents and cases in court <Col N="1212" /> against teachers, we need a good many more teachers under present circumstances. It is not enough for the Minister to say: &ldquo;We have, thanks to this person or that, greatly extended the numbers of teachers in training at the moment.&rdquo;  The number of teachers in training at the moment will merely make up for the wastage of those who are retiring.</P>
    <P>We need many more teachers, if only to ensure that the classes in the primary schools will be of such size as to permit of effective teaching.  But it has long been the view, held by most people, that the school leaving age should be raised.  Even the Commission on Education has seen the light in that respect or at least some of the light and recommended that the school leaving age be raised to fifteen.  Those who glibly recommend the raising of the school leaving age do not, apparently, realise the commitments that must be entered into if such a condition is to be brought about.  First of all, we need many more teachers.</P>
    <P>It is the ambition of the boy or girl of 14 years of age who is, we shall say, qualified to leave the primary school at that age, to leave school.  If boys or girls are kept in the same building under the same teacher for a further year after 14, there will be nothing done in that year.  If we are to raise the school-leaving age, as it must be raised and should be raised, a completely new set of conditions must be created for the older children.  At least there must be a new room in the school for them; it would even be far better if they had a new building. Possibly an extension of the vocational system might meet the problem but if anybody thinks that without extra teachers, without extra rooms or buildings, he can successfully raise the school-leaving age he is labouring under a very false impression.  I want to point out that this House must face up to the fact that a good deal more money must be spent on education.  If the Minister has any intention of seeking that money at any time he will get the fullest support from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Following that viewpoint, the Minister speaks of the number of extra <Col N="1213" /> teachers that will be available as a result of the extension of the training colleges.  I am afraid that the extension of existing training colleges will not be enough if we are to have a sufficient number of teachers for the work we have to do and that we will have to get back the training college that was given away and reopen it as a college.</P>
    <P>I am rather slow of apprehension and I am at a disadvantage because of the lateness of the hour when I got the Minister's brief but I did see something very beautiful here which is a tribute to some form of education, and it sounds to me like the Greyhound Bill.  &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; the Minister said, &ldquo;that the Committees who may be faced with difficulties arising out of the delay in giving such sanctions will appreciate the position and will be able to maintain a constructive patience born of a secure hope and purpose.&rdquo;  Insufficient purpose and forlorn hope!</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken here on a few occasions about the National Library and its needs and I have searched in vain through the Minister's Gaelic brief and through the English translation and I have found no word about the National Library.  Does the Minister or the Department realise the position the National Library is in; that at least some gesture must be made at some time, some sort of promise made that something will be done to put the National Library into effective operation?  We have endless money for land reclamation and land division and God knows what the effects of these are.  I spoke of land division here some time ago as a form of ineffective social welfare&mdash;which it is&mdash;but we have endless money for it and endless money for land reclamation&mdash;reclaiming land which very often the farmer neglects again.  But here <Col N="1214" /> is real reclamation in education, and I think the Minister must take his courage in his hands and demand more money for the National Library.  There is no use in the Minister giving any sarcastic smiles about it.  It is very wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speak up like a man. The next thing is the National Gallery and the Minister says there is no important change in the provision for the National Gallery.  That is a confession of failure.  I thought there might at least be a provision for a few bags of sawdust to throw on the tiled floor of the National Gallery, at least to give it the cheery appearance of a public house instead of the dull dismal uncomfortable place it is for visitors. Anybody who has marched through the National Gallery knows what a wearisome process it is to march over that dull, dismal floor at the top of the building.  I think the Minister should do something about that.</P>
      <P>He has given no information about what pictures were bought or about what is being done.  Will there be any attempt to place the valuable pictures in the centre of the National Gallery? I would welcome the Minister's views on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a rather slow development, in my opinion, in the building of vocational schools.  That is the &ldquo;hope and purpose&rdquo;.  The Minister said that he has built several schools.  In County Limerick I know that for the past five years schools are required at Newcastle, Caherconlish, Kilmallock and Rathkeale.  In the case of one of those schools I was informed about four years ago that the plans were ready to be put into operation and I was told in regard to two others that they would follow immediately.  Yet four or five years have passed and nothing has been done.  The Minister talks here about grants being sanctioned for the erection of 92 primary schools and for 42 major improvement or enlargement schemes and he sounds a warning &ldquo;that these figures do not refer to work done&rdquo;.  That is a very deceptive attitude.  The Department <Col N="1215" /> should face up to the problem and say how many schools have been built, not how many schools have been provided for on paper.</P>
    <P>I am an expert on primary schools but I confess that I am not at home in the matter of secondary education.  The Minister has something to say here about secondary education to the effect that &ldquo;it is good sense, save in very exceptional cases, to leave the choice of school to the parents&rdquo;.  My view is that the parent has no choice in this country.  The curriculum in secondary schools in this country is geared to the requirements of the Civil Service and other collared professions. Something other than that is needed.</P>
    <P>I am an Irish language enthusiast but I believe that the Irish language, and this applies to every language other than vernacular English, is being taught wrongly in our system of education.  No matter what enthusiastic Gaelic leaguers may say, we are not making real progress in regard to Irish and we never will under the present system.  In the teaching of foreign languages we are as bad, if not worse.  I know children who attend secondary schools for five or six years, who spend those years, studying a foreign language and who, at the end of that period, have completely forgotten all they have learned of the foreign language.</P>
    <P>I know we are teaching foreign languages in all our secondary schools, but not half of 1 per cent. of those who learn those languages can make themselves understood in any fashion to a native speaker of the language, or take any further interest in the literature of the language after they have left school.  I rate philosophy, naturally, higher than technology but it does not seem to me that languages taught in that ineffective fashion will develop any cultural side of a child's character or foster any philosophical thought in the child.  I do not think that the teaching of a foreign language to any child under the present system will equip the child unless he pursues it by a study of the literature of that language.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that science is just <Col N="1216" /> as much a cultural study as is a foreign language and I do think that we should get away, in our educational system, from this idea of equipping our children for the Civil Service or a few other collared professions.  Might I suggest that it is time the Minister would give his views and, as a result of giving his views, would open negotiations for certain changes in our educational system.  I think there should be two forms of the matriculation examination. It is all very well to have the present one for those who will not be engaged in technological pursuits by way of a living afterwards, but I do think that science in its various aspects might very easily be substituted for some of the languages demanded for the matriculation certificate.</P>
    <P>We are behind the rest of the world in technological pursuits and developments in science, and we have to take cognisance of what is happening in the world.  People must live before they can think.  They must have some economic foothold before they can philosophise.  I think the Minister would be doing very well if he would make a start with negotiations in relation to the matriculation examination.</P>
    <P>Lest I overload the Minister's mind with too many problems, I shall not speak further except to say that the Minister is to be congratulated on his acquisition of a Parliamentary Secretary. He is to be especially complimented because of the shining intellectual powers the Parliamentary Secretary has displayed since he came into office.  The teaching of history in the schools has been subject to much criticism, but I suppose there will be no further reason for any such criticism in view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has displayed such a magnificent flair for historical research in tracing through the fabric of Irish history the dark thread showing that the Fianna Fáil Party, in 1946 and 1947, were responsible for the Famine of 1847.  I always thought that the Mayo people were intelligent people. I think that the Minister, being so lucky to have that Parliamentary Secretary, should not impose too <Col N="1217" /> heavy administrative responsibilities on him.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were left alone to his research he might yet trace the connection of the Fianna Fáil Party with Mountjoy, Essex, and Cromwell, and even might link Fianna Fáil up with the Danes.</P>
    <P>I notice that University College, Dublin, with 3,700 students, is seeking much greater grants from the Government. When the Government awards that money I feel sure they will have very little difficulty in finding a <i>quid pro quo</i> job for another Parliamentary Secretary in University College, Dublin.  Deputy Lindsay, the Parliamentary Secretary, can pursue the shadow of Fianna Fáil's evil influence back into the mists of Irish history.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that organisations which engage Army bands to attend at commemoration ceremonies, such as the unveiling of memorials in memory of the patriot dead, are required to pay substantial sums in respect of the services of the bands, and if so, if he will consider confining the charge to the transport costs involved.</P>

      <P>I am aware that fees according to a prescribed scale are charged for the services of Army bands when they are engaged for nonmilitary ceremonies.  I regret that I could not consider confining to the transport costs involved the charges to be made for the attendance of Army bands at commemoration ceremonies.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that were it not for the sacrifices made by these men, we would have no Army bands in this country to-day, we would have no Army and we would not have the freedom we enjoy to-day?  Would the Minister not agree that the least tribute we can pay to their memory is to make these bands available, in accordance with the conditions suggested in the question, that is, that the charge be confined mainly to the transport costs involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I would require to give my whole time to decide what would constitute a proper place for the band to go.  If bands were made available on a ruling like that, they would be out every day. I am glad to subscribe to the holding of commemoration ceremonies in memory of people who have made this State possible but that represents a very large number scattered over 32 Counties and some not even in the State itself.  To decide that matter would require the services not only of the Minister whole time but of a staff. I think the regulations are reasonable. I do not think anybody complains as to the way it is done.  Even where payment is made, they cannot be allowed to go unless they are available.  I have to exercise reasonable care in that regard.  I think I have been generous enough and so has my predecessor in the allocation of bands to ceremonies such as this where the regulations are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the charge is rather high in the sense that the band is catered for during that particular day by the commemoration ceremony committee? Therefore, the Army saves a certain amount through catering for the members of the band.  I have a specific case in mind.  I thought the charge of £9 10s. for the use of the band for the day, some 14 miles from their base, was rather excessive.  Would the Minister not consider relating the charge to the distance from the barracks where the bands are stationed?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>The number of illegitimate children over one year of age going to the United States for adoption, according to the Passport Office records in the three and a half years since the commencement of the Adoption Act was as follows: 1953, 128; 1954, 182; 1955, 184; 1956 (to 30th June), 49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of passports issued for <Col N="1228" /> such children who were inmates of Croom Hospital was as follows: 1953, six; 1954, eight; 1955, eight; 1956 (30th June), four.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give the names of these children and the other particulars sought by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The grant of passports in cases of this kind is subjected to certain requirements, which in general are designed to ensure that the adopting parents are suitable from the point of view of religion, material well-being and otherwise and that facilities exist in the district to which the child is going for its legal adoption.  Details of these requirements can be had on application to the Passport Office.</P>
    <P>My Department has no record of any legitimate children being removed out of the State to the U.S.A. with a view to adoption and as far as I am aware there have not been any such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Carroll</NameTxt>

      <P>I fail to see the necessity for issuing that number of copies for Deputies when not more than 15 or 20 Deputies will take part in the debate and the full statement of the Minister will be embodied in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>On the general question of education, I maintain that this is really the most important Estimate that comes before this House, no matter how strongly Deputies may feel on other matters.  Fundamentally, the future of this country depends on the type of citizens produced and the education given to those citizens.  Not alone is the Department of Education of importance with regard to the situation in Ireland but it has a bearing on the viewpoint taken by people outside this country.  In other words, we export one out of three of our growing population and it is essential, in view of the fact that we are unable to give a living to them at home that, if they do happen to go, we should send them, not as hewers of wood and drawers of water, but fitted for and capable of taking up reasonably good positions abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that that is the position at the present time.  It may be said that as far as our university graduates are concerned, the professional <Col N="1238" /> group, engineers and doctors, are in a position to take their rightful place in society abroad.  That may be but, for every university graduate that leaves the country, one thousand individuals leave who have not gone past the primary education stage.  It is in this connection that I wish first of all to deal with the problem of primary education.</P>
    <P>Straight away, I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Moylan who pointed out that the curriculum of primary schools is overloaded.  I do not think that that can be contradicted and it is one of the greatest faults with regard to the primary school programme. Apart from the curriculum, one of the greatest drawbacks at the present time is the condition of our schools.  I am not in a position to deal with the city areas but the number of schools that need replacement at the present moment is astounding.</P>
    <P>In the course of Dáil questions, I extracted from the Minister certain information in regard to the number of schools that needed complete replacement, the number of schools that needed reconstruction and I also got from him the figures of the money spent on large schools and the amount spent on the smaller groups.  I asked a Dáil question of the Minister as to why, in view of the necessity for keeping people on the land, adequate attention and equitable treatment had not been given to proposals for the building and reconstruction of small and average-sized rural schools and whether in connection with the building of new schools official cognisance has been given only to what are regarded as large and important schools in urban areas.  The Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a fact nor is there any foundation for the assertion that adequate attention and equitable treatment have not been given to proposals for the building and reconstruction of small and average-sized schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reply from the Minister is a denial of the suggestion in my question. I think the Minister should be very careful when he gives replies in this House.  I do not know whether the Minister recollected that there was a <Col N="1239" /> number of written replies as well as ones for oral answers.  Although the Minister denied in his oral reply that the rural areas were neglected, in the written reply the figures themselves prove that in the erection of schools priority was undoubtedly given to the building of large schools in rural areas.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's replies, there is a total of 822 primary schools needing completion.  That is a tremendous number&mdash;822 schools need to be demolished and replaced and another 161 need reconstruction and enlargement urgently.  I can say, without fear of contradiction, that many of these schools to-day are nothing but hovels, unfit to house animals not to speak of bringing in young children to give them an education.</P>
    <P>The position has got so serious that we have had the sight of frantic parents in a number of instances withdrawing their children from these hovels in a form of strike in order to spotlight the shameful conditions which obtain with regard to the teaching of the children.  None of us agrees with strikes.  I, at the time, emphasised to the Minister that, because some parents found it desirable in their own outlook to cause a strike, no priority would be given towards the erection of a school in a locality in which a strike took place.  I do not like to see these strikes taking place but it proves how shocking the conditions are in some of these schools that the parents were driven to take that step.  I maintain it is impossible to give anything like a decent education in some of these hovels.</P>
    <P>In the course of a further question to the Minister I asked him the number and addresses of the schools in respect of which proposals for replacement or reconstruction are under consideration for more than five years. The Minister's reply to that was that he regretted he was unable to give the information requested in the Deputy's question since its compilation would involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of official time which he was satisfied would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>The position is that we need 822 new schools.  I asked the Minister a simple <Col N="1240" /> question.  In how many of these cases was application made over five years ago?  The Minister tells me he is not in a position to give that information. In other words, the Minister, for some purpose, possibly in order not to have the Department disgraced, will not give the information to the House as to the number out of these 822 schools that have applied for replacement five, six, seven, eight, nine and perhaps ten years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to tell me that the number of applications that are awaiting attention for over five years is small, where then lies all the great work in the Department?  Why is it impossible for the Minister to make that small number available?  Am I not correct in assuming that the number is large&mdash;that it is a large percentage of the 822 involved?</P>
    <P>That is only part of the story.  I should have thought that the Minister would have been more than anxious to clear his Department of any blame by giving to the House and to the country the number of applications made to his Department which have been lodged for over five years for the replacement or erection of new schools.  I would have thought that it would have been a simple matter for him to do that.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the rate of progress at the moment with the replacement of these schools, how many years will we have to wait for the 822 schools, to say nothing of the 161 schools that need reconstruction?  It is an admitted fact that this year money is short for all capital development purposes.  I presume that the Department of Education has to suffer the same as every other Department and that the amount of money available is being reduced.</P>
    <P>In so far as primary education is concerned, there should be a fair proportion of whatever amount of money is laid out or expended on primary schools in rural areas.  I can only go back for the past three years but I suggest that priority has been given over the past three years to the erection of large schools in urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was <Col N="1241" /> given a considerable amount of information. Would he indicate what items in the information he got is evidence of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. I do not intend to leave the Minister under a wrong impression with regard to his own replies.  I said that priority should be given towards the erection of small schools and medium-sized schools in the backward areas especially.  I think, when it is a question of a choice between a school going up in Dublin, Mullingar or Cork as against schools in the rural areas in Donegal, Galway and elsewhere, priority should be given to the schools in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question yesterday, I asked the Minister if he would state the grant expenditure on new schools and the reconstruction and improvement of existing schools for the years 1953-54, 1954-55, and 1955-56.  In the year 1953-54, a sum of £1,071,000 odd was spent on the construction of new schools and the reconstruction of existing schools.  Of that sum, £631,000 odd was spent on the construction of schools where the grant exceeded £10,000.  In other words, 17 schools were built and the cost of the 17 schools was £631,000.  That left less than £400,000 for the rural areas.  Is that a fair proportion?</P>
      <P>Over the last three years, a sum of £3,163,000&mdash;leaving out the last few pounds in the figure&mdash;was spent on the construction and improvement of schools.  Of that, a sum of £1,300,000 went towards the construction of schools where the minimum grant was £10,000.  In the three years, 48 schools were built where the grant exceeded £10,000.  I can bring it down to an average for the Minister and ask him whether he would contradict this for the three years: 48 schools were built at an average cost of £27,000 each, making a total of almost £1,300,000. That is what 48 schools cost and the total amount available in the three years was a little over £3,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, then, was the fair treatment given to the small and middle-sized schools, if over 40 per cent. of the total amount available for the construction <Col N="1242" /> of schools was spent on the large schools in the rural areas?  I do not think there is any justification whatever for that type of expenditure. When we have 822 schools needing replacement, I think it is ridiculous to build palatial schools.  I understand that the Government is short of money and when that is so why not have a reasonable approach to meet the problems with regard to education?  Why not try to meet the urgent needs of the rural areas instead of concentrating to a great extent&mdash;as the Department has done&mdash;on the needs in cases where the pressure is the greatest?</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well deputations will come to different Ministers and put up strong cases but is it because these deputations are led by prominent people who carry a lot of weight that priority is to be given to the erection of schools to suit these people?  Is it because you have groups of parishioners in backward parishes who are never heard of, and who never see their local T.D. except once in three or four years who are quite and peaceful, that their applications can be left lying on the shelf for seven or eight or nine years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I asked the Minister to give me the number and addresses of schools in respect of which proposals for replacement or reconstruction have been under consideration for more than five years.  The Minister's reply was that he regretted that he was unable to give the information since its compilation would involve the expenditure of a considerable amount of official time which, he was satisfied, would not be warranted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of engaging in cross-fire with the Minister on this matter.  I asked the Minister a very simple question and he had time and a complete Department available with figures and statistics to let him know how many schools were awaiting attention for over five years. Yet the Minister could not give me even that little bit of information and I must assume that the reason he did not do so was that it would blow the lid off the entire Department if the information was disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what interpretation I am entitled to put on the Deputy's generalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help the Minister.  All I wish to say to the Minister is that if he can prove to the satisfaction of this House that the figures I have given are wrong I will be the first to apologise.  If the Minister can tell me that priority&mdash;I shall not even go that far&mdash;that a fair distribution of the money made available for construction of national schools, was given to rural areas compared with what was given to city schools and if he can prove that, I will accept it.  I do not think any more need be said about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that in his reply I do not want to be given the same type of statement as when he said that the number of grants sanctioned in recent years for school building projects in rural areas has been considerably greater than that sanctioned in respect of schools in urban areas.  That is perfectly true; the number of grants sanctioned may be greater, naturally, because there are more schools in rural Ireland than <Col N="1244" /> there are in the cities and towns.  But how is it, that of the amount of money available, a fair proportion was not given to the rural areas?  Why was not more than 50 per cent. made available so far as rural areas were concerned? It goes to show, in my opinion, that the strong bias that should exist towards rural education and the development of rural Ireland is lacking at the top so far as the Department of Education is concerned.  So much for the primary schools.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us the percentage of pupils who, having obtained their primary certificate, then go on and seek a secondary education? What percentage of the primary students have the opportunity of getting a secondary education?  I am sure the Minister has that figure available&mdash;does he want me to give it to him?  Deputy Moylan is quite right when he points out that at the present time the slant in secondary education is towards what he described as the overcrowded Civil Service and other professions.  Being a skilled politician, he did not give us any idea of what these other professional classes are. Of the total number of boys going through national schools only a minimum number have an opportunity of getting&mdash;poor and all though it may be &mdash;secondary education.  The slant for secondary education is all wrong.  It is geared to the outlook of 100 years ago.  To a great extent, of course, it caters for the people who go on for the Civil Service, for the church and for other professions.  As far as giving an idea to a young fellow on business or anything else is concerned, it is the last thing that enters into the minds of the people who set out the curricula or the training programmes in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>In so far as scholarships and burses are concerned in regard to secondary schools, we compare most unfavourably with our neighbours in the other part of this divided State.  I have not got the figures for last year, but in the previous year we gave burses and scholarships amounting to £150,000 when, in the Six Counties, the amount given was £600,000.  With a population of 40 per cent. of our population, they <Col N="1245" /> were able to put up burses and scholarships of just four times the amount put up by the institutions in this State.  There is no need to comment on the comparison there.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble here, when people speak on this Estimate, is that they are likely to be misrepresented both inside and outside the House.  I think that is one of the reasons why so few Deputies take the opportunity of speaking on this Estimate.  It is essential that a lot of the fog should be cleared away from a number of matters involved in the Estimate.  In connection with secondary education, I understand there are a number of grievances among the teachers, among the parents and, naturally, among the pupils with regard to the extraordinarily harsh papers set for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations. A number of teachers in various parts of the country have drawn attention to this matter over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>I have examined the matter, looked at some of the papers and have satisfied myself that there is a strong case to be met.  I hope the few remarks I make on this matter will be studied in the Department and, if possible, that sympathetic consideration will be given to the suggestion that drastic changes will be made in regard to certain examinations. I shall give details here in respect of the mathematical papers set for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>The first paper with which I shall deal is the geometry paper in the honours leaving certificate examination. The time for the paper is two and a half hours.  From 1934 to 1943 there were ten questions on the paper. The pupils had a choice of four, having had to answer six out of the ten questions. That choice existed up to 1948. Then there was a change, the pupils having to answer six out of nine questions. In 1953 there was another change, the pupils then being required to answer seven out of eight questions. The same applied in 1954.  I cannot see the reason for the change which left the children with no choice.  It is a most heartening thing for young <Col N="1246" /> people going into an examination room and looking down through a paper, to see that there is a choice.  They can then select the questions which they are confident of handling and leave the knotty problems until later.  If a young person looks at his paper, sees no choice and finds that the first couple of questions are likely to stick him, it is possible he will do badly on the whole paper.  There is a psychological matter involved in that.</P>
    <P>I think the reason why there is no choice given is that it makes it easier on the man who is setting the paper or on the person who is examining the paper afterwards.  As I said, two and a half hours is the period laid out for that paper.  I regard that as entirely inadequate for the answering of seven questions, especially for an honours paper in geometry.  It is injurious to the health of any young person.  I shall now run briefly through the other papers.  For the algebra paper, the time for which is two and a half hours, also between 1935 and 1948 the pupils had to answer six out of ten questions.  In 1953 they had to answer seven out of eight; the same applied in 1954.  With regard to arithmetic, from 1936 to 1948 six out of nine questions had to be answered.  In 1953 six out of seven had to be answered and in 1954 seven out of seven.</P>
    <P>I think that is ridiculous.  Why give no choice?  There is no excuse for this kind of thing.  The number of questions to be answered have been increased and the pupil has no choice.  Young people going to school to-day are no more supermen than they were 15 or 20 years ago, and it is unfair to have made the examinations more difficult. I would suggest to the Minister that those responsible for the setting of these papers should be smartened up. They should remember that they have gone past their youth, that the examinations they are setting are for young people who go into examination rooms very often trembling and nervous. Many of the people who set those papers had a choice themselves and there is no need for them to be unmerciful at this stage, whether they be civil servants or university authorities. Whoever they are, they are not doing a good job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> The final point I should like to make has been mentioned here by both the Minister and by Deputy Moylan.  I want to know what is the official policy with regard to the revival or the restoration of the Irish language.  This is where a Deputy treads on very dangerous ground.  Horns will be put on a man in here if he makes a mistake in his wording, and I will have to call on the Man above for guidance that I do not put my two feet in it and leave myself open to all sorts of attacks by pressure groups both inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>I ask the question in view of a statement that appears in to-day's newspapers. I have a copy of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, but the report appears in the other papers as well.  A statement was made at the I.N.T.O. course in University College, Galway, by Donnchadh Ó Laoire.  He was speaking on standardising Irish and said that the setting up of a Gaeltacht Department should be welcomed as the most practical step taken in the language cause since Irish was first placed on the curriculum of our schools.  He suggested that an effort should be made without delay to undertake the task of evolving the basis for a standardised national language.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the Minister's view on that.  Have we reached the stage now, after 34 years of trying to restore the language in a certain form, that we now admit failure and that we have decided we will get away from dialects?  Is there only one way now to revive the language&mdash;by standardising it?  That statement and the views taken by a number of people in the Department mean that we have been all wrong in our approach to the question of the revival of the Irish language since 1922.  This is very important because the people as a whole have to pay for the expenditure involved in this and I have no doubt that the public are not too critical if they know that that money is being spent properly and wisely. The general public are very patient on this matter of the revival of the language, but I do not think the general public will keep their patience <Col N="1248" /> much longer if they find that from 1922 to 1956 all the money that went into the various dialects has been wasted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was speaking to the people in a rural area in Donegal, an area I presume where emigration is just as familiar to the people as it is to Deputy O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary.  I will give the Minister's own words.  He said: &ldquo;The Irish language is like Jacob's Ladder.  It is <Col N="1249" /> a direct link between Heaven and earth for the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should assure us here, since the Leas-Cheann Comhairle rules me out of order for quoting people who are outside this House, that so far as the language is concerned no further experimenting will be made with it. Goodness knows, the people concerned find it hard enough to deal with it as it is.  The dialectical forms of the West, of Cork and Donegal are there for a long time and these people should not be asked at this stage to throw up that for the sake of a language that will be imposed on them, a manufactured language made up by a group of geniuses sitting in some back room with marbles in their mouths trying to find words that can be pronounced by people all over the country, having these particular words manufactured so that they will suit Donegalmen, Corkmen and Connemaramen as well. I am glad if I can take the Minister as making it clear that there is no intention of having this programme carried out, whether these pressure groups insist or otherwise, and I am sure the Minister is well aware that some of these pressure groups are making no bones&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As my friend, Deputy McQuillan, has apparently climbed Jacob's Ladder, I will come back to the few points on which he concentrated. Like Deputy Moylan, a few of us are interested in the educational problems confronting this nation from <Col N="1253" /> the point of view of the primary schools.  When it comes to secondary and higher education, there is a protection for the parents and children concerned&mdash;a variety of schools, and so on&mdash;which does not exist in the case of the primary school child.</P>
      <P>Like many other Deputies, I find it necessary to draw attention to the condition of many of our primary schools.  As the Minister pointed out, certain progress has been made; that is true not only of his term of office but of the term of office of Deputy Moylan.  There is one point in this connection which has not been touched upon either by the Minister or other Deputies.  The hold-up in the building of new schools is very often due to under-staffing somewhere.  It may be in the Architectural Division of the Board of Works or in that section of the Department of Education which is handling this matter.  I am convinced that, because of under staffing somewhere, many new school buildings which are urgently required in rural areas are not being erected.  If that is so, I would ask the Minister to do all in his power to ensure that, if the problem is being solved satisfactorily in his Department, something is done in relation to under-staffing so far as the architectural side of the work is concerned.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were educated in some of those old school buildings can testify that some of them are fit to be anything but schoolhouses.  We know what it is to spend from 9 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. for five days of the week in those old buildings.  Very often, the conditions there are merely an incentive to the school-children to get out as soon as they can because of the atmosphere pervading the old buildings where they must spend so many hours.  It is true, of course, that the school-teacher, too, is faced with the problem of having to spend his working hours there as well.  At the moment, I consider it to be my duty to urge the speeding-up of the school-building programme in rural Ireland from the point of view of the school-children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, when travelling to Dublin <Col N="1254" /> each week, that in different towns there are some excellent new school-buildings. The Minister and his Department may justifiably say that the schools must be enlarged in view of the child population in these areas. We appreciate that point and it is well to see these new buildings. Because of our obligations to our constituencies, some Deputies have to travel to remote parts of the country and then we are bound to compare the conditions prevailing in these remote areas with the conditions which obtain in other areas through which we pass on our way to Dublin so far as schools are concerned.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the birth rate.  I know a few schools where at the present time the reverend manager and the teachers are striving to get additional rooms although in some instances they are fairly new schools which were erected only about ten or 12 years ago.  In my own parish, even when the planning of the school was undertaken some 14 or 15 years ago, the Department and the officials concerned were strongly advised by the reverend manager and the school-teacher that the proposed building would not be large enough.  They had to provide all the relevant information as to the number of children baptised within a few years prior to that time, the number of school-going children and so on.  Common sense should have prevailed.  Having regard to the information supplied to the Department at that time by the reverend manager and the school-teacher, and all concerned locally, they are justified in their criticism of the erection of a school which is now found to be too small for the area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is essential that there should be more flexibility in policy in relation to the erection of school-buildings in rural Ireland.  More space than is required to meet the immediate demand should be provided in the hope that the child population of the area will increase and that, in that event, there will be accommodation for them in the local schools so that it will not be necessary to incur extra expenditure as a result of bad planning in the beginning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> I am very pleased to note the Minister's statement in relation to new schools for handicapped children and the system of education adopted for such children.  To me, that is one of the highlights of the Estimate.  I may be biased but I am more interested in hearing that than I am to hear of any matter in connection with the National Art Gallery or the Arts Council.  Undoubtedly, these matters are of concern to many people but to me the question of handicapped children takes precedence over them.  It is an awful thought that in years past there was no form of education available to many of these unfortunate children. While the Minister has good news in regard to that item, which I appreciate, I would ask him and, through him, the Government, to intensify that policy, whatever our difficulties in regard to finance may be, because the duty is imposed on every Deputy, whether supporting the Government or in opposition, of providing whatever advantage is possible for these unfortunate children.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to secondary schools.  The Minister said that while there were many critics of the form of education in some of the secondary schools, our secondary schools are good shapers of character. I hope he is right.  I am not so sure. The secondary schools under the control of the Christian Brothers are a credit to this country and may be truly termed real shapers of character, but I am afraid that quite a few of the secondary schools are not shapers of character but shapers of snobocracy.</P>
    <P>The old school-tie system, which the Minister and members on the other side of the House fought against and which was predominant in this country at that time through the foreign system of secondary education that was imposed on this country, is still present in many of our secondary schools.  Credit must be given for the form of secondary education that is given in the Christian Brothers' schools and in many other schools. Reference is often made to the fact that many Corkmen come to Dublin on a single ticket.  Probably in the <Col N="1256" /> Minister's Department there are quite a few Corkmen and quite a few come through the Christian Brothers' schools, not through the other schools, which I am not so sure are shapers of character.</P>
    <P>The problem of vocational schools is a big problem.  Coupled with it is a matter raised by Deputy Moylan, the raising of the school leaving age.  The raising of the school leaving age must be considered in regard to the number of school buildings available and the accommodation in them and also in relation to the number of teachers.  I am not saying that it has been the policy of the Minister or his Department but I am afraid that, because of lack of co-operation somewhere or other, we are not making any progress in this matter.  There should be in the national schools some form of vocational teaching which would introduce vocational education to the boys and girls.  It might be possible to get the co-operation of the county vocational education committees in providing classes in national schools on one or two evenings in the week which would be a stepping-stone for pupils in the sixth or seventh standards in the national schools who would desire to proceed to the vocational schools or even to secondary schools.  I know that very often there is lack of co-operation even on the part of the local manager in that respect but it should be possible to have a vocational teacher travelling in rural areas and spending a few hours in some of the national schools, not of course in the obsolete buildings about which we are all complaining but in some of the newer school-buildings. It would be a way of introducing vocational education to the children.  It might prevent them from getting into their minds the idea that when their primary education is finished there is nothing for them but to look for any job that may come their way.</P>
    <P>Education in the secondary schools and colleges gives those who can avail of it an avenue to a better life.  A system embracing the national schools and the vocational schools might help us somewhat in the rural areas.  Owing to the enormous cost of building, it would be impossible for us to expect <Col N="1257" /> additional vocational schools in the many centres in which we would like to have them.  To remedy this situation, it would be necessary for us to explore the possibility of having co-operation between the national schools and the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to what might be called the hardy annual.  It concerns the matter of school-books.  I remember, when Deputy Moylan was Minister, he gave an extraordinary answer. He said that as far as he was concerned, at any rate, it would be impossible to have the books handed from one child to another because when the children had finished with the new books they were cast aside. I do not agree.  Indeed, I am convinced that there is a vicious ring operating somewhere.  I am also convinced that the type of book which suits a boy in the fourth standard should suffice for a younger brother when he leaves third class.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there are too many changes in relation to the type of books in use.  It is not the children who ultimately complain.  As youths ourselves, we can all remember the excitement which new books caused to us&mdash;an excitement not derived from the knowledge contained in the books but merely from looking at them but there is little excitement among the parents when they get a hefty bill from the local school-teacher or when they go into the bookshops in Cork City and are told the price of the books.  This system is one that must be radically changed for the benefit of the parents who have to pay the piper.</P>
    <P>Much comment was made in regard to overcrowded syllabuses in the national schools.  I believe that the children are being forced to take up too many subjects.  We seem to be drifting away from the necessity of instilling into the minds of the children in rural areas the importance of rural life and agricultural science.  We are endeavouring to convince parents that if Johnny or Mary finish their primary education all they have to do is to spend a year or two in a secondary college or commercial school in Cork City and all the jobs in the commercial world are available for them.  We <Col N="1258" /> know that that is not true.  In our educational policy, we are not striving to instil into the minds of the people in the rural areas the importance of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The fewer foreign languages we teach the better.  We can get on all right without them.  Perhaps we could even climb Deputy McQuillan's Jacob's Ladder without them.  The minds of the children in the rural areas are directed towards faraway places and our policy should be to direct them towards the rural areas and the importance of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke about the overall policy relating to the Irish language.  I do not worry whether people here or outside are upset by what I have to say.  I say it because it is essential for me to do so.  There is something very wrong from the point of view of the children in regard to the language.  We all want to see the Gaeltacht protected, preserved and improved but I ask the Minister is it fair to continue a policy of victimisation of the child who comes from an area which cannot be classified as a Gaeltacht area?</P>
    <P>Much has been said in regard to the system of education and we always hear the old saying: God be with the good old days.  Apparently, the national teachers of 70 years ago were far ahead of the present-day teachers as a whole.  There are many children in the Gaeltacht who qualify, go into the colleges and advance further.  Their ambition is&mdash;and nobody can blame them&mdash;to improve their knowledge, not of Irish of which they have a fair share already, but their knowledge of the English language.</P>
    <P>It is all right to pursue a policy of preferential treatment but we ought not deny an equal opportunity to the boy or girl from Cork City, for example, who, when they enter for an examination, are placed in a difficult position from the start.  In the first place, their whole life is one in which Irish is not spoken.  The environment in which they live is not Gaelic and yet they can in an examination get 60 or 65 marks in Irish and maybe up to 70 <Col N="1259" /> marks.  In regard to all other subjects they may get anything from 75 to 80 marks.  On the other hand, the boy or girl from the Gaeltacht may scrape through the other subjects but because they excel in the Irish language there are so many places provided in the colleges for them.  That is the point I should like to make clear.</P>
    <P>I do not say that in criticism of the language.  I love the Irish language and I have every reason to love it and it is my desire to see the language prosper.  It is also my desire to kill the complaints heard from day to day from parents in connection with their children having to learn Irish.  I believe it is essential to give a bigger opportunity to the boys and girls of the non-Gaeltacht areas.  If we can instil into the minds of the boys and girls that they are being treated equally with all others and convince the parents that the children can hold their own with those from the Gaeltacht so much the better.  If we pursued that policy the Irish language would be a true living language not only in the Gaeltacht but throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom tacaiocht a thabairt do'n méid adúirt an Teachta Ó Maoláin maidir leis an Leabharlann Náisiúnta.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil níos mó spáis ag teastáil ann agus os rud é go bhfuilimid sna Náisiúin Aontaithe faoi láthair, beidh mórán páipéirí ag teacht isteach agus ní bheidh spás ann dóibh.  Ba cheart go mbeadh faisnéis le fáil sa Leabharlann Náisiúnta i gcóir gach aoinne a tiocfadh an tslí maidir le rudaí a thit amach céad bliain ó shoin nó níos mó, más gá é.  Muna féidir leo a lámha a chur ar rudaí mar sin, mura bhfuil deis leis an taighde atá ag teastáil a dhéanamh le fáil go héasca agus go compordach acu, ní féidir linn a rá go bhfuil an Leabharlann ag comhlíonadh a dualgais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is fíor a rá nach gcuirtear mórán suime sa Leabharlann Náisiúnta sa Dáil de gnáth agus ós rud é nach féidir tagairt a dhéanamh di go minic b'fhéidir go gcuirfidh an tAire an cheist sin faoi athbhreith.  B'fhéidir gur ceart áit éigin sealadach a chur ar bun munar féidir leabharlann nua <Col N="1260" /> a thógaint.  Pé scéal é ba cheart suíomh a chur in áirithe i dtreo is nuair a thiocfaidh an t-am chun leabharlann nua a thógaint, go mbeidh áit oiriúnach le fáil comhgarach do lár na cathrach.</P>
    <P>Tá an t-airgead do na coláistí Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht gearrtha ach más maith linn na coláistí sin a chothú i dtreo is go mbeidh mealladh ann chun an teanga a choimeád beo agus mealladh do na daoine thart an teanga a labhairt i gcónaí ina ngnáthshaol, is léir go gcaithimíd gach cúnamh a thabhairt do na coláistí sin.  Níl aon amhras ach gur ceart dúinn na coláistí Gaeilge a choiméad i slí ina bhféadaidís freastal d'éileamh na ndaoine ó na meánscoileanna a bhfuil togha na Gaeilge acu cheana.  Ní mór dúinn na cúrsaí is fearr is féidir a chur ar fáil sna coláistí sin i gcóir na macléin a théas go dtí an Ghaeltacht, cuir i gcás, le linn an tSamraidh chun feabhas agus snas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.  Mura bhfuil cúrsaí oiriúnacha den tsaghas sin le fáil ann, beimid ag dul ar gcúl.</P>
    <P>Tá gá mór ann faoi láthair le scríbhneoirí nua-Ghaeilge chun obair na teangan a choimeád ar siúl agus ba mhaith an rud dá bhféadhfadh an tAire obair den tsaghas atá ar siúl ag Comhaltas Uladh i dTír Chonaill a chur ar bun sna ceantair Ghaeltacha eile.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithe scoile, bhí morán tagairt dóibh ach do réir dealraimh nílimid ag teacht suas leis na riaráistí. Do réir na bhfigiúirí ba cheart dúinn bheith ag tógaint 50 scoil gach bliain agus má tá an scéal mar dúirt an Teachta Ó Maoláin go bhfuil 800 scoil i ndroch-chás, ba cheart go mbeadh timpeall 100 scoil á dtógaint gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Ós rud é go bhfuil an líon páistí sa nGaeltacht ag titim b'fhéidir gur féidir rud éigin a dhéanamh chun cuid de na scoileanna a thabhairt le chéile.  Go pearsanta, ba mhaith liom iad d'fhágaint mar atáid ach nuair a bhíos an t-aon oide amháin i scoil bheag is rí-deacair dó caighdeán réasúnta maith a shroicheadh sna ranganna uachtaracha.  B'fhéidir gur féidir linn níos mó a dhéanamh chun scoileanna den tsaghas sin a thabhairt <Col N="1261" /> le chéile.  Mar adúras cheana b'fhearr liom féin iad d'fhágaint ach dá mbeadh an t-udarás oideachais sásta, dá mbeadh mánaigh agus eaglaisigh agus na daoine eile a bhfuil baint acu leis na scoileanna sin sásta, go mbeadh caighdeán níos fearr le fáil dá gcuirfí cuid de na scoileanna sin le chéile, ba cheart an cheist sin do scrúdú.</P>
    <P>Níl morán eolais againn maidir le gnáthchúrsaí na Roinne ach an méid a tugadh dúinn in óráid an Aire. Ní dóigh liom gur chuir an Roinn aon tuarascáil amach le blianta agus mar sin níl againn ach an cúntas ón gComhairle Oideachais.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, as I have just been saying in Irish, that we are really depending on the Minister's statement for information as to the working of the Department and the work in the schools.  We have also a certain amount in the Report of the Council of Education which was published about two years ago.  However, as Deputy Moylan said, we have not got as much information as we expected.  We have got the usual review and statistics, reference to school buildings, the arrangements for dealing with salaries and teachers and so on, but the Minister has not attempted to give us any appraisal of the work of the schools during the year, any changes that have taken place, any special examinations or reviews that have been made by the inspectors.  We have not got any information as to whether matters are proceeding satisfactorily or whether there is any recession or retrogression.</P>
    <P>We all know that in the educational field there are bright spots and spots that are not so bright and, as the Minister knows&mdash;we have been both dealing with this Estimate for a very long period of years&mdash;his request to me as Minister&mdash;a very reasonable and logical one&mdash;was that more information should be given, either by publishing the inspectors' reports or summaries of them, or by the Minister himself, dealing with these general questions of the work in the schools.  It is for the purpose of enlightening the public and of giving members of the Dáil the opportunity of dealing with these Estimates in a serious manner <Col N="1262" /> and of trying to get a better grasp of the problems of education and of equipping themselves so as to give advice and counsel as to the steps which might be taken in time, that the Minister and the Department of Education, as far as possible, should give more information as to the work of the schools.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McQuillan, the Minister gave certain figures showing that the size of classes in Dublin was something over 43 per teacher on an average.  I notice that one of the recommendations of the Council of Education was that, while many people think 30 should be the optimum figure, they were prepared, in view of the circumstances and the need for economy, and for doing things as carefully and as cautiously as possible, to admit that the figure should go up to 40 in larger classes.  We have no information as to what steps the Department have been able to take in this matter or what is the actual position, until the Dáil reassembles.  I know this was an issue in which the Minister was always keenly interested.  It is one about which one hears a great deal from parents.</P>
    <P>The question of the supply and quality of teachers was referred to.  I should like to ask whether the Minister is satisfied that sufficient is being done to provide lay teachers in sufficient numbers for the national schools. I should like if he gave us the figures showing the arrangements and the facilities which are available and the number of places for the training of religious and lay teachers.  In connection with that, I should like to know what is the position about those untrained teachers upon whom we have to depend to such a large extent in the smaller schools.  Will it be considered advisable to give these untrained teachers the opportunity, subject to certain tests, of going for courses of training, or will we be faced with the position that they will remain for indefinite periods in the schools to which they have been appointed?  I should think that if they are suitably reported upon by the inspectors they would be sent for further training after a period of trial which, after all, corresponds with the monitorial system <Col N="1263" /> which many people think was very beneficial as part of our training courses for teachers.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that I am interested in the question of accommodation. I should also like to know what is the position with regard to the recommendations of the Council of Education regarding the teaching of drawing, nature study and physical training in the schools, whether anything further can be done in the training colleges to strengthen the position as regards science and particularly, of course, of science bearing on agriculture and rural life.  Is the Minister satisfied that the teacher candidates at the present are doing sufficiently thorough courses, seeing that they will be important later on?  The rural school will always be an important institution to the extent that it can take part in the life of the countryside. Its value will improve and be more esteemed there if the teachers are in a position to do the type of work which they may not be able to do by way of experiment or in classes but which, if they had the necessary training, they could do to a great extent through the ordinary literary subjects, even through conversation and through their influence with the chilren and the manner in which the schools are maintained.  Such teachers can do a great deal to make the schools worthy of the work that is being done in them, of the people who frequent them and of the countryside in which they are situated.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools have done a great deal through the medium of rural science to help rural life.  If we could get the same spirit, the same approach and the same atmosphere from the teachers who are going into the rural primary schools, I think it would be a great matter and would help in some small way in keeping our rural communities together.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of training, I should like the Minister to state whether the number of junior assistant mistresses tends to decrease, whether the junior assistant mistresses will continue to be a feature of the service or whether they are a disappearing entity and that, in some <Col N="1264" /> period of years, they will be replaced by fully-trained teachers.  I should also like the Minister to tell us whether the figure of 400 which has been mentioned as the average wastage is correct.  I do not know whether it is quite correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the numbers in the schools, the falling trend in the birthrate since 1947, and that it is expected another cycle of reduced enrolments will begin this year or next.  One would like to know how he envisages the corps of teachers during the coming period of years or for the next three or five years, what the number of teachers will be and how the smaller schools will stand.  Will they tend to decline at a greater rate or what will be the position having regard to the census figures which we have had recently?  As I have mentioned in Irish, it seems to me it may be necessary to examine the question of reorganising the rural schools if there is to be a large number of one-teacher schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given us very little satisfaction in connection with the recommendations of the first Report of the Council of Education.  I am rather disappointed because I had hoped we would have had some indication of what the Department's final decision was regarding the recommendations of the council.  In fact the position is distinctly unsatisfactory.  The Minister in page 1 of his speech says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The examination and consideration of the recommendations submitted in the first Report of the Council of Education which was presented to me in the summer of 1954, and of the very valuable comments thereon which I have received from the ecclesiastical authorities and the various educational bodies, from all of whom I invited expressions of opinion, are nearing completion in my Department.  I hope that it will be possible for me to reach conclusions before long but I cannot tie myself to any time-table in this respect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to tie himself to a time-table.  We just want him to tell us what conclusions he and his officers have reached and why, in <Col N="1265" /> view of the consultations that have taken place, it has not been possible to reach decisions or, if they have been reached, why the House could not have been informed in regard to these matters, some of which seem to be rather simple and capable of determination quite easily, and others of which, like the school-leaving age, may raise bigger issues.</P>
    <P>Last year on the 8th July the Minister said that in another two months he expected to have the views of all the interests that he had considered it necessary to consult regarding these recommendations.  Now he tells us that he has not yet completed the examination of the views given to him.  I had hoped that, as he stated last year, by the end of the year all possible information would have been in the hands of the Department and, not alone that, but that they would be in a forward position to enable them to come to decisions and let the House and the country have the benefit of them through a White Paper or otherwise as to what the intentions of the Department were regarding these recommendations.</P>
    <P>This Council of Education was appointed in April, 1950.  It reported in June, 1954, and the Minister tells us now that he cannot tie himself to any time-table.  We are fast reaching the position when nobody, except persons who are specially concerned, will have any interest in the report or in the recommendations of the council.  Are we to take it that they will amount to a dead letter or that they will be put on the long finger?  Last year when I queried the Minister's not having referred the question of the school-leaving age and the provision of continuation education to enable the school-leaving age to be raised specifically to the council he informed me, as he had informed the Dáil and the country, that he considered that secondary education was a convenient detached field which the council could usefully survey and examine while the Department was making up its mind about the recommendations of the Council of Education regarding primary education.  He made the statement characteristically that the important <Col N="1266" /> question of the pattern of the system beyond the age of 12 would be postponed until conclusions were reached on proposals already submitted.</P>
    <P>Seeing that a certain number of years was spent on examining the question of primary education and that the council thought fit to refer in very specific terms to the necessity for extending education after the primary school leaving age and that this must have been known to the Department, it is certainly extraordinary that the Minister who, I am sure, had a motion down in this House 20 years ago on the necessity for raising the school-leaving age, should tell us now after all those years that he will not be bound by a time-table.  Surely the House and the country are entitled to more consideration as to what the Government have in mind.</P>
    <P>We fully understand the position regarding the aspects of the matter to which Deputy Moylan has referred, the cost and the time that will be required to provide the necessary teachers, and the great cost of providing the necessary accommodation, if it is thought well to go ahead with raising the school-leaving age.  We do not know however what the Government's view is on that matter and, at the rate we are going on at present, we are not likely to know it for years, perhaps, if ever.  The statement made last year by the Minister that he wanted to ensure that anything proposed would have been very fully and carefully thought out, is certainly extraordinary, because the point comes when one is convinced that it is no longer consideration that is involved but lethargy or procrastination or simply complacency or indifference, to put it in rather stronger language.</P>
    <P>The two reasons which the Council of Education put forward for raising the school-leaving age, if that were found to be at all feasible, were well known and well appreciated in the Department when I was there.  The first was the fact that we would like to give our school pupils a further opportunity of improving their knowledge of Irish.  There is no doubt but that the Irish language programme <Col N="1267" /> threw a great deal of work upon the primary schools and if, by prolonging the school-leaving age, one gave the children a better opportunity of improving and generally perfecting their knowledge of Irish that would be all to the good.</P>
    <P>A second reason was also advanced and that was that a large number of children, when they leave school at 14, can be described as not having a good minimum education.  The commission reported that about 36 per cent. of our youth of 14 to 15 years of age and 55 per cent. of those from 15 to 16 years of age were enrolled in no school in the academic year 1951-52.  The Minister has given me certain figures since showing that it is estimated that, in relation to the year 1954-55, 58.6 per cent. of the boys and 63.3 per cent. of the girls between 14 and 15 years of age are enrolled at courses of whole-time education.  The total number of boys and girls between 14 and 15 is 51,400 and, of these, 31,300 are enrolled in those courses.  That means that about 20,100 are not so enrolled.</P>
    <P>The insurable age for employment is 16 with the result that, from 14 to 16, there is a period of suspense and waiting when young people are either not employed or if they do find employment it is often of a very spasmodic character &mdash; some kind of badly-paid occupation, a cul-de-sac which does not lead to anything better, where the employer often drops the youngster after a few months, as may suit him. It is often purely casual and seasonal employment.  At this age, the youngsters are at a very impressionable stage.  I think the figures of juvenile delinquency will tend to show that if they are more free from control at the age of 15, let us say, they are more likely to get into trouble.  It is fairly certain that, at that age, you have a larger number of offences in the field of juvenile delinquency than perhaps at any other time.</P>
    <P>Even if we could not do better for the children than to organise them during the long summer holidays, to try to help out the work that the boys' clubs do so very well in Dublin, <Col N="1268" /> when they try to collect the youngsters, it would be worth while. I see that efforts are being made to get them down to the farmers through the trade unions.  That is an excellent and splendid idea.  I hope it will work out and succeed to the extent that we shall have not alone hundreds but many thousands of youngsters going down the country and getting a holiday which will do them good and keep them out of mischief.  We hope they will be better citizens as a result of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>In view of the very large number of young people who go to Britain, moral training and discipline is a very serious problem.  I believe we should do everything possible to encourage a greater sense of personal responsibility among parents as well as children. We ought to do everything possible to give them more self-respect. We ought to prepare them in a more practical way for the difficulties which they are likely to meet, particularly in an alien atmosphere which, too often, is not even neutral but is morally harmful and one of which they have had no experience.</P>
    <P>The Council of Education mentioned that a good deal of the work done at present is by way of repetition and that there is a good deal of waste of time even for those who have attained the sixth standard.  The ordinary course provided by the national schools for those pupils who have completed the course at standard six is, in practice, little more than a repetition of the latter course.  It then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Within the organisation of the large schools, it might be possible to teach a more advanced programme and give to the higher standards at least some of the individual attention they need.  In the smaller school that is impossible, unless under the exceptional teacher.  The needs of the pupils of the smaller schools are the greater because they cannot find in the countryside about them the many opportunities for alternative education which are open to pupils of the larger schools situated in the urban areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having examined the question, the <Col N="1269" /> council went on to say that, in their opinion, continuation education ought to be extended and facilities for it made available in all areas.  They referred particularly to the vocational schools.  The paragraph of importance with regard to the basis of all this examination of the standard of education of our children when they are leaving the primary schools is paragraph 371, page 242, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The primary school course, as we have defined it, is a minimum basic course.  It is not in our opinion, however, sufficient to enable young persons fully to take their places in the world in which they live, or adequately to qualify them to meet the demands made upon them by their avocations in life.  It is, in effect, an insufficient minimum education under modern conditions.  The council, as a whole, feels that, in addition to the time available between the end of the primary school and the present statutory school-leaving age of 14 years, at least one further year's attendance is desirable for all children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to say, in paragraph 372:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the foregoing paragraph we refer to the need for a suitable course of at least one further year's education.  For the normal child that would mean a course extending from the age of 13 years to 15.  This would be a minimum course, for we should desire that it would be such as would encourage attendance for three years or at least two years from the end of the present statutory age.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 387 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Influenced, therefore, by the difficulties connected with any satisfactory reorganisation of the existing national schools to provide adequate post-primary education for all pupils above standard VI and the necessity of avoiding, as far as possible, any step detrimental to the efficiency and continuity of these schools, we consider that increased facilities for further education could be provided by ensuring that schools <Col N="1270" /> of the continuation type be established in all areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The council was of opinion that these facilities were needed and were very necessary to meet fully the needs of primary leaving pupils other than those who entered the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that there has been an inspection committee or body, that there has been a conference regarding inspection.  I should like him to give us further information.  He has stated that the matters under discussion are receiving careful examination. I trust that no further change will be made in the system of inspection without the House being given an opportunity of considering the matter.</P>
    <P>People are apt to regard inspectors as bogey men.  There is no ground whatever for that.  If not all, very nearly all the inspectors come from the ranks of the national teachers and why teachers should have any feeling that they would not get fair play and consideration from the inspectors, particularly in the procedure and in the set-up that we have in this country under the managerial system and the Minister and his Department, is more than I can understand.</P>
    <P>Supervision is necessary.  In all walks of life there must be supervision.  We may be very fine people and we may do splendid work but we probably do better under supervision or when we know that there is likely to be supervision, that there is someone to look over our shoulder without in any way impinging on our rights or questioning our capacity so long as we do our work satisfactorily.  It is just part of the system.  The reference to it gives one the feeling that perhaps grievances are being created or are likely to arise which have not very much foundation. Controversies in the Press or by way of correspondence between teachers and inspectors are unfortunate in that what was probably a small difficulty arising out of a difference in temperament, or such, is expanded out of all measure and the whole basis of the trouble is changed to be made an issue between the two very important bodies, <Col N="1271" /> the teachers on the one hand and the inspectorate on the other.  I hope we have seen the end of that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the numbers of pupils who, according to the Council of Education, have not a satisfactory education on leaving the national schools.  I asked the Minister a question recently and he told me that at the age of 14 years 2,521 had not completed Standard V and 4,969 had not completed Standard VI.  Of course, in some of the schools, there are pupils of 12 and 13 years who are good enough for Standard VI, whether they are promoted or not, and who can give a good account of themselves.  We have also to make allowance for the fact that while one third of the pupils may be above average, one-third may be average, there may be another one-third, or somewhat less than one-third, below average.  It is unfortunate that we still have such large numbers who do not seem to have got even the elements of education and that they have to face life without any further opportunities.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that we have every right to express dissatisfaction with the Minister's failure to grapple with the problem and to face up to the recommendations that were made to him and the representations he has received and to make up his mind one way or the other.  I have said before, I am fully aware, from long and sad experience, of the difficulty the Minister for Education has in carrying his plans into operation on account of the great cost that these reforms entail. In order to get public opinion behind the Minister and to make the country more alert to the position, the Minister should take this opportunity of telling the House what his ideas and what his plans may be and I am sure that all Parties and all Deputies would be glad to support him in every way possible, though fully conscious of the difficulties of the present time.</P>
    <P>The other point on which some special emphasis has to be laid and to which attention should be directed is the question of technical education.  A professor of chemistry at University College, Dublin, at a recent meeting, <Col N="1272" /> reported in the Press, said that while chemistry students entering a British University would have studied chemistry for at least two years, in Ireland half of the entrants had no knowledge of science; that much of the science teaching in Irish schools was done by teachers who had no degree in science; that few of our industries were sufficiently large to set up their own research departments, and that to the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards industry must look in increasing measure for aid in the solution of its problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have seen the recent report issued in Britain on technical education.  According to the figure supplied to me of 3,727 candidates who presented themselves for the leaving certificate examination, 622 boys were presented in chemistry. That would be less than 18 per cent. There were 3,388 girls who did the leaving certificate and of these only 46 did chemistry.  Thirty passed the examination.  The figures for general science were somewhat better but the numbers were comparatively low in the case of botany.  Two hundred and forty-three girls took the examination. That was about 7 per cent.  It has to be borne in mind that the girls show up much better in the subjects of physiology and hygiene where about one-third did the examination and in domestic science where almost one-half sat for it.</P>
    <P>But one of the things that has appeared in the British report is the stress on the further education of girls. Of course, we have the same problem except perhaps to a much less degree. Paragraph 91 of this report on technical education says that the problem is how to increase the number of girls entering for science courses and the weakness there is in the secondary school, where there is a shortage of teachers of mathematics and science more pronounced than in boys' schools.</P>
    <P>We ought to do more to get teachers who would satisfy modern standards and whom the authorities, who have a right to speak on this matter and who have given their opinions, would be satisfied are teachers properly qualified and who are able to give us sufficient <Col N="1273" /> numbers of students who have done scientific courses even before they go on to the university.</P>
    <P>I notice that in agricultural science the number of boys was rather low also&mdash;131.  The Minister referred to the question of agricultural science and agricultural teachers, and I am sure that other speakers will be dealing with that matter.  One hundred and thirty-one boys passed, out of 3,727, in the year 1955.  I suppose that at least half of these would be from urban areas but, even so, the figure looks very small.  One hundred and thirty-one boys were presented for examination in agricultural science.</P>
    <P>The point in the Minister's speech, as translated, was that vocational committees were in touch with the Department of Agriculture as to the best method of utilising the services of teachers in building construction.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the position regarding rural science. Both Deputy Moylan and myself were always dissatisfied with the attitude of the Department of Agriculture in regard to rural science teachers and to the possibilities of the vocational schools in the rural areas.  Here we are told that the teachers are to be utilised under the ægis of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>We wonder whether the Minister is satisfied that the Department of Agriculture should come into this matter.  On the question of science in the school one learns, in the English report, that 60 per cent. of the students take science as the main subject in the higher form of the grammar schools in Britain.  One also reads that if talent is not to be wasted, more boys and girls must stay at school until 18.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce informed us that he was proposing to introduce legislation to deal with apprenticeship.  I hope that the Department of Education will play its part in improving, if that is possible, the system of apprenticeship.  I suggested to the Minister in the discussion on his Estimate that there should be a national council, perhaps, to deal with the question of apprenticeship. <Col N="1274" /> It is a matter that affects the vocational schools very seriously.</P>
    <P>The experience in my time as Minister was that the trade unions were co-operative in setting up apprenticeship committees.  I have no doubt but that in the period that has since elapsed they will not be less co-operative but more co-operative.  I am sure that if there were a national council it could go hand in hand with improvements on the technical education side.</P>
    <P>I certainly think the time has arrived when there should be a national body representing our professional technologists, our universities, business, labour and industrial interests to deal with the problem of technical education and make recommendations to the Minister.  I believe very strongly that we could learn a great deal more by sending those who are in responsible positions in the educational field abroad to see what is being done in other countries.  In the field of technical education there can obviously be great improvement. There are improvements in regard to laboratories and in regard to teaching. There are improvements in industry in countries like Switzerland, Germany, Holland and Sweden.</P>
    <P>I am sure our experts, inspectors and our principal teachers could learn a great deal and that they might be able to evolve such a system as is recommended across the water by which those who are in employment would be able also to attend sandwich courses over a period, and proceed to get higher qualifications in technological subjects and ultimately, perhaps, to work in with the university courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us, and I should like to know, what is the position, in view of the overcrowding and of what I have just been saying, with regard to the school-leaving age, the question of science in the schools and the advancement of technical education, regarding the technical school building programme in Dublin?  We know there is serious overcrowding on account of the great increase in population and we see long queues at the vocational and technical <Col N="1275" /> schools in September when the schools open.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us what is the position, whether we have sufficient accommodation for the other 40 per cent. or 45 per cent. of our pupils between the ages of 14 and 15 if they come along and attend voluntary courses?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to special grants for science, domestic science and technical instruction.  I do not know what the amount of these grants may be but I take it they are not very substantial.  The net increase for secondary education was £71,420; £30,000 of the increase was in the provision for capitation grants due to the increase in the number of pupils; £39,000 in provision for incremental salaries grant.  That is £69,000 so that it would appear that the figure for special grants for science is not very great.  I wonder would the Minister tell us what facilities or what assistance is likely to be given or whether he has had any representations regarding the provision of equipment and the fitting out of school laboratories, for example, and such other facilities as might be necessary for the extension of science teaching in secondary schools?</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Moylan in some measure that, after all, parents have not a choice in regard to schools.  The schools are there and it is for us, through our influence and through whatever opinions we may have, and particularly for the Department of Education, to influence the schools, the managers and headmasters and authorities of the schools, not alone in regard to the education of boys but in regard to the education of girls, to which reference has been made very recently, as to how improvement can be brought about. Whether we like it or not we are in a new age, a technological age.  We have this problem of emigration; we have the problem of maintaining our households and of trying to make our young people see that there is something else in life besides amusement, going to the pictures, going to the dance-halls and so on.  We want to give them that sense of purpose and responsibility that I have spoken of.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I think that the tendency is to leave too much altogether to the authorities of the schools, to the headmasters and managers.  The primary responsibility is for the parents, but the parents feel that they have handed over these functions and important duties to the school authorities.  That is not enough. First, they have the responsibility in their own homes to do everything they can to assist the schools in their work and to see that their children are brought up, not alone as good Christians and good Irish men and women, but disciplined, controlled, orderly, clean and tidy in their persons and likely to be a credit to the country, so that if they have to go elsewhere nobody will be able to point the finger of scorn at them.  Both externally and internally we would like them to be worthy of their country and of the Irish people but I am afraid the lesson is not being driven home sufficiently in regard to the responsibilities of parents in the matter.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of parents, of course, are excellent and do their work splendidly but we have this small number who do not.  One constantly hears of those who do not practise the virtues of personal hygiene and who do not practise good manners and proper behaviour in public.  I hope that the Minister who, I am sure, is keenly interested in all these matters, will endeavour to see that if we cannot have the extra subjects that the Council of Education wants included on the curriculum of the primary schools for good and sufficient reasons, we will have more emphasis on these fundamental principles of telling the truth, being honest in dealings with one's neighbour, paying one's debts and treating the State as a neighbour also, remembering that when one robs the State it is a breach of the Seventh Commandment just as when one robs one's neighbour or one's mother or father.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I may have digressed into matters that could more properly be dealt with in a lesson on the Catechism, but it is a matter on which I feel very strongly and on which I think the influence of all of us could be very usefully and beneficially brought <Col N="1277" /> to bear.  After 40 years, since 1916, we certainly need the assistance of every agency and every influence, and the help of everybody, Department and officers of the State, in trying to get a proper standard that will be worthy of this nation and that will make people feel that when we speak of ourselves as a Christian nation that has carried the torch of Christianity through the centuries of persecution and tribulation, we really have the right to hold up our heads to-day and say that we are at least as good as we were, and that we are good enough, at any rate, to give good example to our neighbours and to set a standard for them which they will try to reach and which will influence them in their turn. Nothing could be of greater influence than our young people giving the good example if they have to emigrate and work elsewhere.  Nothing could be worse than that they should, as some of them do, depart from the values and the practices they learned at home.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to read that the number of &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools had increased.  I was very perturbed to hear there had been a falling off for some time past and that there was a feeling among responsible authorities that secondary schools were not doing as well as they should be.  Whether the introduction of the text books is the sole cause of the improvement is another matter.  I should prefer to believe that the personal influence of the Minister in the Department, with the headmasters and with the schools, and the fact that he stands for a policy of Irish in the schools and, of course, the realisation that the secondary schools give a lead in this matter and that they will produce the future leaders of opinion and of the professions, are responsible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of how best the schools can compete with industry for the services of technologists without creating analogies in relation to salary and other matters and said that it is a question to which no satisfactory answer has so far been found anywhere. I suppose the explanation is a question of £.s.d., but surely, in connection with the Dublin technical schools and even the technical schools <Col N="1278" /> outside Dublin, some arrangements could be made to get the services of part time teachers who have these technological qualifications.</P>
    <P>I know that is done to a very great extent by the Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  I feel sure there are many young Irishmen who may have had some experience abroad and in respect of whom, admittedly, we could not pay the salary which they could draw if they were willing to emigrate to Rhodesia or Ontario but who, so long as they could get a reasonable livelihood in Ireland, would be prepared to come to these schools. There are bodies like the Institute of Engineers and the Institute of Architects who might assist the technical schools.  If the Minister had a national council to advise him in respect of technical education, I feel sure he would get valuable advice from the representatives of these professions.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in which I am interested and which arises in connection with the qualifications of teachers of science and the general question of preparing our young people, in a more practical way, for the life of the present day.  I should like to know whether any examination has been made of the position in industrial schools.  Efforts have been made to try and combine vocational education work with work in some, at any rate, of these institutions.  I think that in the larger industrial schools, particularly, it would be a great pity to neglect this aspect, even though it might cost a fairly substantial amount of money.  This money, however, would be an investment, for which the country would be well repaid, for giving the boys in these institutions a more modern technical training in such things as motor engineering and building construction.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into that matter and also into the question of placing boys in these schools after they leave them.  I feel sure the Minister is interested in the future of these boys and girls and I should like to know whether it has been possible, through the social organisations, to keep contact with them after they <Col N="1279" /> leave the institutions.  In the case of the girls it would be very important. It would be desirable if these institutions adopted the practice which was initiated of having some kind of past pupils' union.  If they met together and corresponded and kept in touch with each other, even though some of them had to leave the country, I think it would be of great benefit.  From the religious viewpoint it would be most advantageous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this Estimate principally for one reason, to urge the Minister to bring about a change, a complete change, in the teaching of Irish in our primary and secondary schools.  I do so for two reasons.  I feel the present system or method employed in our schools has had an adverse effect on the education which our children have been getting. Secondly, I speak on the matter because I think it has hindered the growth of the language revival.  I think the evidence available against the system which has been operated now for 30 years is indeed overwhelming. We have our leading educationists in this country speaking about it and talking of the difficulties in the system as operated at the present time.  We have had Deputies from both sides of the House, year after year, complaining of the manner in which the Irish language is taught in the primary and secondary schools; and we have had the teachers themselves on several occasions&mdash;and they should be persons with first hand knowledge&mdash;asking for a change in the system that is being operated and, I believe, unsuccessfully operated for nearly 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only degree of support which the present system has got has been from the Report of the Council of Education.  The Report of the Council of Education on this subject, I think, demonstrates that it can be regarded as only a pusillanimous approach to the question.  In paragraph 203 the report indicates that the present system with regard to the Irish language has met with a great deal of apathy.  Even the mild words of the <Col N="1280" /> report indicate that the policy that has been worked in the schools for the past 30 years has failed to bring about the enthusiasm for the language which we would all so desire.</P>
    <P>I feel the fact that the love of the language has been soured, that the enthusiasm for the language has been warped and the fine ideals have waned is because we have had a policy in the schools which has not been conducive to the revival of the language.  To my mind, the principal argument against the system is the effect it has had on the education of our children. We have got a duty in this House to see that persons who are unable to provide for their own education get it through the State and we must try and fulfil that duty and see that the State gives to the children the best possible education.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote to the House the evidence collected for many years and published in the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the use of the Irish language as a teaching medium.  The report was published by the I.N.T.O. in 1941.  This report indicates that the teachers' organisation went very carefully into the effects of the teaching of Irish in primary schools where the home language was English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>Does the Deputy mean the teaching of Irish or teaching through Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The teaching through Irish of subjects where the home language was English has had a deleterious effect on the education of the children concerned.  I should like to quote first of all from page 28 of this report.  It refers to the teaching of arithmetic through the medium of Irish in standards I, II and III.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Five hundred and fifty-four, roughly 86 per cent. of the replies to the query: &lsquo;Do all the pupils receive benefit from instruction through Irish equal to that which they would receive through English?&rsquo; were in the negative.  Eighty-seven, or 14 per cent. held the contrary view.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report deals very adequately with different aspects of mathematics, and <Col N="1281" /> sums up the findings on page 41 on this subject in regard to all classes and branches of mathematics in the primary schools as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The vast bulk of the evidence submitted to us in the replies would go to show that once the mechanical aspect of mathematical instruction is mastered further progress is definitely hampered by the use of a language other than the home language of the child.  This applies especially to the application of problems and theorems in geometry and with overwhelming force when it is sought to show algebra to be what it really is, generalised arithmetic.  We are convinced from this evidence that an unanswerable case is made against the use as the medium of mathematical instruction of any other language, save the home language of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that could not be in stronger language.  Surely we should take some cognisance of what the I.N.T.O. say with regard to this problem.  I know other Deputies may be better qualified, from first hand knowledge of the teaching of the Irish language, than I am to speak on the teaching of arithmetic through the medium of Irish in national schools, but the fact remains that here is evidence from the teachers' organisation on this subject which clearly indicates that pupils have for years been deprived of the full benefit of education in this field.  The same is true of history, and on page 42 the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In comparing the benefits to be derived by the pupils from instruction in history through the medium of Irish, and through the medium of English, 382 of those replying asserted that the benefit from instruction through Irish was not equal to the benefit from instruction through the medium of English.  Fifty-five held that it was.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar queries were asked in regard to geography and a similar percentage replied that the benefit was less to the pupils than if they were taught through their home language.  I think the evidence which we all have from our own knowledge of the inadequacy of the education that our children are getting, <Col N="1282" /> is borne out by this very detailed report, which I think has not been given sufficient attention since it was published and which the Council of Education in its report largely ignored.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the effect I believe the present system has had on the love of the language, on the desire of people to speak the language.  Again I speak from observation and I feel I speak on behalf of many other people who have had the same experience which I have had.  However, I want to refer Deputies to perhaps a higher authority than my word, the authority of the professor of Irish language and literature in University College, Cork, Professor R.A. Breathnach, who has published an article in the current edition of <i>Studies</i> headed &ldquo;Revival or Survival?&rdquo;  Here again another very learned authority, to whose views we should listen, has added his testimony to that of the many others who have spoken about the deleterious effect that the present policy has had on the revival of Irish.  Page 137 of this article reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The pressure exerted in the field of education, mainly in the national schools and to a less extent in the secondary schools, in the cause of the language, is so well known in general outline that there is no need to dwell on the subject.  It is to be hoped that someone with longer experience than the writer can claim of the policy as applied in the national schools will trace in detail its development from the first beginnings to the ultimate stalemate.  It can scarcely be denied that the machine designed to mass-produce speakers of Irish has proved to be a lethal contrivance.  It was geared to perform the task of establishing infant Gaelic microcosms within an adult English macrocosm.  In its failure to make any impression on the latter, it seems to have produced only apathy and a sense of frustration in the minds of many of those who, more than any others, have borne the burden of the day and the heat thereof for 30 years.  Apart from the effect on the morale of the teachers, amply evidenced by numerous public pronouncements, there is no doubt that the continuous use of <Col N="1283" /> pressure methods to propagate Irish in the schools has killed much of the love, joy and pride proper to the teaching and learning of the language; in the absence of these the study, its patriotic motivation obscured or lost, ceases to have any real meaning and bears only Dead Sea fruit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again on page 141 the Professor says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The establishment of Irish as the <i>summum bonum</i>, then, seems to have brought, as far as the language itself is concerned, a minimum of real progress. Certainly, the outcome has not been to give the majority of students who have been taught wholly or partly through Irish anything approaching a satisfactory colloquial command of the language.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I could bandy around reports with the Deputy if I wanted to, but I think the Deputy would do well to read a comment by another educational authority, this time in the 1954 winter edition of <i>Studies</i>, again by a lecturer in education, this time in University College, Dublin, Father Ó Catháin, who has criticised in very strong terms the manner in which the Report of the Council of Education was worded and its recommendations on this question of the teaching of Irish.  If the Deputy would look at this article, he would see that in three or four pages of his article he criticises in no uncertain terms this part of the Report of the Council of Education and refers to the fact that they have endeavoured to give an appearance of unanimity but that, in fact, it is clear from the report that they were far from unanimous in their recommendation. Let me quote from page 374 of this article:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not against &lsquo;compulsory Irish&rsquo;.  Have we not compulsory arithmetic and English, and one hears no complaints?  But I am against a compulsion that has remained meaningless to most of our people.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As a subject, it is compulsory.  Arithmetic through Irish is not compulsory.  The Deputy started off by saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I have no objection to Irish being made compulsory just as I have no objection to other subjects being made compulsory. <Col N="1285" /> I feel that, as Professor Breathnach has said, Dead Sea fruit has certainly been borne, from the experience we have had up to the present time.</P>
      <P>Some of the remarks in this debate up to the present have been directed towards the desirability of raising the school-leaving age.  I want to add my comments to them.  I feel we have developed in Ireland over the past 30 years a very fine system of social welfare benefits, a very fine system of assistance to our citizens when they are in need.  There are many aspects of it yet which we should like to improve but, on the whole, the system has been one of which we can be proud.  The one aspect of assistance to our community which the State has largely neglected is the inadequate education it gives to its young citizens.  The report of the Council of Education demonstrates that two-thirds of our children get no further education beyond that given to them in the primary schools.  That is a scandalous situation and one which we must try to remedy at the earliest possible opportunity.  It seems to me that, cost what it may, we must make efforts in the near future to raise the school-leaving age.  Even if extra burdens have to be borne by our people, I feel they would willingly be borne if it were made clear to them why we are requesting them to bear them.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to our young people to try and ensure that they are given a proper start in life.  It is a deplorable state of affairs that so many of them have such a poor start when they leave the primary school.  In the time that must elapse before the school-leaving age is raised, I should like the Minister to try and increase greatly the number of scholarships granted through his Department so that the more advanced and cleverer ones, at any rate, can be given facilities for better education which they are unable to afford out of their own means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the export of works of art from this country.  There is considerable evidence that many fine works of art, both of our native art and foreign art, have been leaving this country over the past few years.  At the present time, the <Col N="1286" /> markets have never been higher for works of art in England and America. Many of the finest specimens we possessed have left this country and gone to foreign buyers.  Other countries have legislation to try and stop it.  The Minister should consider bringing in legislation to try to give compensation to vendors of pictures and other works of art who wish to sell them and get a market price for them, so that these works of art can go to the State.  This system is being adopted in countries such as France, Italy and Spain.  We should endeavour to ensure that our native works of art are not scattered throughout the four corners of the earth and that the works of art which we possess are kept in Ireland for the enjoyment of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow Deputy Costello by stressing the need for a great deal more scientific education in this country and, what is even more important, a great deal of elementary education to give people the desire even to learn science and technology.  It is very much easier for us to talk on this subject now that the Council of Education have made some serious and very conservative pronouncements and have clearly indicated that the primary school course cannot provide the full minimum education required by our citizens.  It is a sign of the complete lack of realism in this country that, with all the controversy we have had since the war and with all the difficulties we face, that single sentence by the Council of Education has not had more comment among all sections of the community.  In some ways, that sentence is to my mind of far greater importance than anything said recently about the balance of payments or our economic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been thinking for many years that the principal problem in this country is an educational one.  I have taken the trouble to inquire into comparable educational facilities in other countries in Northern Europe.  I can say without fear of contradiction that we have the worst technological education in Northern Europe&mdash;the fewest facilities, the fewest number of teachers, the fewest number of schools and the fewest number of pupils.  No <Col N="1287" /> country comes anywhere near us in our deficiencies in that respect.  It is the fault of no particular Party or Government; it is the gross deficiency of feeling and thought among the lot of us.  None of us and no section of the people is primarily responsible.</P>
    <P>If we study the history of education in other countries we will find that it is a curious thing that, generally, it is a small group in the community which stimulates better education.  Very often you will find that the people in charge of education&mdash;the managers, the educational authorities, the politicians or any particular group of societies&mdash; do not bring about educational reforms.  Improvement generally comes through a few enthusiasts who may represent any one or many sections of the community.  We have lacked the enthusiasts, and in full measure.  Part of the whole deficiency in education here is based on the fact that there has been a presumption amongst us all and among both the principal Parties of this House that high-grade technical education is not required by the vast majority of the agricultural community.  It has been assumed by way of default or remission that that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking mainly about rural areas.  That being the case, the whole of technological education lags behind because the major part of the community is not considered to require these greater facilities. This has been the case in regard to a number of countries.  There is nothing exceptional about it.  You have only to study the rural educational history of Denmark or Holland or Belgium or Great Britain to find that, in these countries, too, there was a period of pronounced and prolonged deficiency.  Therefore, there is nothing of which we need be particularly ashamed except that we have left it desperately late whereas other countries have gone ahead.</P>

    <P>There has always been a tendency for rural education to lag.  It lagged <Col N="1288" /> in Denmark for a very considerable period.  They got their independence earlier than we did and they took steps earlier than we did to put it right.  Agricultural education lagged in Holland.  At the point when greater facilities were established for elementary agricultural education, and elementary technology in the schools, it was found that there was a gross deficiency of teachers.  As far as I can ascertain it has never lagged through any lack of co-operation on the part of managerial authorities, whoever they have been, in Northern Europe, whether lay or ecclesiastic.</P>
    <P>The demand for this kind of education springs from a number of diverse individuals in the community, of no particular kind or sort, and it is they who get the job done and get the improvements effected.  The Butler Educational Act was passed in Great Britain in, I think, 1945.  No one can say that in the previous period of ten years there was any large-scale political agitation either in the Labour Party or the Conservative Party for the improvements made as a result of that Act.  It came largely from educational experts and enthusiasts of a miscellaneous type.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have to face this issue and we have to face the fact that, according to the Council of Education, a very large number of people do not reach the conclusion of the primary school education; they are unable to take it, unable to follow the full course; and they consider that the school-leaving age should obviously be raised.  Some time ago the Youth Unemployment Commission proposed the raising of the school-leaving age and nothing was done about it.  There was a Commission on Agriculture, which reported in 1947 and which recommended an improvement in agricultural education facilities of the junior type.  Nothing was done about that.  In fact, it looks to me, from studying the history of this country, that one of the things we have all done on both sides of this House is to ignore the solid but difficult recommendations of practically every expert council that has sat for us since the foundation of the State.  As I have <Col N="1289" /> said, we have studied the patient recommendations of many of these people; they have proved in the light of events to be excellent and most of them have been ignored.</P>
    <P>I notice also that the Council of Education recommended the study of nature and of rural science in the primary school.  That also has been adverted to by other organisations.  So far as rural science is concerned, I understand that it is taught in less than 100 schools out of the total number in the State.  I understand that only 4,000 out of nearly 500,000 engaged in agriculture take the night classes which go on from November to January, given by the Department of Agriculture.  I understand that about 4,500 people take the rural science courses in the vocational schools, representing the children of 250,000 farmers.  I understand that secondary school courses in rural science and allied subjects are taken by 1 per cent. of the secondary school population.</P>
    <P>Of course, the position is that agricultural education should be in the premier place in this country; that this is not the case is no more the fault of the present Government than of the past Government.  Agricultural instruction and education should be in the very highest position.  The salaries should be the highest; the kind of people attracted to that work should be the finest citizens in the State; it should be almost, apart from ecclesiastical education, the No. 1 education of the country.  That is not so.  Neither the emoluments nor the conditions of service at the present time are likely to attract people to go into this service and the appallingly inadequate conditions at Albert College for the training of science students would discourage any person except one with an extraordinary vocation for agriculture from entering into that field.  That is the position.  It is a thing about which we all ought to start thinking.  This is a non-political subject.  We are all of us equally guilty.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, if you compare this country with any other country whose major export is agricultural, the whole of the ground work and the basic foundation <Col N="1290" /> of teaching here is grossly inadequate; the whole of the agricultural teaching is inadequate.  I am referring to countries such as Great Britain, Holland and Denmark, who compete with us in the British market, who are competing more than successfully with us at the present time and who, in fact, are driving us out of the British market.</P>
    <P>One of the things about which we have to make up our minds in this country is the fact that there is an enormous number of people here who, because of the easier opportunities of economic life in Great Britain, do not genuinely believe that there is any point in a farmer's son here on a farm of less than 50 to 80 acres acquiring the complicated kind of science which will enable him to increase agricultural production on the farm.  There is a sort of feeling that, even if production were doubled on the small holdings by the use of science, both practical and theoretical, no greater number of people could be supported on that farm, that more might even leave it, whereas of course, unless we insist that the whole of the land of this country be used productively to the maximum degree, we shall not survive as a nation; we shall not be able to support a larger population.  We shall recognise that, even although the population of rural areas does not increase in itself, it would bring purchasing power to the neighbouring towns, to those who provide the farmers with goods and services and in that way we can achieve the object we set out to achieve, which is to increase economic activity in this State.</P>
    <P>We have to make up our minds about this.  It so happens that in every other country in Europe which exports agricultural produce, education for the smallest farmer, from five acres onwards, is considered absolutely indispensable if that farmer and that agricultural community are to export their produce in competition with others. There is no acreage limit whatever in any of these countries.  In none of the countries who compete with us agriculturally is it considered that, for two-thirds of the agricultural area, agricultural scientific teaching of the very <Col N="1291" /> highest, most complex order is unnecessary because the farms are too small or the land is too poor to make it worth while.  There are millions and millions of acres in Europe supporting families, whose produce is exported to Great Britain, where the land is no better than the land of Mayo, Donegal or Kerry, where climatic conditions are no better and where agricultural science is considered absolutely indispensable.</P>
    <P>The basic foundation of rural education is surely that the primary pupils, either through the school-leaving age being raised or through other methods, have got to be given the basic training to want to understand technology, to want to regard the soil and the use thereof as a scientific matter, to want to have the ambition to explore the mysteries of the soil and the whole of the science of botany and zoology.  The desire to understand, the desire to learn has first of all to be inculcated before the vast majority of these people are capable of taking the instruction.</P>
    <P>Again, there is nothing unique in that.  In practically every other country where scientific education follows upon primary education, a considerable proportion of the teaching in the first few years is in relation to the language of the people concerned, be it Dutch, Danish or German, to mathematics and to fundamental elementary science, in order that they may proceed to understand and be sufficiently educated to comprehend technology, science and go ahead with further technical education. That being the case, we can understand that, so far as this country is concerned, this preparation for further technological education is absolutely essential.  I take it that that is what the Council of Education had in mind when they used these very conservative words, that the primary school cannot provide the full minimum of education.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how little this statement has sunk into the mind of the community.  To my mind it is a tremendous condemnation of the present educational system.  This recommendation <Col N="1292" /> is a tremendous condemnation of the preparation which has been given to the school-children in this country now facing an age of automation, an entirely new and different age from which we cannot escape unless we want deliberately to remain in the backwater.  There may be arguments for remaining in the backwater and not taking part in the scientific age.  If there are arguments, let us be frank about them and let us establish a new system of education which encourages emigration.  Let us decide to have something different from the other countries of Europe. Whatever we do, let us be outspoken about it.  If we say we cannot afford high-grade technological education in this country, if the Budget cannot support it or if the people do not want it, let us make up our mind about it.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to advocate for my constituents a reduction in the current Government expenditure to enable further educational facilities to be provided and I would be prepared to advocate any reduction in current or capital expenditure under other heads in order to provide capital costs of buildings and technical apparatus and anything that was required in order that education would be improved. It would be a desperate thing if Deputies were not willing to support such a proposal if the Minister came before the House and said he required money and that it was difficult to find.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a number of people have been talking about this.  We had the report of the joint Commission of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association on the Agricultural Institute.  There are a great number of paragraphs which deserve to be recorded in the annals of this House in the same way as Deputy Costello quoted reports of other councils and committees which debated educational problems.  It is just as well that some of this would be put on record.  Let me quote from page 9 of the Report on Agricultural Institute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An appreciation of agriculture should permeate our whole educational <Col N="1293" /> system.  This should begin in the national school, where agriculture should get its proper place in the reading-books, and should be deepened and extended in the vocational school, the secondary school and the university.  A knowledge of rural science, sufficient at least to appreciate the elementary ideas of botany, chemistry and biology is desirable for life on the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Speaking of rural education on page 23, Section 18 of the report, the commission states the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Holland and Denmark owe their present high state of agricultural development to their comprehensive systems of agricultural education over the years.  In Denmark, the Folk-High schools of Gruntvig give the young people a pride in their country and a love for the land, two factors without which more agricultural efficiency is sterile.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to vocational education, the commission report as follows, on page 23, Section 19:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is vital to recognise that the major function of vocational schools should be to improve education in agriculture: our most important vocation.  It is not sufficient for such education to convey the necessary skills for becoming a farmer, it must also convey the desire to become a farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This report was written largely by farmers, together with professors of agricultural subjects in the university. The report goes on to recommend a very great extension of rural science and agricultural science in the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>It is just as well to make some comparisons. We have now reached the stage when we should not be ashamed of making comparisons with other countries.  Every country has deficiencies to overcome.  The British, according to their present Prime Minister, are in mortal peril.  One of the disgraceful things in this country is the smugness we adopt in studying many of our problems as though we were afraid to face our own deficiencies when the Parliaments of practically every other country in the world are <Col N="1294" /> constantly admitting theirs and admitting the things that need to be overcome.</P>
    <P>I am frequently told that you cannot compare Holland with Ireland; that they are different.  The only thing I know about Holland is that it is an infinitely more congested country; that it has some 5,500,000 acres of arable land crowded into a small community very much smaller than Ireland.  They have lost the Empire on which they depended for their existence.  The country was severely damaged during the last war and the people have to work very hard to improve their economic conditions.  They have always had to do so.  They are a very hard working people with, perhaps, less imagination than we have.  They have the benefit of a longer period of independence with all the privileges going with it.  They compete on the British market with us and they are composed to a very considerable degree of people of our own religion.  I refuse to admit that there is not an element of comparison.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell me or anybody with any sense in this country that Irish farmers and the sons of Irish farmers need a lower standard of technical study than Dutch farmers because nobody can prove it.  Judging by the export figures and the difficulties we have in expanding agricultural production there is no proof that such is the case. There is an element of absolute comparison with Holland or with Denmark for that matter.  There may be a difference in the methods of teaching that should be adopted.  It may be more difficult to teach agriculture in this country owing to the diversity of the soils.  The problem may be greater or more difficult but we should glory in overcoming these difficulties if there are such.</P>
    <P>In any event in Holland £2,000,000 per annum are spent on agricultural education among the sons of 147,000 farmers compared with our £250,000. That is the first fact to notice; £700,000 is spent on agricultural primary education; £670,000 on agricultural secondary education and the remainder on research and agricultural <Col N="1295" /> university education.  I should not like to quote our figures.</P>
    <P>There are general evening courses, two winters of 144 hours each for certain classes of students which include natural history, chemistry, zoology, live stock and dairying, fertilisers. There are 436 classes of ten members upwards totalling 7,000 pupils.  The teachers act as advisers in their spare time.  It was found that this general course was not suitable to the majority of the community because, first of all, being evening work, it was difficult particularly because the people lived far away from where they worked. Finally, it was found that the course took place at a time when the students had forgotten too much of the work they had done in the primary school. It was found that there was a lack of continuity between primary education and this general course.  The premises were inadequate for the teaching.  The Dutch Government, consequently, in full co-operation with the ecclesiastical authorities&mdash;I might add with the very great enthusiasm of the ecclesiastical authorities, particularly those of the same religion as the majority of the people of this country&mdash;inaugurated the elementary school agricultural education for boys between the ages of 13 and 14.</P>
    <P>There are 206 elementary schools in a country where there are 147,000 farmers. In those schools, there are 18,000 pupils coming from 5,500,000 acres and not from 17,000,000 acres as they do here.  Every sixth day of the school the teachers visit the parents' farms from which the students come. Successful pupils go on to more advanced classes.  There are four forms in these elementary schools.  In the first year the total period of school work is spread over 40 weeks in the year, two and a half days a week, leaving the boy to work for his family for the rest of the period.  In the second year, there are 40 weeks of one day per week, and in the third and fourth years the school term is 30 weeks for one day a week, leaving plenty of time for the boys to do the work which is required of them on their farms.</P>
    <P>In the first form there is a total of <Col N="1296" /> 560 hours of work during the year. This is interesting&mdash;of the 560 hours, 120 are allotted to the Dutch language and 120 to arithmetic.  Most of the rest of the first year is devoted to natural history and the history of Holland.  It includes civic teaching and teaching on all the needs of Holland as an agricultural country, the teaching of the young farmer, his duties towards his land in connection with export and marketing, in connection with the difficulty of holding Holland's place in the world's agricultural market and methods of improving it.  That is one of the courses in the first year.  It is repeated in subsequent years because this subject&mdash;the whole of it&mdash;is not regarded as a subject which can be dealt with fully for pupils of that age. That is regarded as a subject for adult education taking place at the age of 18 or 19.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the elements of it are taught so far as young boys can understand it, at that time.  In subsequent years all the agricultural subjects are taught, including practical advice and demonstrations, visits to farms and so on, and all the teachers are ultimately linked with advisory services&mdash;many of them are advisers in the summer months&mdash;and the whole agricultural and advisory teaching services even at the primary school stage are interlocked so that no teacher ever becomes too much desk-bound because they are constantly out on the farms and always combine teaching with practice.</P>
    <P>If we wish to reach the agricultural competence of Holland and Denmark nobody can tell us that we can escape the implications of that kind of teaching of Holland.  It may be difficult to bring about anything similar here; it may be years before we could do it, but I cannot see from an intensive study of modern agricultural science how we can compete with other countries in the British market, how we can raise the competence of our people without that kind of teaching. What I am saying is no reflection on the Irish people; it is simply the plain fact that if the Dutch and the Danes need that level of education we need it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a study of the agricultural output of this country and <Col N="1297" /> others would seem to prove that beyond a doubt.  In Holland, having gone through this three or four years' course in elementary education, 3,400 students go on to the advanced winter schools of which there are 40 in the country&mdash;again, a country of some 5,000,000, arable acres.  These winter schools are what are known as secondary vocational schools, but they cannot be compared with our vocational schools because the element of comparison is not there.  They take place from October to April.  There are two forms and, again, in the first form, for pupils who have gone through the three-year course in elementary education out of the 768 hours of study in these winter classes, 120 hours are for Dutch and mathematics, showing the tremendous importance of the teaching of language in order to acquire a deeper scientific knowledge and also the importance of the fact that apparently&mdash;unless the Dutch are very much more stupid than we are&mdash;no person can acquire sufficient knowledge of his language to pursue technical studies without continual refresher courses in that language and extension in the teaching thereof.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the fourth year of agricultural teaching 120 out of 768 hours are occupied with Dutch and mathematics. I notice also in these winter schools that 48 hours out of the 768 are occupied in engineering, a subject which is very much neglected in the countryside.  The number of farmers' sons who acquire technical knowledge enabling them to maintain agricultural machinery is grossly inadequate. In the second form of these winter schools, 10 per cent. of the time is still spent on non-agricultural subjects such as the language and the literature of the country and on mathematics.  In the second form of the winter school agricultural book-keeping plays a very important part and it is an interesting fact because, as far as I know, there is practically no agricultural book-keeping taught at all in this country. Farmers' sons grow up completely unequipped to understand the science of agricultural book-keeping which is not at all simple but is very complicated because of the factors of depreciation <Col N="1298" /> and miscellaneous revenues that accrue from every form of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the question of advanced agricultural education in Holland because the superiority of their advanced agricultural education is so much greater than ours that it would be painful to recount it and it does not arise on this Vote which does not relate to universities.  I only hope that some of the proposals of the National Farmers' Association Commission on the agricultural institute will be adopted in regard to advanced agricultural education in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a matter from which we cannot possibly escape. There is no question but that there is a very great apathy in this country about rural education and there is no question but that this tidal wave of emigration, which has proceeded since the war and for which no one Party or Government is responsible, has caused the very great majority of our people to feel that there is the line of escape, there is the easy way out of their difficulty, and it is very understandable that if everybody who lives on the western coast of Ireland can get work in Great Britain why on earth should they indulge in a course of agricultural education which would be wearisome and difficult to bring about and of which the results would be problematical, with all the difficulties of providing capital, engaging in modern methods of farming, with the inevitability of co-operation between all small farmers, if there is to be any success.</P>
    <P>That is the challenge to the community to-day and there is no escape. Neither the development of industries in the West nor any other method we can adopt can save the country from the ever-growing emigration except we consider the whole land of the country as land which must play its fullest part in our economy.</P>
    <P>At least we must take some steps to provide these facilities.  We can issue a challenge to the whole community that those are alternatives and that otherwise we can see the tremendous growth of emigration continuing and <Col N="1299" /> continuing until only the land that is easiest to work will be worked.  As I said, these are matters of vital importance.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the post-primary education of our people in relation to agriculture is just as vital a factor if we are, for example, to engage again in so humble a thing as the becon trade of Great Britain.  It is a vital factor which cannot be achieved without intensive mental training.  We shall never be able to run the Danes and the Dutch so close in competition on the bacon market of Great Britain, which is worth £12,000,000 to our people in this country, without intensive mental training.  Modern bacon production cannot be carried on save by intensive mental and technical training.</P>
    <P>It can be done no longer on the old traditional basis.  We must face that fact if we are to have a first-class bacon trade with Great Britain, if we want to face the continuous competition that will come, even in the beef trade through imports of Argentinian beef, we require infinitely more mental and technical training.  The question is very simple: is there something so miraculous about our people that they apparently require one-twentieth of the technical training given to the people who come from the land of Holland, Belgium and Great Britain?  Is there something so miraculous about us that we engage in competition with these countries, that we can produce our own feeding stuffs with the best possible results without really doing anything about mental and technical training?  Are we so remarkable a people that we can suffer this deficiency of education?  Are all those other people wasting their time?  Will we eventually find that the £2,000,000 spent by the Dutch people on agricultural education was wasted, that we were the intelligent ones?  Will we come out in the end better than they?</P>
    <P>I very much doubt it.  The principal problem of this country, outside its immediate economic difficulties, is the lack of mental training and technical education.  It is one subject about which we can speak non-politically because we have all been deficient.  The <Col N="1300" /> present Government, either in their first period of office or now have shown no great desire to make revolutionary changes when they had their opportunities any more than we did when we were in office and when we came back to office.</P>
    <P>Our reason for not giving opportunities for better mental training to our people is that we know in our heart of hearts that emigration makes it unnecessary.  This becomes a major problem&mdash;finding the teachers, the buildings, getting the desire for the education.  This is a major problem which requires to be tackled immediaately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in this debate this evening because most of the people who spoke seemed to have very definite views on how education in this country could be improved and should be improved. Perhaps the most revolutionary suggestion was made by Deputy Childers. Might I suggest to the House and to Deputy Childers that while agricultural education is very necessary and that nobody will deny that any amount of money spent on it would be well spent, there is something else which must be tackled first, and that is the question of education in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the rural communities cannot close our eyes to the fact that the standard of education in our rural schools is terribly low.  There is no use in talking about giving higher education to boys and girls who are leaving school at 14 while the teachers hint to them that they should not continue any longer because their standard of living would not be improved by so doing.  They have practically no education, I am ashamed to say.  Many people in the House will probably say I am wrong in that.  I said last year and I repeat it now, that the present system of education under which teachers, most of whom are doing their best, are trying to teach through the medium of Irish to children who are not of Irish-speaking homes is wrong. There are far too many of our 14-year <Col N="1301" /> old children leaving school semiliterate.</P>
    <P>There is no use trying to deny it.  We find it all over the country.  We heard to-night that 33? per cent. of the children attending schools may turn out to be Irish scholars and may leave the primary schools with a sound knowledge of Irish and of everything else taught through the medium of Irish, but 66 per cent. go out unable to carry out their ordinary daily business through any language because of the fact they have not got a sound primary education.  All we have to do is look at the returns of the primary leaving certificate examination to find out about the small number of children put forward for this examination in order to find that there must be something wrong.</P>
    <P>I believe that as long as we continue this system, and unless the Minister and his Department take a definite decision on this matter, we will never have proper education in our primary schools.  There was a lot of talk last year&mdash;it has died down since&mdash;about cruelty in schools.  I believe we will not make scholars through the stick.  We will never make Irish speakers by trying to beat Irish into the children.  That system does exist in a number of schools.  I brought a couple of cases to the attention of the Minister but I have not received his decision yet in any of them.  I suggest that cruelty, whether it be fore the purpose of making children learn Irish or for any other purpose should not be allowed in our schools.  I would draw the Minister's attention to a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of June 19th, headed &ldquo;Gaeltacht na Midhe&mdash;the Experiment that Failed.&rdquo; The person who wrote that article pointed out that in Gibbstown Gaeltacht in Meath there is a very fine modern school.  When that school was first erected it had something like 70 pupils.  The number has now dropped to 16, while an old school, which should be condemned, a mile down the road, is packed to the doors.  There must be something wrong.  I suggest that the Minister should have this matter investigated.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is the third Bill of its kind to come before the House.  Its object is to confirm and give the force of law to an Order which I have made under Section 9 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of motor vehicles, tyres, spare parts and accessories.  The previous two Bills, relating to the trades in radio sets and building materials, received the approval of all parties in the House and, as the principles underlying the present Bill are the same, I feel confident that this measure, too, will commend itself to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Fair Trade Commission held a statutory inquiry under Section 7 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, in relation to the supply and distribution of motor vehicles, tyres, spare parts and accessories.  Subsequently, the commission furnished to me a report of the inquiry, describing the conditions obtaining in the trade and indicating that, in the view of the commission, certain practices existed which interfered unfairly with competition and operated against the public interest.  The report has been published and copies have been circulated to Deputies.  However, to facilitate the House, I propose to give a résumé of the commission's report and of the recommendations which the commission make with a view to terminating restrictive trade practices which are considered to be unfair or to operate against the public interest. Deputies will understand that, in referring to trade practices, I am referring to the position as it was stated in the commission's report and <Col N="1303" /> that I have no means of knowing to what extent, if any, these practices have been altered in the meantime.</P>
    <P>As the commission's report shows, there are two associations in the motor trade, namely, the Irish Motor Traders' Association, which I shall refer to as the association, and the Society of Irish Motor Traders Limited, which I shall call the society.  The society is a company, and its functions include negotiations with Government Departments and trade organisations. The association is a trade union which, in addition to conducting negotiations relating to wages and conditions of employment, undertakes the regulation of trading practices and the enforcement of regulations such as those relating to the approval of new entrants to the trade, and also to resale price maintenance.  The officers, staff and headquarters of the society and the association are identical, and the executive councils of both bodies have a common membership.</P>
    <P>The commission found that, for a considerable number of years, a list of approved motor traders&mdash;known as the Approved List&mdash;was maintained by the association.  Entry to this list was subject to certain requirements which tended to become more comprehensive with the passage of time, and, of course, admission to the list was a prerequisite to the receipt of a large proportion of motor goods on trade terms.  The Approved List was published jointly by the society and the association.  Applicants for admission to the list had not to be members of either the society or the association, and members did not possess any trading advantages over approved nonmembers. The supply and distribution of motor goods were, however, largely influenced by the control arrangements of the association.</P>
    <P>Assemblers and wholesalers who were members of the association or of the society, as well as approved motor traders, undertook to confine supplies of new cars and other motor goods to persons on the Approved List.  It was considered by the association to be an offence to supply goods on trade terms to unapproved traders.  Two of the <Col N="1304" /> large assemblers were not members of either the association or the society, and did not adhere strictly to the Approved List.  Nevertheless, the majority of the main dealers appointed by both these assemblers were approved by the association and, consequently, had bound themselves to make supplies available only to approved traders.</P>
    <P>The association also enforced the maintenance of resale prices fixed by assemblers for new passenger cars, and, by manufacturers, for tyres.  A trader who was dicovered by the association to have supplied goods on trade terms to an unapproved trader, or to have sold a new car or tyre for less than the manufacturers' list prices, might be subjected by the association to punitive action, such as a fine or removal from the approved list.  The proprietor of an unapproved garage could normally obtain a new vehicle for sale only by surreptitious means from an approved dealer.</P>
    <P>The smaller assemblers usually relied for a substantial proportion of their trade on sales direct to the public.  The larger assemblers, on the other hand, appointed main dealers through whom supplies were channelled to sub-dealers and casual dealers.  The largest assemblers aimed at the appointment of main dealers on a more or less exclusive basis.  Even where exclusiveness was not attained the main dealer was usually prohibited from accepting dealerships for other makes of car without the permission of the assembler.  Each assembler had formal agreements for distribution with his main dealers and also, as a rule, with his sub-dealers.</P>
    <P>Some of the agreements provided for the operation of reciprocal exclusive arrangements between the main dealer and the assembler.  The degree of exclusiveness varied; in some cases it involved the main dealer in confining his sales to the new vehicles produced by an assembler.  In others it meant that, while the main dealer might become a sub-dealer or a casual dealer for other makes of car, he undertook not to take on a second main dealership.</P>
    <P>New vehicles and spare parts were <Col N="1305" /> supplied by assemblers to dealers on the basis of list prices less discounts. The discounts varied between assemblers.  If certain exceptional discounts are omitted, the range of discounts for passenger cars would be 17½ per cent. to 20 per cent. for main dealers, 15 per cent. to 17½ per cent. for sub-dealers, and 11 per cent. to 15 per cent. for casual dealers.  For commercial vehicles the range would be 18 per cent. to 20 per cent. for main dealers, 15 per cent. to 17½ per cent. sub-dealers and 13 per cent. to 15 per cent. casual dealers.  It was stated in evidence that the assemblers settled their discounts without reference to each other and without being subject to the direction of the manufacturing companies from which they import aggregates of parts for vehicle assembly.  Generally, assemblers claimed that their discounts were fixed at as low a level as possible, having regard to the structure of the trade and the overhead and operating costs of garages.</P>
    <P>The commission point out, however, that only in a few cases, and then only to a limited extent, had any analyses of dealers' costs been made in this country.  An important feature of the trade is the extent to which second-hand cars are taken in part exchange for new cars.  It was estimated that 90 per cent. of sales of new cars involved transactions in second-hand cars.  Despite frequent consideration, the association had not evolved a method of controlling the allowances made by dealers in respect of second-hand cars and this situation had rendered the maintenance of the retail prices of new cars difficult, if not anomalous.  As regards spare parts and accessories supplied by assemblers, the general trend of discounts was 25 per cent. to 33? per cent. for main dealers, 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. for sub-dealers and 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. for casual dealers.</P>
    <P>In their agreements with dealers, the assemblers prescribed that sales to the trade and to the public must be made at the prices stipulated by them and provision was made for the imposition of penalties such as fines, or the cessation of supplies, for breaches of this <Col N="1306" /> or other conditions.  The enforcement of resale prices in respect of new vehicles was not normally undertaken by the assembler acting independently. Instead, reliance was placed on collective enforcement by the association. The enforcement arrangements of the association were, at the time of the inquiry, applied in respect of new passenger cars and tyres but not in respect of commercial vehicles or other spare parts or accessories.  The two assemblers who were not members of the association stated that they would, if necessary, take action under their agreements to enforce the maintenance of prices.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that an applicant for approval by the association as a motor retailer was required to meet certain onerous requirements.  His garage had to have a ground floor space of at least 3,000 square feet under one roof.  He was required to have specified tool and office equipment and to carry an adequate stock of accessories and parts.  If not himself mechanically qualified, he was obliged to employ a motor mechanic who had completed a five-year apprenticeship in an approved garage.  Moreover, he had to give a written undertaking to adhere rigidly to the price maintenance regulations prescribed by the association.  The conditions for entry into the motor repairers' section of the approved list were less onerous than those for approval as a motor retailer, but it may be noted that garages in this section are not supplied with new cars on trade terms. The conditions for approval by the association as a wholesaler called for the possession by the applicant of very substantial capital for investment in the business, and premises with specified ground floor space.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers' section of the Approved List catered for the manufacturers of home produced components and materials such as sparking plugs, batteries and springs.  The formula for admission to this section of the Approved List provided that applicants must not market motor goods other than (a) the goods they manufactured or (b) goods bearing the same brand names or other recognised brand <Col N="1307" /> names of the same manufacturer; they must have a suitable premises of at least 1,250 square feet; and any other business conducted in the same premises must be allied to the motor trade and conducted exclusively on a wholesale basis.  The formula also required applicants to possess substantial minimum capital in certain circumstances.  The advantage of inclusion in the manufacturers' section appeared to arise partly from the goodwill attaching to membership and partly from the request made to retailers to purchase only from persons whose names were included on the list. So far as persons in other sections of the Approved List were concerned the advantage of having manufacturers on the list was clearly connected with the expectation that they would confine supplies to persons on the list.</P>
    <P>The commission have concluded that the system described in the report whereby the association apply conditions for the approval of traders, and impose requirements with the object of confining supplies of motor goods to persons on the Approved List, constitutes a restriction of competition and a restraint of trade.  In the opinion of the commission this interference with competition and trade is unfair and operates against the public interest. The regulations governing the approval of persons seeking to qualify as retailers are unnecessarily severe.  The garages of a substantial proportion of approved retailers do not meet the minimum standards demanded of a newcomer to the trade.  If a marked proportion of approved traders have not been compelled or induced by the circumstances of trading to achieve or exceed such minimum standards, it is clearly unreasonable to expect them of a new entrant with limited resources who has not yet become established in the trade.  The commission also consider that the regulations for the approval of motor repairers are excessively restrictive.</P>
    <P>The commission accept that motor-vehicles require the service of skilled mechanics with adequate equipment at their disposal.  They are of opinion, however, that any minimum conditions in this regard which may be essential <Col N="1308" /> should be formulated by the individual assembler and not by an association of traders.  The conditions adopted by the association for the approval of wholesalers unreasonably limit free and fair competition.  The regulations about capital and premises operate unfairly against the applicant with experience but with only modest resources. The commission are satisfied that the tendency of the conditions as a whole is to preserve the <i>status quo,</i> and to retard the development of new methods in the wholesale distribution of motor goods.  The commission consider that assemblers, manufacturers and other suppliers should not be governed in their distribution arrangements by adherence to the approved list.  As requirements for admission to the approved list are deemed by the commission to be unreasonable and unfair, it would, in their view, be contrary to the public interest that suppliers should confine the supply of their goods on trade terms to persons on such a list.  Motor goods manufactured in this country are protected by tariff or by quota and, in consequence, the sources of supply of the goods are, in many cases, necessarily limited.  It is the view of the commission that, in such circumstances, a responsibility rests on suppliers to ensure that persons actively engaged in the trade are not handicapped in earning their livelihood by reason of inability to obtain supplies of the goods on trade terms. It is always open to the individual assembler or to any other supplier, acting on his own initiative, to apply conditions relating to such matters as technical service and stocks which he considers to be necessary for the efficient distribution of his goods.  Any conditions of supply which he imposes should, however, be fair and reasonable. In the case of tyres, which form an important item in the stock-in-trade of any garage, there are two brands, but only one producer, in this country.  Accordingly, if supplies of tyres are restricted to garages, the conditions of supply should not be such as to exclude any public service garages from supplies of tyres on appropriate terms except for causes such as those related to creditworthiness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> As regards resale price maintenance in the motor trade, the conclusion of the commission is that the practice operates against the public interest and should, subject to certain safeguards, be abolished.  It is the view of the commission that the operation of resale price maintenance in respect of new vehicles tends to be anomalous and arbitrary in a situation where the part-exchange of second-hand vehicles plays so large a rôle in selling.  If a trader is free to give a high trade-in allowance to one purchaser it is difficult to justify the imposition of a penalty on him if he reduces the price of a new car for another purchaser.  The commission consider, however, that the individual assembler should be at liberty to withhold supplies of new vehicles from a trader who sells the vehicles at or below the prices at which he purchased them from the assembler, or (subject to notifying the commission and to the right of the commission to review the action taken) to withhold supplies from a trader who has advertised new vehicles for sale at less than the assembler's list prices.  The effect of this would be to allow the individual purchaser to bargain freely with the dealer regarding the price of a new vehicle.  It is the view of the commission, however, that the provision should be contingent on the continued absence of collective controls over the allowances given by traders for second-hand vehicles.</P>
    <P>As regards spare parts and accessories, the commission point out that the margins afforded to traders are substantial, and that the protection afforded to the home manufacturers of such goods tends to reduce the extent of competition in the market.  The commission are of opinion that price competition between traders in spare parts and accessories would provide a safeguard against excessive margins and serve to ensure economy in distribution. The commission consider, however, that a supplier should be allowed to fix maximum prices for parts and accessories.  With regard to tyres, the commission refer to the exceptionally strong position of the manufacturer in the market and point out that this removes any risk to the manufacturer <Col N="1310" /> which might be said to lie in the abolition of minimum prices.  The commission deem it advisable that the individual supplier should be allowed to withhold supplies of tyres from a trader who resells the tyres at or below the price at which he purchased them.  The commission consider it undesirable that minimum charges for technical repair and maintenance services should be fixed or enforced either by an individual assembler or by an association, but they see no objection to the fixing of maximum charges for such services by an assembler acting solely on his own initiative.</P>
    <P>Referring to the practice of exclusive dealing in the trade, the commission point out that there are certain advantages, as well as some risks, attaching to the practice.  It enables the assembler to exercise a considerable measure of control over the distribution of his goods, and provides him with an incentive to develop the efficiency of his dealers.  On the other hand, if extended in this market, it could lead to the control by a few of the larger assemblers of the principal retail outlets, and, if widely adopted, would result in an increase in the costs of distribution.  The commission have not recommended any basic modification of the system as it now operates but have stated that, should the practice be extended or be made more restrictive, the commission might consider it desirable to review it in the light of the altered circumstances.</P>
    <P>With the object of removing the abuses which exist and restoring conditions of free and fair competition in the trade in motor goods, the commission recommend in their report that an Order should be made prohibiting the particular practices which are considered to be harmful to the public interest.  The commission recommend that resale price maintenance should be prohibited and that it should be made possible for traders to determine their own selling prices in the light of their own operating costs. As a corollary, there should be a prohibition on the collective fixing of trade-in allowances for second-hand cars or of minimum charges for technical services.  To provide a safeguard <Col N="1311" /> against the possibility that price competition in the trade may occasionally become excessive, suppliers should be free to withhold goods from a person who resells at a price equal to or less than the purchase price and fails to give an acceptable undertaking to discontinue doing so.  A supplier should also be entitled to withhold supplies of new motor vehicles from a person who advertises for sale of a new car at a price less than the list price indicated by the supplier and fails to give an acceptable undertaking to discontinue this practice.</P>
    <P>As regards the arrangements and practices adopted by the trade with the object of regulating the channels of distribution, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a supplier to withhold supplies from a trader on the grounds that the trader is or is not a member of a particular organisation or association or because the trader's name does not appear on an approved list.  It is also recommended by the commission that no trade association should be permitted to coerce a supplier to withhold supplies from any person, and that no association should be allowed to prepare or publish lists of approved or non-approved persons which are likely to restrict entry to the trade in motor goods or to be used as a basis for regulating or influencing the supply and distribution of such goods, or the terms and conditions on which such goods will be supplied.  The commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for any person to secure a boycott of any supplier on the grounds that the supplier has refused to do any act which would be contrary to the terms of the Order.</P>
    <P>There are, finally, two recommendations by the commission regarding the imposition by individual manufacturers or assemblers of terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders.  Firstly, it is recommended that a manufacturer or assembler should be permitted to impose conditions covering such matters as the size and frequency of orders, the functions of garages and the services to be rendered to the <Col N="1312" /> public.  The only reservations are that these conditions should be reasonable, that they should be equitably applied to all persons seeking supplies and that they should be filed with the commission, which may, if circumstances at any time so require, make fair trading rules in relation thereto.  Secondly, it is recommended that there should be a prohibition against a manufacturer or assembler differentiating between customers for resale who should, in the normal way, be supplied on the same terms and conditions having regard to the size and the frequency of their orders.  The commission do not consider that a manufacturer or assembler should be prevented from advertising or specifying a maximum resale price or from withholding supplies from a trader who sells at a price in excess of the maximum price.  Any such specified price should not, however, be binding on traders as a minimum price.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the commission have not recommended any basic modification of the existing system under which assemblers are free to arrange their own channels of distribution through the appointment of main dealers and sub-dealers of their own choice.</P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission.  I am of opinion that the commission are fully justified in making the recommendations which are contained in their report and I agree entirely with these recommendations. I am satisfied that it is unfair that manufacturers and assemblers of motor goods, all of whom enjoy the benefit of tariff or other protection, should discriminate against traders by refusing to supply them on the grounds that the traders are not approved by a particular trade association.  I am of opinion, also, that it is wrong that it should be within the competence of vested trading interests to restrict or regulate the right of new traders to enter into the trade.  I am satisfied that it is contrary to the interests of the consumer that competition should be restricted both by the operation of arrangements between manufacturers, assemblers and distributors to regulate <Col N="1313" /> the channels of distribution and by the enforcement of minimum resale prices for motor goods.</P>
    <P>I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Report of the Fair Trade Commission and a copy of the Order has been circulated to Deputies.  Section 9 (3) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order.</P>
    <P>Since the Order was published it has been represented to me that it will, when confirmed, have adverse effects on the level of employment and on wage rates in the motor trade.  Employment is given in the assembly of motor vehicles, in the manufacture of motor goods and in garages on servicing and repair work.  The Order can have no effect on the public demand for motor vehicles and other motor goods or on the public demand for essential servicing and repair work. It is, therefore, ridiculous for anyone to suggest that this Order can have any effect, however remote, on employment or wage rates in the industry.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested to me also that the Order may result in a lowering of the standard of skilled service provided by garages.  I must repudiate this suggestion also.  The position is that, under Article 14 of the Order, an individual assembler will be free to impose reasonable conditions as to &ldquo;after sales&rdquo; service on motor traders.  Since assemblers must protect the reputation of their brands, it may be taken as certain that traders selling their particular brands will continue to give efficient &ldquo;after sales&rdquo; service. Of course, the &ldquo;after sales&rdquo; service is only a small part of the repair and maintenance work done by garages. Most of such work is undertaken subject to charges made to car owners. Any garage which, in the manner of repair and maintenance, does not give the motorist value for his money, will find that it is losing business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> It has been said, also, that the abolition of the Approved List system will mean that anyone who wishes to enter the motor trade will have to be given motor goods on trade terms and that the abolition of resale price maintenance will give rise to conditions of &ldquo;cut throat&rdquo; competition in the trade. This Order will not involve any basic modification of the present system under which assemblers are free to arrange their own channels of distribution through the appointment of main dealers and sub-dealers of their own choice.  Furthermore, as I have already explained, all car assemblers, as well as suppliers of other motor goods, will, under Article 14 of the Order, be free to apply to the acceptance of orders conditions covering such matters as the size and frequency of orders, the functions of garages, and the services to be rendered to the public.  The only reservations are that these conditions should be reasonable, that they should be applied equitably to all persons seeking supplies and that they should be field with the Fair Trade Commission, which may make fair trading rules in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>On the subject of resale price maintenance it is accepted by the trade that about 90 per cent. of new car sales involve the acceptance by the dealer of a second-hand car in part exchange. There is at present no control by the Irish Motor Traders' Association over trade-in allowances for used cars.  In these circumstances the operation of resale price maintenance in respect of new cars tends to be anomalous and arbitrary.  It is clearly indefensible to discipline a trader for reducing the price of a new car while action having an equivalent effect is permissible in the great bulk of similar transactions. The fact is that price competition in the trade in new cars exists at present and the only effect of the Order will be to allow that competition to come into the open.  I have already drawn attention to the fact that, subject to certain safeguards, the individual assembler will be at liberty to withhold supplies from a trader who has advertised new vehicles for sale at less than the assembler's list prices.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should, perhaps, refer <Col N="1315" /> briefly to the proceedings which have been initiated in the High Court seeking, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, is unconstitutional.  The hearing of the action has not yet commenced and I do not wish to say anything that might be regarded as prejudicing the hearing, but I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be proper that the Oireachtas should proceed with its consideration of Bills for the confirmation of Orders relating to restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>In the case of confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order, which it is proposed to confirm, would not be capable of being amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters dealt with in the Order have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order are set out fully in the commission's report.  I have no hesitation in commending to the House this Confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the trade in motor goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order which this Bill seeks to confirm is in my opinion almost meaningless and certainly useless. I have read with considerable care the report of the Fair Trade Commission and I have listened now to the Minister.  I have got no indication of why the commission on the one hand recommended the Order and why the Minister on the other decided to accept it.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I have had representations made to me that the making of this Order would have adverse effects upon the level of employment, upon wage rates in the trade or upon the standard of service given to the public.  The Minister has been at pains to point out that these fears are groundless because, as he rightly said, the Order will make no practical difference in the methods by which the trade is carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I introduced the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill in the Dáil in 1953 it was my intention&mdash;I expressed that <Col N="1316" /> intention at the time&mdash;that the powers given under that Act to the Fair Trade Commission and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be used only where it was clearly demonstarted, following an inquiry, that practices were in operation which were demonstrably contrary to the public welfare.</P>
    <P>The aim was to eliminate any tendency towards building up monopoly conditions in a trade, preventing the operation of rings and discouraging collective agreements to fix prices or margins in a way which would mean that the public were not being given the benefits of fair competition.</P>
    <P>I certainly had not intended, and I think I should now protest against, the powers given in that Act being used for the purpose of producing a perfectly harmless and ineffective Order made merely, I think, to show some sign of activity in this field.  I should say that, in my view, the powers given by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act should not be used unless there is a clear case made for using them, that the bias should be against interference by the State in the conduct of private business rather than that interference should be resorted to if any justification for it could be advanced.  The Minister and I may have a different outlook in that regard but I am sure the majority of Deputies would argue that the State should not interfere in the practices of privately owned business unless it can be shown beyond doubt that the public interest is being prejudiced.  It is not merely enough to have some show of justification for interference; the burden of proof is on those who propose that interference should be resorted to.</P>
    <P>It is true that on previous occasions in this House we have had discussions about the motor trade.  Some years ago many Deputies availed of their rights here to draw attention to the difficulties which garage proprietors were then experiencing in obtaining supplies of motor vehicles or parts or other requirements.  Most of the complaints related to petrol, and I think it is true to say that much of the discussion <Col N="1317" /> that was then conducted concerning difficulties experienced by retailers in securing supplies of petrol helped to create the atmosphere which secured general acceptance for the Restrictive Trade Practices Act when it came to the Dáil as a Bill.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission is recommending this Order relating to motor vehicles, spare parts and accessories; it has also made fair trading rules relating to petrol and it is rather interesting to contrast the views of the commission regarding vehicles and parts and other supplies on the one hand and on the other, petrol, the one commodity in respect of which there was a considerable volume of complaint with regard to the effect of restrictive practices in operation.  This Order deals in most of its provisions with the abolition of fixed price maintenance. I have expressed the view here already that there is no public interest affected by arrangements made by manufacturers or suppliers to fix the prices of their commodities when there is a substantial number of manufacturers in active competition with one another for trade and, indeed, in such circumstances the fixing of retail prices by manufacturers or suppliers is often desirable in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In the motor trade all the evidence revealed in the report shows there is active competition between all suppliers. There is no suggestion of collaboration between the assemblers of motor cars in respect of prices or margins or anything else.  The commission clearly shows in its report that there is no uniformity of practice either in regard to price arrangements, or the calculation of discounts or the conditions imposed upon agents by assemblers.  Indeed, it is pointed out by the commission, and the Minister has admitted in his speech, that the efforts of the suppliers to fix and publicise the prices at which their products are available to the public has more or less broken down, that these arrangements are anomalous and ineffective, in the circumstances where, as the report indicates, more than 90 per cent. of the cars are sold in this <Col N="1318" /> country following individual bargains between the purchaser and the trader as to the allowance that is to be made for the traded-in, second-hand car.</P>
    <P>The only interest which assemblers or manufacturers of cars have at the present time in the margins secured by traders is to ensure that these margins remain big enough to permit the traders to give to the public the after-sales service which the manufacturer has contracted will be given.  In many cases it is appreciated that the trader seeking business allows on a second-hand car a price which is more than he can hope to secure when he sells it, cutting down on his margin, and trying to make good that loss by scrimping on service given to the purchaser, by defaulting on the manufacturer's contract of free after-sales service.</P>
    <P>There is no substantial difference being made in the practice in that regard by this Order.  At the present time, with conditions now prevailing in the motor trade, it is rather ridiculous to be talking about legislation to prevent the fixation of minimum prices by manufacturers as every Deputy in the House knows that sales of motor cars, burdened as they are by high import levies and high petrol taxes, have substantially contracted and that there is intense competition between all suppliers to retain their share of the contracting market.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about bringing competition in this trade into the open.  Any Deputy who reads the newspapers will realise how much in the open it is.  As I have said, as a general principle, there is no objection to retail price-fixing where there are a number of suppliers in active competition with one another.  It is an entirely different situation if a number of suppliers get together and agree to charge uniform prices or to allow uniform discounts to the trade, or agree to some arrangement between themselves in respect of their prices. Is not that situation to-day operating in regard to petrol?  But in this publication of the Fair Trade Commission and the fair trading rules relating to petrol there is not a word about price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Everybody knows that the practice has now developed in the petrol trade of exclusive dealing contracts between suppliers and retailers.  The retailers contract to sell only the brand of petrol marketed by one supplier.  In many countries that is regarded as the most objectionable type of restrictive practice; in some countries they have specifically legislated against it. Whatever the merits of the case for that legislation may be, we know that that practice exists here and that the Fair Trade Commission having examined the matter, presumably with all care, has not decided it should be abolished.  On the contrary, they have made fair trade rules which permit its continuation.</P>
    <P>The motor assemblers and importers are not being prevented by this Order from making exclusive dealing arrangements with agents, with individual retailers, and imposing in these arrangements conditions as to the size of their establishments, the maintenance of stocks of spare parts, the employment of skilled, especially trained mechanics or the services to be given to the public.</P>
    <P>The one condition that has been imposed is that supplies must not be refused on the ground that the trader is not a member of the association or on an approved list, and indeed all the evidence given to the Fair Trade Commission indicated, and the commission's report said, that it has not been the practice in the trade to refuse supplies on those grounds in regard to certain accessories or parts manufactured, on a comparatively small scale, in this country.  The fair trading rules made by the Fair Trade Commission contemplated that the practice of confining supplies of petrol to persons operating motor garages should be continued, and we know that the practice is likely to continue in so far as supplies of motor vehicles and spare parts are concerned, and is permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will agree it is desirable that trading in motor cars or parts or supplies for motor cars should be confined to those engaged in the motor business.  It would, on the whole, be detrimental to the public <Col N="1320" /> interest if permission were given to publicans and hoteliers and so forth to install such things as petrol pumps for the supply of petrol, or for the giving of any other service.  It is clear that if the sale of parts and accessories by persons not in the motor trade were encouraged not merely would there be a debasement of the conditions of employment and a threat to the wage rates of mechanics engaged in the trade, but there would, in some cases, be a danger that defective fitting of parts and equipment might result.  We all know, there is a safety factor operating in this business as well.</P>
    <P>If it has been accepted, as it appears the Fair Trade Commission and the Minister have accepted, that the trade in petrol is to be confined to garages, that the trade in motor cars and spare parts and accessories is to be confined to those who are in the business, why is there not a definition in any of these orders as to what constitutes a motor trader?  The main motor suppliers, the firms which hold the dominant position in the trade, will have no difficulty. There is competition among the retailers to get their business.  None of the assemblers has any difficulty in getting the principal garage owners in any area to take agencies for them. On the contrary, they have the opportunity of picking and choosing between the various applicants to get those who are best equipped and best located to serve the interests of their business.  The smaller businesses and many of the manufacturers of parts and accessories have not got the same facilities for finding out the status of the individual retailers seeking their business.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the Fair Trade Commission and the Minister have allowed this theoretical objection to the maintenance of an approved list to lead them into an impracticable position.  I am completely against the operation in any trade of a system which confines the right to enter the trade to persons who are members of an association or confines the right of entry to persons approved by an association; but it is clearly not undesirable there should be some institution or arrangement by which the status and the qualifications of <Col N="1321" /> persons seeking supplies in this trade can be checked.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the big petrol companies have no difficulty; the main motor manufacturers have no difficulty; the small manufacturers may have some difficulty; the traders in various classes of accessories and parts may have considerable difficulty.  It is for them a convenience that there is in existence an organisation which checks the competence and the status of traders seeking supplies and that there is a list of persons who are qualified to engage in the business.  It seems that the evidence adduced to the Fair Trade Commission establishes the fact that the Irish Motor Traders' Association limited their activities in this respect to checking up on the qualifications, status and competence of those who sought entry into the trade.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the qualifications were too onerous.  Perhaps the association tended to increase the qualifications. That is a matter that could be rectified, but there is no evidence that the association sought to confine their approved list to their own members or refused entry to the list on the ground that there were a number of other traders in a locality.  If there is a complete elimination of that arrangement in the trade by which a supplier of any goods can check on the status or competence of the person seeking to enter the trade through the association, what is to replace it?</P>
    <P>There is no definition attempted by the Fair Trade Commission in their rules relating to the motor trade. There is strong objection, and always will be, to any private organisation of motor traders setting up the right for themselves of arbitrating and deciding upon matters of this kind without, at any rate, important checks upon their powers and continuous supervision over their operations.  I understand that the Motor Traders' Association went to the Minister and put this opinion to him.  Did the Minister suggest to them that they should seek to have set up by the Fair Trade Commission fair trading rules which would define the future functions and the <Col N="1322" /> future sphere of operations of the association?  When the association went to the Fair Trade Commission, the commission said they could not draw these rules if this Order became law.  There was a request for time to enable the position to be reviewed and why is that time refused?</P>
    <P>What purpose has the Minister in bringing this measure before the House at this stage of the Dáil's programme? In operation it will make no difference whatsoever in the motor trade, and I speak there with some experience.  In so far as the suppliers of vehicles and parts are concerned, the existing practices will not be changed one iota.  The measure will provide a certain amount of confusion. Normally the manufacturer of parts such as sparking plugs, glass, etc., when asked to supply a new retailer would ring up the association, or take a look at its list.  There is nothing in substitution for that practice now. That is a situation which can be rectified by the drawing up of fair trading rules which would arrange to keep the exercise of the powers and functions of the association under supervision and which would provide an effective channel by which the information required by the trade could be made available without the danger of leading to the development of restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should postpone this Bill.  It could be contended that in present circumstances it is rather foolish to bring this Bill forward at all.  The whole thing can be left over until November and, in the meantime, the association and the Fair Trade Commission can get down together and draw up, in agreement, fair trading rules which will eliminate all risk to the public interest and, at the same time, continue in operation an organisation which has given use-all risk to the public interest and, at the same time, continue in operation an organisation which has given useful service to a very important trade in this country.  I would strongly urge upon the Minister that he should do what I am suggesting now, postpone the completion of the enactment of this measure to give time to the examination of that position.</P>

      <P>I wish to intervene to speak on behalf of Henry Ford &amp; Son of Cork.  They have a certain grievance in respect of this report. They feel that the report did not stress sufficiently that the firm of Henry Ford &amp; Son have never combined with any other group or association of manufacturers or employers.  They have always acted very independently and they feel that the important submissions to the commission were not embodied in the commission's report as were the submissions of group organisations.  Therefore, I must make use of this debate to publicise that fact in the interests of Fords who have been, after all, the premier and pioneer assemblers of cars in this country.  They came to this country in 1919 without any incentive of tariff and have been noted industrialists here ever since.</P>
      <P>The case they have made&mdash;and I think it is a very important case in the matter of price maintenance&mdash;is that their list for spare parts has proved to be a major protection for the consumer, and I believe that to be true.  I have already stated on three or four occasions my general attitude about this kind of legislation.  I do believe that price maintenance of any kind by a combination of manufacturers is bad in the public interest, but this is a free economy and we should let a free-for-all take place.  I agree with the last speaker that the motor trade competition at the moment is too great.  In regard to Ford's I think it can be said that for the last 40 years they have given the Irish people and indeed the people of the world good value in motor cars.  They have been completely independent.  They have refused to combine with anybody else and their attitude towards price fixation has been more in the public interest than that of many other manufacturers.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Lemass had not introduced this Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, and if I had not supported it and had not a clear recollection of the discussion which took place when this Bill was introduced, I would not have thought by his speech this evening he had the remotest association with the Act as it is in operation. The Deputy made a speech this evening <Col N="1324" /> as if this had nothing to do with him, as if he had no responsibility in the matter and as if this was something which should not have been done. He gave the impression that the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was something, as he said, to be left alone unless, as he alleged in this case, somebody wants to make a show of activity. Let the House and the country be clear that Deputy Lemass, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was responsible for the introduction of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill which was passed into law, and if the Deputy finds it inconvenient now to acknowledge paternity of that Act I just cannot help him in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made my case to the House and I do not intend to cover the same ground again.  The general theory underlying this Bill was that you set up a Fair Trade Commission. That commission was appointed by Deputy Lemass and the members of that commission in the main are the same people as were appointed by Deputy Lemass.  Deputy Lemass's own commission, on its own initiative, decided to undertake this inquiry in accordance with the Act passed in the Dáil on the recommendation of Deputy Lemass, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He asks the House to give him the authority to create this commission.  He gives the commission certain functions.  He appoints the commission and it functions in accordance with the powers given to it by <Col N="1325" /> Deputy Lemass.  When all that is done Deputy Lemass comes into the Dáil and says: &ldquo;That is all right for everything else, but it is not good enough for the motor trade.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I had closed my eyes while the Deputy was speaking instead of keeping my eyes on the Deputy in amazement and my ears wide open, I could have come to the conclusion that it was the Motor Traders' Association that was speaking to me.  I saw the Motor Traders' Association and discussed the whole matter with them at considerable lengths.  I think it is true that they subsequently misunderstood what was said at the meeting in imagining that this Order could be scrapped, that everything could be forgotten and that they could go back to the Fair Trade Commission.  In the minutes of the discussion which were not taken by me, which were taken in the presence of the Secretary of the Department, who was a former member of the Fair Trade Commission, it was pointed out to the motor traders what the precise effect of this Order was.  Deputy Lemass now says: &ldquo;Stop this procedure.  Do not put it into operation.  Let the motor traders go back to the Fair Trade Commission and the Fair Trade Commission will make fair trading rules.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What has the Deputy to say about this situation which I now bring to his notice and to the notice of the House?  Before the Fair Trade Commission held its inquiry at all, the Motor Traders' Association and the motor trade were given the option of having fair trading rules drawn up by a Fair Trade Commission and that offer by the Fair Trade Commission was not accepted by the motor traders. I do not know whether Deputy Lemass knew that or not but now we are asked to give these people an opportunity of going back to the Fair Trade Commission. If they had been reasonable and sensible they could have gone there before this expensive inquiry was undertaken, but they did not go there. <Col N="1326" /> When I asked the deputation: &ldquo;Why did you not go to the Fair Trade Commission and obtain agreement on fair trading rules?&rdquo; they said: &ldquo;We cannot agree among ourselves.&rdquo;  That was the explanation they gave to me and now having failed to accept the offer which was made to them, having explained to me that they could not agree among themselves, the recipe offered is to suspend action and let them have another crack at the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>Public sittings were held in this matter on 15 days extending from the 14th September to the 29th November 1954 and a number of private sittings were also held.  Ninety-one witnesses were examined.  After 15 days public hearing, 91 witnesses examined, nobody can say the matter has not been fully considered.  Nobody can say that this long list of witnesses set out here on pages 113-14 did not get a chance of presenting their case.  All these considerations were dealt with by the Fair Trade Commission.  That commission had the trouble and responsibility of doing all that because the motor traders, on whose behalf Deputy Lemass speaks this evening, were not willing to accept the offer which was made to them by the Fair Trade Commission before all this time was spent and all this trouble was undertaken by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass says this is doing nothing more than giving reality to what in fact is a practice.  I wonder if that is so?  Bear in mind that this commission's report quotes the rules of the Irish Motor Traders' Association at Appendix 13.  I want to quote only from page 139 of the report, Rule 43 of the rules of the association. Under the heading of &ldquo;Stop List&rdquo;, these rules provided: &ldquo;Where a member of the association, being a manufacturer or a wholesaler, supplies any description of goods subject to a condition that such goods are not to be sold at prices higher or lower than the list price, such member shall be bound to take effective steps to have such condition carried out by all customers.&rdquo; Then it goes on: &ldquo;No member of the association, being a retailer, shall sell any description of goods by <Col N="1327" /> retail at a price higher or lower than the list price in breach of the conditions subject to which the goods are supplied to him.&rdquo;  You are told that once you pay your subscription to the association you not only swallow that and accept it but all the other rules as well.</P>
    <P>A body known as the Irish Motor Traders' Association sets itself up to look after the interests of the motor trade.  In the course of doing that, it endeavours to organise all the retailers who come into the organisation.  It says to them: &ldquo;Under no circumstances must you sell a motor car or any part of a motor car or any piece of equipment for a motor car at a price less than that prescribed by the man who made the car even though you have paid the man for it long ago.&rdquo;  Under this rule, a main dealer could buy a motor car or a tyre or any other piece of equipment and pay the assembler or the manufacturer for the car or the tyre or the piece of equipment and then the commercial transaction between them is over.  However, if he dared to sell that tyre to the car part even to his own brother or mother he is guilty of an offence under these rules, and to be guilty of an offence under these rules for selling the car or the article at a price below that fixed by the assembler or manufacturer meant that he earned the title to go on the &ldquo;Stop List&rdquo;.  When he went on that list he found he could get no more parts from the assembler or manufacturer.</P>
    <P>In my opening statement, I quoted the profits allowed in the case of main dealers and sub-dealers.  Main dealers in spare parts and accessories supplied by assemblers were allowed discounts from 25 per cent. to 33? per cent.  If you sold a spare part with a profit of 32 per cent. and did not charge 33? per cent. the Motor Traders' Association could put you on the &ldquo;Stop List&rdquo; and, when you got on that list, you lost all future supplies and your livelihood as well.  Apparently Deputy Lemass says: &ldquo;It does not matter; let that situation go along.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>One of them does not confine himself to the approved list and does not take dictation from the association.  I do not propose to finger through the report to find the relevant reference.  The Motor Traders' Association are annoyed with this report.  What is the explanation of the annoyance?  Is it because a vested interest has been broken up or because this report does nothing at all beyond continuing the present situation, as Deputy Lemass says?</P>
      <P>I do not blame these motor traders. It just depends on where you stand in relation to this matter.  Do you want to take the view that it is the job of the motor traders to get together an organisation which will be invincible to pressure, in which all the members will take a firm vote to gang up together and agree to do the one thing and stand against the public interest and protect the motor trade, in which they will not cut prices, into which they will allow only certain people and in relation to which they will cast rules in such a way that, while certain people can get in who do not fulfil the conditions&mdash;and have got in&mdash;people will be asked to comply with, in most cases, impossibly high conditions to keep the membership down?  If you feel the further object is to prevent anybody from selling at less than the fixed price, because of risk of a boycott movement from the fixed prices arrangements, that is all right for anybody who believes it.  That is the point of view of protecting the motor traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My function is not to protect the motor traders but to protect the community interest.  This Bill was introduced for the purpose of protecting the interests of the community.  I cannot look on this matter from the angle of motor traders who want to keep an invincible grip on the trade and want to be rendered immune from public regulation of the trade.  But the public interest is involved in this matter.  A Fair Trade Commission, <Col N="1330" /> one associated with the motor trade, appointed by my predecessor, Deputy Lemass, investigated this matter for 15 days, heard 91 witnesses and, at the end of that period, presented this report.</P>
    <P>I am putting it to the Dáil that, on the case made in this report, the Dáil ought to give a Second Reading to the Confirmation Bill.  The only case made by Deputy Lemass is: &ldquo;Go slow.  Postpone this.  See if you could not deal with the matter by means of fair trade rules drafted by the Fair Trade Commission.&rdquo; A body whose case is precisely the same as that made by Deputy Lemass this evening got the opportunity of going to the Fair Trade Commission before the commission embarked on this long and detailed inquiry.  They did not avail of the offer made to them.  I do not believe that there is, even to-day, any use in sending them back there again even if that were now possible.  I do not think that, when a report of that kind is presented, when the Government has made an Order on it, when I have complied with the procedure envisaged by Deputy Lemass when he introduced the Bill to this House, we should be expected to wait on the convenience of the motor trade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about some of the matters the Minister has been talking about.  It is deplorable that the Minister refuses to consider objectively observations made here. <Col N="1331" /> That, I think, is a fault of the Minister. He usually sets up a bogey and then proceeds to knock down the bogey. In this particular case he decided that the bogey to be set up is the Irish Motor Traders' Association and that he should deal with it as an enemy. I think that is a wrong approach.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Minister and of the Fair Trade Commission should be to ensure that there is introduced into this trade such conditions as will encourage and permit of the development of the trade while at the same time protecting the public against any abuses occurring within it.  It is a good thing that the Fair Trade Commission held this inquiry and that the result of this inquiry has been published, but I assert that anybody who reads the report of the Fair Trade Commission will come to the conclusion that the result of the inquiry is to establish that restrictive practices in the motor trade are generally non-existent and that such of them as do exist can be easily remedied without all this unnecessary State regulation of the conduct of the trade.</P>
      <P>There was one section of the trade in respect of which that is not true and that is the trade in petrol.  In the case of petrol, there exists everything that we were directing the Restrictive Trade Practices Act against&mdash;agreement between suppliers to maintain a uniform price, to maintain uniform margins for traders, to supply only one brand of petrol to one trader and to refuse to supply any other trader in that locality with that brand of petrol.  But, the commission, having investigated that position, decided to allow it to continue and drafted fair trading rules expressly framed to allow that situation to continue.  In relation to the rest of the trade, in respect of which there were no such practices, where all the evidence is of intense competition between all the suppliers, of no collaboration between them to fix prices or margins or anything else, there is to be legislation to control and continuing State investigation of the conditions in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks he can score a point by representing me as the protector of the motor traders.  I am not <Col N="1332" /> objecting to that description.  I hope I will be the first in the Dáil to urge action against motor traders or any other group of traders who combine to establish restrictive practices or who in any way act contrary to the public interest, but I think there is an obligation upon some Deputy to try to protect motor traders and every other class of traders when they are being subjected unnecessarily to State regulation.</P>
    <P>The Minister had people come to him who said that this Order will so alter conditions in the trade that it will cut down the employment it gives, cut down the wages it pays or cut down the services it gives to the public. The Minister, quite rightly, said that these fears were unfounded.  On what basis did the Minister put forward his contention that these fears were unfounded? Because, he said, the Order will not involve any basic modification of the present system.  Is not that the case?  Did not the Minister use these words in his introductory statement? Is not the case he is making against the argument that the operation of this Order will involve a deterioration in the employment or the wages in the trade or the service to the public, that it will not make any basic alterations in the system at all?</P>
    <P>I agree that it will make no basic alteration in the system.  I agree that the Minister is right in his contention that the making of this Order will not by itself affect employment, wages or anything else in the trade because this Order will not alter by an iota the practices carried on in the trade in as far as manufacturers, the assemblers of motor cars, manufacturers of parts or accessories or any of these firms who are engaged in trade in motor cars or motor parts are concerned.  But, the argument I put forward is that the Order is defective in so far as it does not define what a motor trader is.  The Fair Trade Commission agreed, and I agree and I think the whole House will agree, that it is desirable to confine trade in motor cars and in motor-car parts and in petrol to legitimate motor traders, to people who can give the service to the public that the public are entitled to expect from a motor <Col N="1333" /> trader.  It is undesirable that unqualified people should be allowed to put spare parts on a car or undertake repairs of motor cars or in any way come into this business under conditions which might create risks of bad service to the public and consequently increase the danger on the highways.</P>
    <P>From every point of view it is desirable that the trade in motor cars and motor-car parts and supplies for motor cars should be confined to <i>bona fide</i> motor traders.  We are all agreed about that.  The commission agrees, I agree, the Minister agrees and I think the whole House agrees.  But, how can that be done?  It can be done in various ways.  It can be done by setting out in law a definition of a motor trader, a trader who is entitled to his supplies, entitled to engage in this business.  I would be against that.  It would be a further form of State regulation and unnecessary in the circumstances.  It can be done by the Minister setting up an approved list of his own and saying that persons on his approved list are qualified to receive supplies on trade terms and to engage in the sale of these goods.</P>
    <P>The existing practice has been that an organisation called the Irish Motor Traders' Association set up an approved list.  To get entry into that list, I understand, a trader had to have a garage of a certain size, certain minimum equipment; he had to employ a skilled mechanic and, provided he conformed to these conditions, the name of the trader went on the approved list.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission said that the conditions were too onerous, that the garage floor area specified was too large, that the machinery which the association said had to be installed was too elaborate to enable a motor trader to carry on.  That may be so.  I do not know whether it is so or not.  The commission also said that the association tended to intensify these conditions, to make them more onerous so as to restrict entry into the trade.  If that is so, it is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I do see a function to be served by having in existence an association which will carry out the inquiries <Col N="1334" /> around the country which traders in motor cars and motor supplies wish to have made as to whether in fact an individual is a motor trader or not, whether he is qualified to sell these goods at all or not.  I think the association could serve that purpose, provided it operated in accordance with rules drawn up by the Fair Trade Commission and provided it acted under its supervision.</P>
    <P>I am not against the making of this Order.  The making of the Order will make no difference whatever in the actual conduct of the trade but the Motor Traders' Association who went to the Fair Trade Commission asked the commission to draw up rules to define what they were to do and what would be the limits of their powers and their functions in the new circumstances. They were told that the Fair Trade Commission could not draw up fair trading rules, that the bringing in of this Order would preclude that possibility.  I do not know whether the Fair Trade Commission was right in their view.  In that connection, while it is true that I was responsible for the legislation and that I appointed most of the members of the Fair Trade Commission, I did not give them a certificate of infallibility when I was Minister, any more than I would accept them as infallible if I were Minister now.  I would read their reports carefully, but I would certainly make my own decision as to whether the report should be given effect to in legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact the commission recommend that an Order should be made is not sufficient reason for making the Order. The Order is not supported by the actual terms of the commission's report and it is not supported by the evidence the Fair Trade Commission was able to extract from the inquiry into the conditions of the trade.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that in so far as this Order will not make any difference to the actual conduct of the trade &mdash;in fact, the Minister said so in his speech&mdash;and in so far as the circumstances which last year, when the commission were holding an inquiry, might have justified the making of an Order, have completely changed; in the present circumstances of the motor <Col N="1335" /> trade the Order should be postponed until the commission can see whether it is possible within the law to draw up fair trading rules which will permit the Motor Traders' Association to carry on doing the work for the persons engaged in the trade and making inquiries, etc., affecting those in the trade who are seeking supplies of goods.</P>
    <P>Most of these trade associations have different functions to serve for different people associated with them. So far as the motor-car assemblers are concerned, I do not think the Motor Traders' Association serve any purpose whatever other than to carry out collective wage negotiations.  It is a trade union and is used by the motor-car assemblers for the purpose of drawing up collective wage agreements.  So far as I am aware, it serves no other important function whatever, except perhaps as a channel of information and a centre of discussion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned that two of the principal motor assemblers in the country were not in the association. They are not mainly because they did not want to be associated with the collective wage agreements.  In so far as the manufacture of a great number of small items for motor cars, including fittings of various kinds, are concerned, all that information is got through the Motor Traders' Association.  It is trade information which would cost them a great deal to obtain if they had to set up their own organisation for these purposes.  For providing a means of discussing the conditions of trade and a channel by which the views of the trade can be conveyed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the association has useful functions to serve.  It believes that it cannot fulfil all those functions if this Order becomes law.</P>
    <P>The association think they cannot and the Fair Trade Commission told them they could not.  I suggest that this Order should be postponed until November in order to give these parties an opportunity of getting together to see if there is any way by which that situation can be solved.</P>

He made a lot of play of the point as to who was a motor trader.  It is a matter for the individual motor assembler to define that for the purpose of Section 14 of the Order.  In that connection the motor assemblers and manufacturer were pretty alert up to the moment and they will obviously make sure themselves that they will not supply goods to non-<i>bona fide</i> traders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question as to how you would find out who was a motor trader.  The obvious person is the person who is going to sell the parts.  If the manufacturer finds out that the fellow was a sweep or a chemist instead of a motor trader he probably will not give him his goods on credit to be parked in a place to which people do not go to when they order motor cars or parts.</P>
      <P>This Order does much more than deal with price maintenance.  It deals with other restrictive practices as well. One of the restrictive practices with which it deals was the practice of keeping <i>bona fide</i> applicants out of the motor trade.  The <i>bona fide</i> applicants were kept out of the trade, are being kept out of the trade and will be kept out of the trade unless we have an Order of this kind.  I have got the minutes of my discussion with the motor traders now and I will give the Deputy the benefit of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the motor traders on the 4th June.  In the course of the discussion with them&mdash;I am reading from the minutes&mdash;the minister inquired whether the trade had considered the alternative of accepting fair trade rules rather than have a formal inquiry. That is what Deputy Lemass suggested might be done now after the inquiry was heard.  Let me quote again from the discussion.  Mr. Blank for the motor traders said they would like to make it clear in fairness to the commission that they had been offered fair trade rules at the outset.  Mark that.  They were offered fair trading <Col N="1337" /> rules at the outset.  The view of the Irish Motor Traders' Association was, however, that the fair trading rules would be likely to contain provisions similar to those which they now find in the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Car) Order, and, consequently, the rules would not be accepted by the association.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the position appeared to have been reached in which the action just taken by statutory Order would be the same as that which would have been achieved by fair trading rules and that possibly the Motor Traders' Association would have saved itself a good deal of time and trouble if it had agreed to have the rules in the beginning.</P>
    <P>They got an offer from the commission and they did not want it.  They said that the Fair Trade Commission would probably make the same rules as the Order and they could not agree on that.  The trouble about this whole matter is&mdash;and I say this more in sorrow than in anger&mdash;that the Motor Traders' Association seem to think that this is not a Restrictive Trade Practices Act at all but an Act to regulate profit margins.</P>
    <P>The position is that when the Motor Traders' Association went to the Fair Trade Commission to see what function the association would have in relation to the motor trade in the light of the fact that this Order was being made when they got into the presence of the members of the commission it was not rules they wanted at all; they wanted the Fair Trade Commission to fix economic price levels in the industry. The purpose of going back was to discuss what function they could discharge or what fair trade rules might still be necessary outside the scope of the Order.  As if they never heard of this commission, as if there were not 91 witnesses, and if they had not read the report, they wanted to discuss the question of economic price levels in the industry.  The commission could not discuss that.  The commission has to wait until the Order is made.  Then the commission is perfectly free to discuss with the Motor Traders' Association what its functions are to be in future, what fair trade rules have to <Col N="1338" /> be made and what subsequent rules may have to be made arising out of compliance or non-compliance with the provisions of the Order.</P>
    <P>I think, as I said, that Deputy Lemass is unwise in suggesting that they might have gone to the Fair Trade Commission in the first instance.  They could not do that, and their spokesman said he wanted to be fair to the commission by setting out the reasons why they would not go there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said&mdash;and I hope I have got it correctly&mdash;that this Order does not prohibit all price maintenance by individual suppliers.  If the Deputy looks at Article 4 of the Order he will see there is a prohibition on collective resale price maintenance.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported, I was drawing the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 19th June, 1956.  It referred to the Gaeltacht in Meath, and to Gibbstown in particular and I shall quote one section of the statement which I think is very interesting and also very appropriate to the present debate:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;MODERN SCHOOL.</P>
      <P>Away further on the left is a modern school, and behind it the hostel, where boys and girls go to get a speaking knowledge of Irish.  The school is commodious and modern in every sense, with three big airy classrooms, well furnished and provided with the most up-to-date equipment for teaching, and&mdash;what one rarely finds in rural schools&mdash;it boasts a water supply and sanitary amenities that would compare favourably with the best of our city schools.  The structure must have cost many thousands to build&mdash;probably £20,000 or more at present costs&mdash;and it was evidently planned to accommodate some 100 to 150 pupils.  Looking through the school, I saw that only one of the three big classrooms showed signs of occupation.  On inquiry I was told that there were only about 16 pupils attending the school.</P>
      <P>This sounded extraordinary, in view of the fact that there were a good many children around.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is quite true.  What the statement does not give is that about one mile further down the road, there is an old tumbledown school and the children who live around this new school do not go to it but go to the old one.</P>

I know that some years ago there were 60 or 70 pupils attending that school and I suggest there must be a very good reason why the children do not go to the good <Col N="1340" /> school but travel over a mile to the bad one.  That happens not only in Gibbstown but in various other parts of the country.</P>

      <P>I stated earlier in this debate that, because of the fact that children coming out of English-speaking homes are being taught through the medium of Irish from the first day they go to school until they leave at the age of 14, we are turning out children, of whom, according to statistics&mdash;of course they can prove anything&mdash; approximately one-third are not receiving anything like adequate primary education.  Particularly in view of the fact that so many of the people of this country must emigrate to England, is it not a shocking thing to find that if you go where the Irish are working in England most of them are working as hewers of wood and drawers of water for the very reason that they have not a really adequate education and they cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reason for it is the teachers feel that by teaching through Irish they will be able to put up a better show for the inspector when he arrives than if they taught through the language the children know.  It is no use trying to cod this House.  It is all right for Deputies to come in and laud to the skies the efforts being made to reestablish the Irish language.  I would love to hear everybody in this country speaking Irish, but I know we will not succeed under the present system which has been proved a failure.  If it were not so, the majority of our teenagers would be Irish speakers.</P>

      <P>Another point I should like to raise is that relating to the old schools which for years have been falling into disrepair.  If we go into many of them we will find that not alone are the walls and windows broken but that the furniture is also broken.  Personally, I do not blame the parents in the rural districts for not wanting to send their small children to school in bad weather, to old draughty broken-down places that are not even clean.  I have the greatest respect for the teachers, but I think they are not getting a chance to teach the children properly because of the condition of some of the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which I think is worthy of note.  That is that the schools erected in the last 30 years, perfectly modern buildings, are now falling into disrepair.  I do not know <Col N="1343" /> who is responsible.  I raised the question last year.  These schools have not been repainted, broken windows have not been replaced.  I suggest that the Minister should do something about them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the children being taught nature study, rural science.  I do not suggest they should be sent out to work in gardens and clearing up around the schools as happens occasionally, but I suggest there should be some system by which teachers in country schools should be asked to grow flowers around the schools in an effort to beautify them and make them pleasant places for the children.  Many of the up-to-date schools are anything but pleasant on the outside.  I should also like to refer to the question of cleaning schools.  I do not think it is right that when children finish lessons they should be kept behind to clean the schools.  When I raised this matter previously, the Minister said that arrangements were made to employ somebody to clean the schools. Apparently somebody is saving on the job and getting the children to do it instead.  It should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>I think there is a habit also in national schools which has grown considerably during the past few years.  I do not know what is the cause; perhaps some of the teacher Deputies would enlighten me why children in primary schools in the country do not get their holidays until very late in July.  Many of them have not got their holidays yet.  Children from the secondary schools have been out playing in the fresh air and sun for the past month and I do not think it is right that the smaller children in primary schools should be kept inside until the really warm weather has passed.  With the exception of last year, when the weather was particularly good, the best of the summer is over when the children get an opportunity of enjoying the fresh air which they need so much.</P>
    <P>The question of raising the school leaving age has been mentioned on many occasions during debates on this Estimate.  I am all in favour of it.  I <Col N="1344" /> believe there is far too great a tendency to take children out of school as soon as they reach the age of 14. That may be necessary in some cases where children have to supplement the family income, but I do not think it is right.  Such children are not getting the proper start in life. They are put into some hole or corner for a few shillings a week so that by 16, when they might be required to earn a decent wage, they find there is not a decent job available for them. They are only half educated and are of no use except as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  I think the effort to raise the school-leaving age to 16 is a very good idea.</P>
    <P>Where children have an aptitude for a trade they should be transferred to vocational schools so that they can get a certain amount of training before serving their apprenticeships.  I am perturbed about the absence in some towns of alternative schools to which to send children when they reach 14 years of age.  In many of these towns there is no school except a secondary school, to enter which they must pay a fee.  The fee is fairly small, in many cases it is under £20, but it is quite a lot for a working man.  The result is that many children who would make brilliant pupils cannot get any further than the primary school.  I would ask the Minister to do something to see that schools are made available in country towns for post-primary children.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the question of building new schools.  When schools are being built I suggest a census of the population in the area should be taken in order to estimate the potential number of children who will attend.  I have particularly in mind a school built some years ago to house 80 children. At the present time there are 115 attending, and since there is a new building scheme of 54 houses there will probably be 50 or 60 more children attending after the summer recess. Something must be done to extend those schools, but the necessity to do that could be avoided if the proper type of school were built in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises in <Col N="1345" /> country districts is that, in many schools, when children reach the age of ten years they are required to attend another school, necessitating a considerable journey by bus and train.  The Minister should make some arrangement with the railway company whereby at least part of the fare for these children would be paid.  I know a farm worker who has four children and has to pay 28/5 per quarter.  The family is suffering as a result.  Some attempt should be made to remedy a position like that.  I know the Minister cannot do everything but cases like that should be remedied.  I should like to say a final word about the case of the pre-1950 pensioned teachers.  I understand that the Minister promised he would look into their case.</P>

      <P>Bhí súil agam labhairt i nGaelige ar an Meastachán seo, ach i dtosach ba mhaith liom freagra a thabhairt i mBéarla ar phointí a rinne an Teachta deiridh agus an Teachta D. Mac Coisdealbha.  I intended speaking in Irish on this Estimate.  I shall do that but I should like first to deal in English with some of the points made by the last speaker, who is now going out.  His contribution showed a complete misunderstanding of the regulations on the whole question of teaching through Irish.  He referred to the question of compulsory Irish.  I can excuse Deputy James Tully for that but I certainly cannot excuse Deputy Costello, who came in here and gave us a similar contribution. He came in well armed with what he considered to be authoritative documents, and treated us to a condemnation of what he referred to as compulsory Irish.  I want to say categorically that there is no compulsory Irish except in the case of the teaching of Irish as a subject.  There is no such thing as compulsion in the teaching through Irish of subjects like arithmetic, history and geography. I will quote the Department's regulation on that point.  Regulation 229 says: &ldquo;Where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish, and where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible. <Col N="1346" /> Where, in the regulation, is there a question of compulsory Irish?  There is no compulsion.  No teacher is compelled to teach those subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the children cannot get the full benefit of instruction through the medium of Irish the teacher is advised by the Department to give instruction through the medium of English.  Even where the optimum conditions exist, even where the teacher is capable and the pupils are capable of assimilating the knowledge he teaches, the Department regulation says he should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.  Even where we have the optimum conditions pertaining, still the Department does not categorically say we should have 100 per cent. instruction in those subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>
      <P>There is at the moment a lot of woolly talk by persons who do not want Irish taught in our schools, who want to kill the teaching of Irish and the teaching of subjects through Irish in our schools.  There is a move on to do as much harm as possible.  To further back up what I have said, I will quote a more authoritative body than any of those mentioned by Deputy Declan Costello, and that is the Council of Education set up by the Minister.  They have gone into it thoroughly, and this is what they say in paragraph 235:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority of the council, who favour the use of Irish as a medium of instruction wherever the requisite conditions are present, are aware that reasonable objections exist to such instruction in the case of mentally retarded children, and grant that the position in regard to them may require special consideration. They are, however, satisfied that where children of ordinary ability are concerned, to teach other subjects through Irish provided always that the teacher is himself competent and efficient and provided also that the pupil has sufficient <Col N="1347" /> ability in the language to benefit from the instruction in the subject being taught, is not only possible without educational loss ensuing but, in our circumstances, is advantageous. They do not, accordingly, suggest that any change be made in the present regulations regarding teaching through Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those regulations I have quoted for the House.  They are very reasonable and give a very wide scope to the teacher, and there is no compulsion.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I will relate my own experience in this regard.  I went to a non-Gaeltacht school some years ago&mdash;my first school.  I found that the subjects history, geography and arithmetic were being taught through the medium of Irish.  I continued that for a year.  I found that the results in those three subjects were not satisfactory, and in fact two of them were marked &ldquo;Fair&rdquo;.  I decided that I would change over to the teaching of those subjects through the medium of English.  Before doing so I wrote to the inspector, and he said in reply to me: &ldquo;Well, these things have been taught for some years now through the medium of Irish, and it might be a retrograde step if you changed now.&rdquo; When the beginning of the school year came I did not take his suggestion to continue on and not change.  The result was that after a year things had improved, and since then I have taught those subjects through the medium of English, with a use of Irish when I felt like it and when the children were able to appreciate the knowledge imparted through the medium of Irish. It was rather a loose arrangement&mdash; 50-50, or, perhaps, the emphasis more on English than on Irish.</P>
    <P>I quote that example to show that a teacher is safeguarded by the Department regulations.  Despite anything that any inspector says, despite anything that any teacher did who went before him, or despite anything that any manager says, he can switch over and change, and he will be protected by that regulation.  The reason I am going into this so thoroughly is that when a young Deputy like Deputy Declan Costello comes in it is more <Col N="1348" /> important that this thing should be scotched once and for all.  It did crop up last year but there was some excuse for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully came in with something the same this year as last year but there is possibly an excuse for him. He may not have gone into the thing too thoroughly.  That is evident from the fact that one of the items he mentioned to-night was that it is a pity that pupils in national schools could not have their holidays early in July. He said that even to-day some school have not yet got their holidays.  Again, the Department regulation in that matter, if it is carried out, is this, that all schools must close in the last fortnight of July.  This is now the last fortnight in July.  Therefore, according to the Department's regulations every school in the Twenty-Six Counties should be shut to-day while we have Deputy Tully saying that he knows schools in Meath that are not shut for holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Tully was chancing his arm or not.  I do not want to say anything to him.  But he was certainly chancing his arm and doing a good deal of damage to the cause of Irish, and not alone to the cause of Irish but to the cause of education generally and to our good name as a nation.  He specifically stated that the compulsory teaching of Irish had caused a deterioration in the standard of our education in the primary schools.  Again, he said that he knows that pupils from Irish primary schools are working in England under the worst conditions, doing the most menial jobs, being hewers of wood and drawers of water, and he attributes that to the poor education they were equipped with when they left our national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the reports of the school inspectors and we know that that is not so.  We know that a high percentage of our pupils leaving the national schools are equipped with the leaving certificate issued by the Department of Education.  That leaving certificate is based on the standard of education in <Col N="1349" /> sixth class in the national schools and that is a standard in the national schools which if a pupil is able to pass gives him a good, sound ground work for his future life.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with him that our Irish emigrants in England or elsewhere find employment in the slums and in the worst jobs available there. That is not so and I know from experience that it is not so.  I have found, and I am sure most Deputies will agree, with me, that we have in England skilled carpenters, masons and tradesmen in the very best positions over there.  They are there first of all because they are capable of doing their work and they are not afraid of hard work.  They are an example to the workers in England, and if England had skilled people of the same type as the Irish that are over there&mdash;young people prepared to give an honest day's work for a fair day's pay&mdash;England would be in a better position than she is to-day.  It is not true that the Irish people are in the worst positions in England.  As a matter of fact, many of our people are in the very best positions there.</P>
    <P>Again I would refer Deputy Costello, who seems to have gone very deeply into this question of compulsory Irish and who has gone out of his way to quote authoritative sources, which favour his line of argument, to two facts.  In the first place the Department recommended that Irish should be taught as a compulsory subject. Nobody could object to that I hope any more than they would object to the teaching of Irish history as a compulsory subject or some of the other subjects that are compulsory. On page 164 of this Report of the Council of Education, paragraph 236, it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is natural to expect, however, that Irish as a medium of instruction in standards above infants, assuming that the language has been efficiently taught at that stage, would continue to be used in an increasing proportion as teachers more proficient in Irish are appointed to the schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are trying to arrive at the situation <Col N="1350" /> where as Irish progresses and the pupil becomes more fluent in Irish that some of the work in these subjects can be done through the medium of Irish and the learning of subjects through the medium of Irish is not a drawback. It is a good thing where the optimum conditions are there.  It is a good thing to teach the subjects through the medium of Irish.  Even in very many of our colleges subjects, even technical and scientific subjects, are taught through the medium of Irish.  In all the preparatory colleges all subjects except English are taught through the medium of Irish and it is remarkable that in the last two years a number of young pupils from the preparatory colleges who had their instructions completely through the medium of Irish obtained first places in some of these subjects in competition with pupils who had been instructed through the medium of English.</P>
    <P>The Press or some section of the Press is not doing anything to improve the understanding of the position in our national schools.  They foster or help the idea that Irish is compulsory. The fact is that Irish is compulsory as a subject and as a subject only.  The teaching of other subjects through the medium of Irish is not compulsory not even where there is no doubt about the capabilities of the teachers and the pupils.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire go raibh tuarascáil faighte aige ón gComhairle Oideachais ach nach raibh iniúchadh cheart déanta go fóill ar an tuarascáil sin.  Tá sé níos mó ná dhá bhliain ó fuair an tAire an tuarascáil sin.  Fuair sé é i samhradh na bliana 1954 agus ba cheart go mbeadh sé ábalta anois a thuairimí agus tuairímí na Roinne a thabhairt ar na gnéithe éagsúla den Chomhairle Bun-Oideachais atá leagtha amach sa tuarascáil sin.  Chomh maith leis sin, taobh istigh den dá bhliain sin tá faighte aige tuairimí daoine agus dreamanna éagsúla ón taobh amuigh agus is cinnte go raibh tuairimí ag muintir na Roinne ar a lán de na gnéithe a bhaineann le Bun-Oideachais a bhí á scrúdú ag an gComhairle.  Tá rudaí áirithe a mhol <Col N="1351" /> an Chomhairle gur ceart scrúdú láithreach a dhéanamh orthu.  Sílim gur olc an rud a rinne an tAire nuair dúirt sé leis an gComhaírle scrúdú a dhéanamh ar cheist an mheánoideachais le linn scrúdú na moltaí i dtaobh na mbun-scol.  Tá tábhacht ag baint le cúrsaí do pháistí roimh aois 12 bliana ach níos tábhachtaí fós an cúrsa léinn don leanbh ó aois 12 go 15 bliana, agus ba cheart don Aire dul isteach i gceist an chúrsa oideachais a bhaineann le leanaí na mbun-scol ó aois 12 go 15 bliana.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a mhol an Chomhairle seo ná breis ábhar a chur á dteagasc sna bun-scoileanna.  I druairim an Teachta Ó Tullaí tá páistí ag fágáil na mbun-scol agus gan oideachas ceart faighte acu.  Sa chéad ghuth eile dúirt sé gur cheart talmhaíocht agus garradóireacht a theagasc sna scoileanna céanna.  Más fíor é go bhfuil an cúrsa chomh lán agus chomh trom sin go bhfuil páistí ag fágáil na mbun-scol gan a ndóthain oideachais orthu conas is féidir, mar a mholann an Teachta seo, dhá ábhar eile mar gharradóireacht agus talmhaíocht a chur ar siúl?</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom gur féidir ábhair mar sin a chur ar chlár na mbun-scol san am i láthair.  Tá go leor cainte faoin rud seo ag na feirmeoirí óga, i gcumainn agus i gcoistí na bhfeirmeorí. Molann siad talmhaíocht a theagasc sna bun-scoileanna.  Ní aontaím leis sin ar chor ar bith.  Sé mó thuairim gur ceart bunús maith oideachais a thabhairt do scoláirí na mbun-scol, isé sin gur ceart dóibh léitheoireacht, scríbhneoireacht, tíreolas, áireamh agus stair d'fhoghlaim ar dtúis agus ansan go mbeidh siad ábalta staidéar a dhéanamh níos déanaí, nuair a fhágann siad an scoil, ar thalmhaíocht má tá siad chun bheith ina bhfeirmeoirí nó ar adhmadóireacht má tá siad le bheith 'na siúinéiri.  Sílim gur olc an rud gearradh síos ar eolas na bpáistí i léamh, scríobh agus uimhríocht agus breac-eolas ar thalmhaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.  Bheadh an t-am a chaithfeadh siad ar thalmhaíocht níos fearr caite in eolas d'fháil mar gheall ar léitheoireacht, scríbhneoireacht agus tíreolas, agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> Aontaím ceart go leor gur cóir na téacs-leabhra i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla a bheith leagaithe amach sa dóigh go mbeadh trácht suimiúil ar déiríocht agus rudí mar sin iontu chun suim na bpáistí a mhúscailt i bhfeirmeoireacht, mar isé príomh-thionscal na tíre í, agus go bhfeicfeadh siad gur rud suimiúil an fheirmeoireacht, gur rud maith é agus go dtabharfaí blas dóibh air sin agus, mar sin, go ndéanfadh siad leanúint níos déanaí don ghné sin den oideachas.  Sílim gur ceart go mbeadh níos mó rangannaí sna ceard-scoileanna ar eolas tuaithe agus feirmeoireacht. Sin í an áit ba cheart fóirithint ar na buachaillí idir 14 agus 16 bliana d'aois agus is mó tairbhe é sin ná bheith ag plé le ceisteanna feirmeoireachta i rith cúrsaí an bhun-oideachais nuair atá rudaí níos tábhachtaí le fáil amach acu.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na Gaeilge, tá sé sin pléite go leor, tá súil agam.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a luaigh an tAire nuair a bhí sé ag caint&mdash;Aireacht na Gaeltachta&mdash;isé an chéad rud is mian liom a rá faoi sin, nach ndearna an Rúnaí Parlaiminte gnó fónta do chúis Aireacht nua na Gaeltachta nuair a chuaigh sé síos go Sligeach agus gur thug an óráid phoiblí a thug sé.  Sin í an chéad tairne i gcomhra Aireacht na Gaeltachta agus má éiríonn le hAireacht na Gaeltachta agus le hAire na Gaeltachta rud fónta ar son an limistéir sin a dhéanamh, ní bheidh an locht ar an Rúnaí Parlaiminite an Teachta Mac Loingsigh.  An dóigh a thosaigh an fear óg sin ar chuid dá chúramaí, ní raibh aoinne ag súil leis, ní raibh cúis ar bith leis agus ní raibh sé fíor, ná ní raibh faic na fríde de bhunús na fírinne ann.  Nílim ag iarraidh óráid pholaitíochta a dhéanamh anois ach deirim anseo gur chuir sé cuid mhaith de mhuintir ionraic na Gaeltachta ní hamháin ina aghaidh féin ach in aghaidh an Aire agus rachfaidh sé dian ar an Aire a chur in iúl nach cleas polaitíochta é toisc gurab é an céad uair é a chuaigh an Rúnaí Parlaiminte síos go Sligeach.</P>
    <P>Níor thug an tAire aon eolas dúinn ar rud ar bith a tharla mar gheall ar Aireacht na Gaeltachta ó ritheadh an tAcht sin.  Luaigh sé é i dtosach na hóráide a thug sé.  Dúirt sé nach raibh <Col N="1353" /> sé beartaithe go fóill céard iad na cúramaí de chuid na Roinne Oideachais a tabharfaí don Roinn úr.  Ní fheicim i gClár na Dála go bhfuil meastachán ar bith leagaithe amach le haghaidh Aireacht na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>An chéad rud eile, tithe scoile.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint thug sé cuntas dúinn ar scoltacha úra agus an méid airgid a bhí leagtha amach le haghaidh na scol sin.  Tá sé riachtanach.  Tá gá leo.  Ach anois cuirim fá bhráid an Aire an ghné seo&mdash;tá go leor scoltacha ar fud na tire, scoltacha nach bhfuil ró-aosta, scoltacha nach bhfuil tógtha, b'fhéidir, ach 20 bliain, agus tá siad ag dul in olcas toisc an neamh-chúram atá á dhéanamh díobh.  Tá cúram agus deisiú, maisiú agus feabhsú na scol san chomh tábhachtach leis an scéim mhaith atá ag an Aire chun scoltacha úra a thógáil.</P>
      <P>Ní ceart don Aire neamart a dhéanamh sna scoltacha atá ag dul i ndonas trí easba airgid nó easba cúraim maidir leis na daoine gur cheart dóibh an cúram sin a ghlacadh orthu féin.</P>
      <P>Sílim, nuair atá mé ag caint ar thithe scoile, nach ceart don Aire neamart a dhéanamh i dtógáil na scoltacha gairm-oidis.  Tá ráiteas ar leathanach 13 den leagan Béarla do cuireadh ar an gcaint a thug an tAire. Deir sé:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This, with the present-day difficulties experienced in financing capital works, will operate to restrict the making of allocations this year to other than urgent cases.  I expect to be pressed very hard during the year to approve of many schemes for which the necessary capital is not available.  I hope that committees who may be faced with difficulties arising out of the delay in giving such sanctions will appreciate the position and will be able to maintain a constructive patience born of a secure hope and purpose.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is olc an rud é neamart a dhéanamh i dtógáil scoltacha gairm-oidis mar is obair í sin a rachadh chun feabhais eacnamaíochta na tíre.  Má oiltear na páistí ins na scoltacha sin in obair adhmadóireachta agus i dtógáil de gach aon tsaghas nó in aon ghné de obair a bhaineas le ceard-oideachas rachaidh sé chun leas eacnamaíochta na tíre.  Ní ceart neamart a dhéanamh ins an méid airgid atá leagtha síos i gcóir na hoibre seo.  Tabharfaidh sé obair do na daoine atá as obair faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>A trí nó a ceanthair de bhlianta ó shoin do thosnaíomar ag plé le tógáil dhá scoil gairm-oidis i dTír Chonaill. Bhí ceann amháin acu i mBaile na nGallóglach nó Milford agus an ceann eile i gCarn Domhnach.  Rinne sinne ar an gCoiste Gairm-Oideachais rud ar bith a hiarradh orainn a dhéanamh. Do chuireamar na pleananna go dtí an Roinn Oideachais agus do cuireadh ar ais iad chun athrú a dhéanamh orthu anseo agus ansiúd.  Idir achan rud chuaigh an t-am thart agus anuraidh tugadh cead dul ar aghaidh leis an scoil i mBaile na nGallóglach. An bhliain seo bhíomar ag súil go rachfaí ar aghaidh leis an scoil i gCarn Domhnach ach, faraoir, nuair a bhí gach rud ullamh agus na pleananna molta chuir an tAire scéala chugainn nach bhféadfadh sé dul ar aghaidh leis an scoil níos luaithe ná an chéad lá de mhí Aibreáin an bhliain seo chugainn.  Níor chuir sin crá croí ar bith ar an Aire.  Dúirt sé gur ganntanas airgid fá ndeara é.  Tá cás den tsaghas céanna i Luimneach sílim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis na bun-scoltacha, is inmholta an saghas scoile atá á tógáil ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí.  Tá siad go han-mhaith ar fad.  Tá cuma agus crot sásúil orthu.  Nuair a tógtar scoil gairm-oidis cuirtear airíoch ina bhfeighil, agus is mór an trua ná <Col N="1356" /> déantar an rud céanna maidir leis na bun-scoltacha.  Ní chosnódh sé ach an oiread céanna airgid.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart rudaí eile a rá maidir leis na tithe scoile.  Anuraidh luaigh mé an rud seo agus bheirim buíochas don Aire go ndearna sé ordú ar an méid airgid a tugtar i gcóir guail nó ábhar tine nó glanadh na scoltacha.  Bhí sin riachtanach.  Tá áthas orm go ndearnadh leasú ar na figiúirí a bhí i bhfeidhm anuas ón mbliain 1943.  Bhí géar-ghá leis sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire nach raibh sé sásta leis an dóigh lenar ghlac an I.N.T.O., Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta, leis an toradh a bhí ar an scéim chomhréitigh agus eadrána.  Anois, tá cead acu nuair atá baint acu leis an gcomhairle sin a rá cé acu is maith leo é nó nach maith.  Ní hé an toradh amháin a bhí siad ag lochtú ach cuid den fhianaise a tugadh.  Níor aontaigh an chuid is mó de na múinteoirí leis go raibh sé ceart.  Dúirt an tAire gurab iad sin na tuairimí a bhí aige féin.  Is mór an trua gur dúradh na rudaí adúradh. Sílim nach laghdaíonn sé an cás atá ag na bun-mhúinteoirí i leith comhionannais leis na múinteoirí eile.</P>
    <P>Chuala mé an tAire Rialtais Aitiúil ag déanamh tagairt do ioncam na mbun-mhúinteoirí nuair a bhí sé ag cur síos ar na Small Dwellings Loans; dúirt sé nach mbeadh iasachtaí le fáil ag na múinteoirí ós rud é go raibh a bpáigh ró-ard.

Maidir le clár na gceard-scol, ceapaim go bhfuil an cúrsa úr ar foirgneálaíocht ar cheann de na rudaí is fearr a tosnaíodh go fóill.  Níl againn ar an gcúrsa <Col N="1357" /> sin áfach, ach scór múinteoirí, agus tá triúr acu sin ag obair i dTír Chonaill. Bíonn siad ag imeacht timpeall ag tabhairt cabhair agus comhairle do dhaoine atá ag tógáil tithe, ag cur suas stáblaí nó botháin, agus fosta, do dhaoine atá ag deisiú agus ag feabhsú tithe cónaithe agus tithe feirme.  Rud an-mhaith é sin, agus ba mhaith liom dá gcuireadh an tAire cúrsa eile mar sin ar siúl sa bhliain acadúil nua.  Ba mhaith linn dá mbeadh triúr eile de na múinteoirí sin i dTír Chonaill.</P>

      <P>Ábhar úsáideach é ceart go leor.  Ba mhaith liom na bun-mhúinteoirí a fheiceáil ag mhúnadh tarraingeoireachta dá mbeadh an t-am acu, ach tá rudaí i bhfad níos úsáidí á múnadh acu sna bunscoileanna. Caithimid na trí R a mhúinadh. B'fhéidir gur furasta tarraingeoireacht de shaghas a mhúnadh i gcuideachtain tíreolais.  Is fíor a rá gur féidir saghas tarraingeoireachta a mhúnadh freisin i ndáil le stair&mdash;léaráidí agus grafanna agus rudaí mar sin.</P>
      <P>Dhein an Teachta Childers tagairt d'oideachas i gcóir daoine fásta agus léigh mé féin le déanaí cúpla leabhar ar an rud céanna.  Bhain leabhar amháin díobh le saghas folk high school i dtír na Sualainne agus an ceann eile leis an oideachas céanna sa Danmhairg. Is é a scríobh oide ó Shasana a chuaigh amach, agus táim cinnte go bhfuil lochta ar an scéim sin dá bhfeicfeadh sé iad ach, má tá an ceart aige maidir leis na torthaí atá le fáil, ba cheart don Aire gan a thuille ama a chailleadh gan tosach a dhéanamh chun rud éigin mar sin a chur ar siúil anseo. Tá na hábhair aige anois.  D'fhéadfadh sé tosach a dhéanamh le gnéithe den fheirmeoireacht, costaisí feirmeoireachta agus rudaí mar sin.  Tá mórán cumainn mar chomhcomhaltas náisiúnta na bhfeirmeoirí agus gheobhfadh sé cabhair uathu.  Cuideoidh Cumann Bantracht na Tuatha leis agus mórán cumann, coistí agus grúpaí mar sin chun tosach a dhéanamh le gnéithe áirithe den oideachas sin do dhaoine fásta a chur ar bun.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom da mbainfí triail as gnéithe éigin den oideachas sin.  Tá mórán scóip sa tír seo i gcóir talmhaíochta agus tíreolais san gcéad áit. Bheadh sé le feiceáil ansin conas mar bheadh ag éirí leis an scéim agus d'fhéadfadh an tAire tuille a chur leis an gclár diaidh ar ndiaidh.  Tá dhá mhodh sa tír seo le haghaidh oideachais den tsaghas sin.  D'fhéadfaí tosnú a dhéanamh sna bun-scoileanna a bhíonn folamh gach oíche agus tá solas aíbhléise iontu anois.  Cho maith le sin, tá mórán hallaí paróiste ar fáil agus sílim go bhfuigheadh na daoine maitheas mór as ranganna oíche den tsaghas atá acu sa Danmhairg agus sa tSualainn.</P>

      <Col N="1359" /> Bíonn caint go minic ar Ghaeilge Uladh, Gaeilge Chonnacht agus Gaeilge na Mumhan.  Is maith liom féin an Gaeilge chaighdeánach, ach cé go bhfuil Gaeilge chaighdeánach ann tá Gaeilge chaighdeánach Uladh, Gaeilge chaighdeánach Chonnacht agus Gaeilge chaighdeánach na Muman agus leagtar amach na leabhar scoile sa tslí sin. Cheap mé féin, nuair a bheadh Gaeilge chaighdeánach againn nach mbeadh ann ach an t-aon-rud amháin.  Mar atá, níl dóthain leabhar i nGaeilge Uladh le fáil.  Deineadh iarracht i mbliana le feabhas a chur ar an scéal maidir keis na bun-leabhair, ach ba cheart don Aire cead a thabhairt i dtreo is go bhfoilseofaí níos mó leabhar i Gaeilge Uladh.  Bíonn míbhuntáiste mór ar scoláirí ó mo cheantar nuair a thagas an scrúdú agus ní fior a rá nach mbíonn an t-eolas acu ach ní thuigeann siad na ceisteanna sa saghas Gaeilge chaighdeánach a húsáidtear agus, mar sin, ní bhíonn na freagrai acu.  Ní locht ar na scoláirí é sin dar ndóigh.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart don Aire níos mó cabhrach a thabhairt do na coláistí Samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht agus go mór mór don aos óg.  Bíonn mórán cainte sa Teach seo maidir le Gaeilge agus an staid ina bhfuil sí agus an tslí is fearr lena cur chun cinn.  Ach gidh go bhfuil lochtanna ar an gcóras atá ar siúl ní lochtanna bunúsacha iad. Ní maith linn aon athrú mór a fheiscint. Admhaím gur féidir feabhas a chur ar na scéimeanna agus na modhanna a mbaintear triail astu faoi láthair, ach taobh amuigh de sin ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon athrú mór is féidir linn a dhéanmh chun í d'fheabhsú. Chun go n-éireoidh leis an aithbheochaint is gá borradh a fháil i measc an aosa óig.  Is beag an méid daoine faoi chúig bhliana fichead d'aois nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu agus tá sé ar a gcumas í a léamh agus í do scríobh.  Tuigeann siad Gaeilge ach ní labhrann siad í.  Nílimid ábalta faic a dhéanamh mar oidí agus teachtaí leis an scéal sin a leigheas.  Ní easpa oideachais is cúis le staid na Gaeilge faoi láthair agus ní admhaím go bhfuil an staid sin chomh holc agus a cheapas daoine éigin.  Tá mórán <Col N="1360" /> slite agus modhanna inar féidir linn an teanga a shábháil agus tá mórán obair curtha isteach ar an aithbheochaint. Sileadh mórán allais uirthí chomh maith agus sílim nach baol ar bith don Ghaeilge faoi láthair.  Sílim go bhfuil mórán daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh dí atá ábalta an teanga a shábháil má mhínítear dóibh go bhfuil gá náisiúnta ann.  Is féidir leis na daoine lasmuigh den Gaeltacht féin an Ghaeilge a shábháil.</P>

      <P>While I personally do not share Deputy Cunningham's optimism on the position regarding the revival of the Irish language I say quite sincerely I welcome the outlook as expressed here by him.  It is inspiring that the outlook as expressed by Deputy Cunningham with regard to the Irish language and the steps that have been taken over the last 30 years should have been expressed by a person in his position who is concerned with the education of our youth.  It is my own personal regret that in following his speech&mdash;and this is something on which I propose giving my own views later on&mdash;I am unable to do so in our native tongue such as he was able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to the fact that there are many people in this country who are in a position to read, write and speak Irish but that they will not do it, and that there is not very much the Legislature can do in that situation.  I often find myself listening to discussions in the House&mdash; and this is one of them&mdash;where I can listen to Irish and understand it but I do not find myself in a position readily to speak it in return.  There are probably a great number of people in that position also and that is one of the aspects of this question of the revival of Irish on which I would like to dwell and give my views before I conclude, because it is something that we can all do something about and it is a <Col N="1362" /> question about which each one of us who as Deputies are in this House in a representative capacity should ask ourselves, are we doing anything?</P>
    <P>I want to pay this tribute at the outset to the present Minister for Education.  I do not believe that if you searched the length and breadth of the country you would find anyone more sincere and high-minded with regard particularly to the question of the revival of the Irish language and those of us of the younger generation of Irish politicians might very well follow the example of the people of the Minister's generation who in their day, without any incentive, without any of the financial inducements to which Deputy Cunningham, I think, referred, banded themselves together to do what they could both as individuals and in groups, as a national aid to further the cause of not only the preservation but the spirit and revival of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I know the present Minister was one of those who, in that patriotic way, set himself about that particular task. I simply mention him because he happens to be the Minister in charge of the particular Estimate we are discussing. I know there were many others, many of whom are still with us, many on both sides of the House, who went about endeavouring to achieve that objective in a similar way in those days.  It may very well be that a number of Deputies find themselves in the same position as that in which I find myself, that is, that I can frequently follow the debates in Irish, read the newspaper articles, whatever they have in Irish, read debates here in Irish, but I have not, because of my professional activities, any need or any opportunity to practise the speaking of Irish and endeavour to attain a fluency in Irish as a spoken tongue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers referred this afternoon at some length to the question of technological education, vocational education.  I interjected while he was speaking to emphasise that the remarks he was making did not apply to Dublin City.  Deputy Childers, I think, agreed with me that the references he was making and the deficiencies he was deploring were rather related to vocational <Col N="1363" /> education in the rural areas than in Dublin City.  I do not want to misinterpret anything which Deputy Childers said.  I think he very readily agreed with me that his remarks did not have reference to the work being done in Dublin City.  However, I want to take the opportunity, in case others might misconstrue them, of saying that, as far as I am aware&mdash;and I have had ten years' experience of serving on the Vocational Education Committee in Dublin City&mdash;the criticisms made by Deputy Childers do not in fact have any relevancy so far as Dublin City is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not a member of the Vocational Education Committee in Dublin now and perhaps I feel a bit freer to speak in their praise than I would if I were still a member of that committee.  I have a very great admiration for the work being carried out by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. I think they are doing grand and very important work and, to a great extent, it meets the needs which Deputy D. Costello referred to when he was speaking here to-day and advocating the raising of the school-leaving age.  The technical schools throughout this city do work of very great importance not only in relation to to technical subjects but in relation to continuation subjects and continuation courses.  I think it is true to say that in a number of the technical schools in this city not only is important work being done but it is being done by an extremely competent, efficient and well-trained staff.</P>
    <P>At the top of the vocational educational organisation in this city you have men of very great ability and experience who throw themselves very actively and with great enthusiasm into the work which they have to do. I think very much more so than is the case with secondary or primary teachers, the calls upon the time of members of the teaching staff of vocational schools are very great and very varied.  It is necessary for them to devote their time and ability even on occasions when the ordinary professional man thinks he is entitled to a well-earned rest in the evening.  I know that very many of the teachers <Col N="1364" /> in the service of the Vocational Education Committee in Dublin City do not stint themselves in any way but are quite prepared to spend what should be their leisure hours in active participation in such things as drill courses, games, sports, and so on, which, in the normal way, might be considered as outside the curriculum of the master or the teacher.  They devote themselves to that kind of work, the organisational and recreational work in connection with the schools, in a way which I think should excite the admiration of all of us.</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that the enthusiasm and activity which they have displayed in Dublin has certainly been responded to by the pupils who attend the schools and by the parents of those pupils.</P>
    <P>Going through the city during the enrolment period, we see long queues of people lining up and trying to get into various courses.  It is not always possible to take them all in.  Frequently, a number of people are disappointed and are not able to take the particular courses which they are anxious to take.  However, the work being done in Rathmines, Kevin Street, Parnell Square, Cathal Brugha Street and all the other schools is important work.  It is being well done with enthusiasm by the staff.  Very great credit is due to these people.  I think this also reflects great credit on the permanent staff of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>During my association with the vocational schools in this city, I was impressed by the degree of co-operation and encouragement given by the senior officers of the Department of Education. Very often individual school principals put up proposals for new courses which might be of interest, such as, to take an example, window dressing or shop-fitting.  All of these subjects are received with very great and sympathetic consideration and many have been adopted and have proved to be popular and well worth while when they have been put into effect.  I was glad to note from the Minister's remarks that courses are continuing in most of the technological <Col N="1365" /> subjects, in training courses such as rural science, woodworking, building construction, or cabinet making.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to the fact that it might be better to devote more time to courses which might be described as useful rather than ornamental, but I do not claim to have followed him very clearly.  Generally speaking, I am in agreement with that but it did occur to me that very often in order to get the proper groundwork, in courses such as woodwork, it may be necessary, from the educational point of view, to implant in the pupils, who in this case will be teachers, certain essential principles which require the ornamental side, before they can pass on to the useful side of the work.  These kind of courses for teachers are proceeding.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to talk about the position of vocational training in rural areas.  Deputy Childers appeared to feel that there was still a lot lacking, particularly in regard to subjects which are important in the agricultural sphere.  That may be so; I do not know anything about it but some of the rural Deputies, I take it, will be able to give their views on it.  It does seem that the Department, and the various vocational education committees throughout the country, could have a very proper appreciation of the importance of the work which is necessary in this sphere.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate that as far as Dublin City is concerned the work that has been done, and is being done, and which is being added to year by year, reflects great credit not only on the members of the committee&mdash;and to a great extent they are the least important&mdash;but on the staff working under the C.E.O., and on the officials in the Department of Education, and the encouragement which successive Ministers have given to expanding the sphere of activity of the committee and its work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello and, I think, Deputy Tully, although I did not hear him, referred to what has for some time past been referred to as compulsory Irish.  I have no doubt that Deputy Cunningham, who, naturally enough, <Col N="1366" /> by reason of his advocation, is interested in the subject, is at least theoretically correct, when he says that there is no such thing as compulsory Irish in the sense of compulsion on teachers to teach other subjects through the medium of Irish.  Deputy Cunningham quoted the Department regulations on the subject and, as I say, I have no doubt that theoretically the Deputy is correct.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to make it clear that my main reason for raising these questions is the fact that I am convinced that there have been serious contraventions of Section 40 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  That is my only purpose.

      <P>Section 40 of the Adoption Act, sub-section 1, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  No person shall remove out of the State a child under seven years of age who is an Irish citizen or cause or permit such removal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Sub-section (2) of the same Act states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Sub-section (1) shall not apply to the removal of an illegitimate child under one year of age by or with the approval of the mother or, if the mother is dead, of a relative for the purpose of residing with the mother or a relative outside the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Sub-section (1) shall not apply to the removal of a child (not being an illegitimate child under one year of age) by or with the approval of a parent, guardian or relative of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that the section, as I interpret it&mdash;not being a professional legislator, and not having expert knowledge of legislation&mdash;clearly indicates that a child of under seven years of age shall not be removed from the State and that nobody has the authority to remove such a child.  It further states that an illegitimate child under one year cannot be removed from this State even with the approval of the parents, parent, or guardian.  In the case of an illegitimate child the consent of the parent or guardian can be obtained and such adoption can take place.</P>
    <P>In my first Question to-day, No. 6, I asked the Minister if he would make a statement regarding the circumstances which led to the transfer to the United States of America, with a view to adoption of Anthony Barron and Mary Clancy of Camos, Bruff, County Limerick, and if he would state the date of each transfer and the place from which each transfer took place. The Minister in his reply stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the inquiries that have been made I am satisfied that there was nothing unlawful or irregular about the removal of these children out of the State.  In the circumstances, I have no further function in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that not only was there something irregular about the manner of the removal of those children but something definitely illegal.  My attention was drawn to this matter by a responsible association in this country <Col N="1368" /> and I based my questions on information supplied by that organisation.  I made it my business to go to Limerick last Sunday.  I went to the house where these children had been and I saw the grandmother of the children. I happened to see also the aunt of one of them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied beyond all doubt that Mary Clancy was born in 1952 and that Anthony Barron was born in 1953.  The Minister's reply to me to-day states that both children were removed from this State this year.  The ages speak for themselves.  I was also informed, in reply to a further question, that Anthony Barron was removed from the Croom Hospital by his grandmother. I have here a photostatic copy of the letter from Anthony Barron's grandmother to the Mrs. Barron who had charge of the child.  This letter was written after the removal of the child from the Barron household.  The letter states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Barron: I hope you are well, as this leaves me the same. Well, Mrs. I was surprised to hear that the child was gone.  It is in Croom Hospital waiting to go to the U.S.A.  Will you take it back if I get it for you?  I will go down to see it on Sunday.  If you can, will you write by return post?  Yours truly, N. Barron.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I mention those two documents to substantiate that, on the basis of these two specific cases, something illegal took place.  Two children over one year and under seven were removed from this State with a view to adoption.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley put a question to the Minister for Justice last April.  It is in the Dáil Reports of 10th April, Volumn 165, columns 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. O'Malley asked the Minister for Justice whether any children, who were temporary inmates of the County Hospital, Croom, County Limerick, were adopted by American citizens and, if so, if he will state the circumstances of such adoption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The answer to the first part of the question is that some such children <Col N="1369" /> have been taken out of the country with a view to adoption.  I am satisfied that there was nothing irregular or unlawful about this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a further question, Deputy Desmond directed the attention of the Minister to some Sunday newspaper reports.  I did not see the reports myself, but his question was based on some Sunday newspaper reports alleging that there was traffic in babies in this country. The Minister referred the Deputy to the reply given to Deputy O'Malley, and again reiterated he was satisfied there was nothing wrong in the whole matter and that it was merely cross-Channel misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to consider that, while these two isolated cases alone would have justified the fullest examination of the facts, in reply to a further question of mine to-day, I was given the information that in the last three years 523 such children have left this country with a view to adoption in the U.S.A.  Five hundred and twenty-three is an appalling figure in view of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The present Adoption Act, which was passed after many years of agitation by interested societies and social workers, in its present form deals with the adoption of children in this country, and its application has proved to be most successful, most efficient and most beneficial to the applicants for adopted children and to the children adopted.  I fail to see why we cannot take the same protective measures to ensure that those children who are leaving this country are guaranteed the same protection with regard to religious duties, and with regard to the type of home they are going to.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has stated, and sincerely meant, that investigations do take place on this side when these children go.  Our Adoption Act is not effective in the U.S.A.  How legally binding, therefore, are the undertakings given by the people willing to adopt?  I think this is a very serious matter.  I have no objection to the transfer of these children to America as such.  It is quite probable that many of these children are getting an opportunity in life they could not and <Col N="1370" /> would not get here, that they can start a new life and that they will not have to go through life in this country with the stigma they normally have to bear. But I do not see why it should have to be done in an illegal manner.  I again ask the Minister if he cannot put any interpretation on this section other than the one that is on it, to ensure that at an early date legislation will be brought in to ensure that these children are adopted in this country before they go?</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Act states that when parents in this country are adopting a baby in this country they must be resident in this country for at least five years before the baby is adopted. In my opinion that should also apply to a limited extent to parents from America who wish to adopt our babies. They should have a residential term in this country, so that their whole moral character and religious outlook and ideas could be examined.  I think legislation should be introduced at once to amend this Act.  If the Minister cannot assure me in this, then I would suggest that the Act should be made more specific.  If the points I am making are not correct&mdash;and I am at a loss to see they are not, in view of my investigations&mdash;or if I am not right in my beliefs, I hope the Minister will amend the wording of the Act to make it more clear so that these children will be protected.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I would like to go into the particular circumstances surrounding the removal of those two children I mentioned.  It was specifically stated, in reply to a question of mine, that Mary Clancy was removed from Croom Hospital by her grandmother.  As I said, I was in Limerick last Sunday and I found that that was not true.  Mary Clancy's grandmother did not remove her from that hospital.  Mary Clancy left Croom Hospital for an American plane at one o'clock in the morning.  Her grandmother may have known she was going, but she did not remove her from the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> Anthony Barron was not taken to Croom Hospital by his grandmother nor was he removed by his grandmother. I am quite satisfied, as a result of my personal investigations, that these facts are true.  I do not know what the reason behind all this is. Apart from these cases in County Limerick I would consider this Adjournment motion necessary in view of the appalling figure of 523 children who have gone out of this country in three years and who, in my opinion, have gone out of it illegally.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to give an adequate explanation and assure us he will do something to control the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll mentioned that I raised this matter in connection with the children originally.  She mentioned that last April I got a reply from the Minister for Justice that he was satisfied nothing illegal had been done.  I support 80 per cent. of what Deputy Mrs. Maureen O'Carroll maintains, but I deprecate the manner in which she has chosen to bring publicity to a question which, in my respectful opinion, would have been better dealt with by an interview, first of all, between Deputy Mrs. Maureen O'Carroll &mdash;if she does not mind my saying so&mdash; and the appropriate Minister.  There are too many outside bodies waiting to have a crack at this country, without mentioning any names, and they lose no opportunity of vilifying us.  What has been stated in all sincerity by Deputy Mrs. Maureen O'Carroll will be splashed across many a paper, not only in Britain but in other countries, to the detriment of this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll 80 per cent.  I admire her for the trouble she has taken in this matter. She went down to Limerick and interviewed the grandmother of the two children I mentioned here last April. There is no doubt that what she states is substantially correct.  One thing emerges from this debate: the whole system of adoption of children is worthy of reinvestigation.  I know, as everyone connected with Shannon <Col N="1372" /> Airport knows, that these children are going to very wealthy homes.  There are two sides to that.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll says she agrees it improves their lot in life and possibly they lose the stigma which might attach to them, under certain circumstances, if they continued to live here.  The parents of these adopted children can afford to pay the passage of an employee of an American air company at Shannon to take the child, or children, over there.  Her first-class return fare is paid.  Evidently these children are going to very good families.</P>
    <P>One point has not been stressed, though I think Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll has it in the back of her mind.  Who is at the back of these arrangements? That is what we want to find out.  Who is the negotiating body?  Who is carrying out the deals for these millionaires, semi-millionaires and very high Catholic Americans?  Who is the liaison officer between America and this country?  No one can find that out. Money is passing to the very close relatives of these children, in certain cases to the unfortunate mother of the type of child to whom Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll referred.  It is a temptation to such a mother if she is offered £100 or £150 in order to get her consent.</P>
    <P>I live in Limerick and I could go into a lot of detail in regard to this.  I do not say there is any illegal traffic. There may be technical breaches.  I support Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll 100 per cent. and congratulate her in bringing this matter to the Minister's attention and in focussing the attention of the public on it.  I hope, as a result of this debate, the whole system will be reinvestigated, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts in this matter are not in dispute.  The position is that the two children referred to in the question asked to-day were both adopted in accordance with the terms of Section 40 <Col N="1373" /> of the Adoption Act.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll appears to have misdirected herself on the interpretation of that section.  Sub-section (1) of Section 40 provides a general prohibition against the removal of a child under seven years of age out of the State; but that sub-section is qualified by the subsequent sub-sections (2) and (3).  Sub-section (3) provides that this prohibition will not apply to the removal of a child, whether legitimate or not, with the parents' consent unless the child is an illegitimate child under one year of age, in which case the child may be removed only for the purpose of residing with its mother or a relative outside the State.</P>
      <P>In the two cases in question the children were removed with the consent of the mother in one case and the consent of the grandmother in another. Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll said that on the basis of the figures supplied in reply to other parliamentary questions to-day there would appear to be a traffic in these children.  Although Deputy O'Malley sympathised with Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll, he thought she had not gone the proper way about raising this matter.  I agree with the Deputy's solicitude for a proper compliance with the law.  Unfortunately, Deputy O'Malley suggested that there were deals with millionaires.  I have no particulars of such deals and it is wrong to suggest that there is anything in the nature of a traffic in the adoption of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirements of my Department concerning the issue of passports for the adoption of children are very stringent and full particulars must be supplied before a passport issues.  In all these cases appropriate religious organisations in the adopting countries investigate the cases concerned.  I have here a draft letter dealing with the applications of a Catholic legitimate child.  In the case of children of other <Col N="1374" /> denominations the same requirements must be complied with.</P>
    <P>In the particular case mentioned here the provisions of the Act have been complied with.  Deputy Mrs. O'Carroll said that she had her information from a responsible association. I hope that their other activities are more responsible than is their attempt at an interpretation of Section 40 of the Adoption Act.  If the Deputy has based her interpretation of that section on the information supplied to her, then she has misdirected herself. Only when the requirements are complied with is a passport issued.  The other requirements involve a very careful study conducted by charitable organisations in the United States as to the circumstances, the background, the suitability and so forth of the adopting parents.  If Deputies are interested, particulars may be had on application to the Department.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that, because of the publicity that has attached to these two particular cases, in the 500 other cases in which passports have been issued, such passports have been issued irregularly.  I deprecate the type of publicity which this debate will attract.  Deputy Desmond put a supplementary question to-day.  Great care is taken to see that the Adoption Act is complied with and that the prospective adopting parents are suitable and proper people to be granted the custody of a child.  It is significant that the only comments on this have appeared in what we here call the yellow English Sunday newspapers, who avail of every, and any, opportunity to smear the name of this country.  I do not propose to be a party to any such campaign and I hope that no Deputies in this House will lend themselves to it either.</P>
