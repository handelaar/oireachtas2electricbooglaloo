      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the cost-of-living index figure, to base 1947=100, at 18th February, 1948, June, 1951, June, 1954, and at the latest available date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As and from November, 1953, the title of the retail price index was changed from the &ldquo;Interim Cost-of-Living Index (Essential Items)&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo;.  The Consumer Price Index is based on mid-August, 1947=100 but differs in scope and weighting pattern from the Essential Items Index.  In particular, the Consumer Price Index covers a wide range of sundries&mdash; including tobacco, cigarettes, alcoholic drinks, newspapers, etc.&mdash;which were not covered by the Essential Items Index.</P>
      <P>The index is computed at the quarterly intervals, mid-February, mid-May, mid-August and mid-November. To base mid-August 1947=100 the index was 99 at mid-February, 1948, 109 at mid-May, 1951, 124 at mid-May, 1954, and 134 at mid-May, 1956.</P>
      <P>The index increased by 10 per cent. between mid-February, 1948 and mid-May, 1951, by 14 per cent. between mid-May, 1951, and mid-May, 1954, and by 8 per cent. between mid-May, 1954, and mid-May, 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of the fact that the new vocational schools in course of erection at Emmet Road, Inchicore, Dublin, are nearing completion, he is now in a position to state whether a date has been fixed for the opening of these schools, and the courses of study it is proposed to pursue therein.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>No date has yet been fixed for the opening of the new vocational schools at Emmet Road, Inchicore, but it is hoped that the work will be sufficiently advanced to permit of occupation in October next when it is intended to commence a day junior technical course for boys, comprising woodwork, metalwork, drawing, science, Irish, English, physical training and religious knowledge.  Suitable evening courses for adults will also be introduced.</P>

      <P>According to the returns furnished to the Department from the national schools the position on the 30th June, 1955, was as follows in relation to pupils who had attained the age of 14 years:&mdash;(a) 2,521 had not completed standard V; (b) 4,969 had not completed standard VI.</P>
      <P>A pupil who has not completed standard VI is not eligible to sit for the primary certificate examination.  I regret that my available information does not enable me to state the number of pupils over 14 years of age who have completed standard VI but have not obtained the primary certificate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the present position in relation to the Land Commission's proceedings to acquire the Welsh estate, Knocklong, County Limerick, and whether the negotiations have been completed, (b) the price agreed and (c) the acreage involved.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the lands of Knocklong East containing 73 acres and Knocklong West containing 61 acres on the estate of Reps.  William Walsh, deceased. Objections to acquisition were heard last month; the objection in respect of Knocklong West being allowed and in respect of Knocklong East being disallowed.  The proceedings for Knocklong West have, therefore, terminated and the question of price in respect of Knocklong East has yet to be settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the date on which the Land Commission decided to take action in connection with the acquisition of the Lloyd estate, Cappamore, County Limerick, the developments which have since taken place, <Col N="10" /> the price recommended to be paid, the acreage involved, and what is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In November, 1954, the Land Commission instituted proceedings for the acquisition of this estate comprising about 179 acres.  In March, 1955, an objection to acquisition lodged by the owner was disallowed.  On appeal the price was fixed by the Appeal Tribunal at £6,250 in March last.  The Land Commission considered the price so fixed to be such as to render the purchase of the lands inexpedient and decided, pursuant to Section 24, Land Act, 1927, to withdraw from proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that very acute congestion exists in this area?  Would he consider making representations to the Land Commission to reconsider their attitude, which appears to be that the price allowed by the tribunal was excessive and exorbitant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring the Deputy's remarks to the notice of the commissioners, but I think it is only right to say that the question of the fixation of price and the suitability of land acquired are matters confined by law to the commissioners.  The Minister has no function.  In this case the commissioners decided to withdraw from the proceedings because they thought the price would render acquisition of the lands inexpedient. However, I shall bring the Deputy's remarks to the notice of the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister said the acreage in question is 179 statute acres.  I do not think the price asked was excessive.  A farm of land of 143 statute acres was sold in Limerick the week before last by public auction for £7,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be under the impression that the price of the land in question is normal but, nevertheless, the commissioners are obliged by law, a law made in this House, to take into account the annuity which will be placed on the allottees ultimately. I have no doubt that they decided on <Col N="11" /> the action they have taken in the best interests of the allottees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state the amount of the receipts from sales of timber at forest centres, and the comparative cost of extraction of such timber during 1954-55 and 1955-56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The total receipts from sales of timber in State forests (as distinct from sawmills) were £143,604 in 1954-55 and £179,170 in 1955-56; the latter figure is provisional.</P>
      <P>Records of expenditure on the felling and extraction of timber in any particular year are not segregated so as to show the expenditure on timber sold to the public separately from the cost of timber supplied to the Department's sawmills or otherwise applied to departmental requirements, e.g. fencing stakes, bridge construction or toolhouses.  No useful purpose would be served by such separate figures.  It would not be possible to use the figures in conjunction with figures of annual receipts from sales as felling and extraction of any particular lot of timber may not be completed in a single year or, alternatively, sale may not be brought to completion within the same year.  Furthermore, some sales are arranged on the basis of instalment payments, stated proportions of the purchase price being payable according as removal of the material proceeds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Lack of a sufficiently pleasing gap between the cost of extraction and sales is engaging my attention at the present time.  I believe that, in the matter of sales, there can be improvement and, in the matter of costs of extraction, there can be economy.  I am engaged on both of these aspects at the moment.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This Bill is the eighth since the transfer of services in 1922.  Its purpose is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow further moneys up to a limit of £6,000,000 for continued development of the telephone service.  The money will be borrowed as required over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> As Deputies are no doubt aware, expenditure on the telephone service falls under two broad heads.  The ordinary running expenses on day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system are met out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas under the Post Office Vote.  On the other hand, expenditure on extension and development of the system&mdash;for example, on the erection of new exchanges, the provision of additional trunk lines and the installation of subscribers' telephones&mdash;are met out of funds provided by the Minister for Finance under the Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
    <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums not exceeding a stated amount for the development of the telephone service.  The issues are subject to estimates of expenditure being submitted to and approved by the Minister for Finance.  The Acts also authorise the Minister for Finance to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues from the Central Fund and for that purpose to create terminable annuities extending over a period not exceeding 25 years.  The annuities are paid annually in six-monthly instalments out of moneys provided in subhead M of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    <P>The total amount authorised to be raised under the previous Irish Telephone Capital Acts to finance works carried out since 1st April, 1922, is £16.75 million, of which £16.33 million approximately had been expended up to March 31st last.  Of the latter amount some £12.6 million still remained to be repaid on that date.</P>
    <P>The last Telephone Capital Act, that of 1951, was for £8,000,000 and was intended to cover a broad programme of works comprising new and extended exchanges, additional subscribers' installations and trunk circuits, new buildings and additional kiosks and call offices.  Of the funds authorised to be raised by the 1946 Telephone Capital Act a balance of £1,057,000 odd remained at 31st March, 1951, making, with the £8,000,000 authorised by the 1951 Act, a total of £9,057,000.  Here is how over the five years to 31st <Col N="20" /> March last the bulk of that money was spent:</P>

    <P>In the five years, much has been done; over 35,000 exchange lines and 50,000 telephone stations have been provided and the total number of exchange telephones in service is now 120,000 approximately as compared with 86,000 odd in 1951.  Local calls increased from 69,000,000 in 1950 to 88,000,000 in 1955 and trunk calls from 9.4 million to 13.7 million.</P>
    <P>In 1950, trunk call delays were the rule rather than the exception.  The outstanding development in the meantime has been a great increase in the capacity of our trunk network, particularly of our main trunk routes.  The works carried out include completion of the southern coaxial trunk cables from Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Athlone; the provision of the northern trunk cable to Drogheda and Dundalk; the laying of a third trunk cable, to be completed this month, to Mullingar, Longford, Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo, with a branch to Athlone; the erection of extra wires and the installation of carrier equipment on hundreds of other routes. Altogether the mileage of trunk circuits in service has been increased from 45,000 miles at the end of 1950 to some 92,000 at the end of 1955.  In other words, trunk circuit mileage has been more than doubled in 5 years. The corresponding increase in the total number of trunk calls has been 46 per cent. approximately.  Although it cannot be claimed that long delays have yet been entirely eliminated, no-delay services have been provided over a great part of the system and the <Col N="21" /> trunk services generally have been greatly improved.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to mention that the handling of trunk calls has been considerably expedited over a large number of routes by the introduction of a degree of trunk mechanisation, whereby the operator at the originating exchange is able to dial a call through one or more intermediate trunk exchanges to the called subscriber without the assistance of another operator.  For example, an operator at Sligo can dial directly to a subscriber at Cobh via Dublin and Cork exchanges.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, a new trunk exchange opened in 1952 at St. Andrew Street, Dublin, has greatly facilitated trunk working and improved the service for Dublin subscribers.  In the city and suburban area, new automatic exchanges have been established in Upper O'Connell Street, Finglas, Priory Park (Blackrock), Dundrum, Foxrock, Clondalkin&mdash;Tallaght, Sutton &mdash;Howth, and Whitehall and extensions have been carried out at all existing exchanges.  Outside of Dublin, automatic exchanges have been provided at 21 places including Dundalk, Waterford, Athlone and Mullingar.  In most of the larger provincial centres magneto switchboard equipment has been replaced by modern operating suites.  Altogether over 530 extensions or renewals of switchboard equipment have been carried out at various exchanges.</P>
    <P>Continuous 24-hour service has been introduced at 78 exchanges where the service was formerly restricted and the attendance at 305 other small exchanges has been increased by 14 hours weekly in each case. 97.5 per cent. of our subscribers now have continuous service.</P>
    <P>The rural call office scheme for providing a telephone in every rural post office has been completed, apart from two offices which are in course of being provided.  Although the use made of these telephones is, in most cases, small, they do provide a valuable means of communication in areas that would otherwise be isolated.  In cities and towns, over 230 additional kiosks <Col N="22" /> were provided during the period in question.</P>
    <P>Although the number of telephones being installed is now greater than ever before, we still have a waiting list.  It may well be asked why there should be such a list so long after the war, when most other shortages have disappeared.  The first point to be noted is that the problem is not one peculiar to us.  Most countries still have waiting applications for telephones, our nearest neighbour having no less than 360,000.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in providing telephones everywhere promptly lies in the fundamental necessity to forecast for several years ahead what the likely requirements will be, to plan for exchange and underground cables, and to order the equipment and have it installed well in advance of the treatment of individual applications for telephone service.  The experience in most countries has been that public demand for telephones has been outrunning the capacity of the telephone industry and administrations to meet it except after some delay.</P>
    <P>In common with most organisations requiring staff for engineering and electronic work, we have found it difficult to recruit and retain an engineering staff sufficiently strong to expand the system at a rate sufficient to overtake demand which has now reached a level of about four times what it was immediately before the war.</P>
    <P>Let me give some figures to show how steeply demand has been rising in the last few years.  In 1954, the number of applications received was 16 per cent. greater than in 1953; the 1955 demand rate was 25 per cent. greater than in 1954; for the first five months of this year, it was some 17 per cent. over the corresponding figures for last year and about 44 per cent. greater than it was two years ago.  The bulk of the increased demand is for private telephones.  It is obvious that to cope with an increasing demand of this magnitude more staff is required and an increase in the rate of development entailing a substantial increase in the level of capital expenditure on the service. <Col N="23" /> This brings me to the financial position of the service and to its capital needs for the next few years.</P>
    <P>For many years past the telephone service has been run, on the whole, at a profit.  In the current year, the margin of profit would virtually disappear if pre-July 1st charges were to remain unaltered.  This is not surprising when it is considered that wages, costs of materials and total annual expenditure on the service are on average respectively about two and a half times, three and a half times and six times what they were in 1939. On the other hand, telephone rentals are only about 50 per cent. and call charges, as recently revised, about 66 per cent. overall greater than the 1939 rates.  Our rates compare very favourably with those in other countries.</P>
    <P>The small increases in rentals and call rates as compared with the much greater increases in money incomes have undoubtedly put telephones within the reach of people who could not afford them pre-war.  Moreover, the great increase in residential building schemes, often at fairly considerable distances from main shopping centres and places of employment, has stimulated demand for private telephones.</P>
    <P>This demand is welcome in so far as it indicates more telephone consciousness among our people and so long as we have the capital resources to satisfy it.  Telephone development, however, requires heavy capital investment per subscriber.  Apart from the subscriber's instrument and his individual pair of wires to the nearest exchange, the whole complex system of lines, cables and exchanges must be maintained and expanded in step with growth in subscribers' lines and call traffic if bottlenecks resulting in congestion and delays are to be avoided.  The capital investment in the system has grown from £57 per telephone instrument in use in 1938-1939 to £125 in the past financial year.</P>
    <P>In considering the future capital needs of the telephone service, we are faced with the unpleasant facts that capital is very scarce and that it is <Col N="24" /> also abnormally dear.  The funds for telephone capital development must be raised by the Exchequer which is unable to meet all the demands upon it for desirable capital expenditure.  The needs of the telephone service must, therefore, be weighed against those of the other capital services which are also financed through the Exchequer, such as housing, sanitary services, hospitals, agricultural development, etc. As Minister responsible for the telephone service, I am, of course, concerned that its claims be given full weight.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I do recognise that, since there is a serious shortage of capital, I cannot reasonably expect telephone development and particularly the extensive installation of private telephones, which now constitutes a very large part of the increased demand, to be regarded as of such overriding importance that the needs of the service should be met in full at the expense of the other capital services to which I have referred.  After careful consideration, it has been decided, subject to the approval of the Oireachtas, to provide telephone capital funds for the next four years on the basis of the average rate of expenditure over the past few years, that is, at £1,500,000 a year.  The present Bill is, accordingly, for £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>The £6,000,000 will not be sufficient to meet completely, on the basis of recent demand, the anticipated needs of the service over the next few years. That is to say, we cannot go ahead to install all the subscribers' lines that could otherwise be provided, to undertake all the underground development schemes required in built-up areas to meet and anticipate application for telephones, to install all the exchange equipment we otherwise would to extend automatic working or to provide all the additional trunk lines we would endeavour to provide if there were no capital shortage.</P>
    <P>The amount of work to be done under all these headings will be limited by the amount of money available and the works programme will have to be adjusted accordingly.  New schemes that can be postponed without <Col N="25" /> materially affecting the standard of service to subscribers will be postponed. Thus, manual exchanges will not be converted to automatic working if a reasonable standard of service can continue to be given on a manual basis.  Ways and means will be sought of postponing other costly schemes, such as major trunk underground schemes.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the provision of plant for new subscribers will have to be related strictly to the amount of money available for the purpose.  We shall have to do the best we can on a restricted programme based on a capital allocation of £1,500,000 a year commencing in the current financial year. Our efforts will be directed towards reducing and keeping the level of capital costs within this figure in a manner that will cause least inconvenience to all concerned.  By and large, there should be no material variation in the volume of employment given.</P>
    <P>The following programme indicates under broad headings how the £6,000,000 is likely to be spent.  It is in rather general terms as it is important, if we are to make the best use of the limited money available, that there should be a considerable measure of flexibility in carrying it out:</P>

    <P>New automatic exchanges will be provided at Drogheda, Dublin, Sligo, Limerick, Galway, Longford, Naas and a number of other places.  There will also be heavy expenditure on extensions of existing exchanges.  Provision is being made for commencing the erection of a third trunk exchange at Dublin and for a satellite automatic exchange at Cork to relieve the existing exchanges.  As I have already indicated, it is proposed to defer the planned conversion to automatic working of manual exchanges in cases where there is no compelling need for conversion.</P>

    <P>Additional equipment will be installed on the southern and northern trunk cables in order to maintain a <Col N="26" /> sufficiency of circuits for no-delay working on these backbone routes.  The trunk programme will include the installation of a considerable amount of carrier equipment and on shorter routes the erection of aerial cables and physical wires.  The general aim will be to improve the standard of trunk service that obtains at present on routes where there are delays but assuming that trunk traffic will continue to increase at the rate realised in recent years, it is unlikely that, while capital shortage persists, it will be possible to get much nearer our long term objective of a no-delay system than we are at present.  Indeed, it may not be possible to avoid a temporary deterioration of service on some routes.</P>

    <P>It would be mistaken policy to devote an excessive amount of the limited capital available to subscribers' installations and associated work at the expense of exchange and trunk works.  The result would be to create a need for additions to exchanges and additional trunk lines that could not be met&mdash;in other words, the intake of new subscribers would exceed the capacity of the system.  The expenditure under this heading is therefore limited by the necessity of maintaining a balanced programme.</P>
    <P>A large part of the expenditure will be on underground cabling schemes in the cities and larger towns but mostly in Dublin.  The Dublin underground has posed one of the most difficult problems with which our engineers have had to deal.  A complete recabling of the whole area has had to be undertaken and contractors have been employed to supplement the Department's own efforts.  However, cable laying and jointing involves highly skilled work and takes a considerable amount of time.  The main scheme has now been under way since 1954 and although it has been more than half completed, much still remains to be done, particularly in outlying suburban areas.  Even if there were no financial difficulties it would be a considerable <Col N="27" /> time before all areas could be reached, but the work will now take longer to complete because the necessity of keeping expenditure within certain limits compels us to reduce the amount of underground relief work which is at present being carried out.</P>
    <P>Outside the larger centres, underground difficulties are not so serious but the capital cost of long rural lines per subscriber is disproportionately high and it may be necessary to restrict the amount of work of this kind which is undertaken.  The number of new subscribers' lines connected is not expected to show any great variation from the numbers connected in former years but in view of the rising demand for service a bigger waiting list can hardly be avoided.</P>
    <P>In short, the £6,000,000 will be used to meet all essential needs, to give a reasonable standard of service and to provide for a reasonable measure of development including the installation of approximately the same number of new subscribers' telephones as we have been installing in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not think the House will have any hesitation in providing more money for telephone development.  It is money well spent and, while I am sorry that more funds cannot be made available for the purpose, we in the Post Office cannot expect to be unaffected by the difficult financial situation in which the country finds itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering if it is fair to ask the Minister&mdash;obviously, I do not like to spring a question on him to which he can find no easy reply &mdash;before we begin this debate if he could tell me how much he would like to have spent instead of the £6,000,000? What is the optimum amount he would like to have spent?  Is it possible for him to give us that figure before we commence the debate?  I take it the Minister is not able to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are supporting this Bill in order to keep telephone development going and because we realise the vital necessity for an improvement in the whole of the telephone services of this country, but I think that the Minister <Col N="28" /> has been persuaded by his colleagues on an entirely wrong basis to restrict development.  When we hear that an absolutely modern function of development in our society is to be restricted for capital, because of capital shortage, I think it is a most short-sighted attitude.  One might as well have said: &ldquo;We will prevent steam engines coming into this country because they cost so much&rdquo; or, &ldquo;We will prevent radio development beginning in this country because it costs so much.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in all too-dulcet terms, has been pleading for more efficiency in industry and more efficiency in distribution.  He has been pleading for greater output.  Greater output and greater efficiency all need the enlivening of the mind; they all need quicker methods of thought; they all need the application of the maximum number of new ideas in connection with every kind of electrical and other techniques.  It seems to us that it is an entirely backwoods conception to restrain development in regard to a modern communication device.  The Government must surely be aware that if they mean anything but mere platitudes in talking about a reduction of costs, and increases in efficiency, they mean a multitude, thousands upon thousands, of individual decisions to increase efficiency and to reduce costs; individual decisions affecting the distribution of commodities throughout the country; individual decisions reducing the costs of making decisions, of sending messages, of getting machinery repaired, of getting goods distributed and of getting goods manufactured.</P>
    <P>An increase in efficiency means, as I have said, a change in mentality, one for which the Government itself should give a lead because the telephone service is one of many forms of communication which are absolutely essential attributes of the quickening which we need in this country.  The Minister so far, because of the backlog of telephone work done since the war, has never yet been compelled to advertise the telephone service, and so he has not been concerned to collect all the facts, which could be to his hand, to show the reduction in costs effected when a person takes a telephone, <Col N="29" /> that despite whatever rental is paid and in spite of the cost, for a huge modern community the telephone becomes an absolutely essential economy in costs, an essential attribute of increased production and of more economic distribution.</P>
    <P>Even if you take into account purely the whole question of repairs, or servicing or delivery of goods, the telephone enters more and more into the picture.  Quite apart from that, there is another factor to be considered.  The telephone service is helping to pay for the postal and telegraph services and as far as I can gather during the last five years the postal and telegraph service lost over £1,500,000 between 1953 and 1956 and the telephone service contributed £480,000 to offset that loss. In every year the telephone service produces a profit.  In every year the taxpayer, as a result, is saved some of the burden of taxation involved in making the three services, as a whole, pay.  I have always fought for the principle that the whole of the three services should be self-supporting.  The fact that they lose money is one example of the appalling atmosphere of sentimentalism in which we have lived in this country since the war.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, wants to make the three services pay as best he can and has imposed some very heavy charges on the community in order to do so.  These charges, while heavy, will in fact relieve the taxpayers by the amount the deficit decreases, and everybody has to be aware of the fact that they do pay taxes, whatever the fraction is, in income-tax in order to discharge whatever the remaining net deficit may be at the end of the year's operation.  But if the telephone service is to make more profits there can be no real progress so far as capital development is concerned.</P>
    <P>Capital development in a case of crisis of this kind might well be applied in the fullest possible measure to get the greatest possible increase in revenue for the telegraph service.  It also might be applied to assist production and distribution in so far as they need any priority in the supplying of trunk circuits or telephone instruments, but as the Minister knows, the telephone service is exactly like <Col N="30" /> smoking cigarettes because the cigarette habit is a snowballing process, and to arrest it midway seems to be very unwise and likely to defeat the very desire of the Minister to avoid having to impose higher taxation by restricting the process of development and so quite possibly making the telephone service lop-sided in one direction or another, so that normal increase in revenues will not take place.</P>
    <P>The Government have apparently decided to attack a modern communication principle in their difficulty in finding capital for development. They have also decided, apparently, to take the risk of losing the normal growth of profit on the telephone service which assists them in balancing their budget.  It seems to me to be a very short-sighted policy and I note from the Minister's speech that he himself can have no very great enthusiasm for it.  He merely spoke in very polite tones of his regret that enough capital had not been made available.  I am well aware of the Minister's difficulties and of the fact that he is but one of several persons in the Cabinet.  I am well aware that he has to fight a difficult corner, but I feel, speaking from the point of view of the development of a country as a whole, we surely ought not to impede modern communication of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that money has to be found for more essential things, but surely the Government should at least consider at the present time that, unless they encourage a greater efficiency, unless they encourage greater production, unless they encourage the use of modern devices, they will not be able to get the sort of private productivity operating here which will enable them to find the capital for things like housing and all the other social services.  In other words, the Minister may quite easily be depriving the country of various forms of improvement in the future because of an attitude towards a modern technique which seems to me to be over-restrictive and overconservative.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there may be an absolute capital difficulty; there may be a position in which, at least <Col N="31" /> for the moment, it would be impossible for the Minister to plead for the maximum amount of capital he requires.  I do not want to pretend that there are not these capital difficulties.  I do not want to over-exaggerate what I am saying by implying that the Minister now, in this very year, could possibly secure the full amount of capital which he would like to have spent in the next 12 months.  But, when I see a Capital Bill before the House in which he mentions a total sum of £6,000,000 and clearly implies that the total sum is less than he would like to have spent, I cannot help feeling that that is too pessimistic an attitude.  Even if for the present year capital may have to be restricted, surely we are not going to live in an atmosphere of capital-deficiency gloom for four years.  Surely, at least, the Minister would have been permitted by the Government to have said: &ldquo;Well, this year we cannot say how much we will find for capital, but here is a Bill and here is a sum, not £6,000,000, but £8,000,000 and we hope that, either in the second, or third or fourth year, the great volume of capital will come for this new form of communication technique.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the Government might have been able to say that with all the more force when they know that this country has one of the lowest telephone densities in Europe.  I do not know what the figures are now and I am afraid that among the many questions I asked the Minister I did not ask him this particular one.  The figure at the end of the last Government's term of office was that there were roughly four telephones to every 100 people. That was the level in Italy and the next figure, for France, was something like six and then you went straight away up to the 16, 20 and 25 mark in the case of all the northern European countries.</P>
    <P>Telephone consciousness is low in this country because we have not had that drive towards greater productivity, greater modernisation, greater use of scientific methods which should have been the case ever since the last war ended and, to my mind, to restrict the growth of telephone consciousness <Col N="32" /> is to restrict the growth of the kind of mentality we need if we are to get over our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is no use my taking an exaggerated point of view.  I am aware of the Minister's immediate difficulties, but what we do not like is the fact that there is implied in his speech a continuing restriction.  If the Minister can tell us that the £6,000,000 could possibly be increased by another Capital Bill in the second, third or fourth year, if the Minister can tell us that he has not been told of any essential restriction in capital in the year 1957, that would be good news to us, because, according to his own statement, a small amount of money has been held over from the previous capital sum made available under the last Telephone Bill and it may be that he could have some restriction this year and that next year he could then proceed again at full blast.  So I hope the Minister in his reply will tell us whether it is possible that the decision to restrict capital could be modified at any time by the present Government and that he would then be in a position to marshal his capital and go ahead and to allow the telephone service to snowball at the pace at which all such devices should snowball in the modern world and in the modern community.</P>
    <P>Having made some general observations, I should like to say a few more things in regard to the details of telephone development.  I asked the Minister some questions, which I deliberately intended to be helpful to him, in connection with postal, telegraph and telephone development, so that the public could be enlightened as to the difficulties faced by the telephone service in helping to keep the other two services going.  One of the questions I asked was concerned with the total staff.  I think that, in connection with this Telephone Capital Bill, we should note that the staffs of the postal and telegraph services have increased by only some 3,000 people since 1947, although there has been a very big increase in the number of postal items sent through the post of 33? per cent. for the same period, and that the total engineering staff of the telephone service has increased by 150 <Col N="33" /> persons since 1954 and had increased by 291 from 1951 to 1954.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the difficulty of getting staff.  I was well aware of that difficulty in my time and we were doing our utmost to try to obtain better staff, first of all, by improving the arrangements for technical teaching and by making arrangements for taking students from the various technical schools and enabling them to go through a further course of training when they had joined the telephone service, and next we were doing our best to encourage the universities to improve their electronic equipment and to do everything they could to increase the number of students who would come forward to take the B.E. degree.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the problem is still with the Minister.  I do not like to see that small increase of staff in the engineering service.  I am glad to see the small increase of staff in what might be called the administrative carrying service, because it indicates efficiency. In connection with the engineering service, that very small increase of staff indicates that apparently the Minister has not yet been able to solve the problem of finding staff and I wonder whether he will not have to do more in the direction of breaking away from the stranglehold of Civil Service control of salary levels; I wonder whether he has been doing his utmost in that respect.  I should like to ask him, now that he is going to find more capital, even though it is a restricted amount, whether he sees any solution to the problem and why it should be that, nine years after the war, although the telephone service makes a profit, although the telephone service is snowballing, something in the way of staff conditions enables electronic industries in England and in this country to take staff from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and also prevents staff going to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and that even applies in the case of advertisements that have been inserted in previous years and that possibly are being inserted at the present time inviting persons of other than Irish nationality to become assistant electrical engineers.  Would the Minister tell us <Col N="34" /> what his current difficulties are and whether there is a solution to the problem?</P>
    <P>It seems a great pity that we have this annual output of engineers from University College Dublin, and that there are the demands of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and the telephone service and that the telephone service lacks from year to year at least from 12 to 15 new graduate engineers and also, as far as I can gather, lacks technical staff from the technical college level.  I should like to ask the Minister what hope he has of spending economically and efficiently even the money he is proposing to spend, unless he can get over that difficulty which, I admit, is a very serious one.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that other countries had arrears in respect of subscribers waiting for service. In a country that has, as I have said, a comparatively low telephone consciousness as compared with Great Britain, I should like to feel that that should be no excuse for delay in joining subscribers' lines.  As the Minister is aware, in the two years previous to his taking office, there was a very rapid overtake.  He has been overtaking the position, I notice from figures which he supplied in a reply to a parliamentary question but, nevertheless, at the end of it all, there are still some, I think, 4,000 subscribers waiting for service, including quite a number whose applications have been outstanding for over two years.  I do not think that capital should be restricted for any reasons in the direction of not encouraging subscribers to join the telephone service.  People do become discouraged at having to wait so long and it is not an incentive to people to take the telephone service if they have to wait. Having regard to all the new housing that is being done, it is extremely essential that we catch up on these arrears if we are to spend this capital.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister what the position is with regard to areas where there are now no appreciable delays in service but where it would appear that the number of calls made has not yet sufficiently increased to cover the huge increase in capital <Col N="35" /> and maintenance costs.  I noticed that the interest on capital and the annual maintenance costs increased from 1947 to 1955 by 65 per cent.  I want to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the revenue from the telephone service has grown proportionately and is likely to grow proportionately so that that element of maintenance and capital will not become an ever-increasing burden upon the service.</P>
    <P>Further I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that, without advertising or any other means of publicity, the telephone service in the areas where there are no delays is being used to the maximum or whether the existing subscribers are being charged too much under the new charges.  Is he satisfied that the whole of the complexes of telephone charges in relation to annual capital charges for maintenance are now properly related to each other so that the service can progress in an ever more profitable way?  This is a highly technical matter and it is very difficult to go into it completely but from the questions I asked the Minister I rather gathered the impression that capital and maintenance charges were growing pretty quickly and that whatever is done with the capital now being voted by the Dáil, a very big effort should be made to increase telephone call revenue so as to catch up.  No doubt the Minister will be able to tell us something about that.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister is in difficulties in regard to securing capital, I think it is a good thing to mention new ideas in the House.  We have a terrific lack of productivity since 1947. Recently we had a statement made by an eminent economist that the total increase of production per head since 1949 is only 7 per cent. and in the rest of Europe it is 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>We can afford to speculate a bit. We can afford to talk about things which we might have whispered only a few years ago.  I wonder whether it might not be a good thing to have a more independent basis even if the officers of the telephone service had to hire or use the services of the postal and telegraph staff for many purposes. <Col N="36" /> I was beginning to wonder whether we might not benefit more from some further freedom and whether the service might not be more efficient than at the moment, if there were greater freedom.  All these matters should now be examined.  We have evidence of torpidity since 1949.  I hope the Minister will consider all these matters while he is spending this money.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, there was an independent industrial consultant appointed to the engineering service during the period of office of the last Government.  The staff showed the same helpful, constructive attitude that the staffs of any company do who believe in efficiency and who are reasonably efficient.  It is only the really bad companies who resent the presence of a specialist industrial consultant.  I understand that that consultant remained in the telephone service until very recently.</P>
    <P>In the first two years of his office many of his proposals were accepted with alacrity by the officers of the Department in the same way as his proposals were accepted by some private companies with whom he worked most successfully before he came to the telephone service.  I understand that since then most of his proposals have been accepted and that there have been virtually, with very few exceptions, no difficulties with the staffs of unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things proposed was that the staffs of the telephone service, even though it is the Civil Service, should be given incentive bonuses.  If the staffs of private telephone manufacturing companies and private cabling companies can earn more money on a basis agreed to by their trade unions, why should not the telephone service be able to do so? The Minister will be able to make this capital go further if he is able to persuade the Minister for Finance, who longs to reduce the numbers of persons required for the Civil Service, that in this case the number should be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> The Minister for Finance says he is full of ideas about improving the efficiency of the Civil Service.  I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will accept the scheme in which the Civil Service will get away from the tradition of having no incentive bonuses for anything.  In this way we would get more work done with the full consent of the unions.  The incentive bonus scheme is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of a restriction in the number of automatic exchanges which will now replace the old type of manual exchange.  I would ask the Minister whether that is one of the restrictions that will be imposed on him as a result of the difficulties of getting capital.  He ought to be a little bit more explicit about that. Before the Minister assumed his position, there had been an examination of that whole matter, even without there being any unreasonable restriction of capital.</P>
    <P>Take an automatic exchange such as Dundalk, for example, and examine the increase in the number of new local subscribers as a result of their being able to dial one another.  Take the number of new local calls made and then make a comparison with a town like Drogheda, where the exchange has not been improved.  When the service improved the total number of new local subscriber costs and trunk costs seemed to be increasing at the same time.  In Dundalk, where a large sum of money was spent in supplying an automatic exchange, the annual capital figure required to amortise the cost of the exchange and the increase in maintenance involved, if there was any, was a greater sum than any economy made.  Accordingly, it was decided that some of these exchanges should not be built until the whole of a large area could be automatised and until all the outlying satellite exchanges could be joined to one another and to the main exchange. Only when there was a given density would it pay.  It might be better to wait and do a much bigger job which would prove more economic in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to indicate that <Col N="38" /> one of the economies he is going to make is in relation to the question of going ahead with those kinds of exchanges.  I should like to know what is the present view in regard to that matter?  I am referring to the difficulties to be faced with by his officers in respect of the larger exchanges, including satellite exchanges worked automatically, and the better method of carrying out the job. I am not speaking of the very big exchanges such as Limerick, Sligo and Galway, where they are good enough, but I am speaking of the exchanges in towns of 1,500 to 4,000 people.  There does not seem to be much point in spending a lot of money if, in fact, there are not any savings and so long as the trunk service is good, the exchange is working reasonably efficiently and the conditions for the workers are reasonably satisfactory.  As the Minister knows, there have had to be improvements in exchanges for the sake of providing proper conditions for girls, who in some places are working in very dark conditions, and in some places where there have been outbreaks of illness, which were altogether unjustified according to post office standards.  I am not speaking of changes that will take place for those reasons but changes where those factors do not operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the progress that had been made since 1950.  I would like to say at this point, as the Minister well knows, that the tremendous jump in telephone development that took place between 1951 and 1953, as compared with the three previous years, gave him a tremendous head start, so to speak, and the increase in work performed by a staff which increased only 16 per cent. during the period&mdash;many of the increases were very much larger than that&mdash;was extremely startling.  The increase in the mileage of trunk circuits provided, for instance, was 376 per cent. between 1951 and 1953; the number of kiosks erected increased by 130 per cent.; the number of automatic exchanges opened increased by 33 per cent., and the number of exchanges extended increased by 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those increases apply to the whole <Col N="39" /> of the development of the telephone service during that period.  I have noticed that the present Minister has not been able to keep up the rate of increase.  I dare say that might not have been possible because the rate of increase was very startling, and the corresponding figures for 1953 to 1955 show a decrease in the rate of activity. I do not know what the reason for that is but, as I have said, I hope it is not due to a restriction of capital and I hope above all that it is not due to the fact that the Minister is now finding it even more difficult than I did to get staff.</P>
    <P>The pace of the increase has not been the same.  I hope that the Minister, who has a most able staff, including a great number of young men, will not allow himself to be ballyragged by his colleagues and that he will put the telephone services, along with agriculture, along with industrial development, along with anything that quickens people's minds and gives them new ideas about industrial methods; I hope he will insist on pushing it, pushing it and pushing it again or we will never get out of the mess we are in this country.</P>

I find myself in somewhat the same position as Deputy Childers in that I am disappointed and very sorry at the attempt that I see here to reduce our capital development programme in general.  There was a great deal of discussion in this House, and there is a great deal of discussion outside it at the moment, in connection with the cost of Government services and Government administration.  I think all sides of this House are unanimous that the cost of Government should be reduced, but it is a different thing when we find that the Government and the Cabinet interpret that feeling in the sense that they feel it is wise and desirable to apply the axe to the capital development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been various rumours <Col N="40" /> floating about in recent weeks that the Cabinet have decided, in view of the tight position with regard to money generally, to cut drastically our capital development programme in many spheres.  Here we find the first practical proof that there are some grounds for the truth of that particular rumour.  Deputy Childers asked the Minister&mdash;very naively, I think&mdash; could he say what he would feel he would be able to spend if he were allowed to increase the actual amount under this Bill.  I have no doubt but that the Minister could spend, and spend efficiently and well, another £2,500,000 or possibly £3,000,000 under this particular heading of telephone capital development.</P>
    <P>If we take that figure of £2,500,000 or £3,000,000, we find it corresponds very closely with the suggestion abroad that it is the Government's intention to reduce the capital development programme by approximately 30 per cent. for the coming year.  Let us take this fact into consideration.  The telephone service is, to my mind and to my knowledge, one of the few paying services in this State.  It pays its way and it makes a profit.  The general criticism of Government services is that they are not profit-making and that they have to be subsidised.  We find here in regard to one service that is able to pay its way and make a profit that the Government have decided to slow up its development programme. To my mind that is anything but a sensible approach for the Minister or for the Government to take.</P>
    <P>The idea has been advanced here, and explained by Deputy Childers, that the demand in recent years for telephone services has grown and has snowballed.  People are beginning to realise that, in this age of competition and speed, it is essential that communications be of the most efficient nature.  If we are to develop economically and if we are to expand agriculture in order to exist, we must have two things run efficiently: transport and communications.  Our transport system is in a bad way at the moment.  Are we now to bring the communications system to the same level as the transport system?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> The demand is there.  The demand for telephone services is growing daily in the rural areas, and it is in the rural areas that the Minister should meet the demand, or he should at least give priority to those areas.  I had many disputes with his predecessor on this question of priority with regard to telephone installations, and I am still not convinced that a raw deal was not given to the rural areas in connection with this very essential service.  As far as I can see, from the figures given by the Minister here, the cities, and in particular Dublin City, have got the biggest share and will get the biggest share in the future in regard to the money spent.  The economic process, when applied to the telephone service, does not work out mathematically.  We are told that the more people who take such services as telephones and rural electrification, the less danger there would be of an increase in the cost of these services.  As far as I can see, in recent years, in spite of the fact that you have a tremendous demand for more telephones, the cost of the service seems to go up hand in hand with that demand.</P>
    <P>Surely there is something wrong there.  It is most disheartening.  Perhaps, in justification, the Minister will say that at least we are able to keep our heads above water in this Department. He may say the service is paying for itself.  If that is the argument he will offer, I suggest he should go ahead full steam with the programme to ensure that by getting more people to avail of the service the cost will come down.  The demand is there.  By meeting that demand, we would be increasing the profit to the State as a whole and, at the same time, giving more efficient service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The day of doing business by telegram and letter is gone.  The quickest and most efficient method is the telephone, and that being the case, there should be no slowing down in that development. It is not a question of having to tell the House that in ten or 15 years the service will pay for itself, because the service is paying for itself at the moment.  Why disturb that situation?  That, mind you, is not <Col N="42" /> the whole picture.  The Minister disclosed in the course of his opening remarks that the position would be reached during the year where a deterioration was likely to occur in some areas.  I want the Minister to tell us now the areas involved; I want him to let us know where those areas are.  Is Dublin the main area where this deterioration will occur or will it apply to rural areas which are already getting the knife?</P>
    <P>It is bad enough to have people waiting for long periods to make trunk calls without having to wait still longer.  This morning I tried to make a trunk call.  The distance was 12 miles.  I had to wait 25 minutes.  I was lucky to get the call through even then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have made my call as quickly had I gone off in my car but I was in such a temper that I might have killed somebody on the road.  The Minister said there was an increase of 46 per cent. in the turnover with regard to trunk calls.  That is a tremendous figure and surely we should back the Minister and ensure that an increase of that nature is kept up.  As far as I am concerned, I am only too willing to give the Minister my vocal assistance in the House and outside of it to ensure that the axe is not wielded on a service that is paying its way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he believes there will be no unemployment as a result of this reduction.  My reply to that is there is bound to be.  There will be unemployment wherever these capital services are reduced.  We know that a <Col N="43" /> reduction of employment in any service has a snowballing effect.  We want to ensure that there is no disemployment in this service.  If you knocked ten people out of work in one line of business it is very hard to check what are the final figures that will be disemployed as a result of those ten dismissals.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I want to make and it is in reference to the salaries of staff.  There is still difficulty in regard to the recruitment of technical and engineering staff.  As far as I am concerned, the technicians and engineers in the Department are excellent.  The danger I see is that the Post Office service will not be able to hold on to these men, apart altogether from the question of getting new men into the service.  We must be realistic on this question.  We have to compete with firms outside.  We must compete with attractive salaries and conditions across the water and if we wish genuinely to compete with those conditions and salaries offered outside there is only one way to do so and that is to raise the emoluments and salaries of those whom we wish to attract.  There will not be any difficulty whatever in getting suitable material for the technical posts open if proper salaries are paid to these people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the administrative end of the question, one of the best means of getting efficient service in the telephone system is to pay those we already have a living wage.  I want to refer in particular to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses in rural areas, and hope the Minister will be able to see his way to improving the lot of those administrative officers.  They give long and weary hours in the service of the State and are paid only scandalous rates of pay.  If their conditions were improved, the efficiency of that service would improve a hundredfold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the criticism of the reduced amount asked for in this Bill is unnecessary.  Let us look into the past history of this programme of the provision of telephones and we will find that in the 30 years from 1922 to <Col N="44" /> 1952 only £16,000,000 was provided.  In the five years from 1951 to the present time, £8,000,000 was provided.  Accordingly, we can see that since 1948, and since the war, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have done a very big job in the provision of a telephone network all over the country at considerable expense.</P>
      <P>The figure of £8,000,000 was provided on the last occasion on which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs introduced a Telephone Capital Bill. He brought in that Bill after there had been considerable pressure and at a time when there was a very long waiting list and backlog, when the Minister was trying to deal with people who had been many years on a waiting list for telephones.  There is still a long waiting list, but the people are not so long waiting.  When that Bill was introduced previously there was very great pressure and £8,000,000 had to be provided.  That appeared to be a figure that would fairly meet the pressure brought to bear by the people who had been so long waiting.</P>
      <P>The pressure came from people who not alone required the service of telephones but who also required exchanges through which those telephones could be provided.  The figure of £8,000,000 included a sum for the provision of exchanges, so that now an increased number of subscribers can be catered for.  The £6,000,000 provided in this Bill is for a period of four years. That will ensure that £1,500,000 will be spent per annum in the extension of the telephone service.  This will involve the provision of still more exchanges.  The point I want to make is that £1,250,000 has already been spent on the provision of exchanges which need not be provided again and through which a very large number of private subscribers can get the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill intends to provide a further large number of exchanges; in fact, it proposes to provide nearly the same number of exchanges as have already been provided, according to the amount of money allocated.  That will mean that, through those exchanges, we can then get a very large number of subscribers.  The main thing is the provision of these exchanges <Col N="45" /> through which the services can be channelled.  I am satisfied, in the circumstances, that £6,000,000 for the coming four years will be equal to the £8,000,000 provided in the previous four years because we now have exchanges &mdash;through the expenditure of the previous £8,000,000&mdash;which were not there previously and for which much of the £6,000,000 will not be required.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the Minister's statement the considerable amount of progress which has taken place, especially since the telephone service is providing substantial revenue.  Of course the question of the repayment of the capital arises.  Deputy McQuillan raised the question of a short trunk call which he wanted to make.  I should like to confirm that these short trunk calls are very unsatisfactory. It is much easier to get calls to Cork, Limerick or Belfast than it is to get a call through to a point 20 miles outside the city.  I particularly wish to speak about Rush, Lusk and Skerries; Balbriggan, too, is limited in the matter of the intake of calls.  These places are a disgrace because people who are paying a substantial telephone rental in these areas are not getting the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>A subscriber from Skerries will come into Dublin and will ask for a telephone number in Skerries, which is his home.  He will be told that there is no reply from his number or that there is a delay of perhaps half an hour.  He may be told that his telephone appears to be out of order.  He may have used that telephone before he came into Dublin, but as soon as he comes into Dublin and tries to get into contact with his own home, this is the kind of reply he gets.  He is able to say that his telephone was working that morning and that there is somebody at the other end ready to answer it. I doubt if there is any district in the whole of Ireland, having regard to the proportion of subscribers, from which more complaints come in than come from Skerries, Rush and Lusk.  I am glad that attempts are being made to make a dial system available for these three places, similar to the system in Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock and other places nearer the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> I find it difficult to understand why telephone calls from Dublin to Cork and Limerick can be obtained almost immediately while there is indefinite and very long delay in the case of places 20 or 30 miles from the city.  I hope that this proposal will ensure that subscribers in those areas will get satisfaction.  I think that subscribers who are greater distances away are able to get better service.  I know of many places where private subscribers have increased in numbers very rapidly and where the local exchanges are incapable of dealing with the volume of calls.  What is really needed is an extra line or two, an extra trunk line which will ensure that the large number of calls can be catered for.</P>
    <P>I feel that the remarks of Deputy Childers, so far as the smaller amount of capital is concerned, are not justified. I feel that the £6,000,000 asked for in this Bill will give as much, to a greater number of people as the previous £8,000,000, or even more, service. That amount was spent in laying, if you like, the foundations in the matter of providing exchanges which previously did not exist, so that a very large number of subscribers could be catered for.  This Bill is going to spend almost the same amount in the provision of further exchanges, and, like the rolling snowball, the extra amount of money which is to be spent on these exchanges will result in a very much greater number of subscribers being able to avail of the services and so become a source of very valuable revenue to the Post Office.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is no reason for the House to worry about the fact that the amount of £6,000,000 asked for on this occasion does not equal the amount previously asked for.  We can remember the conditions which existed before the previous £8,000,000 was asked for and the very large number of people who wanted service and who now have it.  A large number still want service and will avail of it when these facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that here in Dublin City there is an unsatisfactory position for a great number of subscribers because, when they want to get a telephone, they are told that the <Col N="47" /> cable is not capable of taking extra subscribers and that they will have to wait until a cable is provided.  It seems from the engineering point of view, in any case, that especially in the outer districts of Dublin City, a very vigorous programme of replacing cables or of providing a better cable intake is necessary immediately.  It is no consolation for people in these outer portions of the city to be told that they cannot get a telephone until the new cable is laid.  Probably the cable-laying in various parts of the city may take a very long time to complete, but if efforts were made to provide the cables very quickly in those extended areas, where there are large populations, the expenditure would be justified by the very large numbers of subscribers who would immediately come in.</P>
    <P>I want to compare that problem with the problem of bringing telephone services long distances down the country from local exchanges.  We know that bringing telephone wires and poles for long distances out through the country and connecting them up with local exchanges involves a considerable amount of expense and the revenue from that expenditure is not nearly so great as the revenue that would become available if we pursued as quickly and as vigorously as possible a programme of laying cables in the outer areas of Dublin City where there is a dense population.  Through such a programme, a large number of subscribers could get a service within a reasonable time, instead of being told that they must wait indefinitely until a cable is laid in the area, which would enable subscribers to get that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he asked that all the people in Dublin who desire to have telephones installed be connected in a hurry, with no regard for the rural dwellers.  I do not contribute to that point of view.  As Deputy <Col N="48" /> McQuillan put it, the rural areas are most in need of a telephone service. If the citizens of Dublin have no telephones in their own houses, almost invariably they have a telephone next door or a few doors away or the public telephone kiosk is very convenient. While I do not begrudge them the benefits of an efficient telephone service, I feel the rural areas should get prior consideration.  I am sure also that the Minister will not be swayed by what Deputy Rooney has said in that regard and that, being a rural Deputy himself, he fully appreciates the difficulties of people living in a rural area.</P>
      <P>We have undoubtedly made progress, if rather slowly, for some years past in the matter of installing telephones both in the rural areas and in the city.  There are many telephone installations in the country which have brought great benefits to the rural community.  There is much leeway to be made up and you still find in some rural areas that people are eight, ten or more miles away from a telephone. These matters should be looked into as early as possible.</P>
      <P>An increased amount of money should, if possible, be made available for the telephone service.  The telephone is being used more extensively to-day than every before.  So far as business people are concerned, it is of the greatest importance that they should have telephones installed.  In disposing of goods and transacting business quickly, where money may be made or lost, it is absolutely necessary that the installation of telephones be continued with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my experience, having had a telephone installed for a long number of years, that we have a great number of breakdowns in this country, particularly in the West of Ireland.  Yesterday I tried to phone Swinford which is seven miles away.  It took 35 minutes before the call was put through and I was told by the Post Office people it was due to breakdowns.  I tried later in the evening and it took something like 25 or 30 minutes.  That is a common occurrence in my part of the country and the Post Office service van is regularly <Col N="49" /> on the road trying to keep lines and telephones in working order.</P>
    <P>Whether these breakdowns occur in the city I do not know, but I believe it is due to the policy pursued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for a long number of years, of purchasing secondhand materials from Great Britain and elsewhere, instead of buying or manufacturing completely new instruments and materials.  We all appreciate that if we buy a secondhand motor car it is not as dependable as a new car.  We cannot be always sure when we go out in the morning whether it will start or not and it is in the garage very often for repairs.  It is bad economy in the long run to buy secondhand telephonic equipment from foreign countries for installation here. I believe it is the main reason why we, in the West of Ireland particularly, have that disadvantage of frequent breakdowns.  A breakdown can be very serious at times.  A telephone might be required to summon a priest, a doctor or an ambulance.  If it is out of order it can have very serious consequences, especially in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It also seems to be the practice of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to send that type of scrap to the country.  I have noticed many times in Dublin City more modern instruments installed.  They look newer and in better condition.  I understand that the department for servicing such instruments is centred in Dublin.  You would think, therefore, that they would keep the instruments that are in poor condition convenient to the centre where repairs can be carried out expeditiously rather than send them to the country.  That would avoid the necessity of transporting such equipment for repair from the rural areas to Dublin, which causes great delay.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's Department is pursuing this policy of buying secondhand material for the country, I would ask the Minister to discontinue it as early as possible.  I fully appreciate that the war was a serious handicap to telephone installation work generally. I also appreciate the point stressed by Deputy Childers, the difficulty of providing properly trained <Col N="50" /> staffs.  That was a big problem during the war and is still a big problem for the reason that outside this country, due to war conditions, our people who took up telephone work were able to command higher rates of pay and gain more experience than at home.  It was, therefore, quite difficult to attract people into the service at home and I am afraid that, generally speaking, we have not the best technical staff for that reason.  I am quite prepared to concede that we have some very competent people employed but in some instances I am afraid we have been obliged to make do, to take people into the service who have not the technical knowledge and the technical knowhow which they have in other countries.  Our best people have emigrated and have gone into the telephone service in other countries.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more kiosks installed on country roads to form a connecting link with nearby towns.  It is regrettable that there should be so many accidents on our roads, accidents in which lives are often lost.  Sometimes those involved in such accidents have to travel seven or eight miles before they reach a telephone.  It would be a paying proposition for the Department to install more kiosks between towns to afford motorists and the rural community in general a better means of telephonic communication for the purpose of, perhaps, sending for doctors or ambulances should accidents occur.  Indeed, there is no reason why a better telephone service should not be provided for the people who live in the country.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the badly paid staffs, and to the fact that sub-postmasters are not receiving enough remuneration.  We all know that, when a sub-post office becomes vacant, there are many applicants.</P>

      <P>The reason there are so many applicants is that a sub-post office tends to increase business in a business premises.  There is quite a lot of talk from time to time about such appointments, I admit.  In connection with the young girls and boys <Col N="51" /> who are employed on the telephone service in the rural areas, I have been told by some of them that they receive as little as £1 or 30/- per week from their employers.  Having regard to the present cost of living and the standards these people are expected to maintain, that is a scandalous state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Childers, he addressed himself to that question, too.  Certainly Deputy McQuillan dealt with it.  He referred to remuneration and, in particular, he referred to sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  In no other type of employment to-day could one get people to work for such low wages. It is wrong that they should be <Col N="52" /> expected to work for such low wages. It is more than wrong when one remembers that in these rural exchanges there is a round-the-clock service and some of these young boys and girls are expected to get up any hour of the night and answer telephone calls.  If they refuse, they will be dismissed.</P>
      <P>That situation definitely exists.  I have had occasion to refer to it before. It still continues.  It is certainly wrong and it is grossly unfair.  These boys and girls should have the normal eight-hour day.  Their work is responsible work.  Successive Governments have failed to do anything to remedy that position.  These people are public servants.  They are expected to be in good humour, no matter who is out of humour or in humour.  Something should be done for them, and I am asking the Minister now to take the necessary steps to ensure that they will be paid a proper wage as soon as possible and given proper working hours.  I would not be in order in dealing with the question of living conditions.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  If the Minister does nothing more than ensure that these people are given proper wages and proper hours, it will be something which will stand to his credit for many a long year.  I think it would be a worthwhile step on his part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are approximately 4,000 subscribers on the waiting list.  It will take some time to get round to providing telephones for all these people.  In view of the fact that the telephone service is a paying service, the Department is losing by its failure to connect up these 4,000 subscribers.  Some of these have been waiting for a year; some have been waiting for two years.  I appeal to the Minister to connect up these people as soon as possible, particularly the applicants in rural areas.  Two years is a long time to wait and it may well happen, as Deputy Childers said, that they will get tired waiting, with consequential <Col N="53" /> loss to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest dangers I see is that telephones will be priced out of popular demand.  A number of speakers have adverted to the fact that the telephone service pays its way.  Yet, we have the position that on 1st July we had very steep increases in the cost of telephone calls.  If the telephone service is paying its way, why is it necessary to have these steep increases? Is the telephone service to be used to bolster up some other form of Post Office activity?  If that is not so, why was it necessary to increase telephone charges?</P>
      <P>At the present rate, at the rate operating to-day, the Minister will find that the demand for telephones will be substantially reduced.  If he were to take a census of those who are waiting to become subscribers, I think he would probably find a very substantial drop in that number.  That should not happen in a country where, as Deputy Childers has stated, we have only four telephones per 100 of the population. There is no guarantee that this is the last increase.  It seems to me to be on a par with what happened in the case of rural electrification, when we had the E.S.B. getting money from the public by way of borrowing and now we have an application for a 10 per cent. increase.  I think this is on a par with that.</P>
      <P>While, admittedly, it is necessary to expand this service in order to serve the business community and especially to serve the farming community, we will not do so if we, year after year, do what we have been doing this year, and if we are to have such increases in years to come.  The position will then be that the telephone will become a luxury and only those who find it absolutely necessary will have recourse to the use of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seeing that £6,000,000 will be forthcoming some time before the end of the next four years, I would like to appeal to the Minister to consider the rural areas.  The Minister may have noticed that, in the Six Counties, at strategic <Col N="54" /> points, such as at cross-roads, they have telephone kiosks for the express purpose of serving the farming community. In this country, no matter how hopeful we are, the time when every farmer will have a telephone is still far distant.  For that reason we must try to meet him in some way. I think we should follow the idea adopted in the Six Counties and install public kiosks for the benefit of the farmers in all the rural districts.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the present method of selecting places for the installation of public telephone kiosks is the best.  I understand that, in order to get a telephone kiosk, a town must have a population of 3,500 people. A town of such a population may have an industry, or a number of industries, which are important but I think that the farming industry in a rural area is still more important.  It should be the duty of the Department and the Minister to see that, in the interests of the production drive and of rural social life, there should be no lack of telephone facilities.</P>
    <P>We have not yet reached the stage in which every sub-post office has got a telephone.  Very many sub-post offices have not got them.  I would say that it should be the first objective of the Minister to install a telephone for the use of the public, and especially for the use of the farming community, in every sub-post office in the country.  When that is done, kiosks should be erected at strategic points to serve districts which would not be served by the local sub-post office.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the sub-post office question, I would appeal to the Minister, as other Deputies have done, for better financial treatment for those in charge of them.  I had a case brought to my mind recently in which an office had been switched over from nine o'clock closing, or it might have been seven o'clock closing, to round-the-clock operation, and the extra remuneration which was paid to the local postmaster was 1/5 or 1/7 per day, or it might be per week.  That is the sort of thing that is operating in rural sub-post offices&mdash;for very much extra work, for being on call for 24 <Col N="55" /> hours per day, a few pence are thrown to the sub-postmaster for undertaking the work.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to say on this Bill except to warn the Minister that, whereas Deputy Childers thought that £6,000,000 would not be enough to do the work which is envisaged, I think that if the charges for telephones and telephone calls increase any further, they will be too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The main brunt of the criticism of this Bill has been with regard to the amount sought.  Deputy Childers asked me a fairly straight question as to what I, as Minister, would put forward if I were a free agent.  I will give him a straight answer to that question.  I would probably have put down £8,000,000, as the Deputy himself put down in 1951, as the amount which would be required for five years.  I would have gone on somewhat similar lines to those Deputy Childers followed and I would have invested funds in the telephone service as he did then when telephones were in great demand.</P>
      <P>However, we have to have regard to the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day.  There is a national shortage of money for capital development. I have been Minister for other Departments in which there was need for capital expenditure and, while I might demand the full requirements of the telephone service, I would not like to forget that other forms of national development should get their share of the money available.  I think it would be selfish if we were to go all out 100 per cent. for our needs and requirements to the exclusion of somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are stepping down our projected programme somewhat, there will not be any closing down or slackness in the work.  We will be working at our full capacity and, if times improve, it will be possible to spend the money much more quickly.  It has been suggested that I have been too gloomy in providing for four years of depression. I am hoping that the situation will be much better than that, but I thought it wise and prudent to take the long <Col N="56" /> view and not to anticipate any stepping-up of the programme before that time.  If our circumstances improve, there is nothing to prevent this money being spent in a shorter period than the four years I have mentioned.  We can go right ahead and spend faster but in the beginning it is more prudent, having regard to the shortage of capital, to take a long view.  We are not tied to spending it in the four-year period.  If things improve we can increase the amount first undertaken.  In my opinion, we shall not have any worthwhile disemployment as a result of this measure although there may be some disemployment of casuals.  We should have been employing extra men if we had gone on with our full programme but, with this restricted programme, there is no question of any disemployment except of casuals. However, the extra employment we should have liked to give will have to be postponed and some of the bigger schemes we had in mind will have to be deferred.</P>
    <P>By and large, the service will be continued and we will maintain the standard of service which has already been given.  There is no conflict between urban and rural areas and there will be no such conflict so far as the Department is concerned.  Deputy Rooney mentioned that long lines of communication are uneconomic and that we should concentrate on cabling. Both will have to go hand in hand. Cabling in Dublin has nothing to do with rural servicing and we will continue it to the best of our ability, at the same time attending to the cabling in Dublin, more than 50 per cent. of which has been completed.  We intend to go on with that work but at the same time we will not neglect the requirements of the rural community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers asked if anything is being done to increase revenue in areas in which there has been considerable capital expenditure.  In view of the restriction of capital expenditure generally, the position is that areas which have any margin of plant over and above current requirements will need that margin in full to meet demand in the next few years.  Generally, we do not try to stimulate demand in such areas as we might boost the demand <Col N="57" /> and then be unable to provide the capital to meet it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the employment of technical staff.  That difficulty in the recruitment of technical staff arises from the extra demand for persons with the necessary technical qualifications. With recent developments in the electronic field, it has been difficult to get these people.  You cannot expect to get men with such qualifications without offering them a proper salary. As a result of conciliation agreements, the salary scales have been satisfactorily adjusted and should attract the men required.  I might mention that for some years past non-nationals have not been excluded from these technical posts.  Since we got this conciliation machinery going, and acquired an outlook different from the Civil Service outlook, we have been able to recruit people on lines similar to those of outside concerns.  We could not hope to attract people with the requisite qualifications if we were not able to compete with outside concerns so far as salaries, and so forth, are concerned.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say how long or how short the present capital difficulty will continue.  We are hoping it will last only a short time but we are making provision lest it should be prolonged and that is the reason for providing for a period of four years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney mentioned the conditions in Rush, Lusk and Skerries. We are installing an automatic telephone exchange to serve the Rush-Lusk area and Skerries is due to be converted to automatic working in the coming year.  I hope the difficulties which the Deputy has experienced will be completely wiped out when the new automatic exchanges have been provided. I find it difficult to understand why there should be such delays and I wonder if &ldquo;no replies&rdquo; are fairly general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham says the telephones might be priced out of popular demand.  I think I answered that point in my opening statement.  For many years, the telephone service has, on the whole, been run at a profit but, at the same time, that profit is being almost wiped out because of increased wages and increased costs of materials.  All <Col N="58" /> in all, we are not overcharging or asking for anything in excess of what we have to pay.  The increases have been reasonable.  They were imposed only because we did not want to get into an insolvent position.  We have to pay our way.  There have been two rounds of increases for the staff, as well as increased costs of materials. These factors forced us to raise the charges which were the minimum required to keep our head above water. I do not think these increases will drive the people from the phones.  I have received very few complaints about the increases either from the towns or the country.  Of course, there have been some grouses, but, by and large, I do not think they are considered unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham spoke about consideration for the rural areas.  We have put a telephone in every rural post office in Ireland, except two.  I should be pleased to hear from the Deputy if the figure is more than two. My information is that there are only two sub-offices without a phone and I think they are located in County Mayo. Therefore, if Deputy Cunningham knows of any other sub-post office where there is not a phone, I shall be glad to hear of it.  I think that that was an important step towards encouraging people to use the telephone. Deputy O'Hara mentioned that there are places seven and eight miles from a telephone; they must be very remote and very few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not seven or eight miles apart; generally, they are between three and four miles apart. I should not like to have anybody living seven or eight miles from a telephone.  At very considerable expense, we installed a telephone in each and every one of the sub-offices.  It is my desire that the people in the rural areas should be enabled to keep in touch with the doctor, the clergyman, and the veterinary surgeon.  I will press on with that work.  Our first step was to put a telephone into every sub-post office.  The establishment of <Col N="59" /> kiosks is different.  In rural areas, kiosks are fairly costly to maintain and they are liable to be abused.  We erect them only where there is a reasonable demand for them.  If we erected them at cross-roads I believe they would be used for purposes other than telephoning. However, we are erecting kiosks in places where they are most needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">

      <P>One of the rural difficulties is that, in the evening when nearly all transport ends, the post office closes and then there is no means of getting at the phone.  If it were a kiosk, of course, it would be available all the time.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question raised about the assistants in sub-post offices, they are not really in the employment of the Post Office at all; they are employed by the sub-postmaster. The sub-postmasters themselves have an organisation&mdash;I do not know whether there is any organisation for their employees&mdash;and I can only assume that they are paid on scales comparable with those paid in the shops in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>How do they attract assistants at all then?  However, it is not a matter over which we have control. We merely control the sub-postmaster who employs his own staff and I should be inclined to think that he would have to meet competition from the shops in the vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan was worried about the possibility of unemployment and I think I have answered that.  I do not expect there will be any unemployment created, except among &ldquo;casuals.&rdquo; We will retain the <i>status quo</i>, although we would have done better if we did not have this restriction.  I think I have covered most of the points made, but if I have omitted to reply to any Deputy, I can assure him that all the points raised have been noted for consideration.  I thank the House for the reception given to this Bill, and I give the assurance that, even if the amount is restricted to <Col N="60" /> something less than I would have liked myself, there will be no change so far as we are concerned in working for telephone advancement in both rural and urban areas.  As regards industrial activities, I can say that they will get the priority essential for their success and the decrease in the amount of capital available will not retard industrial progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time, when the Government should set an example of wanting to make for efficiency and wanting to extend the only profitable Government service in existence, the <Col N="61" /> Minister has given us some hope that this capital restriction can be modified at any time.  Otherwise, I would really feel inclined to recommend this side of the House to vote against the Bill. However, he has given us that assurance, and we understand, therefore, that the money can be spent more quickly, that the sum of £6,000,000 mentioned in this section of the Bill can be spent more quickly.  We understand that the Department will not be prevented from planning as though the money could be spent more quickly, and that the Minister will not be placed in the position a year from now of being told that the capital stringency has become less and that the Government has a changed point of view in regard to the allocation of capital and then find that his staff is unable to replan the capital work or unable to speed up plans, because, as the Minister knows, planning for telephone networks is a long-term business.</P>
      <P>Some of the improvements can be effected within nine or 12 months, once a decision is taken, but many of them require two years' notice, and I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that, if the money becomes available later and he is in a position to speed up the work, his officers will be able to speed it up for him before the Telephone Act actually expires, before the four years are up.</P>
      <P>I should like to say in connection with this section that this £6,000,000 will not be spent well if the Minister is forced to have the attitude of an over-conservative 19th century company director, if he is forced to adopt the attitude of Deputy Rooney who talked just like a 19th century business director about being cautious and who said: &ldquo;I think enough money is being spent,&rdquo; when the Minister knows perfectly well that, unless the Government sets the example of the modern type of business which, seeing difficulties, produces a better product, puts it in a better package and sells more of it against mounting depression, we will never get out of our difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has £6,000,000 to spend under this Bill, and if he is constantly to be restricted by his colleagues so <Col N="62" /> that he is scared in regard to how he is going to spend the money, it will affect not only the profitability of the telephone service, but it will have an undoubted effect on the morale of the staff.  The Minister has some very able young engineers, with some of whom I have had the pleasure of working&mdash;I include the chief engineer&mdash; and it is appalling for young and brilliant men to live in an atmosphere of restriction in connection with a modern scientific communication device and it is absolute madness for the Government to set that kind of example.</P>
    <P>If we pass Section 1 of this Bill, I hope the Minister will use all his personal efforts to keep his staff interested, to keep them alive to the fact the time will come when more money will be forthcoming, to make them feel that they can go on developing. Otherwise, as I have said, we might as well go back to 1850.</P>

Níl mórán sa mhéid sin féin, ach tá rudaí áirithe le sonrú ina thaobh. 'Sé an chéad rud nach bhfuil éinne ar an mBord nua seachas an Státsheirbhíseach nach bhfuil baint aige le tionscal na hiascaireachta, agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin le moladh.

Bhí beirt ar an sean-bhord a raibh an cháillíocht sin acu go maith, seachas na státsheirbhísigh. Nuair a bhí Bille an Iascaigh á rith tríd na Dála chuathas go bog agus go cruaidh orm in aghaidh státsheirbhísigh a cheapadh don bhord.  Ní raibh mise fiáin i ndiaidh státsheirbhísigh a cheapadh don bhord ach ní raibh mé ag iarraidh lámha mo chomharba a cheangailt le alt do-lúptha a chur sa mBille agus, sa deireadh thiar, socraíodh nach mbeadh thar triúr státsheirbhíseach in-cheapaithe don Bhord.

Níor coinniodh é i ngeall ar a mhaitheas ach coinniodh é i ngeall ar a <i>status</i> oifigiúl.

Is dóigh go dtógfaidh sé cúig bliana leis an gclár ar fad a chríochnú agus go gcosnóidh sé idir £300,000 agus £400,000.  'Sé mo thuairim féin, má táthar chun rath a chur ar na monarcana min éisc, go dtógfaidh sé idir £100,000 agus £150,000 sa bhreis, mar thacaíocht le praghas an éisc.  Má caitear na suimeanna seo ar fad tiocfaidh sé suas go £500,000.  'Sé mo thuairim gur fiú an £500,000 sin a chaitheamh, i ngeall ar an rath atá tagaithe go nuige seo.</P>

Sin é nádúir an duine.  Is iondúil go gcuirtear an milleán ar an bhfear thall.</P>
    <P>I spoke in Irish, not because of the rumour which I heard that the Fisheries Branch is to be incorporated in the new Gaeltacht Ministry, but because on practically every occasion upon which I speak, I use the little Irish I have.  I think we should not reserve it merely for the Vote for the Department of Education or for Oifig na Gaeltachta.  I do not know whether the rumour that Fisheries is to become part of the new Ministry is true or not. I am not going to find a great deal of fault with it, but I do not think it would be very wise because, after all, though it would be a compliment to the Gaeltacht&mdash;and a very large part of my constituency is in the Gaeltacht&mdash;the fishing industry is one that must be fostered on all parts of the coast.  We in the Gaeltacht do not make any special claim that all the plums be reserved for those areas.  During my term I think they got some little bit of extra attention, but there are many grounds upon which that could be justified.</P>
    <P>From the statement read out by the Parliamentary Secretary, it is obvious that both sides of the House have agreed upon a certain broad, general outlook in relation to the things that should be done to stabilise the industry.  If, in the carrying out of these plans, claims are made from either side of the House as to who should get the credit and who should be blamed for the things that have not worked out quite exactly as was thought, I suppose in the by-play of politics that it not any great fault.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that, when attempting to place blame, Ministers in particular should be a little careful <Col N="66" /> about their facts.  I was charged on the Vote for the Gaeltacht Office that I had committed a large sum of State money to a very wasteful project, namely, the purchase of derelict fishing vessels.  I should like the critics to remember that there were various objects to be served by the addition of three large-type vessels to the fishing fleet.  The catching of fish was not, perhaps, the primary one.  There were other problems to be faced as well as the catching of the necessary fish to eliminate imports, and one very important one was the training of young men in the competent handling of a modern fishing boat, and another which was present to my mind&mdash;I cannot now recall whether An Bord Iascaigh Mhara was as conscious of this need as I was&mdash;was, the need to make a good show on the high seas near our own shores.</P>
    <P>I remember often discussing this question of the adequate protection of the fishing fleet against impudent interference of foreigners within a few miles of our shores and asking seasoned fishermen what they thought was the best thing to do about it.  They said: &ldquo;No scheme of official boats such as is operated by the naval service can be devised to meet this problem adequately, but if you acquire a number of boats that can compete with these interfering foreigners and put them out fishing in the places where they appear most frequently, you will probably, provided you can make as good a show as they make, either warn them off or at least teach them manners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I agreed to the purchase of these three boats&mdash;after all, they are built of steel&mdash;in my mind, even if I did not express it to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, was the conviction that that was the best service they could give. Recently, I put down a question to the Minister asking to have some units of the fishing fleet incorporated in our fishing defence service.  I was given the reply that the Minister did not understand what I meant and would I elaborate upon the idea.  If the head of the Department of Agriculture and his Parliamentary Secretary could not apply their imagination to the matter and interpret exactly what the question <Col N="67" /> meant, I think they are greatly lacking in this matter of fisheries protection.</P>
    <P>It may be thought that I am encouraging something in the nature of piracy on the high seas.  I am not doing any such thing, but I imagine that the people who have, in fact, been acting more or less as pirates may be induced to take a more considerate view of Irish ships fishing on the high seas near Ireland if there is some display of fishing strength made available. In my opinion, boats of this kind could do that job much better than any corvette.  One of the bad spots, one of the places from which most of the complaints in this respect come, is that strip of the west coast from the Aran Islands down to the south coast. If these boats were put to fish in the areas where these occurrences are most frequent, I believe that would produce the desired result in a short time.</P>
    <P>In any event, that was one purpose. Another purpose was to train young men.  How is it expected that men can be trained to handle a modern fishing boat if some boats under the immediate control of the fishery authority are not available for the purpose?</P>
    <P>A scheme was put into operation for that purpose.  Of course, the other purpose was to reduce the imports. I know an olagón was raised that the purchase of these three boats was going to crush the inshore fishermen.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary giving a definition of the term &ldquo;inshore fisherman.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, it is not now necessary for me to ask that that be done, but it had appeared to me for a long time that such a definition was badly needed.  If anybody cares to read the remarks of the present Minister for Agriculture on the final passage of the 1952 Fisheries Bill, he will find what is tantamount to a panegyric on the passing of the inshore fisherman.  He became quite emotional about it, and I think he indicated that the 1952 Fisheries Act was singing the swan song of the inshore fisherman.</P>
    <P>When they came on the scene, the <Col N="68" /> three German boats, as the Minister for Local Government called them, were cited as further proof that this policy of killing the inshore fisherman would be pursued to the fullest.  I cannot let the occasion pass, however, without reminding the House that on that occasion, in a certain crossfire between the Minister for Local Government and myself, he referred to these inshore fishermen as &ldquo;gentlemen fishermen.&rdquo;  He did not seem to be on the same note as Deputy Dillon, as he was at that time, had been.  But who would have thought that the Deputy who became so emotional on behalf of the inshore fishermen would have, within the past month, as was referred to by Deputy Breslin the other day, revoked a by-law operating between Bloody Foreland Point and Dawros Head in Donegal, which protected the inshore fishermen from the incursions of these trawlers?</P>
    <P>In the 1952 Fisheries Act, we very deliberately inserted sections designed, as occasion demanded, for the protection of these inshore men.  I think at that time we all had practically the same conception of the term &ldquo;inshore fishermen&rdquo;&mdash;that it meant a man who was, in the main, a part time man, doing a bit of farming and doing a bit of seasonal fishing, whether he caught lobsters, salmon, herrings and so forth, and that he did not depend entirely on either of these avocations for his livelihood.  I was prepared to accept that definition of the inshore fisherman, although I knew at the time that it was not the technical or official definition.  The Parliamentary Secretary thought it desirable, in view of the change of outlook on this matter on his own part and on the part of the Minister for Agriculture now, to give us the technical definition of an inshore fisherman.  That is being done to justify the taking away from these inshore fishermen, popularly so-called, of the protection which they had from 1908 onwards.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising this action on its merits because I am not sufficiently acquainted with what led up to it to do so.  What I do want to point out is that it is quite unfair for responsible people to attack a newly-appointed Parliamentary Secretary who is trying <Col N="69" /> to do his best for all sections in the fishing industry with an insincere and dishonest campaign of this sort; and it is now proved to have been such by the revocation of this by-law, which, in my opinion, is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the hypocrisy of the talk about the protection of the inshore man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The by-law, as far as I understand from my only authority, which was the speech made by Deputy Breslin last week, was made in 1908.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot discuss it on the merits, because, as I have said, I do not know exactly what led up to it. I know that the by-law could not be revoked or could not be made without such an inquiry, but that is not the whole story.  The evidence, pro and con, given at the inquiry is submitted to the Minister and it is the Minister who assesses the value of it.  If the Minister for Agriculture has changed his mind as to what an inshore fisherman is, since he denounced me on the 1952 Act, and has now come around to the viewpoint that it is better to adopt the official technical definition of an inshore fisherman, and has changed his view about protection for those in regard to whom he said I was singing their swan song, and if he has now changed his stance, what guarantee have I that even if the evidence was weighted in favour of these smaller fry that evidence was given due consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, what am I to do in this case?  I think it is pardonable, in view of what I had to put up with over there when piloting that Bill through the House, if I now point out the hollowness and the hypocrisy of the olagón that was raised at that time on behalf of these men.  It was my intention to ensure, through the 1952 Act, that their interests would be protected.  The Minister for Local Government said they were gentlemen fishermen who would not accept a decent boat that would enable them to make fishing a <Col N="70" /> wholetime livelihood and I think it was Deputy Collins who asked: &ldquo;If they were not so inclined who was to compel them to do so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was my democratic outlook also.  On the question of these offshore fishermen, I should like to point out that certain post-war plans were drawn up towards the end of the war by I understand the then head of the Fisheries Section who was a civil servant. There was no politician in charge of fisheries until I was appointed in 1951.  The administration of Sea Fisheries, as everybody knows, was on the lines of a national co-operative industry and the fishermen had as much say in the running of it as the Government had because a committee of directors was fifty-fifty in representation of the two Parties.</P>
    <P>The job of drawing up plans was very largely left to the man who was directing policy from the Government side in that national co-operative.  In the plans he drew up, he recommended that from four to six deep-sea, diesel-engined short-trip trawlers would be provided after the war in an attempt to bridge the gap between home production and national consumption. When this man retired in due course from the Civil Service it seems strange the Minister for Agriculture should have reappointed him, or that, having done so, he should have attacked me for doing practically the same thing as he had recommeneded formerly.</P>
    <P>When he was Minister he had a scheme for fitting out an 80 foot boat for portion of my constituency with a foreign skipper, very largely, I will admit, for the training of young Gaeltacht men, but also in competition with the inshore boats.  I am pointing out these inconsistencies because fundamentally I want to examine all criticisms in order to find what the main faults are and in fact what the solutions should be.</P>
    <P>In the pursuit of these solutions, we will stand very often on the corns of vested interests.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a reference to them last week because they were voiced plainly in the protest from Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara.  I will not now go into this question of the difference of <Col N="71" /> opinion between the Comhlachas, which is the advisory authority, and the Bord, the executive authority, because I had to deal with it myself, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary is there any connection between the resignation of the Comhlachas and the composition of the new Bord Iascaigh Mhara which the Parliamentary Secretary has appointed?  They gave me a good deal of criticism.  I do not want to say it was unfair criticism though I will admit it was partial in the fact that it came from vested interests.</P>
    <P>They have stood two years under the Parliamentary Secretary, but they disappear <i>en bloc</i> now when he appoints a new board.  I do not know what is the connection between these two happenings, but in any event it does raise the question that has been put by me.  With regard to the use of large size boats directly operated by the board for the purpose of training young men, I should like to find out what is going to happen in that respect when the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister dispose of these three offshore vessels, because dispose of them they will, if their words mean anything.</P>

These boats have been working since 1952.  There is a good deal of information accumulated about them.  They have been working at a financial loss but they have been given in a report by the board as being worth £75,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are three steel hulks which were bought, I understand, for considerably less than the sum for which they would be built in Ireland or England.  The Minister for Agriculture was not in the House when I referred to what I consider was the main purpose which they should serve. That is the protection of Irish inshore fishermen when they go on the high seas against the impudent interference of foreigners.  That is the question I put to the Minister for Agriculture a few weeks ago.  That is the service to which I want them to be put now.  They would have been based in Cork, Kerry or Galway, if we had been able to establish our ice plants in time.  I know we had this difficulty of getting trained personnel and that has added very considerably to the inefficiency of these boats.  I will not use the word <Col N="73" />&ldquo;sabotage,&rdquo; but there was such gross incompetency, because of the failure to get suitable people, that a great deal of this deterioration could be put down to that fact.  I understand it was incompetence that caused the breakdown of an engine when they were in Icelandic waters.</P>
      <P>The purpose for which these boats were bought, I understand, was to train men in the handling of such ships.  Now they are to be sold.  That is the plain meaning of what the Parliamentary Secretary says.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The boats are worth, according to the accounts, £75,000. That is more than can be said for the chartering of boats which was tried and failed here.  Nobody on this side of the House made any political row about its failure.  It was an attempt to see if we could supply by charter boats a good part of our needs from home landings.</P>

Has that engine been sold or has it been put into another boat?  Could it not be put into one of these boats?  There is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary trying <Col N="74" /> to discredit these boats because they have made a financial loss.  If we are to condemn all efforts on the basis of a financial loss, then you get out of the business altogether.  After all, from 1932 to 1955, there was a sum of £68,000 wiped out in respect of advances for the purchase of inshore boats.</P>

      <P>No; it did not date from the 1914-18 war.  I have taken the years 1932 to 1955.  Prior to 1932, there was a further £70,000 wiped out under the 1931 Revision of Fishery Laws Act.  I was not counting in that £70,000, but, from 1932 on, there was a sum of £68,000 wiped out.  I notice in the accounts that losses on boat and gear amounted, to March, 1955, to £157,000.  Now, there is a sum of £200,000 in respect of inshore fishing and I am not cavilling at it.  I think it can be justified, in view of the fact that stability and reasonable prosperity are in sight, if they have not been achieved.</P>

      <P>The new board which he sent to the road the other day, in three years' service, supplied one-third of the total tonnage which has been acquired by the Irish fishing fleet in 25 years.  That is an achievement for the board which he sent on the road, simply, I believe, because I appointed it.  It is the Minister's right to put his own nominees on the board, but I do say that my board will stand comparison with his and it has one or two qualifications which his board has not got.  The results are there which I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> They drew up a scheme of development, some of which the Parliamentary Secretary read out the other day. He has read out the current year's part of it.  There is for works for the coming year £150,000, in round figures; boats and gear £157,000 worth and prepayments and cash sales will bring in £45,000, reducing the amount required to £112,000.  A total of £272,000 will be spent this year, of which £215,000 is by way of advances and grants £57,000, of which only £13,000 is coming from the National Development Fund.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that if the public thinks that the fishing industry is all a matter of State grants then they are very wide of the mark, because four-fifths of the provision is from repayable advances and only one-fifth by way of grant of £13,000 from the National Development Fund and the balance as set out in the Estimate.  I do not think that that is too heavy an expenditure in one year for an industry which is showing such buoyancy as the fishing industry has been showing since the advent of the larger sized boat.  That is part of the plan which was prepared by the board for the Minister and he knows that the plans will cost anything from £350,000 to £500,000 spread over a period of five years.  I believe he will have to spend the full £500,000, if he is to ensure success for the three fishmeal factories. It is most unlikely that the fishmeal factories will be able to run successfully without a substanial subsidy for the purchase of fish for a few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pessimistic view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if these factories are to undertake, on a large scale, the processing of herrings and mackerel, a price subsidy will be necessary to get in the quantity of herrings and mackerel that will keep them in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary about the second and third of these factories.  A German firm, I understand, came in here with a proposition to establish a <Col N="76" /> factory on the south coast.  My information may be entirely wrong but I place it before the Parliamentary Secretary as I got it.  After surveying the south coast they intended to set up their factory at Dunmore East and were subsequently induced&mdash;by whom I cannot say, definitely, but I understand it was from some official source anyway&mdash;to locate it in Killybegs. There was to be another factory in Donegal and I understand the Germans are coming to take up the running from the State in Donegal.  If that is so, I think that in all fairness the State ought to go down to Dunmore East this year.  They should have put in the estimate this year for the fishmeal factory in Dunmore East.</P>
    <P>Where the third factory should be located I am not prepared to say, but this plan of, say, three fishmeal factories, about six freezing plants, three large cold stores and a number of ice-making plants as set out by the Parliamentary Secretary is a moderate enough programme and spread over five years will not impose too big a burden on the national purse.  In relation to the programme, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say when he is replying why they delayed so long about the proposal for Galway. The land was acquired and fenced in before he took office and it is only within the past few months that the work began.  He may have a good reason for it and, if he has, I would be glad if he would give it because it has been said in respect of this proposal and in respect of some other public works like the pier at Irisheer, about which I have had so many questions down here, that these works were delayed deliberately so that they would appear to have emanated from the present Government and that Fianna Fáil had nothing whatsoever to do with them.  I do not believe that applied at all in the Galway case and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give the real reason as to why the work was not proceeded with immediately the land was acquired. which was over two years ago.</P>
    <P>This question of large boats will probably solve itself.  The inshore man is no longer the type of inshore man <Col N="77" /> about whom so many representations used to be made in the past.  He is looking for larger boats himself, but when I am being lambasted by the charge of accelerating his elimination it is only fair that I should parry the charge by pointing out what has been attempted by people who are laying this charge at my door.  The Minister for Local Government made a very big effort to get a fleet of Dutch trawlers into fishing in Donegal.  A similar request was made to myself in respect of another part of the coast also by a Dutch enterprise.  I put my foot down on both of these propositions even though the one further down the coast would have benefited my own constituency. We had nailed our colours to the mast and were standing on the principle that the development of the Irish fishing fleet would be entirely Irish and entirely in the hands of Irish fishermen except in so far as it might be necessary to secure a trained skipper where you could not get one at home.</P>
    <P>There was a very big inducement in the second of these proposals to me as a T.D. representing a very poor constituency, but I fought it because of that principle, which has also been applied by other Departments as well as Fisheries.  It applied in the establishment of the Shannon airport, for one, and by and large it is a very sound principle.  I am quite satisfied that we have all the capacity at home to do what needs to be done.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary say, when he is replying, how many certificated skippers for fishing boats we have in the country and would he tell us what the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts are in this respect?  I have the feeling that every one of our first-class fishing boats from 15 tons that goes out to fish is breaking the law. It was to meet that situation that we attempted this training scheme and I want to know what the Parliamentary Secretary intends to do about supplying the need.</P>
    <P>I was brought to task by the Minister for Local Government on the Estimate for Oifig na Gaeltachta in respect of the closing of the Meevagh boatyard.  I do not know whether the Meevagh boatyard was ever closed or <Col N="78" /> not but his remark was: &ldquo;Deputy Bartley is entitled to credit for the Gaeltacht boat scheme but I cannot foget that he is the gentleman who closed down the Meevagh doatyard.&rdquo; I want to tell him Deputy Bartley is not the gentleman who closed down that boatyard.  It is doubtful if it was ever closed down because, in a reply which I was given on July 12th of last year, Question No. 13, I was informed that the decision was taken in February, 1946, that notice was given by the committee of directors of the Sea Fisheries Association to the landlord of the premises in March, 1947, that they would give up possession on the 31st October, 1948.  It does not seem from these dates that the boatyard was ever closed down but, if it was, I cannot see how he can say that Deputy Bartley was the man who as Parliamentary Secretary closed it down, in view of the dates which the present Parliamentary Secretary gave me in reply to the question I have mentioned. It is again one of these matters which responsible people like Ministers ought to examine a little more carefully before they start making charges of that sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it altogether fair now to question me on charges made by somebody else?  I did not make any charges and I am responsible only for what I myself do or what I myself say in the course of my Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough, but I have quoted the reply the Parliamentary Secretary gave me.  I have given the main facts contained in that reply.  I have given the number of it, the date, and all the rest of it.  That absolves the Parliamentary Secretary. I am not making any charge against him.  This is a matter of current fishery administration, the operation of a boatyard, and from that point of view I am entitled to refer to it.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary would have been better served, his Party would have been better served and his side generally would have been better served on this question had the Minister for Local Government left it alone; I pointed out that the administration of fisheries up to the passing <Col N="79" /> of the 1952 Act was something in the nature of a national co-operative, financed, and to some extent directed, by official authority.  But it was not entirely directed by official authority. There was a committee of eight directors, four nominated by the Minister and four elected by the fishermen. It was that committee that made decisions.</P>
      <P>I asked a question of the present Parliamentary Secretary as to what the procedure was in relation to this matter and he told me that the committee made the decision and that the decision did not require to be referred to any higher authority for sanction. That, in any event, cleared any politics, in so far as Ministers were concerned, out of the question.  At the time the committee made the decision there were four elected representatives on the committee and only three Government nominees.  I take it that the four elected representatives must have agreed to this; otherwise, it could not have been carried out.  Now one of the four was a representative from Donegal.  If these four elected representatives had objected to the closing of this boatyard&mdash;if, in fact, it was closed&mdash;it could not have been closed.  Again, when the decision to reopen it was taken, that decision was not referable to a Minister or to any higher authority for confirmation but was an absolute act of the committee of directors and was operative immediately from the time it was taken. When the boatyard was reopened&mdash;if, in fact, it was reopened&mdash;there were four Government nominees instead of three.  Deducing from the facts given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary I am entitled to say that it was the elected representatives of the fishermen who closed this yard&mdash;if, in fact, it was closed&mdash;and it was the Government nominees who reopened it&mdash;if, in fact, it had to be reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary in his strategic planning for fishery development ought to <Col N="80" /> have a little more regard to geographical locations.  We are getting an innings now on one part of the western coast through this station in Galway.  But, remember, when the present Minister for Agriculture was in office on a former occasion, he skipped that entire middle west coast of Galway, Clare and Mayo and gave it practically nothing.  I remedied that situation.  Even if it happened to be my own constituency, the situation was crying out to be remedied; and I remedied it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara complained the other day that Mayo got nothing.  That is not true.  He knows that we gave Mayo one sizable grant for the improvement of Purteen harbour in Achill.  I was very surprised to hear him and another Deputy from Mayo denigrating the value of that work, simply because it came from a Fianna Fáil Government.  On another Estimate a Deputy treated us to a lecture on thankfulness for anything good that is done and making up our minds to utilise anything that is done to the best possible advantage.  When he did have something he could use to the best possible advantage, he threw cold water on it because he alleged, and so did another Deputy, it served only one man.  It would be more correct to say it served one industry; and there is a mighty big difference between the two.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary knows I am not fault-finding.  I am merely indicating that it is futile for any side to try to attach a political label to fisheries development.  We have not attempted to do that but I have noticed attempts made on the opposite side of the House in that direction.  People who try to make a Party issue of fisheries development will find there are quite enough conflicts and difficulties in the industry without creating further difficulties of a political nature.  Definite progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters which require consideration.  Before the war the directors of the Sea Fisheries Association decided on a standard boat of 36 feet and a sub-standard boat of 32 feet.  There were protests against these measurements but the protests <Col N="81" /> went unheeded until 1946.  Someone may ask why the Government did not step in.  My reply is that the administration of fisheries was based on a national co-operative.  One of the dominant directors on that committee was a man elected by the fishermen. He claimed to have a very long and a very wide knowledge of the needs of the fishing industry.  He pontificated&mdash; I cannot use any other word&mdash;on this question of size; he gave it as his opinion that 36 feet was the correct measurement.  If the Parliamentary Secretary examines the evidence given at the 1938 inquiry, he will find that this man's evidence, more than any other evidence given, had the result of confirming the view that the 36 foot boat was the proper boat.  It may or may not be significant that this man is back again once more on the board as one of the new appointees.  If I couple his reappointment with the revocation of the by-law on the North-West Donegal coast I am possibly compelled to the conclusion that we are now going to get back again to the small boat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  It is not necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to know, anyway.  The Minister for Agriculture seems to be quite proud of the fact that the first Gaeltacht boat was a 55 footer, although he decried this enlargement of boats over a number of years as the harbinger of bad luck for the inshore fishermen and said that something that was of value in Irish life was going to disappear.  Now, apparently, he has become quite an enthusiast for the new development and I think his conversion is to we welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what he proposes to do about the provision of money for the protection of inland fisheries. During the period of office of the previous Government, the Salmon Conservancy Fund Bill was passed through the Dáil and accepted without division.  There was some criticism that the money provided under the Bill <Col N="82" /> would not produce the good results which the Parliamentary Secretary hoped for and that he would not get the amount of money required for protection.  My reply to that was that it was a step towards that end and that it would give me as much money as was then being provided by way of rates and licences.</P>
    <P>Since the end of the war, the grants to these boards have been increased. The Parliamentary Secretary said last year that, in spite of the cancellation of the Orders made under the Salmon Conservancy Fund Bill, and the abolition of that fund, more money was being given by way of grants last year for fishery protection than ever before.  That is quite true, but anybody speaking the year before could have said that for the year previous more money was given than ever before.  I had hoped that the Parlimentary Secretary would be able to stand up this year and say that more money was being provided this year for fishery protection than ever before, but he has told us that it is less this year than last year.</P>
    <P>The money provided a year ago was provided out of the income of the fund set up under the Salmon Conservancy Bill.  There was a sum of £9,000 odd collected in the levies.  This year, the Parliamentary Secretary says that the money is less.  I do not say he is responsible for that.  I know that it is the Minister for Agriculture who cancelled the operation of that Act, but if he did it on the principle that the export of agricultural products should not be taxed&mdash;and I think that is the case he made&mdash;then there is a double obligation on him to see that the Exchequer steps in and makes available to the protectors of our fisheries the money they need.</P>
    <P>When the Salmon Conservancy Fund Bill was going through, the provision for protection asked for was a token Estimate of £10.  The Minister was able to say to me last year that that was, in fact, all we had done, and that what we had done was to save the Exchequer to the extent of the grant previously given.  I am prepared to concede to the Minister for Agriculture that things did look like that and that it would seem that the Department of <Col N="83" /> Finance engaged in what looked like sharp practice in eliminating the usual amount of grants from the Book of Estimates and providing, instead, a token sum of £10, indicating that the grants were to be financed out of the produce of the levy.  That did seem to me to be a rather shady turn on the part of the Department of Finance, but I did not get to deal with it here, because there was a change of Government. There was a certain amount of justification for what the Minister did say to me here across the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>The intention was that the produce of the levy should be added to the amounts of the grants previously given, so that double the amount would be supplied for protection.  That was the purpose of the Bill and what happened is an argument in the hands of those who say that civil servants depart from what is ordained by Parliament. Here it was the Department of Finance which stepped in and wiped out what was proposed in legislation passed here.  I got no chance to fight that, but I will have another place and another occasion on which to do so.  If I do not do it, there will be somebody else who will do it for me.</P>
    <P>I did not make as many speeches regarding poaching and poachers as the Parliamentary Secretary did and what speeches I made did not get half the publicity the speeches of the Parliametary Secretary got.  However, I was giving double the amount of money for the purpose of putting down poaching and that is more practical and to the point than the making of speeches.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister for Agriculture can come along with this principle of the non-taxing of exports of agricultural produce.  The difference between agricultural products and fishery products is quite clear.  The farmer has to produce the food, and the animals, and the other products which he exports, but, in the case of fisheries, the good Lord Himself provides. The fishermen have always expressed to me their solicitude for the <Col N="84" /> proper protection of the fisheries because they know that, if their waters are not protected, their livelihood will disappear after one or two generations.</P>
    <P>We all know that the levy was not paid by the fishermen.  Do we not know that there was such competition between the exporters of salmon that they constituted one of the greatest problems in detecting poachers, because it was so easy to get rid of poached fish?  Whatever levy was collected was paid, not by the fishermen, but by the exporters.  I do not think the principle of the Minister for Agriculture can be put into operation or applied in this instance.  If it could, I would say that there would be some reason for the action taken.  There were no protests against this levy and this was admitted by the Parliamentary Secretary in the reply which he gave to me here.</P>
    <P>I think it was established to the satisfaction of the public that it was a very reasonable method of finding additional money.  I want to lay emphasis on the word &ldquo;additional&rdquo;. It was not a substitute for what was being paid before; it was not to relieve the Exchequer.  If, in fact, that happened, the Minister for Agriculture himself is as much to blame as I am because, when he abolished the fund, he should have insisted that the Exchequer would come up with the extra money&mdash;up to about £15,000&mdash;which we proposed to find by our method. Now he has £650 less for the purpose this year than last year and he is not able to say that more money is being granted for the purpose than before.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the levy would have worked satisfactorily and without imposing any hardship whatsoever on the primary producer.  Even if he had to pay it, I think the price of salmon in Britain, since the lifting of control a few years ago, went so high that the couple of pence a lb. would not be felt.  As far as I could gather, in recent years the price of salmon on the English market did not go below 6/- a lb. and twopence out of 6/- was not a very heavy levy and was not a sore blister on either the producer <Col N="85" /> or the exporter&mdash;and I do not know that the producer paid any part of it.</P>
    <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether and if so when he is prepared to go on with the two 80-foot boats which were planned to be built in Donegal and will he tell us what has happened the machinery for one of them?  The engine and machinery were at Killybegs before I left office. If he is going to sell the steel-built off-shore vessels because their machinery is defective, I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to proceed with the building of these two boats. They will be timber boats and in my opinion they will not be as good for the purpose for which we acquired the steel-built boats.  I would say to those who say that the boats we brought in were operating to the detriment of the inshore men that four steam trawlers were taken out of service a short time before these boats came in.  Therefore there was less competition for the inshore men from the larger boats even after they went to sea.</P>
    <P>A few figures will indicate&mdash;I think statistics can be overdone&mdash;more than anything else the progress that has been made.  Imports of fresh fish pre-war averaged 136,000 cwt.  That figure is down now to one-fifth. That is very satisfactory progress. It may be due to either of two causes; I was giving one a moment ago and I digressed.  The other is&mdash; and I think it is the more likely one&mdash; the coming into operation of the Control of Imports Order, 1938, consequent on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938.  In my opinion, that played a very important part in stabilising the industry here and in enabling our own catching capacity to &ldquo;make good&rdquo;.  On the other hand, it may have been that the 36-foot boat was not adequate for the job but the pre-war 36-foot boat did not have the protection of this Import Order. Donegal, in particular, and a good many other places were littered with these 36-foot boats that could not pay their way.  However, the increased size and the Control of Imports Order <Col N="86" /> combined, in my opinion, to bring about this very promising result.</P>
    <P>There is another comparison which I can give to indicate that our position has improved beyond expectations and it is the fact that, taking the total imports and the total exports of fish and fish products, our exports exceeded our imports and I do not believe the British fishing industry can say that for itself.  As I have mentioned the British fishing industry, I should like to suggest to people who want fishermen and the State to engage in very costly and large-scale equipment for the catching of pelagic fish, that can only be marketed in countries abroad such as Eastern Europe, that that matter ought not to be pressed for the time being and that we ought to attempt to develop our pelagic fisheries by means of the reduction plants, by the manufacture of oil and meal and whatever fresh sales can be effected at home.</P>
    <P>If, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated in his speech the other day, the point has now been reached when there is a danger of saturating the white fish market in Ireland and when there may have to be an easing-off in the production of boats, I would suggest to him that he explore the possibility of larger exports of white fish to the British market.  After all, Britain imports several millions worth of fish in the year.  It is a market near to us The fish will not require nearly as expensive processing for marketing in a market so near us as in other markets that are almost inaccessible at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the £500,000 programme of development which is planned is well justified on the facts of the situation as we now know them to be.  If the Minister for Agriculture can show comparable results for the expenditure of his £12,000,000 on land reclamation, we shall have no adverse trade balance in a few years.  I know there have been losses.  I mentioned the losses in respect of the inshore industry down over the years because I want the Minister for Agriculture and his Parliamentary Secretary to get into proper perspective this project of plying <Col N="87" /> large-scale boats under the direct supervision of the board.  It is neither prejudicial to the inshore fishermen, nor unduly expensive to the taxpayer. There have been losses, but surely in the case of this experimental work of training men to operate the standard boats and of helping in the fishery protection service, these two services in themselves justify whatever loss is involved at the present time.  I am quite satisfied that that loss will be reduced in time, until it disappears altogether.</P>
    <P>I want to protest very vehemently against making these three boats political ships, as has been done with other projects.  I think it is entirely uncalled for and I think an examination of them should be approached in a more objective way.</P>
    <P>Might I call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to some statistics published under his authority?  I was in that Department myself for a few years and perhaps I should have given more attention to them than I did. However, I am now on this side of the House, and it is my duty to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to them.  I am referring to statistics given about the number of people engaged in fishing.  It is the report for 1954 that I have and I would refer the Parliamentary Secertary to Appendices Nos. 6 and 7 of the report. We are given figures which I must say I do not understand.  According to them, the total number of men solely engaged in 1954 was 1,725.  The total number of vessels solely engaged was 2,638.  The total number of men partially engaged is given as 7,606&mdash;I am referring to the 1954 report&mdash;and the total number of vessels partially engaged is 539.  Am I to take it that some of the men partially engaged are employed on the boats, &ldquo;solely engaged&rdquo;; or how is it explained that we have only 1,725 men &ldquo;solely engaged&rdquo; on 2,638 boats?  There must be something wrong there.</P>
    <P>Again in Appendix 7&mdash;trawling and seining in 1954&mdash;the port and locality is given, but the total tonnage of <Col N="88" /> motor boats engaged in these operations is given as 356.  That is in regard to the boats of 15 tons, of over ten tons, and not exceeding ten tons.  I take it they would be first and second-class fishing vessels, and a total tonnage of 356 is given for 1954.  We have about 140 first-class fishing boats, each of which would be not less than 15 tons gross, and how is it that there is such a small tonnage engaged in trawling and seining, while a much larger tonnage of ships is available?  It seems to me that not one-tenth of the available tonnage is engaged and I think there must be something wrong in these statistics.  I cannot expect the Parliamentary Secretary to give me a reply on this matter now and I do not think his Department would be able to get the information for him.  It will take some research to get to the bottom of this, but I think that, while the statistics are very full, they may be calculated to give a false impression of the industry.</P>
    <P>We are given 3,809 vessels as a total, but it is to be noted that 632 of them are laid up and that 539 of them, as I mentioned, are only partially engaged. There are therefore 2,638 solely engaged, but out of that figure, only about 140 would be first-class motor vessels, 569 being second and third-class fishing vessels.  That, in round figures, would be, say, 700 motor vessels out of this 2,638, so that you have roughly about 2,000 boats which are not powered.  There are first, second and third-class sailing boats, and these are in the 2,000, but about 1,500 row boats, without either sails or engines, are included in that figure.  It would be advisable if the Parliamentary Secretary would have these statistics examined, with a view possibly to a different presentation of them.  I do not think it is possible to take these figures as being completely accurate.  I know it is not easy to get accurate information when it comes to dealing with the number of men and the number of boats that are partially engaged, and if we could get accurate figures for the motor boats that are engaged whole time in the fishing industry, it would give us a sufficiently clear picture of what the effective <Col N="89" /> catching power is, and that is the main information we need.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should show his appreciation of one fact.  For three years, I was in his position, and, during those three years, I had to withstand a terrific barrage on practically every matter that cropped up.  The Parliamentary Secretary will admit that during his period, the past two years, he has met with no such obstruction, either inside or outside this House.  We have treated him very fairly.  I need refer only to all the vexatious questions that were asked about these trawlers and about what the weather was over a period of several months, and to remind the House that everything possible was done to disparage the project simply because either prejudiced or ill-informed people thought they were a menace to their own interests.  The board and the Parliamentary Secretary had no vested interest in the matter. They were conscious of the fact that the reason for all we were doing was the securing of an adequate supply of fish for the public.  The public had to be given first consideration.  I made no apologies and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not make apologies for taking that stand.</P>
    <P>The public have contributed generously to the establishment of the fishing industry and are therefore entitled to call the tune.  Next to the public I always put the interest of the fisherman who found his livelihood there. His interest was naturally bound up very intimately with that of the public. We are able to say that in the post-war period, with new scientific developments in the preservation, reduction and distribution of fish and with the improved catching power and the reservation of the market, which is most important, the fishing industry faces a brighter prospect than it has faced at any time since the Congested Districts Board first took on the job of teaching men in the Aran Islands how to catch mackerel from nobbies. It is a matter for congratulation that we all seem to be agreed on the general lines of policy to be followed and if there is a slight tendency on the part of politicians to take credit for this, <Col N="90" /> personally, I have no axe to grind there.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board which has just departed deserves well of this House and it would be a generous gesture if the Parliamentary Secretary were to admit in his closing remarks that they did good for the fishing industry, that they laid a solid foundation and that they have prepared a plan, some of which he read out, which can bear the closest examination.  The money which is to be expended for a period of four years will be well spent money and will bear abundant fruit and the time will come when the fishing industry will be showing a profit under all heads.</P>
    <P>If at that time the private enterprises that now feel aggrieved because of certain restrictions and certain activities of the public authority, say: &ldquo;Now we are in a position to take over and to run the industry from where you left off,&rdquo; I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be prepared to say to them: &ldquo;Here it is for you, and the best of good luck.&rdquo;  At the present time, unless we are to sacrifice the fishermen, I do not think the public authority can pull out, and I hope that if the Minister decides to appoint a new comhlachas, which he can do under the terms of the 1952 Act, in place of the body that has resigned, he will appoint representatives of the various sections of the industry who will approach the problems as objectively as possible and will try to reconcile the conflicts that undoubtedly exist.</P>
    <P>We did impose a hardship on the distributing trade when we removed the freedom to import.  It was much easier for a distributor in Dublin to get his fish supplies from the west coast of England than from the west coast of Ireland.  He was guaranteed a better variety, a more continuous supply and generally better service. Nobody will doubt that.  The new strategy is to supply the home market from the depots which have been set up along the coast and inland, if one can refer to Limerick as an inland town, for the purpose of rationalising distribution and preventing unnecessary <Col N="91" /> transportation such as unfortunately took place heretofore.  The Dublin distributing trade did benefit by the old system and, under the new dispensation, may suffer for the time being.  I understand that further inland depots will be established.  I do not know what towns will be selected but places like Longford and Kilkenny appear to me to be likely places for establishing depots.  When these depots are established, when the insulated vans are in operation and when freezing and cold storage facilities are available at the ports, the public can be guaranteed a continuous regular supply of fresh fish, which is the basis of a successful fishing industry. The public taste for salt-cured fish is gone and the industry can no longer be based on that product.</P>
    <P>I do not think any public representative would go out of his way deliberately to injure any interest engaged in the industry, whether it is in catching or distributing fish but one very often has to stand on somebody's corn when the public good is at stake.  The public good is the fundamental object and I take it that that is the concern of every one of us who has taken any part in this problem. If the prosperity of the industry as a whole is achieved, it is inconceivable that an injury will eventually be done to any section of it, whether engaged in processing, catching or distributing. I would say, therefore, to those who feel that their vested interests are being impinged upon at the moment that they should have a little patience and should co-operate in this effort and they will find that their patience will be well rewarded.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that he has my fullest support for the programme which he has outlined.  I am happy to be able to say that I am sharing it with him.  He will not begrudge me that tribute, I hope.  With that spirit of co-operation, we will be able to make continued and better progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the statement made by the last speaker that the Fishery Branch will be incorporated in the New Gaeltacht Ministry is untrue. <Col N="92" /> I do not wish the Gaeltacht any harm; I feel it needs all the development possible but I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the fact that there are places outside the Gaeltacht which engage to a considerable extent in the fishing industry and that do not appear to come into the picture as fully as they ought in the programme outlined by him in his opening speech.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the establishment of freezing plants.  County Wexford has a considerable extent of seaboard and a considerable number of the people there are employed whole-time or part-time, directly or indirectly, in the fishing industry.  Judging by the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement, it would not appear that County Wexford will get any benefit.  I would suggest to him that we are just as badly in need of a freezing plant either in Rosslare Harbour or Kilmore Quay as they are in any other part of the country and I would ask him to give that matter his consideration.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that there has been a gradual change in the methods of fishing.  They have become more up-to-date than they were heretofore and the fishing industry as a whole is becoming more mechanised.  The aim is greater production to meet the overhead costs which fishermen have to face, including overhead costs in regard to transport and other things. We know it is the policy of the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;it was also the policy of his predecessor&mdash;to endeavour to encourage the development of the fishing industry in so far as it is possible to do so.  We accept that is necessary for the overall balance of payments situation in the country.  We have a long way to go before we reach full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always maintained that, if the fishermen were in a position to turn over to the larger type of fishing craft, they would be willing to do so in 90 per cent. of the cases.  In my part of the country, the fishermen are faced with great difficulties.  They have no deepwater safe anchorage available between Dún Laoghaire and Waterford.  It stands to reason that <Col N="93" /> fishing will tend to develop in those areas where there is a safe anchorage. Anybody who knows anything about the sea realises that the hazards are considerable and if a fisherman is out fishing, he prefers to fish in the vicinity of a harbour.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary came down to us a couple of years ago and we put our case fully before him.  We made a very good case for the development of Kilmore Quay or Rosslare Harbour.  We know the difficulties he is up against.  The Department of Finance is not keen on providing money, unless under great duress.  If we wish to develop the fishing industry in this country, our primary aim and object should be to provide deepwater anchorage shelters throughout the country.  The rest will follow in the ordinary course of events.  The fisherman who has provided himself with a boat and established himself on a strong basis is able to refund the money lent him by the State in a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>Other countries are now extending their territorial limits and I see no reason why we should not work in the same direction.  There is a considerable amount of money in fish and we ought to approach our problem from that point of view.  The distribution of fish has always been a difficult question, since transport in this country is tied up with a C.I.E. monopoly and very often it is difficult for fishermen in different parts of the country to get their fish dispatched.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to use all the influence he can command with the Government and those responsible in order to enable fishermen to stock their own co-operative societies, to encourage them to do so and to place funds at their disposal to do so, so that they may possess their own lorries and sell and distribute the fish.  That is another way of developing the industry along the right lines.  We ought to develop private enterprise.  We have too much State control and too much clamping down on the free interests of the people generally.</P>
    <P>In regard to the placing of fresh fish at the disposal of the public, what Deputy Bartley said is probably true. <Col N="94" /> It may be that the Department have schemes and methods on foot.  In connection with the idea of setting up freezing plants inshore, so that fish may be available, my experience is that if you have lunch in any rural town in Ireland and you want to have fish, the odds are against your getting fresh fish.  You will probably be offered salted fish, and, if one gets fresh fish, one is rather suspicious that it has made a long journey before it finally arrived on the table.</P>
    <P>We have not yet got away from the system whereby all the fish is sent to Dublin and then sent out again to the different parts of Ireland.  It was suggested to me by people in the fishing industry, who believe it would be feasible, that the creameries, most of which have refrigerators of one kind or another, should be used as the pivot for the dissemination of fresh fish.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>As one who does not live in the Gaeltacht and who is very interested in the fishing industry, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give me an assurance that his Department is not going to be absorbed into the Gaeltacht Ministry.  We do not want everything in this country run from that area.  We have our own industry to set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I also shall be brief, not because I consider the Estimate of little importance, but simply because it seems that year after year the same Deputies speak on this problem.  Year after year, members on all sides of the House find themselves in agreement as to what should be done but is not being done in relation to fisheries.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary when he introduced his Estimate on Thursday last.  I listened to the various Deputies on different sides of the House.  Some members, including colleagues of my own, congratulated the Parliamentary Secretary on the work done, but I think that if we had less congratulation and more criticism, self-criticism, in this Chamber, we might be doing better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate, great emphasis was laid upon the problems of inshore <Col N="95" /> and deep-sea fishing, but very few drew attention to the problems facing the people in inland and even in seaboard areas as to where they are to get the fish.  I have always given credit to people for what they attempt to do. I heard Deputy Bartley explain the problems which confronted him when he was in charge of this Department. Fisheries is still the tail end of the Department of Agriculture and that is why we are still stuck in the mud.  It is out of date to suggest that fisheries should be the godchild of the Department of Agriculture, and, as long as we continue that way, so long are we going to find ourselves in the doldrums in regard to fisheries.</P>
    <P>In discussing this matter of the fishing industry, we appreciate the difficulties of the unfortunate fishermen. Deputy Bartley explained in a very clear manner the problem in regard to vested interests, but the main problem, in my opinion, is the one mentioned by Deputy Esmonde&mdash;the system whereby fish landed at various parts of the Irish coast are sent up to Dublin immediately. If there had been more scarcities in Dublin during past years, we probably would have made a better attempt to solve our fisheries problem, but because we were adopting a system of leaving the people in the seaboard and inland areas without fish, as a result of supplying it to Dublin, that policy meant we were satisfied with a little progress.  However, it is well to know from the Parliamentary Secretary that the returns are showing an increase.  It is satisfactory for everyone concerned, particularly for the fishermen, who indeed earn their living the hard way.  Nevertheless, I believe it is not sufficient for us to say we are advancing slowly but surely.  Let us be more determined to advance more speedily.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday, Deputies, particularly those from Donegal, drew attention to the problem of attacks on the livelihood of Irish fishermen by foreign trawlers.  On how many occasions have many of us of various Parties in this House asked the question: what is being done in relation to our just demands for an extension of our territorial <Col N="96" /> waters?  This problem never will be solved, if we are to continue at the rate at which we have been moving in the past.  If other nations saw fit to move in a more determined manner to secure an extension of their territorial waters for fishing, why should we not do the same?  Why should we be moaning about what is undoubtedly a tragedy, when we have the right to demand for ourselves an extension of our territorial waters?</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, supplies are a big problem, and Deputy Bartley and Deputy Esmonde mentioned quite rightly the trouble in relation to transport costs and so forth; but I am convinced there would be a better return for all concerned if we concentrated more on giving a supply to areas much nearer to the places where the fish are caught. There are towns in South Cork where they do not see a fish; yet the fish are still coming from Kinsale and from the eastern side of Cork Harbour, from Ballycotton, up here to Dublin. Why must the people in these areas be victimised?  It is true to say that that policy is now changed somewhat and that depots are being established in various areas.  I believe it is rather late in the day to do that now, but I suppose it is better late than never.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the progress that has been made in the north-western area.  We have all heard of Killybegs and other areas, but surely it is evident to anyone who goes to the trouble of looking up a map of Ireland that there is a long sea coast in this country?  While returns of catches at Kinsale have dropped, it is well known that this is a fishing area.  I consider it is essential that that problem should be tackled. It is going to be poor consolation for the people in that area to find that vast improvements are being made in areas hundreds of miles away from them even as the crow flies, apart from the length of the coast.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Esmonde pointed out, we have our problems along the southeastern coast.  I consider it essential that, when the problem of fisheries is being tackled, no specific part of the coast of our small country should be isolated just because the returns of <Col N="97" /> the fishery section of the Department show that catches have dropped over a number of years back.  We know the circumstances in which that falling off in the number of fish caught has occurred.  We know that in Kinsale and many other areas along the south and south-east the financial problem for the fisherman was so severe, and also because the buyers had these unfortunate men at their mercy, that these problems, interrelated with each other, meant that eventually these unfortunate men had no alternative but to emigrate.  If we hope to improve the conditions in these areas in the future, it is essential that we have a programme for them, as well as for other areas in the country.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that, no matter what improvement we get in the west, north-west, south, southwest or south-east, it all comes back to the problem of how these areas are to be treated in relation to the returns they give for catching fish which is sent mainly to areas such as Dublin. Deputy Bartley mentioned that certain interests here in Dublin were handicapped to some degree when the system was altered and they were prevented from importing fish from across the Channel and from getting it from places here in our own country.  We know that problem exists, but again, drawing attention to Deputy Bartley's remarks, which we know are true, money is being provided by the State for fisheries.  If any sections are considered to have a prior claim, there are two sections in particular.  Again, Deputy Bartley mentioned this.  I draw attention to his remarks because it is well that many of us can see the problem and can agree in our desire to remedy it.  In my opinion, the two important sections that must be considered are, first, the consumers&mdash;the people who are anxious to buy fish&mdash; and, secondly, but of equal importance, the fishermen.  Do not let us forget that, whether we are concerned with inshore fishermen or any other interest, no vested interest should come before the overall welfare of fisheries as a whole and the interests of the people who are anxious to buy fish in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> It is fantastic for certain people to suggest we are not a fish-eating people. It suits certain people to suggest that the people of Ireland are not interested in fish, except on a Friday, or another day now and again.  That excuse has been thrown out too long and too often.  We know that the people are interested in fish, much more so in recent years, due to the price of meat.  No matter what Government has been in power, we know that the prices of meat have naturally altered.  It is because the people have had no alternative that they have tried to get meat on many occasions when they were anxious to get fish but, unfortunately, they cannot get fish.  The question of price does not enter into it.  What they want is not available in the areas in which they live.  So long as we are satisfied to continue that policy, or even if we are satisfied to move slowly away from that policy, we will continue to speak here year after year&mdash;if the public find it suitable to send us back&mdash;moaning and wailing in relation to the very important need for building up a true economy for the fishermen in these areas and a better system for the people in the inland areas who are anxious to get supplies of good fish.</P>
    <P>We heard a lot from the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the progress made in the boatyards owned and controlled by the board.  At the present time, the Parliamentary Seccretary, the Minister and the responsible officials should put their heads together and realise that there is a boatyard which could be secured.  It is a boatyard that has met with certain financial difficulties in an area in which the Department should have better facilities.  I am speaking of the boatyard in Crosshaven Harbour. There is no need for me to go into it in more detail now, but I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to consider the urgent necessity of inquiring into this proposal and of securing a boatyard in that area for the building up of a better system for boat building there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley drew particular attention to the policy in relation to the size of boats being constructed.  It <Col N="99" /> was a huge joke, year after year here, to hear Parliamentary Secretaries speaking of the importance of smaller boats and of the vital importance of inshore fishing.  I realise the necessity for protecting the inshore fishermen, but I have always maintained that our policy in relation to boats of smaller sizes was one which, in itself, would not give us the desired results.  I do not claim to be a fanatic in relation to deep-sea fishing as a whole, but I believe it is essential to have some supplementary arm of supplies in relation to fisheries, because inshore fisheries have been, for many years, used in this House as nothing other than a mere joke.</P>
    <P>Coming from a seaboard area, I am not speaking in terms of condemning these men, but I will certainly not swallow what has been given to us here as official belief in the importance of inshore fishing.  No matter what Deputy Bartley may say in relation to statistics&mdash;in fact he admitted they were complicated&mdash;I would go further and say that, in relation to fisheries and the number of men engaged in the industry, statistics will never give us the facts, particularly in relation to part-time inshore fishermen.  It is because we were fooling ourselves and attempting to fool the people of the country by saying there were so many thousand men engaged in this employment when we knew they were not, that we were getting nowhere in relation to improving our policy because a large percentage of the part-time inshore fishermen are engaged in other callings.</P>
    <P>If one of those men goes out in the morning, looks at the sky and sees that it is a suitable day for working on his land, he will not go fishing.  He is able to make up his mind first what occupation he will employ himself in on any given day.  Over the years, we have been giving protection to these men which was not alone unnecessary but was not justifiable.  It is essential to protect the man who may be considered to be an inshore fisherman, provided that man is employed as a fisherman should be.  It is no use, and certainly no pleasure, for some of us <Col N="100" /> to try to draw attention to those facts when we know that no notice has been taken of such attempts to improve the situation in relation to areas like Kinsale, where genuine fishermen, who had no ambition for any form of employment other than the sea, were given little hope of ever getting anywhere, and when we were prepared to adopt a policy completely detrimental to their interests by extending help to people who were not of any value as fishermen.</P>
    <P>I would conclude on the note on which I started, by saying that it is a pleasure to know that while a small number of members from all sides of the House hold, to a certain degree, different views on this important subject, in the larger, overall view, they are anxious to see the fisheries of this country improved.  It was good to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary that increased landings are being made available.  However, it is essential to have it understood that, unless and until supplies of fish are made available to the people in the rural areas, as well as to the people of Dublin, we will neither have a fishing industry nor will we be sincere or genuine in our efforts to build up a true economy aimed at helping the people in the areas concerned who look to the members of this House, whether in Opposition or in Government, to formulate a policy which will be a genuine incentive to men to stay at home rather than go abroad seeking a living on the fishing boats of the Continent.  Unfortunately many of them have to emigrate year after year to provide the employment they are unable to get at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to the debate on this very important industry is mainly from the viewpoint now generally accepted that our rivers and lakes, our tidal and inshore waters and the deep seas around us hold, from natural sources, potential wealth in the form of much needed food for our homes, our hotels and our hospitals. The point that has been stressed by most speakers is the question of providing the fish to supply the market, to distribute it economically and to give the people generally an interest in that <Col N="101" /> production.  We do not need any frogmen at all to give us an idea of what other nations, who have developed this industry over the years, considered a suitable type of boat for deep-sea fishing, because we have often seen numbers of them seeking shelter in our ports or getting service there in stormy weather, while our own industry is neglected by the lack of boats of that type to compete with them in the waters around our shores, which are a source of such activity and of income for those nations.  Surely we are not so blind to our own interests as not to be able to take advantage from the experience of others and to adapt such experience to our own resources and problems.</P>
      <P>The interests of the inshore fishermen have been stressed by my colleague, Deputy Desmond.  According as our deep-sea fisheries develop, the sons, and perhaps some of the inshore fishermen themselves, will be best competent to man these boats and to be trained in their operation both as officers and men.  Too often in this country&mdash;I have said it before and I repeat it now&mdash;has the general development of our potential been hindered by the fact that one interest was set against the other while it was in the interests of all particular sections that there should be general development.  That, too, applies to our fisheries.  Surely, with that potential source of wealth around our shores, it should not be the policy to say that if we develop deep-sea fishing, we are injuring the interests of our inshore fishermen.  While there is such an immense market to be met at home and, as Deputy Bartley has said, while England is importing several million pounds worth of fish per annum, not only should we strive to supply our own market but also that nearby market.  We should try to get after it and become one of its suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my young days when fish was landed it was brought to surrounding towns by very humble methods of transport.  They were slow-moving, if you like, but the fish arrived fresh, it was delivered in all the villages and towns, and the people got after it.  It was an event in the place when the fish cart arrived.  People bought fish as a <Col N="102" /> rarity but the demand was there.  Now it is seen so seldom that the people have almost forgotten how to cook it properly.  One of the reasons for this, and Deputy Desmond made reference to it, is that when the branch railway line was closed no alternative method of transport was provided to take its place.</P>
    <P>The various questions which have arisen in this debate are matters of great local and national importance. Any Deputy who has suggestions to put forward to promote the success of the schemes envisaged has a duty to put them to the Minister or to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The first interest, of course, is the man who gets the fish, because there is no use in our having proper methods of transport, or propaganda to induce the people to eat fish, if fishermen are not encouraged sufficiently to go after the fish, to risk the waters of the deep, in boats properly equipped, in order to supply the market.  As matters stand at present, say, in the City of Cork, if fish is delivered the big traders and merchants buy on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  The small traders have to depend on what is left&mdash; perhaps it may be of poor quality &mdash;and to buy on Thursday to supply the biggest market of the week, on Friday.  In order to encourage all the people engaged in the industry, to encourage the fishermen themselves, you must have a means of disposing of the surplus because otherwise you will have a glut.  In a week when there is a glut the fisherman will, perhaps, get a very small return in comparison with the size of his catch.</P>
    <P>To my mind fishmeal plants should be established at various points along our shores to deal with surplus catches.  Dunmore East was mentioned by some Deputy, I think Deputy Bartley.  Last year surplus herring and mackerel had to be sent from Dunmore East to the north-west of the country.  Due to costly transport, I am sure the result hardly paid for the effort.  We shall have to depend on local development to deal with the surplus catches try to stabilise the prices as far as we can, for the fishermen and see that they have a reasonable <Col N="103" /> and favourable market so that the fruit of their labours will not be cast into the sea again and lost when it may be otherwise utilised.</P>
    <P>We had people in the past, I think they are very rare now, who were able to cure fish.  I know people from the North of Ireland who came to Cork to engage in curing as a very remunerative type of employment.  They continued it for a number of years until the family became extinct, or went out of business.  We do not hear much now about curing fish for table.  If the surplus is not cured, it must be used in some other way and we must provide for that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke the other day, if Press reports are correct, about expensive organisations. I do not know whether he was correctly informed on that but I would make the suggestion to him, following up a point made by Deputy Desmond, that if you had a fishmeal station provided in Kinsale it could be supervised by the officials of the Fishery Board in Cork and there would be no need for any new organisation.  We are only putting up the suggestion for Kinsale if it is considered more central but whatever place is chosen as the best port, the best distributing centre for the purpose, it is up to us to encourage local effort for the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>The subject of poaching has been discussed. One of the best antidotes to poaching is more freedom for the ordinary man to fish with his rod and line when he feels like it.  That can only be done of course in agreement with the people who own the land on the river banks.  That can be done through various organisations.  If men cannot fish fairly freely they try to poach and, in consequence, destroy the potentialities of a river or lake.  This is where the local organisations come in.  If you have local organisations through which people can engage in fishing as a recreation or a sport or as a means of providing themselves with fish, then those organisations should make such arrangements with the owners of land on the river banks such as, say, a coursing club would make <Col N="104" /> with the farmers to enable them to course over their lands.</P>
    <P>These organisations would be the best protectors of the fish in the rivers. Unless we have local organisations, unless we have a proper appreciation of what our fisheries mean to the country and what they could mean if they are properly preserved and developed, we will not make the desired progress. Expending money simply on hunting poachers instead of stocking the rivers, and so on, and giving greater opportunity for fishing is, to my mind, working on the wrong lines.  I would prefer that whatever money is to be expended by the Fisheries Branch would be used on the proper stocking of the rivers and lakes.  The more fish that is there, the more will be available for fishermen to engage in their recreation.  If the fish becomes scarce by the destructive methods of poachers then the sport is gone for everybody, even for the poacher himself.  Of course, it is not sport for him; he engages in it for some other reasons.  Because the price of fish is high, he tries to catch it in an illegal and improper way which we all deplore.  Then, when he finds himself in difficulties, perhaps, he contacts somebody to try to extricate himself with some backdoor excuse or another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the main problem that requires to be dealt with is the distribution of fish.  The market for fish seems to be there if the people can get it fresh and can get it conveniently in the village or town. I live only 35 miles from Dublin, but I would also say that this practice of sending all the fish to the Dublin market and having it redistributed around the towns and villages of our country seems to be wrong.  It was probably necessary until road transport became such a highly organised and swift business.  Since road transport has developed and with the advent of the deep freeze plant which it should be possible to erect at our ports, we should be in a position to provide a regular and constant service to our towns and villages.  Even without a deep freeze plant it should be possible to increase supplies with the aid of motor vans and lorries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> I know a case where a young lady possessed a Ford 10 van and succeeded in giving a service to five or six villages in County Louth.  From Clogherhead in County Louth this young lady can go to as many as 50 or 75 houses and those people know that they will have their fish on Friday.  It is not possible on a large scale without a deep freeze plant but if small deep freeze plants can be obtained and if fish merchants can be induced by loan or by any other method to purchase them and set them up in the small fishing ports along the seaboard, I think the retail trade in fish will disappear.</P>
    <P>It is an accepted fact that the retail fish shop is to disappear very soon. Frozen fillets in the ordinary grocer's shop can be stored in his refrigerator over a period of up to three days.  The frozen fillets may even be as fresh as the fresh or supposedly fresh fish which arrives at the moment, as a result of being stored in the ordinary refrigerator that is available in almost every grocer's shop.  I think that is the solution of the problem.  Of course, surplus catches may have to go to fishmeal factories or into the Dublin market for disposal to larger centres of population but it is absolutely necessary that we should get a supply to our small towns.</P>
    <P>About two years ago, the Parliamentary Secretary visited the premier fishing village of my area, namely, Clogherhead.  There we got a little further than is usual on first occasions of deputations to Parliamentary Secretaries, because the Parliamentary Secretary had gone to the trouble before he arrived of saying that if sensible schemes were produced for the improvement of Clogherhead harbour and the facilities for fishermen there, he had the liberty to say that his branch could practically guarantee that a 50 per cent. grant would be available.  Of course, the county council has to come into it and I am glad to say we are working upon the matter.  I hope that certain improvements will be effected at Clogherhead and I would like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that we will make every effort to see that the proposal is <Col N="106" /> with him, if not within the next couple of months, certainly within the next five or six months, so that he will have every opportunity of considering and putting before the Department of Finance plans for the improvement of Clogherhead harbour.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at Deputy Bartley's naïve statement that it is the fish wholesalers who pay the levy on salmon.  I shall not argue the merits or demerits of the collection of the levy or the manner in which it is expended. Anyone who buys fish, like any businessman, must take into consideration all his costs; if, perchance, one of his costs, in this instance, happens to be a levy of 2d. per lb. on salmon, he must take that into consideration when he makes his bid for the fish.  Deputy Bartley may say that there is keen competition because these men get very small profits on the salmon they handle. That may be so, but that does not affect the matter one iota.  In the last analysis, the man who pays the levy is the man who catches the fish.  The man who buys the fish knows his market and is able to pay 2d. per lb. less; if the levy were 2/- per lb. he would pay 2/- per lb. less.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has the serious duty of keeping a watchful eye on operations and making every effort to repair the depredations caused by the drainage of certain rivers.  No fishermen, not even a salmon fisherman who derives his livelihood from salmon fishing, will say it is not right to drain our rivers.  It is in the national interest that they should be drained so that land which had fallen into disuse might be brought back once more into fertility for the ultimate benefit of the nation.  But there have been serious depredations as a result of which many people have lost their livelihoods; I refer to the position on the Clyde and Dee.  A claim for compensation is pending.  That is not, of course, a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary and it may not be discussed here.</P>
    <P>The restocking of such rivers is of vital importance.  I pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary because he saw fit to provide us, when we organised a local committee&mdash;the Clyde <Col N="107" /> and Dee Development Association&mdash; with 50,000 salmon fry and 50,000 trout fry.  That was an excellent contribution. In the national interest it is his duty to ensure that, year after year, irrespective of local effort, thousands of fry will be released into these rivers as soon as drainage operations have been completed.</P>
    <P>I am not a very old man but I can remember seeing horses and carts going down to take away the salmon caught on a certain river.  Last year there were three fish caught on that river.  This year things are a little better; 53 fish have been caught.  The situation is altogether absurd when one remembers the value of the fish caught by the Glyde and Dee fishermen before the drainage was carried out, I emphasise that it is the bounden duty of the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that restocking is carried out on a large scale on every river in which drainage operations have been carried out.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary situation exists in relation to the net fishermen on the River Boyne.  Hitherto it has received no publicity and it is about time someone publicised the situation there. Possibly legislation will be required. Possibly the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to do something about the position.  It is the practice of the net fishermen at the mouth of the river to form a queue for a pull, as it is commonly called.  The number in the queue is not decided by the number of people present but by the number of boats they own.  If anybody stands on the second tee at Baltray Golf Club and looks across the mouth of the river he will see at least 100 boats and, of these 100 boats, not ten are fit to take the water.  If anybody arrives from Drogheda, or anywhere else along the river, he will find three or four families at Mornington who own 100 boats and he will become 101 in the queue.</P>
    <P>I remember being in the Parliamentary Secretary's office in relation to another matter affecting the Boyne. Some minutes were being read out and, in the course of them, we got some details about a riot amongst fishermen <Col N="108" /> at a place called The Haven, about three or four years ago.  Now these riots demonstrate that there are certain difficulties.  An unfair advantage is being taken of decent fishermen with one or two boats.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to apply himself to that situation in an effort to see what he can do to remedy it.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bartley, I believe that a great deal has been done.  Like Deputy MacCarthy, I think many small markets in the smaller towns have been lost because it no longer pays the man with a horse and cart to travel the streets with a load of fish. We will have to mobilise all the resources at our disposal to resuscitate these markets.  The solution is the adoption of a small freezing plant and fleets of vans to carry the frozen fillets to the various towns.  That is the direction in which the Parliamentary Secretary should proceed.  It is the essential adjunct to the activities of the large wholesaler in the Dublin market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one aspect on which I would like to say a few words in relation to the men who &ldquo;go down to the sea in ships&rdquo;.  The first thing that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Fisheries Branch should ensure is that the fishing grounds are protected, so that those who operate in them will be able to fish in them without let or hindrance. It should be our aim to ensure that those who wish to fish and those whom we are trying to induce into the fishing industry will, at least, have their preserves preserved for them.  It is sad to see foreign trawlers and tramps operating under the very noses of our people, of our fishermen and those who are supposed to protect our fishermen and our fishing grounds.  It is sad to see these foreign vessels operating on our grounds, and operating so very remuneratively.  That is particularly true of County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to geographical considerations we are remote from fishery patrols more or less.  The problem is a serious one in the north.  It is serious admittedly along other parts of the seaboard too, but it hits Donegal particularly hard.  The time has come when <Col N="109" /> a 100 per cent. effort will have to be made to put an end to this piracy on our fishing grounds.  This problem has never been tackled.  For historical reasons it was not tackled up to 30 years ago; regrettably, it has not been effectively tackled since then either.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to have our fishing grounds destroyed.  We cannot continue to allow our fish to be pilfered. If anyone attempted to rob our farmers we would very soon get rid of him and take steps to ensure that no outsider would unlawfully take the produce off our Irish farms.  The same should apply to our fishing grounds. We are trying to foster and build up a fishing industry.  The methods adopted up to now have not been satisfactory. We should, if we are to confine ourselves to patrol by boats, see that the boats are able to do the work they have to do.  If the boats are not sufficient we should have aerial patrols operating from different centres.  When these marauders are captured they should not be let off as easily as they are at present.</P>
    <P>It will be very necessary to get our fishermen to co-operate in order that they may compete in this modern world.  We find that many new devices are available for use in other countries, whether they be better boats, better gear or new methods like the use of radar, but they are all very expensive and are quite outside the capacity of any fisherman, family of fishermen, or group of fishermen to obtain on their own.  It is for that reason that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is in existence and will be in existence for a long time to come.  Where there has not been development and where there is very little prospect that there will be development, as there has been in continental countries, somebody must supply the needs of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The amount of work which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has done is worthy of praise.  They certainly have done a considerable amount.  They were faced with an industry which was underdeveloped and under-capitalised.  It still is in that condition but nevertheless great progress has been made. However, we can go very much further; how far we can go depends <Col N="110" /> on the Government and on the Minister for Finance.  I think that very much more money is required.  It is required, first of all, to provide better boats and nets, to provide radar and other modern devices which help fishermen in their occupation.</P>
    <P>Money is needed to train young men. Many of these young men are inclined to give up fishing.  They are inclined to give up the way of their fathers who were willing and able to carry on fishing under very severe conditions, great hardship and much loss of equipment and life.  The young men have decided that they will not do that and we cannot blame them for that decision.  We cannot blame a young farmer if he refuses to operate with the tools and methods of 50 or 80 years ago.  Neither can we blame the fishermen if they forsake the traditional means and methods of their fathers and forefathers. It is up to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, with the financial help of the Government, to train these young men and to give them proper facilities. Unless they have these, they will find their way, with many other young Irishmen, into exile and emigration.</P>
    <P>Not alone must we provide fishing boats and gear all along our coasts but we must also provide proper landing facilities.  The facilities which were available in the way of piers, harbours and so forth, and which were able to take the smaller boats of the last generation, are not able to cater for the boats of to-day.  We find that great losses, including loss of life, are common in some of our ports.  I find that the Donegal coastline outside the Gaeltacht area is very much neglected in regard to piers and harbours.  I do admit that the Gaeltacht areas along the Donegal coast have got their share and that, whether it be Killybegs, Downings or Burtonport, the ports have been greatly improved as regards landing and other facilities.  I must say, however, and I would like something to be done about it, that the Donegal coast outside the Gaeltacht area has been completely neglected in the way of piers and harbours.</P>
    <P>I can mention one example.  That is the pier at Portaleen, where fishing has been carried on for generations <Col N="111" /> and where, at the moment, upwards of 100 people are engaged in this industry despite the fact that, due to the lack of pier facilities and proper landing facilities, 30 fishing boats have been wrecked there within the last ten years.  Fortunately, there was no loss of life, I think, but that could happen any day.  It goes to prove that what I say is true, that unless we provide proper facilities for the younger generation we will have emigration.  Emigration from that area and other such areas has begun.</P>
    <P>I know that proposals have been put forward, and are, at the moment, with the Parliamentary Secretary's Department. I know that both the present Parliamentary Secretary and the previous one are well aware of the position and I hope that, despite any financial stringencies there may be, sufficient money will be found to improve this harbour and that is all we are asking for.  We know that a major scheme would be costly and all we are asking for is a scheme that will improve the port which is one of the few outside the Gaeltacht.  It is situated in the very north of our country and it would be a disgrace to neglect the most northerly port in Ireland when we have in our own hands the means and the methods by which we can look after this fishing community and see that it does not move either into the Six Counties or across the water.</P>
    <P>Those points deal with the most important aspect of fishing.  There is one other point in which I am interested&mdash; the manufacture of nets in this country. No nets are being made in this country on a commercial scale except a small number which are being knitted by hand.  Even that craft is dying out with the result that we have to import all our nets.  A group in Donegal, which is concerned in the fishing industry, have gone into this question.  A great deal of research has been done.  I should like if the board or the Parliamentary Secretary or his Department would give any help possible in this connection. We should like as much help as possible because I think that, even with the stage of development which the fishing industry has reached, the prospects of future development which <Col N="112" /> we are all sure will come about require a net-making industry in the State.</P>
    <P>In want to refer briefly to the inland fisheries of Donegal.  Again, I am afraid I have to report some neglect in the development of our Donegal lakes and rivers.  I am not so much interested in inland fisheries, as such, as in the fact that in Donegal they are a tourist attraction which are capable of further development.  I think that, apart from one lake, very little has been done for the improvement of lake and river fishing in Donegal.  That may be subject to correction, but I think the position is not good and that not a lot has been done in that respect.</P>
    <P>The position of deep freeze for fish in or around the coast or in some of the provincial towns is a fairly serious problem.  I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that in Donegal a large volume of deep freeze facilities are available, that is, deep freeze which was intended for commercial purposes other than fish.  I think it would be a good idea if An Bord Iascaigh Mhara could avail of that.  At the moment, it is available. I suggest that if they have any difficulties in the way of getting deep freeze facilities they should seek to have these facilities which are available put into use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that, together with agriculture and our tourist industry, the fishing industry ranks as one of the possible highest in the country.  For that reason, I am glad Deputies have availed themselves of the opportunity of expressing their views very openly, frankly, honestly and conscientiously in this debate.  The fishing industry may be said to be a natural industry.  I feel, unlike Deputy Bartley and most of the other Deputies who have spoken, that I speak under a certain disability due to the fact that I do not come from a part of the country actively engaged in the fishing industry.  There may be something to be said in favour of having a man in charge of fisheries who comes from a fishing district and who has an intimate and practical knowledge of the industry.  However, there may be something to be said for having a man in charge of fisheries <Col N="113" /> who lives many miles from the coast and who probably comes from a district where a fishing boat is never seen and fish are seldom seen, because he can view every aspect of the industry in a most impartial manner.  He has no personal axe to grind and he can examine all aspects of the fishing industry without prejudice.  So it is with me.</P>
      <P>I found, when I entered the Department, that I had no knowledge, or only a very limited knowledge, of the fishing industry&mdash;entirely unlike my predecessor.  I also found that the only way in which I could equip myself with information concerning the fishing industry and the only way I could make myself familiar with the conditions affecting the fishermen and the landings of fish caught at the various ports and the various requirements and necessities of the fishing industry was to avail myself of every possible opportunity to visit each of the fishing centres, to meet the fishermen, to attend meetings of groups of fishermen, to ask them questions and to try and familiarise myself as best I could with their everyday life.</P>
      <P>I must say that the outgoing members of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara as well as the members of the present board gave me every help, assistance and co-operation.  In every area I visited, I asked the fishermen to speak frankly and to give me all the information they possibly could concerning their livelihood and what steps I could take to improve it.  I asked them if there was anything which they needed in their respective districts, and I pointed out that I should be glad if representations were made to me so that I could do something to improve their conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the fisherman has an extremely difficult life.  Furthermore, his livelihood demands great courage and skill.  Within the past few weeks, we read in the newspapers of a tragedy which is typical of the difficult life of the fisherman and it demonstrates the great courage that it requires to be a skilful fisherman.  We read of the loss of life off Dingle recently.  Every one of us here, and particularly those of us in the Fisheries Branch, extend our deepest <Col N="114" /> sympathy to the relatives of the men who lost their lives while fishing.</P>
    <P>Compare the life of the fisherman with that of the professional man, the shopkeeper, the civil servant, the tradesman, the man living in the town or in the city.  By comparison with these men, the fisherman is deprived of a good deal of home life.  Sometimes he has to stay out fishing day and night.  He depends a great deal on the weather and he is at the mercy of the roughness of the seas.  It is very gratifying to note from conversation with fishermen how, all down through the years, son has followed in the footsteps of his father.  As an entirely impartial individual, while speaking to those various groups of fishermen around the coast, I could not help thinking it was the greatest possible pity that special care and attention were not given all down through the years&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;all down through the years&rdquo; I do not mean just the past ten or 15 years but longer &mdash;to develop our fisheries and improve the standard of living of those engaged in that capacity.  I have wondered why it was that there was not special consideration for fishermen and for the development of our fisheries and our fishing industry in general.</P>
    <P>It is very important for the fishing industry that we should have contented fishermen, and I am glad to say that, from my experience of the fishermen around our coasts, we have fishermen as courageous and as good in this country as in any part of the world. I am sure that if my predecessor were asked to express an honest opinion on the courage and abilities of our fishermen, he would take as much pride as I do in saying that our fishermen are second to none.  But they have been handicapped to some extent, as has been said by a number of Deputies, There is little use in fishermen catching fish and landing their catches, unless we are able to market the fish; now that we have increased the number of fishermen; now that we have a greater number of vessels at a number of ports engaging in the fishing industry, now that we have improved the standard of our boats and enlarged the size of them, and now that we <Col N="115" /> have these boats equipped with the most modern fishing equipment possible, it is only right that Deputy Brennan of Donegal should strike a forcible note in the course of his observations and ask, in view of the fact that there are more boats bringing in catches, and in view of the fact that there is a greater number of men engaged in fishing, are we going to reach a stage when the supply will exceed the demand.</P>
    <P>He felt that, in the event of supply exceeding demand, the prices paid to our fishermen were likely to fall considerably and that our fishermen would eventually find, because of that state of affairs, it would not pay them to engage in fishing.  I want to assure Deputy Brennan and every other Deputy who feels that supply is likely to exceed demand that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department in general are very wide awake to the situation that would prevail if those conditions should arise.  Possibly the expansion and modernisation of our fishing fleet is one of the reasons why the board in its foresight and wisdom has decided to set about the establishment of various ice and deep-freeze plants and central depots around the coast from which fish will be dispatched to various centres.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an assurance to every Deputy, and particularly to the fishermen, that we have, in the past, read of the difficulties which fishermen had when they could not dispose of their catches, and it is my aim and it is the policy of the Government to see that there will be no fisherman who will have to dump back into the sea one fish that he catches.  In order that that might be the case, we are now arranging&mdash;reference has been made to it&mdash;for a publicity campaign to encourage people to eat more fish, and for the establishment of the depots to which various Deputies have referred.  And in order to consume any excessive landings or supplies of fish which the fishermen may have on hand, a full-scale, full-size fishmeal factory is about to be set up in Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that it takes five tons of fish to produce one ton of fishmeal, <Col N="116" /> and, if we have a fishmeal factory established, in order that it may be conducted on an economic basis, it is of the greatest possible importance that there should be constant landings and a constant supply of fish brought into our ports by our fishermen.  Reference has been made to the fact that it will not pay our fishermen to fish solely for fishmeal.  There are parts of the world where fishermen are engaged solely in fishing for fishmeal and I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture was able to say some time ago in Killybegs that a group of interested German fishmeal experts have decided to come here and to open a large-scale fishmeal factory there because the factory that exists at present in Killybegs was intended to be only an experimental or pilot factory.  Much valuable information has been gained, and much useful experience also, through the working of that pilot factory, and I am glad to see that steps are now being taken and facilities granted to enable those interested parties to embark on the establishment of a fishmeal factory at Killybegs.</P>
    <P>The fact that a fishmeal factory is being erected at Killybegs by private enterprise does not mean that a line is being drawn under fishmeal possibilities. The whole question of the production of fishmeal is at present under consideration by the board and I hope to be able to make further statements on the matter at an early date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the outgoing board, and so did Deputy Bartley.  It has not been left until now to convey to the outgoing board an expression of appreciation and thanks for the services which they rendered. I believe that the Minister for Agriculture addressed a communication to every member of the outgoing board thanking him for his services and expressing very great appreciation for them.  I would feel very dishonest in this House, if I did not admit that that board did good work, and, in order that the value of that work should be borne in mind, and in order to show the confidence that the fisheries administration and I, myself, have in that board, I can point to the fact that the chairman of the board, to whom Deputy Bartley referred, is still chairman <Col N="117" /> of the new board.  I want to take this opportunity of paying tribute in this House to the untiring efforts of the chairman of the board over the past number of years and to the very valuable services so usefully rendered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan also referred to the fishpass at Ballyshannon in County Donegal.  He said, I think, that some hundreds of salmon have died there. His words were: &ldquo;It is not an exaggeration for me to say that in the course of passing through the dam at Ballyshannon and upwards, over 200 salmon have died.&rdquo;  That is the first information that my Department has received of that, and I want to assure the Deputy that I will have this matter investigated and see what can be done, with a view to having an immediate improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins questioned the decision to have refrigerated transport acquired by the board, on the ground that, if fish were properly iced, it would be possible for it to arrive in good condition at any place in the country.  I should like to explain that the purpose of this transport is the carriage, under satisfactory conditions, of the products of the quick-freezing plants to central storage points, such as Limerick and Dublin, for sales distribution, this being part of the general plan to promote improved home consumption demand in connection with which, as already mentioned, a fish publicity campaign is now about to be commenced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins&mdash;and I think also Deputy Burke&mdash;referred to shell fish. I may say that my Department's work is actively directed towards the promotion of the development and use of our shell fish resources, with particular regard to those varieties which hitherto have been insufficiently exploited or have not been exploited at all.  That work is going ahead on an increasing scale this year and the Deputy will no doubt be aware that investigations are being carried out by technical advisers of my Department in his own area, amongst others.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the growth of our shell fish export trade, I may say that our shipments to France have increased <Col N="118" /> from 78,422 lb. in 1954 to 128,976 lb. in 1955.  This increase is all the more gratifying in that it has been brought about without any lessening of the shell fish trade with all other countries, which, on the contrary, increased to 159,660 lb. in 1955 compared with 119,709 lb. in 1954.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also stated that he felt the fishermen were very badly handicapped because of the difficulty in putting down the deposit for the purchase of a boat.  He referred to the fact that in Great Britain there are grants available to assist fishermen in the purchase of boats.  It is true to say that in Great Britain grants are available to fishermen, but it must be borne in mind that in Great Britain the fishermen have to pay down at least 25 per cent. of the cost of their boats.  Here, all the fisherman has to pay down is 10 per cent. and there are no other securities required whatsoever, despite the fact that, in other countries, good, solvent security is required, in addition to a down payment of 25 per cent. of the cost of the boat. I feel that when the State is prepared to take the risk of 90 per cent. of the cost of the boat, it is reasonably good assistance to the fishermen in providing themselves with boats.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the need for improved harbour facilities in their constituencies.  I should like to place on record that I am only too anxious to support any reasonable project for the betterment of conditions of the fishermen in this regard. A number of State projects are at present under examination, but I can assure all Deputies that, once the engineering advice which is necessary in such cases is received in my Department, no time will be lost in examining the proposals and supporting them in every possible way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke raised a question here on Thursday, and spoke very strongly, in connection with Balbriggan harbour. The position with regard to Balbriggan harbour is that the responsible authority for its maintenance is the Dublin Port and Docks Board, to whom any representations should accordingly be addressed.  The board has already assured this Department <Col N="119" /> that the condition of the harbour is kept under constant review and that it will continue to take all possible steps to maintain and improve its condition. The board contended, however, and it is accepted, that, unfortunately, it will never be possible to eliminate entirely the shoaling which occurs at the mouth of the harbour when the winds blow from certain directions, as the main cause of the trouble is the proximity of the large volume of free-running sand on the adjacent strand.</P>
    <P>With regard to Loughshinny and Skerries harbours, which were also referred to by Deputy Burke, the first is in the charge of the Dublin County Council and Skerries harbour is in the charge of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The question of devising a suitable scheme to serve the fishing fleet of the Loughshinny-Skerries area as a whole is under consideration and engineering advice on the matter is awaited from the Office of Public Works.  I can assure the Deputy that, as a result of his raising it here on Thursday night, I am now asking that the Office of Public Works expedite the report and furnish it to me with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>With regard to Howth, this harbour is in the charge of the Commissioners of Public Works and proposals for its improvement should be submitted to the Office of Public Works.  No representations have been received in my Department that the existing facilities are unsatisfactory, but there is a local demand for the provision of a larger and modern slip for hauling up boats for repair and general overhaul.  The question of providing such a slipway is under consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Ormonde, in connection with Cheekpoint harbour, it is admitted that this harbour is badly in need of dredging.  It is in the charge of the Waterford County Council, in consultation with which body a suitable scheme of dredging is under examination by this Department, and I can assure both Deputy Lynch and Deputy Ormonde, who have made representations in this matter, that I will have <Col N="120" /> a further communication addressed to the local authority without delay and see what can be done with a view to speeding up this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and Deputy Ormonde, again, raised the question of Dunmore East.  This harbour is in the charge of the Commissioners of Public Works, to whom any proposals for improvement or repair should be submitted.  It is understood that repairs to the pier were carried out last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara made reference to the piers and slips of importance to the fishermen in County Mayo and I would ask him to be good enough to make a similar speech at a meeting of the Mayo County Council, of which I believe he is a member.  I feel that, if he did, it might be of some assistance to my Department in even getting a reply from the council concerned.  I promised Deputy O'Hara that I would send him a list of the various proposals which we had in mind in County Mayo and in which we were making no headway, in so far as the local authority was concerned.  I will have it posted to the Deputy with the least possible delay and trust that, as a result of his intervention, it may be possible for him to get the engineering section of the Mayo County Council to give us a little more help and co-operation, so that we may carry out some schemes of improvement for the welfare of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht boat scheme.  The first boat, as Deputies are aware, has been located in Donegal.  According as further suitable boats become ready for issue under the scheme from now on, the claims of all other Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas for such facilities will be given every consideration.  Deputies Ormonde and Lynch may be assured that the fishermen of Helvic and Ring districts will not be forgotten in that connection, but there is one point I should like to mention, that is, that the building of the boats under the scheme has suffered some set-back, owing to a difficulty which has arisen at the Crosshaven boatyard where two boats were in course of construction. This will mean some regrettable delay in the planning of our future <Col N="121" /> programme and our delivery of boats under the scheme.  I have, however, noted Deputy Desmond's observations in connection with the Crosshaven boatyard and I will see what I can possibly do to meet his wishes in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also referred to the question of the piers at Schull and Castletownbere.  I am making inquiries to see what can be done with regard to both of those areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley opened on the note of asking if the new Department for the Gaeltacht was about to take over fisheries.  I want to assure him that that is not so.  The Department of Fisheries is remaining under the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Gaeltacht is not going to take the responsibility for the administration of fisheries.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Bartley appeared to make very special reference to the trawlers&mdash;the three German trawlers as he described them &mdash;which he purchased.  I should like to make just a brief reference to these three trawlers.  In the course of my opening remarks on Thursday last, I was again forced to refer to it.  I made reference to the losses in the course of my remarks on the Estimate last year.  Those losses continued and I told the House I was asking the board to submit to me a full and detailed report concerning the working of these three trawlers. I hope Deputy Bartley and the House will bear in mind that the original cost of those three trawlers was approximately £62,000 and to date there has been a capital expenditure of £16,000 on those trawlers, in addition to £10,000 on repairs.  Deputy Bartley now asks that those three trawlers be engaged in the protection of our fisheries or to train young men in handling similar craft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have.  They have also been fishing, as the Deputy knows, any time they were not in dry-dock undergoing repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Parliamentary <Col N="122" /> Secretary is on this matter, will he say whether there are any items being charged against the accounts in respect of those boats that are not charged against the inshore fishing fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I am aware of, but I am aware that the capital expenditure on them was £16,000, together with £10,000 for repairs.  One of those boats has had to be fitted with a new engine and we now feel that the engines are falling out of the other two boats.  The engines are falling completely and entirely out of the two boats which were purchased for £62,000.  I have asked to know what it would cost to put them back into reasonable working order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of that is covered by insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question entirely.  The fact that they are covered by insurance does not take from the fact that the engines are falling out of the boats.  What use is a boat without a suitable engine?  It will take from £12,000 to £14,000 to put those boats back into working order. We are not going to tolerate losses of this kind and it is because we are not going to tolerate these losses on these three trawlers that I have asked for a report.  When the report comes along, I will make up my mind as to what we are to do with the boats.  They are a desperate liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they worth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows what a boat without an engine is worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £75,000 is given in the accounts for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I know about it is that the board would have been a lot better off financially without them.  I will make up my mind, when I get the report, as to what the future of the boats will be. Again, I want to make it very clear that we could not possibly continue to allow those losses to be increased year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> With regard to the protection of our fisheries, I have taken that matter up with the Minister for Defence.  I explained to him the importance of our fishery protection service.  I hope that, as a result of the representations made to his Department, there will be some improvements.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.P. Murphy and other Deputies raised a question in regard to the mitigation of fines for fishery offences.  I read protests in the newspapers and I received representations from various boards of conservators against the mitigation of fines.  As I told the House last week, the reduction of a fine is not a function of mine. If a citizen is fined in the local courts for a fishery offence, the Minister for Justice has the right to give every consideration to all the facts as to whether there is a good case for mitigating the fine or not.  The Cork Board of Conservators, however, passed a resolution protesting against fishery fines being reduced.  In so far as I am concerned, I want to make it clear that I did not recommend mitigations of fines in any cases.</P>
    <P>I have one case in particular to which I should like to make special reference here.  It concerns the Cork Board of Fishery Conservators.  In one case, the board, by a majority vote, recommended that the fine be remitted in full.  That is from the board itself.  As the file will reveal, on 19th June, 1956, I put a note on the bottom of the file: &ldquo;No mitigation.  I am not prepared to take the view expressed by the Cork Board of Conservators.&rdquo; I have not recommended that any of those fines be reduced and I am certainly not prepared in the future, either, to recommend that fines for fishery offences be reduced.</P>
    <P>I note what was said in connection with the transportation of fish. Deputies will, of course, understand that this is a matter entirely for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. However, in most of the fishing districts that I visited, the fishermen always put forward the case that transport facilities were not sufficient. Again, I want to make reference, as Deputy Esmonde did, to the fact that <Col N="124" /> at Kilmore Quay the fishermen formed a co-operative society to get their own lorry and provide transport for their own fish.  I think another Deputy felt that, in the case of sales of fish, they could be well organised, if the matter was done on the basis of the co-operative creameries.</P>
    <P>That is the very thing we welcome. I should be glad to see fishermen forming themselves into co-operative societies in every part of the country, because there must be a certain amount of local effort, and where there is local effort, such as we have more particularly in Kilmore Quay, it has brought very good results and given better facilities to the fishermen. In so far as the transport of fish is concerned, and more particularly in connection with the reference by Deputy Collins to the marketing and sales of fish, it would be desirable and advisable that fishermen in their own interests would give more thought to the co-operative movement.  I strongly recommend it to them.</P>
    <P>When I visited Kilmore Quay, I made that recommendation to the local fishermen in order to solve the transport difficulties they had there.  They took my advice, and, so far as I am concerned, the scheme is working most satisfactorily.  I hope during the present session to introduce legislation to enable and authorise the board to expend further moneys.  At the end of the present financial year, the balance remaining to the board for development purposes, etc., was £68,388.  This balance would be entirely insufficient to meet the advances that I referred to on Thursday last, and further legislation is required to authorise advances in excess of £500,000.  That was specified in the Act of 1952.  I now propose during the present session to introduce legislation to enable the board to spend another £500,000 and I hope that I will have the co-operation of the House in having that legislation passed with every possible speed so that the board may carry on its very useful work in the development of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by Deputies.  I want to express a word of appreciation and <Col N="125" /> thanks to Deputies for the co-operation I received and to assure them, if there is any possible way in which I can help them, while I hold this office, be it long or short, the knob of my door is in their hands if they have any problem they wish to discuss with me. The same applies to any of their constituents who may be engaged in the fishery industry in any way.  I am always prepared to learn, I am always glad to see them and, while it may not be always within my power to give full effect to their advice, I can assure them that I will do my best to advance the interests of their industry in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say with regard to the Gaeltacht boats whether he is going to gather them in to fish out of one port or whether he will allow them to operate from their own home ports?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked that question all right and I am sorry I did not answer it.  The delay in that case was due to the old board&mdash;the board the Deputy described to-day as his board.  If there was any delay, it was due to the board.  I can assure the Deputy that, so far as the Galway premises are concerned, I had a particular interest in seeing that the work went ahead with the least possible delay.  As far as I can recall, there was some legal delay with regard to the lease, that it was not entirely completed, and I asked for a report on the matter every Monday morning I went into the office until the matter was finally disposed of and the work started. I assure the Deputy with every sincerity that, if there was any delay in regard to this project, the responsibility for the delay rested with the board.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Vote 58&mdash;External Affairs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £286,290 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs and of certain services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924) including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take the Estimate for External Affairs Vote 58 and the Estimate for International Co-operation Vote 59 together, as has been the practice in previous years.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for 1956-57 at £457,240 shows a net increase of £60,990 on the figure for 1955-56.  This increase is attributable in the main to (1) the extra provision required arising from our membership of the United Nations Organisation, (2) provision for additional allowances for officers serving abroad and (3) additional remuneration of staff arising from the revision of Civil Service pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The headquarters salary sub-head shows an increase of £1,200 due to the revision of Civil Service pay.  Headquarters Telegrams and Telephones A (4) shows an increase of £500 owing to increased charges likely to arise under these heads.  A new sub-head&mdash; A (5)&mdash;has been opened to provide for subscriptions to inter-governmental legal bodies.  The total provision for the current year under this heading is £790&mdash;£700 to the Hague Conference on Private International Law and £90 to the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law.  In previous years, such subscriptions were charged to sub-head A (3)&mdash; Incidental Expenses&mdash;but to meet correct accounting procedure, a new sub-head has been included in the current Estimate.</P>
    <P>The salary sub-head&mdash;B (1)&mdash;for representatives abroad is increased by £50,770, due chiefly to, (1) a new provision of £20,000 for representation&mdash;staff, additional assistance and exchange compensation&mdash;at the United Nations; (2) an extra provision of £15,000 for additional allowances of representatives abroad; (3) an additional £4,410 to cover increases in remuneration arising from the revision of Civil Service pay; and (4) an extra £3,000 required to meet the salary, office, assistance and exchange compensation of the permanent representative to the Council of Europe at Strasbourg.  Provision under this heading was made in the Estimate for 1955-56 for only part of the year.</P>
    <P>The provision for travelling expenses of representatives abroad&mdash;sub-head B (2)&mdash;is increased by £5,000.  This increase is justified having regard to the level of expenditure necessarily incurred in previous years, and an increase of £1,800 on sub-head B (3)&mdash; postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones for representatives abroad &mdash;is due to anticipated increased activity under these headings by missions abroad in the current year.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided under the miscellaneous sub-heads&mdash;Cultural Relations with other Countries, the Irish News Agency, Information Material and Official Entertainment&mdash;are unchanged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The Vote for International Co-operation shows a net increase of £65,800, due entirely to new expenditure arising from membership of the United Nations Organisation.  The new expenditure is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (1)&mdash;Contribution to the United Nations in respect of part of 1955 and all of 1956, and in respect of the working capital fund, £55,000; Sub-head C (2)&mdash;Expenditure on travelling and subsistence allowances, £10,000; Sub-head C (3)&mdash;Incidental expenses, £3,000.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the matter of the United Nations later in more detail. I feel I should, at the outset, refer to the celebrations for the seventeenth anniversary of the coronation and eightieth birthday of the Holy Father which coincided this year in Rome.  In all, 51 countries sent special delegations or missions to convey to His Holiness the deep-felt congratulations of their Governments and peoples on this great occasion.  As the House is aware, Ireland joined in this expression of devotion to the Holy See.</P>
    <P>Looking at the present world position, we have seen in the past year an apparent change in the outlook of Soviet Russia in so far as the principal Soviet leaders have denounced the policies and activities of Stalin.  In this connection, one must ask oneself what this apparent change really means.  The only acid test in a matter of this kind is what is done, not what is said.  As far as I see it, it is essentially a change to a more intelligent leadership with the same aim, namely that of Communist world domination.</P>
    <P>The basic Soviet objective remains the same, to divide as far as possible the free countries of Western Europe and to divorce them from the influence and assistance of the U.S.A.  The primary object of present Soviet policy is to weaken the vigilance of the free countries and so to weaken their desire and ability for self-defence. Thus we hear speech after speech, supported by all the elements of propaganda, smiles and handshakes advocating disarmament, a neutralised Germany and, above all, that the new type of collective dictatorship is more friendly, more peace-loving and more <Col N="130" /> co-operative than the personal dictatorship of Stalin.  Here we must be eternally vigilant and have no illusions, if we are successfully to defend and maintain our Christian civilisation and our way of life.</P>
    <P>There are other sources of serious conflict, notably in North Africa and in the Middle East, which must cause grave concern to all free countries.  I do not wish, at this stage, to do more than to advert to these problems and to assure the House that they are, at all times, the subject of the detailed examination of my Department and, that, in the various international organisations to which we now belong they will receive from the delegations concerned the most serious consideration from every angle.</P>
    <P>We have continued to play our part in the field of international organisations. I would like to mention first the O.E.E.C.  In its early years, the organisation's most important work was the examination of programmes submitted by member countries and recommendations based thereon to the American Government as to how American aid should be divided between them.  With the diminution of American economic assistance, the O.E.E.C. has devoted increasing attention to broad economic and financial questions.  One of its major achievements has been the progressive raising of the percentage of trade liberalisation amongst its members.</P>
    <P>In September last, this country notified the organisation of its agreement to comply with the current requirement that 90 per cent. of all private trading between member countries should be free from quantitative restrictions.  Other activities of the organisation in which we are fully participating are the European Productivity Agency which was set up to promote research and productivity amongst the member countries, in particular through the medium of technical assistance programmes.  More recently, we have joined with the organisation in formulating proposals for the co-operative development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</P>
    <P>Last month, an official visit to Ireland was made by the secretary-general <Col N="131" /> of the organisation, who was accompanied by the head of the Information Section of O.E.E.C. and the deputy-head of the County Study Section dealing with Ireland.  The visit was one of a series of visits being undertaken by the secretary-general to member countries to inform himself direct about conditions there, to make contact with Ministers and officials concerned with O.E.E.C. matters, and also to publicise the aims and activities of the organisation.</P>
    <P>In the period since June, 1955, of which I propose to give a brief review, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has met three times, in July and December, 1955, and in April, 1956.  The Consultative Assembly likewise has met on three occasions.</P>
    <P>Between sessions of the Committee of Ministers, the work of the committee is carried on by the Committee of Ministers' Deputies and that of the Consultative Assembly by the various Assembly committees and sub-committees. In the period under review the Committee of Ministers' Deputies has met nine times.  In that time, 24 meetings of Assembly committees and subcommittees have been held.  We were represented at all of these.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to review the debates and conclusions of the sessions of the Consultative Assembly, as my Department&mdash;apart from providing expenses and travel facilities&mdash;can claim no credit for what is the result of the independent initiative of the Assembly representatives.  Whilst recording my appreciation of the work done in the Consultative Assembly by members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, of all Parties, I would like to mention that at the recent first part of the Eighth Assembly Session, an Irish representative (Senator James Crosbie) was unanimously elected one of the seven vice-presidents of the Consultative Assembly.</P>
    <P>In April last, the membership of the Council of Europe was increased by the admission of Austria to full membership and we associate ourselves with the remaining member countries in welcoming Austria as a full member of the council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> The best measure of the achievements of the council is, perhaps, found in the conventions and agreements between member states drawn up under the auspices of the council.  One of the most important of these instruments is the European Convention on Human Rights.  In July, 1955, the number of declarations by member Governments recognising the right of individual application under the convention was raised to six.  Since that date, therefore, the European Commission of Human Rights is competent to accept applications from individuals in respect of those countries, of which Ireland is one, which recognise the right of individual application.  In addition, in the course of the last year, the number of declarations by contracting parties recognising the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights was increased to five and the first election of members of the court will take place when eight such declarations have been made.</P>
    <P>The first formal reference to the European Commission of Human Rights by one contracting party against another was recently made when the Greek Government alleged the breach by the British Government of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cyprus.  At the conclusion of its deliberations at the beginning of June, 1956, the commission which holds its meetings in camera, announced that it had ruled that the petition of the Greek Government was admissible.</P>
    <P>The next stage in the procedure laid down by the convention is the constitution of a sub-commission of seven which will undertake an investigation of the petition.  If this sub-commission does not succeed in effecting settlement by conciliation, the plenary commission will submit a report to the Committee of Ministers who may decide, by a two&mdash;thirds majority, whether there has been a violation of the convention.  The actual subject matter of the petition is therefore still <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>The elaboration of two further instruments under the auspices of the Council of Europe was completed during the year.  On 13th December, 1955, <Col N="133" /> we signed, without reservation as to ratification, the Council of Europe Agreement on the Exchange of War Cripples between member countries for medical treatment.  A Convention on Establishment, which provides common rules for the treatment accorded to nationals of each member state in the territory of the others, was opened for signature by Council of Europe members on the same date.  For technical reasons connected with a reservation which Ireland wished to make to the convention, it was not possible for this country to sign on that date.</P>
    <P>In addition to those completed during the year, a number of further conventions and agreements under the auspices of the council are in various stages of completion.  In the legal field, a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes, now in draft form is at present being examined by the Committee of Ministers' Deputies and a Draft European Convention on Extradition will come up for examination at a forthcoming meeting.  In addition, a preliminary meeting of experts has been held with a view to drafting a European Convention on the Treatment of Legal Persons.</P>
    <P>In the social field, the council has undertaken the drafting of a European Social Charter of a type similiar in that field to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In the more restricted field of social security a committee composed of governmental experts from member states has completed a draft of a European Code of Social Security which will endeavour to lay down minimum standards of social security for members of the council.</P>
    <P>The work of the council is not, of course, restricted to the elaboration of conventions and agreements, as its activities also embrace common action in economic, social, cultural, scientific, legal and administrative matters. Among the economic matters I would mention the proposals of the Consultative Assembly for the economic development of Southern Europe. The proposals in this field, which are now due for examination by the Committee of Ministers, are largely the work of one of our delegates to the <Col N="134" /> assembly&mdash;Deputy MacBride&mdash;who was invited by the Assembly Committee on Economic Questions to undertake a study of this problem in Southern Italy.</P>
    <P>During the year, the usual consular services continued to be provided, such as the issue, renewal and endorsement of passports, the grant of visas, the repatriation of destitute Irish citizens abroad, the provision of assistance on behalf of interested Irish citizens in connection with foreign estates, and advising and assisting members of the public on citizenship questions, problems arising out of military conscription in other countries, compensation claims against foreign authorities, locating the whereabouts of persons in other countries, and other miscellaneous services.</P>
    <P>Visa abolition agreements were concluded between Portugal, Greece and Turkey.  The position in this regard is that we now have total or partial visa abolition agreement with all nonCommunist European countries, except Spain which, it is understood, is not prepared at present to enter into any visa agreements with other countries. It will be appreciated that these agreements are of great assistance in enabling our citizens to travel freely in the free countries of Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government recently gave its approval for Ireland's accession to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, which was drawn up at a conference convened by the United Nations at Geneva in July, 1951.  Our instrument of accession will shortly be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and 90 days thereafter the convention will enter into force for this country.</P>
    <P>The convention is a comprehensive charter of the rights of refugees and represents an important advance in international co-operation for the improvement of the status of refugees. It is the outcome of efforts extending over the previous 30 years to put a humanitarian concern for refugees into international law.  The convention establishes a broad base of rights of refugees, including the right to be accorded at least the same treatment as aliens generally.  Our accession to <Col N="135" /> the convention will not alter in any important respect this country's existing treatment of refugees.  Accession to the Convention will not entail any charge on public funds other than, initially, a small printing charge for travel documents for refugees which, however, would be covered by the fees to be charged for the issue of these documents.</P>
    <P>Twenty other Governments, including those of all the Council of Europe Member Countries, have signed, ratified or acceded to the convention.</P>
    <P>Our external trade figures for 1955 are already before the House.  I do not propose, on this Estimate, to give a detailed breakdown and analysis of these figures, but rather to devote myself to the main functions of my Department in the development of foreign trade.  It plays its part in the work of the Interdepartmental Foreign Trade Committee and is represented on delegations for the negotiation of trade agreements.  Officers of the Department's missions abroad, besides participating in negotiations for the conclusion of new, or the renewal of existing trade agreements, are actively engaged in promoting Irish exports.</P>
    <P>Apart from the trade agreements of 1938 and 1948 with Great Britain, trade agreements are in operation with 12 countries, viz.: Austria, Ceylon, France, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  The conclusion of these trade agreements is intended to facilitate the development of actual or potential markets for Irish exports.  Some of the agreements are of a continuing and general nature, each Government undertaking to grant all reasonable facilities for the import of products from the other, whilst others provide for specific import quotas for Irish goods.  Agreements of the latter kind are re-negotiated annually with a view to securing adequate quotas for non-liberalised Irish goods.  In this connection, negotiations were concluded during the year with France, Finland and Germany.  An agreement with Belgium, under which that country purchases Irish cattle for serum purposes, was also renewed last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> My Department, in collaboration with the other Departments concerned, has also been active in schemes for the utilisation of Grant Counterpart Funds under the Economic Co-operation Agreement of 1948 between this country and the U.S.A.  Last year, two sub-agreements were negotiated, one providing for additional laboratories and equipment for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the other for grants to Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
    <P>Last year, I emphasised two points which we must recognise as permanent realities in our approach to the question of Partition: firstly, that it is a problem for which there is no quick and easy solution; secondly, that the first step towards unity lies in more neighbourly relations between the two sections of the Irish people.  It is a matter for regret that the actions of the advocates of the illusory quick solution by violence have impeded progress in the development of more neighbourly relations.</P>
    <P>Despite this, there has been some positive advance.  I am glad to say that I am informed that the Irish association, to which I referred last year, has continued to develop and expand in both Dublin and Belfast, and it has had informative discussions and debates on a number of topics relating to Partition, in which both sides were able to present their cases without venom or vituperation.  A more important development which is, by its nature, an implicit recognition on the economic and social planes of the fundamental unity of our country and of the artificiality of its political division, was the decision to unify trade union congresses on a 32-county basis.</P>
    <P>The climate in which violence flourishes, which is the inevitable result of loss of faith in constitutional methods, is nothing more or less than a predictable reaction to the abuse of constitutional processes whereby the most elementary democratic rights have been denied to the Nationalist minority in the Six Counties by gerrymander, discrimination in housing and employment, and even open provocation by the para-military force usually called the B-Specials.  In the past <Col N="137" /> month, we have seen attempts, fortunately abortive, to introduce discrimination into the fields of children's allowances and education.  It is in the continuation of repressive and discriminatory actions that we have the soil in which the seeds of violence flourish, and I need hardly say that these measures, apart from their results, make the task of developing neighbourly relations difficult, but, despite these difficulties, the Government will continue to strive for better relations between both sections of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that we will continue to expose repressive or discriminatory practices against our fellow-countrymen and use every means appropriate to bring international public opinion to bear on such cases.</P>
    <P>In the United Nations of which we are now members, we are, as has already been announced, determined to miss no opportunity of seeking to undo the unnatural division of our country.  We do not, however, propose to raise the issue on inappropriate occasions or to give to the world the impression that we have no interest in any matter of international policy save that of Partition alone.</P>
    <P>Before coming to a general review of our position as a member of the United Nations, I should like to mention our military and financial obligations under the charter.  I feel that I should dispel any misunderstanding that may exist concerning the question of military commitments under the Charter of the United Nations. Article 43 of the charter reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I.  All members of the United Nations, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance, and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security.</P>
    <P>2.  Such agreement or agreements shall govern the numbers and types <Col N="138" /> of forces, their degree of readiness and general location, and the nature of the facilities and assistance to be provided.</P>
    <P>3.  The agreement or agreements shall be negotiated as soon as possible on the initiative of the Security Council.  They shall be concluded between the Security Council and members, or between the Security Council and groups of members and shall be subject to ratification by the signatory States in accordance with their respective constitutional processes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From this Article it is clear that the contribution which any State member can be called on to make to the maintenance of international peace and security depends on the special agreement or agreements which that State has made.  There is, consequently, no form of commitment that follows automatically on acceptance of membership.</P>
    <P>Our financial obligations to the United Nations are fixed by the General Assembly on recommendations of the Committee on Contributions. Following the admission of the 16 new members, the committee has recommended a revised scale of contributions under which Ireland's share would be 0.19 per cent. of the total budget.  This contribution cannot be definitely fixed until considered and accepted by the 11th General Assembly towards the end of the present year. In arriving at the provision of £55,000 under sub-head C (1) of the International Co-operation Estimate, my Department worked on the basis of our contribution being at the rate of approximately 0.21 per cent. which had already been fixed in respect of our participation in certain U.N. activities.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity that the Dáil has had of discussing foreign affairs since we were elected to membership of the United Nations.  I know the House will be interested to hear something from me as to how the Government views this new development and to have some information about the general lines of our policy as a member of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>I may say, then, at the outset that <Col N="139" /> the Government welcomes the admission of Ireland to the United Nations as a proper and necessary consequence of our national sovereignty and our membership of the family of free and independent States.  I am sure that that attitude will be shared by all thinking people in the country.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is essentially the organisation, and the principal meeting place of the independent States of the world.  It is almost universal in its membership&mdash;certainly more universal than the former League of Nations ever was.  For us to turn our backs on such an organisation, to abstain from membership and cut ourselves off from the great centre of international activity which the United Nations has come to represent, would be tantamount to committing ourselves deliberately to a position of isolationism and insignificance in world affairs. I do not believe that that is a position which is likely to commend itself to many people as a national objective. It would be contrary to the ideals of those who worked and struggled to achieve our national freedom and independence; it would be contrary to the principles on which our foreign policies have been based since the foundation of the State, and, in my belief, it would be contrary to our national interests.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here, of course, with a very important decision of national policy.  What is involved is nothing less than the basic principle on which our policy towards the outside world and its problems is to be based.  We must not only decide clearly what that principle is going to be; we must also be clear in our own minds as to the reasons for our decision.  The reasons, as I said just now, are to be found in our national traditions, in the external policies we have followed since this State was founded and in a proper appreciation of our own national interests. The men whose ideas inspired the movement which achieved the measure of national freedom we at present enjoy never conceived the Ireland of the future simply as a province with Home Rule, occupying itself exclusively with its own domestic concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> They had a broader vision and a higher ideal than that.  They wanted to see Ireland take her place among the nations of the world.  They believed in a frank co-operation between the nations as the best means of bringing about a world in which freedom and justice would be accepted as the fundamental principles of international relations. They hoped that, with our distinctive culture, our Christian social order and our traditional love of freedom, Ireland might have something to contribute towards bringing such a world about and that, by so doing, this ancient nation would gain esteem and renown among the nations of the earth.</P>
    <P>The foreign policies we have followed here since the State was founded have been entirely in line with these ideals and aspirations.  We became a member of the League of Nations at the first possible opportunity, and I think it can be fairly said that we played a worthy and a useful part in the work of that organisation as long as it lasted.</P>
    <P>After the war, the Government of the day applied for membership of the United Nations with the unanimous consent of the Dáil.  It was not our fault that our application was not accepted at the time.  We took an active part, however, in the setting-up of the O.E.E.C. and the Council of Europe and we have participated fully, and I think usefully, in the work of both those bodies since their establishment. We have followed a similar line of policy as regards the various international organisations concerned with technical matters.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, been a member of the International Labour Organisation since the twenties, and since the war we have become members of the organisations set up to promote international co-operation in regard to food and agriculture, civil aviation, health and various other matters.  These various activities, taken together, combine to form a coherent and logical picture, because they are all expressions of the same basic policy which we have followed fairly consistently ever since we had control of our own affairs. Briefly, that policy may be said to be that, wherever we have been offered <Col N="141" /> opportunities of international co-operation in keeping with our own national policies and interests, we have always taken advantage of them and done our best to contribute towards the attainment of the objects in view as a responsible member of international society.  Our acceptance of membership of the United Nations is a logical extension of that policy.  Not to accept membership of the United Nations would be a sudden and illogical departure from it.  It would leave us in the position of acting as a responsible member of international society in regard to the various organisations to which I have referred while at the same time choosing the path of isolationism in regard to the most important international organisation of all.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which it is worth bearing in mind, because in this matter we have to consider not only our duties as a member of the family of nations, but our rights and interests as well.  History warns us, and we ourselves know only too well from practical experience, that although wars and international crises may be brought about by the actions and rivalries of a mere handful of powerful states, their consequences in terms of hardship and suffering are felt in greater or lesser degree by all States without distinction and no country is so strong or self-contained as to be able to insulate itself against them.  International society is still fundamentally undemocratic in that way.  A handful of powerful States&mdash; even a single powerful State&mdash;can embark on policies which may involve the destinies of all.  The best hope of remedying that situation lies in international organisation.  In the creation of a forum in which the ardent desire for peace of the smaller countries of the world, which have nothing whatever to gain from wars, can find expression and in which a climate of opinion can be built up, and if necessary measures of concerted action taken, strong enough to constitute a decisive deterrent to any State contemplating aggression.  We may still be a long way from that position; but from the point of view of this country, and other small countries like ours, it is definitely a target to be aimed at; <Col N="142" /> because, as I say, it is only through international organisations like the United Nations that we can hope to have any real say or to exert any real influence on events which may vitally affect our whole national destinies.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the reasons why, in our view, our admission to the United Nations is something not only to be accepted, but indeed welcomed.  I turn now to another and no less important question, namely, what policy we should pursue at the United Nations and on what general principles our action as a member of the organisation should be based.  This, of course, is not a matter which we can discuss in relation to specific problems because there is no means of knowing in advance what particular situations and questions are likely to arise from time to time.  There are, however, certain broad principles of policy which we will do well to have always in mind in determining our attitude on specific issues; and, as I intend that these should form the basis of our policy at the United Nations, it is proper, I think, that I should take this opportunity of explaining to the Dáil what they are.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it should be our aim, not only to observe the terms of the charter scrupulously ourselves, but to insist as strongly as we can on the integral application of its provisions in any situation to which it is intended to apply.  As a member of the League of Nations, we invariably supported the strict application of the provisions of the covenant.  We should follow a similar policy as regards the United Nations Charter.  There is a fatal tendency in international organisations to shrink from the decisions required by their charters when they seem likely to give offence to powerful States and to get rid of problems which have become too ticklish or delicate by leaving them to conferences or meetings convened outside the scope of the organisation itself.</P>
    <P>So far as the United Nations is concerned, I think our policy should be to lean against such tendencies.  They can only result in weakening the organisation and destroying confidence in its value and efficacy.  I believe that <Col N="143" /> the more sincere and single-minded we are in upholding the principles of the charter, the more respect and influence we will come to enjoy as a member of the organisation.  The better also will our own interests be served, because, whatever interest we have in United Nations which is strong enough to safeguard peace and ensure the security and the national rights of its members, we can have no interest in an organisation which is so weak as to be unable to exert any real influence on events.</P>
    <P>In the second place&mdash;but closely connected with what I have just said&mdash; I believe that as a member of the United Nations we should try to maintain a position of independence, judging the various questions on which we have to adopt an attitude or cast our vote strictly on their merits in a just and disinterested way.  As Deputies may know, there is a tendency in some international organisations for the members to form themselves into geographical or other <i>blocs</i> or groups, which act together for the purposes of elections to committees and offices and hold meetings with a view to concerting their action and policies on specific issues.  The practice seems to be followed fairly widely at the United Nations.  To a certain extent, that may be inevitable; so far as we are concerned, however, our aim should be, I think, to avoid becoming associated with particular <i>blocs</i> or groups so far as possible.</P>
    <P>It is true that that may put us at a certain disadvantage when it comes to elections to committees and so on.  We need not be over-anxious about appointments of that kind.  My belief is that, on a long-term view we will better serve our interests, and gain more respect and influence for ourselves if by maintaining our independence we leave our hands free to pursue what may come to be generally recognised as a fair, helpful and constructive rôle.</P>
    <P>The attitudes we adopt and the courses we follow in virtue of the independence I have described must, of course, always reflect our own national traditions and objectives and the ideas and beliefs which we in this country <Col N="144" /> hold to be fundamental.  We must be guided, not by considerations of expediency or temporary advantage, but the moral concepts which our history has taught us to honour and which lie at the root of our culture and national tradition and outlook.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third of the principles which, in my view, must form the basis of our policy at the United Nations.  It must be our constant concern&mdash;indeed it is our moral responsibility&mdash;to do whatever we can as a member of the United Nations to preserve the Christian civilisation of which we are a part and with that end in view to support wherever possible those powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world in their resistance to the spread of Communist power and influence.  This, it seems to me, must be a principle not simply of our policy at the United Nations but of our foreign policy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the great ideological conflict which divides the world to-day, our attitude is clear, by geographical position, culture, tradition and national interest.  We belong to the great community of states made up of the United States of America, Canada and Western Europe.  Our national destinies are indissolubly bound up with theirs.  It is in our national interest that this group of states should remain strong and united, and that being so, it should be part of our policy as I conceive it to do what we can, consistently with our own views and policies and with our duty as a loyal and independent member of the organisation, to strengthen the influence of this group, to resist efforts aiming at its disintegration and to lend support and co-operation wherever possible to its individual members.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of this policy may not always prove easy and straightforward in practice.  Let me take just one example.  As Deputies are aware, the United Nations is at present faced with several specific questions resulting from a development which is widespread nowadays in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world&mdash;namely, the growing desire for self-determination <Col N="145" /> on the part of subject peoples and the rise of national feeling in opposition to systems of imperialistic domination surviving from the past.  It is impossible for us, with our history, to regard this general development otherwise than with sympathy.  Many of these national movements have drawn encouragement and inspiration from the story of our own national struggle, and the ideals of freedom and self-determination which they proclaim&mdash; ideals which are recognised and endorsed to-day in the Charter of the United Nations.  These are the same ideals as animated the Irish people in their struggle for independence.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent and insistent needs of the world to-day is a formula of action which will enable the undeniable claims of national feeling and the just and reasonable interests of European powers which have a major rôle to play in the defence of the free world, to be reconciled in such a way as to avoid resort to those measures of oppression which, in our view, must inevitably fail and to prevent those legacies of bitterness and resentment which can only impair the strength of civilisation's defences against the spread of Communism.</P>
    <P>It must be one of our aims in the United Nations to help in the search for pacific formulas of that kind, and in doing so we shall have to bear in mind, not only the sympathy we naturally feel for other nations justly struggling to be free, but the danger of conflicts of the kind I have described being exploited for the purpose of disrupting the unity and weakening the cohesion of the powers principally responsible for the defence of the free world.  As I say, the judgments it will be necessary to make in specific cases may not always be easy. All we can do is to make them fairly and conscientiously with due regard both to the moral principles and the wider issues of world policy involved.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if we play our part on the principles which have guided our policies since the State was established and on the lines which I have just stated, this country can make some contribution, as a member of the <Col N="146" /> United Nations, to the cause of peace on earth among men of goodwill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a somewhat comprehensive statement of Government policy in the United Nations Organisation and I am glad that he has done so.  Personally I would have preferred his statement of policy and his explanation of our commitments under the United Nations Charter to have been given at the time that our membership was accepted.  It was not done at that time but it is good that it has been done now.</P>
      <P>From a financial point of view, it will be pretty costly to be an active member of the United Nations Organisation, but, if we can do there, in that organisation, the work that was done in the League of Nations, and that our representatives have done in every international organisation for the promotion of better international harmony, I think it will be found to be worth the money.  I am glad that the Minister has appointed a very first-class official as our representative at the United Nations Organisation in New York.  We wish him every good luck in his arduous work.</P>
      <P>It was difficult to take down the various principle which the Minister outlined, the principles upon which our policy at the United Nations ought to be based.  With the first one stated, not one in this country will have any quarrel, that is, that we should support the application to all situations of the principles outlined in the Charter. The carrying out of that principle in detail may present great difficulty because a number of the problems presented to that organisation are just like other human problems, neither black nor white.  They are grey and mixed.  It will require great wisdom in the representatives of our country at the United Nations to make certain that, when carrying out that point of policy, the best possible thing is done to promote harmony and to bring about a state of affairs in the world when all disputes will be settled on the basis of law and justice, rather than on the basis of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second principle of policy which <Col N="147" /> the Minister outlined was to try to maintain a position of independence. Personally I think that it is very necessary that we should, in that organisation, as we have done in others, maintain our independence and not become a part of any tied group, bound by agreements to support one another, no matter what the subject matter up for discussion.</P>
    <P>We must remember, I think, that the United Nations Organisation is a name, but that it is not altogether a fact yet.  What we must try to do is to give, so far as we can within our resources, reality to the name.  We should try to do all in our power to promote the idea that this organisation should be gradually changed in its constitution, so that, in all matters coming before it, our members would have a voice in the settlement of affairs, and so that these questions would be settled on the basis of justice.  We must realise that the United Nations Organisation is dominated by the Security Council and by the permanent members of the Security Council.  That is a completely artificial situation.  I do not think it can last.  If it does last, it is bound to bring disaster, and not the development that all men of goodwill throughout the world would like to see&mdash;that there should be a real United Nations Organisation, based on international laws that would suit all members, large or small.</P>
    <P>It may be that this Security Council was the farthest that the group of men in San Francisco were prepared to go in order to accept even the name of the United Nations Organisation.  If we are to get rid of force as the basis on which international questions will be settled, the United Nations Organisation must work towards a balance between the greater nations and the smaller democratic nations. No matter what the organisation is, or how democratic it is, the larger nations will have an influence according to their size and, if there is to be real peace and development in the world, I think we will have to trust to that influence, rather than to the power of the veto, when questions come up for decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I think the Minister, in the third principle he outlined, departed to some extent from the first and the second which he announced.  It seemed to me, from what I could hear and as I was able to follow him, that he was rather tying himself up in his third point of policy.  There is no doubt that one of the reasons why Communism has had success in some parts of the world is because the non-Communist nations have not behaved as they should. There are sins that are common both to the Communistic states and to non-Communistic states.  Our acid test for all nations, no matter on which side of the Iron Curtain they may be, should be the test the Minister stated in the beginning of his speech he would apply to Russia, namely, that it is what is done that counts and not what is said. That, I think, should be our acid test and the acid test of our representatives in regard to all countries inside the United Nations Organisation or outside it.  Indeed, our own case and the support other nations are prepared to give it should be our acid test as to their <i>bona fides</i> when they talk about the freedom-loving nations and the desire to support and defend freedom-loving nations.  I think President Eisenhower was very wise when he said in effect&mdash; I cannot remember his exact words&mdash; that the nations should press people only to defend what they have and not to defend the freedom that other nations have and that is denied to them.</P>
    <P>This Estimate, as the Minister pointed out, has gone up by £60,000 this year.  In fact, apart altogether from our subscription to the United Nations Organisation, which is a fresh item, one characteristic of all Estimates for the Department of External Affairs under the Coalition Government in the first period of office and in this is that the expense is always rising.  Indeed, this year we are to spend almost as much on the United Nations Organisation as was spent altogether in 1948 when the Minister and his colleagues denounced the extravagance of the Fianna Fáil Government.  I know there are reasons for it, but the fact was that the Minister and his colleagues denounced the very vital expenditure undertaken by <Col N="149" /> Fianna Fáil in its various terms of office.  They should now have some little apology to offer to the people whom they deceived into voting for them by promising that they would reduce these expenditures and the consequential taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a rather comprehensive review of the various international organisations to which we are attached.  It is good that such a review should be given at least once a year.  I think that one of the organisations that has given the most practical results is O.E.E.C.  After its first few years of work to provide and agree upon the division of American support for Europe, it settled down to see how Europe could help itself.  That work was very excellently carried out, not only by the members of the organisation at the top but by the staff of O.E.E.C. itself.  A very excellent group of men were working in that organisation and indeed I am sorry that, from time to time, more heed was not paid to their advice on all sides. If we here had taken some of the advice that was issued by the O.E.E.C. experts from time to time I think we would be very much further on from an economic point of view. Our policies in trying to take three jumps ahead when one jump was all that was within our competence within a period of time has led us into grave difficulties and has resulted in creating a lot of the troubles the country finds itself in at the present time.  Be that as it may, I feel that, as time goes on, and as these lessons have been learned, the troubles we are in at the present time will help only to make the future brighter for our people, because they will be more realistic in their approach to economic and financial problems.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that the Charter of Human Rights is coming into effective operation and that not only various judicial committees are being set up.  We hope the judicial bodies will influence the future of Europe to ensure that the human rights that were agreed to in the charter by all nations will be observed by all.  We have a particular interest in that and we are interested, too, in a broad way to see <Col N="150" /> that the principles our members fought to have embodied in that charter are implemented.  In its drafting, the charter was influenced in a very substantial degree by the activities of our representatives on the drafting committee.  As the House is aware, Deputy MacEntee was a member of that committee and did excellent work.  It is a document of which we have every right to be proud both as Europeans and Irishmen and, as Irishmen and Europeans, we hope it will not remain a dead legal document but will become a live and active charter governing the relations of Europeans, one to the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the activities of the Department in regard to external trade.  While the total amount of money in question, the total value of the exchange of goods between our country and the countries with which we have agreements may not be very large at the moment, it has, in fact, grown substantially over a number of years, and I am sure that these trade agreements, which have been renewed this year&mdash;and, we hope, improved&mdash; will help us to sell abroad as much as is necessary to buy what we must import. In carrying out the negotiations for these agreements, the Department of External Affairs does very good work and we are glad to note that it has been successful in renewing a number of agreements made in the past and in making fresh agreements with other countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to the problem of Partition I think I can say that all in this House agree that one of the difficulties we have had to contend with in the past was the hopes raised by the then Taoiseach when he came back from Canada in 1949 and said that the whole problem would be solved in a few months.  The fact that he raised the people's hopes so high and set such a short limit upon the ending of the problem gave encouragement, I am afraid, to people who thought the problem could be dealt with more quickly than its nature would permit. Whether the time be long or short, the Irish people will not rest content until we have secured for the whole of Ireland the right to self-determination, <Col N="151" /> founded on the idea of human liberty and democratic freedom.  We are all united on that and there is no necessity to emphasis the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope that we shall have an opportunity in the Dáil of discussing the further conventions that are in process of negotiation in the Council of Europe when they come to be finally signed because it is important that any conventions signed by us or any important steps taken by the Department of External Affairs should be open to discussion here, not only from the point of view of informing members of this House but also so that the country at large will be made fully aware of what is happening and so that the people will understand what our representatives abroad are trying to do on these various organisations.</P>
    <P>We wish our team attending the United Nations Organisation every success and I am sure that in their actions they will be imbued with the same spirit as were other Irish teams which took part in international organisations in the past.  We hope their activities will result in raising the status of Ireland among other nations <Col N="152" /> and gain further goodwill for our people.  While we may not be very great in numbers, if we act wisely, I have no doubt we can do good work in the councils at New York.  There are plenty of problems facing the world which will be discussed there and in relation to which we have experience. I feel that, if our affairs are handled wisely, we shall help the United Nations Organisation to become really effective for the benefit of mankind and for the promotion of permanent world peace.  We must strive to give practical effect to the idea that was in men's minds in regard to the United Nations Organisation and help that organisation to grow into a truly democratic organisation in which decisions will be taken on a democratic basis, thereby giving better hope of greater and more peaceful progress in the future.</P>
