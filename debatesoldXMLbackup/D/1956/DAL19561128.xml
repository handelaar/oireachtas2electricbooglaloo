      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is now in a position to authorise the construction of the runways and airport buildings at Ballygarvan, in order to provide the facilities of modern air transport near Cork City which has a population of 120,000, and to give scope for the employment of the numerous workers now being laid off weekly from the hydro-electric schemes at Inniscara and Carrigdrohid.</P>

      <P>The question of providing an airport near Cork City is still under consideration and I am not yet in a position to make any announcement on the subject.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that a scheme for the improvement of Wicklow harbour was sanctioned by his Department over 12 months ago and that work on the project has been suspended for <Col N="1514" /> some months past, he will state (a) the reason for the suspension of this urgent work, and (b) when it is proposed to proceed with the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reconstruction of the South Quay at Wicklow harbour, which is a part of the approved works, was completed early this year.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Commissioners of Public Works, who are carrying out the scheme, that the preliminary stages for the other works have taken longer than was anticipated and that it is not now proposed to make a start on the site until next spring.  The reason for the postponement is that practically all the work to be carried out requires reasonably good weather, long hours of daylight, and&mdash;most important&mdash;low water spring tide conditions during the initial stages.  As the latter conditions occur between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock, morning and evening, at Wicklow, it would not be possible, due to failing light, to take advantage of them at this period of the year.  I understand that by commencing operations in the early spring it should be possible to make uninterrupted progress with the works until they are complete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information as to the retail price of 40 per cent. phosphatic manures.  The maximum ex-factory price on the 12th November was £12 5s. per ton.</P>
      <P>The effect of the removal of the customs duty on phosphatic manures on the 13th November was to create a free market in these manures and to leave the retail price subject to the normal competition between home-produced supplies and imported supplies bought at world prices.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the necessity for the repair and extension of bog roads in turf producing areas in South Kerry so as to enable turf producers to produce the maximum quantity required for the operation of the turf generating station at Deelis, Cahirciveen, and whether he will have money provided for this purpose from the National Development Fund.</P>

      <P>The need for works on private accommodation bog roads in <Col N="1517" /> the area of the Cahirciveen generating station will be examined by the E.S.B. in the light of tenders received by the board for the supply of turf.  Where works are considered necessary to facilitate the movement of turf these will be carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office and will be financed from an allocation which has already been made from the National Development Fund to meet the cost of such works in the areas of the four small generating stations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey that the Minister referred to in his reply, which he states will be carried out by the E.S.B., has been carried out and I am informed by the E.S.B. that it is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce to provide the money. They are prepared to go on with the scheme and to have the necessary production if the accommodation roads are repaired for the producers.  Is the Minister aware that, if steps are not taken now to assist the producers, no supplies will be available in 1957 and the result will be that the plant will have to close down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy misunderstands the position.  Perhaps if I give him the background, he will understand it.  In November, 1954, the Minister for Finance decided to make available a sum of £200,000 from the National Development Fund towards the cost of road works in the areas of the four small generating stations, which were to be fired by hand-won turf.  Tentative allocations have been made to the four areas, Galway, Donegal, Clare and Kerry, to the extent of £116,000, of which Kerry was allocated £19,250.  That was for the purpose of repairing county roads in the vicinity of the station.  That work has been carried out by the county council in Kerry and in the other areas concerned.  There is a sum of £80,000 still left, which is available for repairing <Col N="1518" /> bog-roads to facilitate the winning and the delivery of turf to the four generating stations.  The E.S.B. have been told to examine the matter in the light of the tenders received and in the light of the possibilities of turf being brought in from particular areas.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is little use in constructing a road in an area from which no turf will be offered to the station.  The E.S.B., therefore, have been told to examine the matter in the light of the tenders received and, if it is established then that road works are necessary in order to facilitate the winning and delivery of the turf and the E.S.B. so report, the Special Employment Schemes Office of the Board of Works will have the necessary works carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the E.S.B. did carry out the survey that he refers to, that is, the survey in relation to the prospective quantity of turf available in the bog areas?  That survey was carried out and the work that he refers to as having been carried out by the county council has not been directly of assistance to the turf producers.  What we are asking the Minister to do is to make this £80,000 that he refers to available for the production areas, and if he can expedite that, it will enable us and the people concerned to go ahead with production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that this money will be made available for the improvement of roads leading to bogs from which it is hoped to get the turf. If, as the Deputy says, the E.S.B. have dealt with that aspect of the matter and now know the roads to be repaired, then they have to report to the Office of Public Works and, perhaps, the Deputy would now pen another question to the Office of Public Works to see whether the E.S.B. proposals have reached that office.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the townlands of Riverstick and Ballymartle are included in the Belgooly area which has been considered for selection by the board on a number of occasions.  The area has not yet been selected as the returns for the area have not compared favourably with those for other areas still awaiting development in the Cork No. 2 district. The area will be reconsidered by the board in due course and the decision of the board will depend on how the returns for the area then compare with those for other areas awaiting development in the Cork No. 2 district.</P>

      <P>A suitable site has been offered for a large new school for senior girls and for infant boys and girls at Ballyfermot Upper and the planning of the school is being proceeded with.  Certain preliminary arrangements have still to be made before my Department will be in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of the school and before the Commissioners of Public Works will be in a position to authorise the invitation of tenders.  These arrangements will necessarily take some time to complete but every effort will be made to expedite matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the position with regard to boys will soon be somewhat relieved by steps which are being taken to enable additional accommodation for boys in the Ballyfermot area to be made available in the existing schools there.  As well as this, the schools for girls and infants at Ballyfermot Lower, which are at present partly occupied, are nearing completion.

Substantial school accommodation has already been provided.  A certain amount of it has been partly occupied and it is being completed.  There are at the present moment about 1,100 children being conveyed by buses to three different school centres in the city.  That is a matter that is having the serious and persistent attention of the Department. Questions did arise as to whether or not certain schools were necessary and doubt has been expressed on that now but the matter is one that is very seriously occupying the attention and consideration of the Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction is due to the extension of my Department's policy of selling thinnings standing, where that course is practicable.

      <P>Of course there is a certain amount of road work being done by contract now.  The system of having roads done by contract has been growing up for the past four or five years but that is only a small proportion of the employment content. The principal reason arises from the extension of the policy of selling thinnings standing where it is practicable to do that.  I should add that the reply I gave to the Deputy last week as to the number of men employed may be misleading.  The number given in that reply was 4,730.  For the current planting programme that number will be rising to about 5,190 in the middle of January.  I gave that information because Deputies might not readily appreciate why it should be that with an increased planting programme the number of men employed is reduced. That is not so, because the number of men will increase to 5,190 after Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House earlier this month, the prices paid to our producers for turkeys are determined mainly by the prices obtainable for our turkeys on the British market, which takes the bulk of our production. These prices are decided by demand and supply.</P>
      <P>As a result of very greatly increased supplies of turkeys in Great Britain the prices realised by our turkeys this year have so far been lower than those for the corresponding period last year; however, only a very small proportion of our turkey exports have yet been consigned.  As the market is an entirely free one, it would not be practicable to fix a price or pay a subsidy for turkeys.</P>
      <P>A market bulletin is issued by my Department to the Press and radio twice a week, which gives the prices and general market position in the principal centres in Great Britain and also the live-weight prices paid to producers at local markets here.  This is intended to guide our producers in marketing their turkeys.</P>
      <P>The most recent quotations on the home market show that up to 2/- per lb. live weight has been paid for good quality cocks and 2/4 per lb. live weight for good quality hens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it not been that at some time in the past, when another Deputy occupied the seat where the <Col N="1528" /> Minister now sits, Deputy Dillon, as he then was, advocated some such subsidies being paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's recollection deceives him.  I was constrained at one time to comment unfavourably on the folly of one of my predecessors in winding up Eggsports Limited at a time when that body might have been of great service to poultry producers but my remarks at that time have little relevance to the situation to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to explain how it is that the producer gets 1/3 to 1/6 per lb. as we have seen at the market recently and, when the purchaser goes along to the grocer or retailer two days later, he will pay 3/- per lb. for the very same turkey?  Would the Minister try to have some little bit of justice brought to bear on the situation, so that the primary producer and not the man in between will reap whatever benefit there is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy that the primary producer is entitled to first consideration.  But one must bear in mind that, if one buys a turkey on the market, one buys feathers, guts and all the rest.  If one buys a turkey in the poulterer's shop, one may buy guts, but not feathers and all the rest.  There is bound to be some difference then between the price payable in the retail shop and the price realised on the open market for the live bird.  I have tried, and I shall continue to try, to keep producers accurately posted as to market conditions on our own markets here and in Great Britain; but we must face the fact, from which there is no escape, that this year there are, according to the census returns, 264,000 more turkeys in Ireland than there were last year; that there are 785,000 more turkeys in Great Britain than there were last year; that there are 61,000 more turkeys in Northern Ireland this year than there were last year.  The Deputy may rest assured that any help the Department can give producers to secure for them the maximum value for the birds they have on offer will be given.</P>

All I can do is to try to keep producers fully informed so that there will be no possibility of their being unfairly exploited.  There is only one sure guarantee of securing for the producer the full value of his bird, and that is to follow the example of the farmers of Monaghan, Cavan and the surrounding counties who establish their own co-operative to handle their own fowl, with a guarantee that the entire return therefrom will find its way back to the producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pursuant to the announcement by the Taoiseach in his speech on October 5th that the Government had decided to arrange for the supply of superphosphate to farmers in Ireland at world prices, the customs duty on imported superphosphate was recently suspended, and, accordingly, the trade in this commodity is now on an entirely open market basis at world prices.  As also announced by the Taoiseach, the Government is ensuring that the entire output of the Irish fertiliser industry will be taken up at prices which will enable them to continue operating at their full capacity. Plentiful supplies of fertilisers generally are at present available to meet all <Col N="1532" /> requirements.  Nitrogenous and potassic fertilisers, to which world price conditions also apply, are now slightly cheaper than last year.  It appears, however, that world conditions may restrict supplies of phosphates and that the prices for superphosphate may show some increase, as a result mainly of higher shipping rates in obtaining rock phosphate from North Africa.</P>
      <P>In view of the possibility of diminishing supplies, I urge the farmers to buy and use all the phosphates they can get now on their land, in accordance with the expert technical guidance readily available to them, and so increase agricultural production profitably for themselves and the nation.</P>

Is it correct that the price payable will be the world price for the commodity at the point of origin, together with all the additions representing freight, delivery and other costs, including retailing costs?

They are now available, and with world conditions as they are, freight rates may react upon the prices.  Availability may react on supplies and I would therefore urge upon the Deputy and his colleagues to join with me in urging on farmers everywhere to buy in now as much superphosphate as they can get their hands on, in the certain knowledge that whatever is put out now will be prudently and wisely put out, and that in future they have the guarantee that as supplies become available they will be available to Irish farmers free of tax or restriction of any kind no matter from whence they come.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I am informed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara that, in September last, buying agents from Prague informed a representative <Col N="1535" /> of the board that their suppliers in this country had failed to fill some £7,000 balance of a quota for pickled herrings to be delivered by 20th November, 1956, and inquired if the board could take up this balance.  The board's representative promised to see what could be done and, on the question of price should the deal materialise, he tentatively quoted a net price c.i.f. Hamburg.</P>
      <P>The agents in question protested that they had previously done business with a private firm here at a specified lower figure and it was then agreed to work on that figure subject to supplies being available.  It transpired, however, that the fish did not become available and no business was done by the board.  The board's quotation was applicable only to this offer and, in the event, neither the board nor the firm in question was in a position to meet the order within the time limit stipulated.  I am satisfied&mdash;and so I gather is the Deputy&mdash;that there is no warrant for any allegation that the private firm lost the deal as a result of the board's intervention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in reply to the previous question, vacancies for auxiliary postmen are filled from lists supplied by Employment Exchanges and from persons already temporarily employed.  When the vacancy arose at Drinagh Sub-Post Office, the Employment Exchange was unable to supply any names and a man was taken on direct.  Shortly afterwards it came to notice that there were, in fact, unemployed persons in the area.  The first appointment was accordingly cancelled and the Employment Exchange was again approached.  Two names were now supplied and the claims and qualifications of these persons, together with those of the person who had been taken on direct were. considered.  In the outcome, one of the persons nominated by the Exchange was selected as the most suitable.  No question of statutory requirements arises in auxiliary postmen appointments and the appointments are not permanent but temporary and terminable without notice.  In this case the man discharged was given a fortnight's notice.</P>

      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Potash and nitrogenous manures are not liable to duty.  Certain phosphatic manures are liable to the duty on superphosphates, ground mineral phosphates and compound manures mentioned at Reference No. 245 in the Customs and Excise Tariff.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the serious unemployment situation at present existing, as disclosed by the recent statement of the General President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, he will state what steps he proposes to take to deal with the situation and, in particular, what measures he proposes for the City of Dublin during the coming Christmas season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>As regards the general question of the measures taken by the Government to alleviate unemployment, I would refer the Deputies to the announcement made by the Government on 23rd instant as to the apportionment of the sum of £1,000,000 which is being made available for expenditure on certain projects of a public character during the remainder of the current financial year.</P>
      <P>As regards the Dublin area, the details so announced include provision for special employment schemes in urban areas, including Dublin. Employment in the Dublin area will also be given from the additional money at the disposal of the Office of Public Works and to be made available to University College, Dublin, for site clearance at Belfield.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation was requested on 24th instant to submit schemes appropriate for financing from an allocation of £100,000 for special employment schemes, which is supplementary to the sum of £206,000 available to the corporation at 1st April, 1956, from unexpended balances of earlier grants for such schemes, and to the percentage contribution which the corporation makes from its own resources towards the cost of the schemes.  It rests with Dublin Corporation, in the first instance, to prepare and submit suitable schemes for execution with the moneys now available.</P>

      <P>I would like to inquire how my question, which was originally addressed to the Tánaiste as Minister for Industry and Commerce, was transferred to the Department of Finance?  I cannot see from the wording of it how it came to be regarded as a Board of Works matter.  My original question was addressed to the Tánaiste and asked what steps he proposed taking to deal with the unemployment situation.  I find that the question was transferred to the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Government have some more comprehensive method for dealing with unemployment other than by way of relief schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that question for it affords me the opportunity of saying that the Government have made funds available to the Dublin Corporation for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and if the Deputy would go to Deputy Briscoe, Lord Mayor of Dublin, and ask him to make an announcement as to the readiness of the corporation to allocate a sufficient sum out of the £4,000,000 made available by this Government to the Dublin Corporation this year and next year for the purposes of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, he would do more to end unemployment in the building industry in the City of Dublin than all the clatter from Fianna Fáil during the past six weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to imply by that that the Government are to pass the problem over to the Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  What I mean is this: Deputy Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, has the money if he will disgorge it for the purposes for which it was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I should like to deal with that supplementary question.  I have informed the Dáil of the direct measures taken by this Government to assist in dealing with what I hope is the temporary unemployment problem in Dublin City.  Over and above what I have referred to in my reply, I want to inform the Dáil that the Dublin Corporation have been provided with £4,000,000 this year and have been guaranteed £4,000,000 next year and if Deputy Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and his colleagues want to help in resolving the unemployment problem in the building industry in Dublin City, the way to do it is to declare now what allocation they are going to make out of the £4,000,000 this Government are giving the Dublin Corporation which they never before got from any Government.  If Deputy Briscoe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and the Dublin Corporation, will announce now that they are allocating £500,000 of that £4,000,000 given to them for Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act purposes beginning on 1st April next, they will do more to help to resolve the problem of unemployment in the building industry in this city than all the clatter of Fianna Fáil for the last two months.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that every step will be taken to expedite the preparation and implementation of the plans referred to in my question, but I desire to reaffirm to the Deputy that the greatest contribution Dublin Corporation could make to the present situation would be to announce to the public the fact that they have in this financial year abundant funds to finance S.D.A. applications and that in respect of next year they will make £500,000 available.  It is the doubt as to whether the Dublin Corporation will make that sum available next year that is causing a great deal of the dislocation in the building trade, and I am utterly at a loss to know why they will not do it.  I do not conceal from the House or from the Deputy my sense of bitter resentment that the Dublin Corporation, by its outrageous refusal to make that declaration, should throw hundreds of men into unnecessary unemployment.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's remarks concerning the corporation, could the Minister inform the House how many fewer men are employed on Dublin Corporation housing schemes this month as against this month last year, and whether the basic cause of this reduction in employment on all corporation housing schemes is due to the failure of the Department of Local Government to approve plans submitted by the corporation and lying in the Department for months?</P>

Is the Minister not aware that, because of the difficulties in continuing this year's projected building programme, it has been announced there will be £215,000 available for S.D.A. purposes next year and that there is a grave fear that that sum will grow to the figure mentioned by the Minister?</P>

    <P>That the Waterford Gas Order, 1956, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 22nd day of November, <Col N="1551" /> 1956, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to extend the powers of statutory gas undertakings by a Special Order, which, before it is made, must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas may, by Resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions. Under the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, a gas undertaking desiring to obtain fresh powers is required to give public notice of its intention to apply for the making of the Order.  If there are objections to the making of the Order the Minister may direct the holding of an inquiry, in the light of which he may modify, or refuse to make, the draft Order.</P>
    <P>The City of Waterford Gas Company have applied to the Minister for a Special Order altering certain provisions of the City of Waterford Gas Acts and Orders, 1858 to 1949.</P>
    <P>The following are the principal objects of the proposed Special Order:</P>
    <P>(i) To increase the authorised capital of the company from £80,400 to £250,000.  The additional capital of £169,600, which may be raised by way of Ordinary stock or Preference stock, is required for the renewal and extension of the company's plant, the extension of supply mains to new housing areas in Waterford and the repayment of a bank overdraft.</P>
    <P>(ii) To increase the borrowing powers of the Company to an amount not exceeding the aggregate amount of the paid-up capital of the company. The additional borrowing powers may be exercised by the issue of debentures or debenture stock.  A development programme commensurate with such a considerable increase in its borrowing powers is not immediately contemplated by the company.  They wish, however, to obviate the necessity for seeking increased borrowing powers from time to time and are bringing these powers into line with <Col N="1552" /> common commercial practice by relating the permitted borrowing to the amount of paid-up share capital of the concern.</P>
    <P>(iii) To increase from £3,000 to £12,500 the maximum amount which can be set aside out of the net profits of the company in any year towards a redemption fund, to be applied in redeeming any loans, mortgages or debentures raised by the company.</P>
    <P>(iv) To authorise the continuing directors to act notwithstanding any vacancy in their number, provided that, if the number of directors holding office is less than three, they shall not act except for the purpose of filling a vacancy.  The City of Waterford Gas Act, 1858, fixes the number of directors of the company at not less than three and not more than five.</P>
    <P>(v) To authorise the company to capitalise undistributed profits, by making an issue of Ordinary stock to be distributed by way of bonus to the holders of the consolidated stock of the company.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the statutory requirements, notice of their intention to apply for the Order was given by the City of Waterford Gas Company. Notice was given (a) by publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a local paper and (b) by sending copies to Waterford Corporation, Waterford County Council, the E.S.B., and certain Government Departments.  No objection to the making of the Order has been received.</P>
    <P>The draft is in a form acceptable to the City of Waterford Gas Company and I now move that the House formally give its approval by passing the Resolution.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAFinlay1954" hpid="Mr. Finlay Mr. Finlay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finlay</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that I welcome the Bill in its general terms and its general purpose, particularly in so far as it provides consolidation and re-enactment of what had been a very considerable <Col N="1553" /> number of scattered statutory provisions.  Secondly, I do not think it would be out of place to state that this, like other law reform Bills which have come before the House recently, in its form and in the way in which it is presented to the House and in the manner in which the House has been assisted in trying to follow it, seems to me to be an excellent production and something in respect of which the Minister and his officials deserve considerable gratitude from the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general provisions of the Bill, I think it is only proper that straightaway I should make clear a point of view which occurs to me as being of considerable importance in principle and arising from the provisions of this Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill, as was explained by the Minister and also by the Attorney-General, at the commencement of the Second Reading, is, to a certain extent, considered desirable by reason of a situation which has existed up to this in which a husband could not sue his wife or a wife sue her husband for a motor accident.  As probably many members of the House are aware, great hardship has occurred on occasions to individuals by reason of that rule of law, particularly as very few laymen were aware of it and, accordingly, very few laymen were in fact insured against accidents caused by their own negligent driving to their wife while a passenger in their own motor-car and the very absurd and very tragic situation arose in which a man driving his own motor-car, as he thought, comprehensively insured and paying a premium corresponding with that comprehensive insurance, discovered that, whereas any stranger would be fully covered for injuries or loss or damage suffered by him or her as a result of accident, the man's own wife, who might suffer very serious injury and who might be involved in very considerable expense as a result of a motor accident, could not recover against the insurance company and, of course, could not recover against her husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a situation which, obviously, should be remedied.  Whilst there does not readily occur to me any other situation <Col N="1554" /> in which hardship was being imposed by the pre-existing rule of law that a husband could not sue his wife in tort or the wife could not sue her husband in tort, I accept that there may be other instances where that rule created hardship.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General in his speech on the Second Reading made it clear and the Minister made it clear that various alternative methods of correcting the anomaly and the hardship which arose from this rule had been considered and that eventually this particular method enshrined in Section 2, sub-sections (1) and (2), was decided upon.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should slavishly imitate in law reform any particular legal system and I am glad to say that in this Bill, for instance, as in several of the other Bills of law reform revision that have come recently before the House, we have taken what was considered most suitable and most appropriate from several different legal systems.</P>
    <P>We have left behind recent reforms, either in England or America or some of the Dominion countries, which do not appear to us to be reforms or to be necessary to Irish conditions.  It is of very considerable significance, in my view, that the only other common law State in which we meet a reform of the law applicable to the right of a wife or husband to sue each other in tort is the State of New York.  That State is the only place which has given to either husband or wife the full right and liberty of suing in tort and in contract as it is proposed in Section 2 of this Act.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge on the Minister a careful reconsideration, between now and the Committee Stage of this Bill, of the exact effect of Section 2.  The first matter which becomes obvious is that, apart from motor accident cases, it achieves the right of a wife to sue a husband or a husband to sue a wife, in instances which, to my mind, may be found to be undesirable. Apart altogether from negligence or nuisance, it leaves it open for actions to be taken by either party against the other for slander, assault <Col N="1555" /> or conversion, all of which would, if this section were left in its existing form, be available to a wife against a husband or a husband against a wife.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that, in so far as assault and slander actions are concerned, there is already available in the District Court a criminal procedure whereby a wife can sue a husband for a breach of the peace, or for conduct leading to a breach of the peace, or for assault committed by the husband or wife on the other party to the marriage.  One party or the other can be brought to court as matters stand at the present.</P>
    <P>I do not think, however, that that is a situation which should be changed or enlarged.  I think the right of a wife to bring proceedings of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature against her husband for assault, or threats of assault, is probably something which has existed for a very long time and I do not think it is one which should be largely increased.  The point of view which I would like to put before the Minister in regard to this matter is that, from the point of view of the lawyer, the section as it stands is tidy, neat and easy to deal with.  I am concerned as to whether or not it may not have purely social disadvantages.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had some experience of practising law, particularly in the country, will know that situations arise in which a husband or wife, possibly more often a wife, will seek legal advice on disputes arising in the ordinary way with the husband, or with the other party.  The disputes, or the causes of the disputes, will not amount to such serious or grave matters as would lead to a separation or which would lead any responsible lawyer to advise the institution of proceedings.  They often concern single assaults or possibly slander.  A wife may allege that a husband has spoken disparagingly to other people of her.  As the law exists at present, if the acts complained of should fall short of a very serious difference which entitles a person in this country to a legal separation, the only advice which can be given in such a case is that there is no legal remedy for what has <Col N="1556" /> happened and that it is best to go away and forget it and to tell them to settle their differences in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>I feel that, if you provide in a section such as there is in this Bill, a right for the wife to bring an ordinary civil action to punish her husband for a single assault and to obtain damages from him, many disagreements in a marriage which heretofore would have ended with the intervention of some helpful person, will now end up in an action in court and, when that happens, a considerable amount of bitterness will ensue on both sides.</P>
    <P>Anybody's experience will indicate that, when a husband or wife takes an action against each other in court, and ventilate their grievances, either in public or in private, it will militate against any real settlement of their differences being achieved.  To give a wife the right to sue for a single assault or to give a husband the right to sue for slander for something said by the other party to the marriage, to give the right to sue for detinue or conversion, which is an allegation that one party has not dealt properly with the income of the other, or that the husband has taken part of the wife's money, which are common allegations in disputes, but which would not themselves constitute grounds for a legal separation, would be making matters worse instead of better in the ordinary relation between husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there are serious anachronisms and abnormalities in the law as it has come haphazardly down to us as regards husband and wife but I do not think it is necessary to go this far in the case of motor insurance.  We could easily find ourselves in the position that, in passing a Bill to rectify the position between husband and wife, we may make it easier or less difficult to have actions between the parties on other matters.  That is a point of view I would like to put before the Minister very strongly.  It is my own personal approach to the social implications of the section.</P>
    <P>There is one other point As I read the section, particularly paragraph (d) of sub-section (1), a husband can sue <Col N="1557" /> his wife in ejectment under this section. Now, if I am right in that, and I think I am, that is highly undesirable. At present the position is that one party to a marriage can exclude the other party by ejectment action from the marital home only if the person seeking to eject can establish to the court that the other party has been guilty of conduct which would entitle the plaintiff seeking an ejectment to a separation, were he or she to ask for it in the proper proceedings.  That is the only basis on which a husband can eject his wife from his house or a wife can eject her husband from her house.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) states that a wife shall &ldquo;be capable of suing and being sued, either in tort or in contract&rdquo;.  Then one comes to sub-section (2) and finds that that &ldquo;shall apply as between a married woman and her husband in like manner as it applies as between her and any other person&rdquo;.  I think that the answer must be that if that section is enacted in its present form, then a husband can immediately apply by ejectment proceedings to exclude his wife from his house.  If that is so, the only thing he would have to prove is that he owns the house and that he does not want his wife there any longer.  The same would apply to a wife who owns the marital home.  There is no doubt that would be a most serious consequence, if I am correct in my interpretation of the section.  I am not confident I am correct and, therefore, I ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am confident that I rightly interpret the section with regard to the more general point I made at the commencement.  Paragraph (d) gives the right to sue in tort and contract. I may be expressing groundless fears and, if I am, well and good, but I would like the Minister to consider very carefully whether or not the purpose of Section 2 could not be achieved by confining the general right to sue to contract in which it is desirable that each party in the marriage should be separate, or, better still, confining sub-section (2) of Section 2, which applies this as between a husband and wife, to cases of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle, or even to cases of <Col N="1558" /> negligence, if you want to make it as wide as that, but not to provide for all torts or, in particular, exclude expressly the torts I have mentioned, slander, assault, debt or conversion. There are many alternatives for dealing with the situation.  I would ask the Minister to consider between this and the Committee Stage some cutting down of the general power provided should not be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 3, I would like the Minister to consider between this and the Committee Stage as to whether Section 3 would inadvertently alter the descent of property of the wife under intestacy.  It does seem possible that to provide that all property which the wife has should belong to her as if she were unmarried would inadvertently cut across the existing provision that on her death, intestate, all her property goes to her husband.  There is at least a possibility of that.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I am concerned, and I would ask the Minister to consider it also between this and the Committee Stage, is a matter which was dealt with at some length mainly by the Attorney-General, namely, restraint on anticipation. I appreciate this is a highly technical matter and from the point of view of legal history there is very little to say for it.  Like many legal doctrines it arose more by accident than by intent, as far as one can see and, like many legal doctrines, it was applied for a purpose for which it was never originally intended.  To that extent it should go, particularly as it is now being used as something to defeat creditors rather than as something to protect married women.  The possibilities envisaged when it was first introduced as a doctrine for the defence of married women are quite inapplicable to modern times.  What I am concerned with, however, is the method of its abolition.  In so far as any settlement made after the date of the passing of the Act, I would be wholeheartedly in favour of it.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech and from the Attorney-General's explanation that they considered very carefully the question of making this <Col N="1559" /> retrospective.  There are grave arguments in favour of making it retrospective, the most forceful being that mentioned by the Attorney-General, namely, that a great number of people who have settled property on married women did so in complete ignorance of the doctrine of restraint on anticipation. In other words, they settled it on a certain basis, the terms of the deed of settlement containing certain express provisions, and they were probably quite unaware that there was, superimposed on those express provisions, other restricting provisions by virtue of this doctrine.  That is a good argument in favour of retrospective abolition, but it does seem to me that what is being done here is advocating an extraordinarily dangerous principle.</P>
    <P>Now, the most usual case is that in which a man settles property on his daughter on her marriage, a man who, for his own good reasons and knowing the situation and the personalities involved, avails of the doctrine of restraint on anticipation and does so because he wants to provide against some very definite and present fears with regard to his daughter's property. If an Act passed by this House were to alter that settlement and to remove what that man considered to be suitable safeguards provided for his daughter's property, I think strong justification would be needed to substantiate that.  I appreciate that many arguments have been advanced in justification of such a move, the main one being that for every one case such as I quote, where a man consciously invokes this doctrine in order to achieve a particular purpose, there will probably be ten cases in which a man unconsciously and inadvertently invokes this doctrine without meaning it to have any effect and will be astonished if one tells him exactly what it does mean.</P>
    <P>In so far as past settlements are concerned, I have a feeling that, even if only a very small number of people have their express purposes defeated retrospectively, that would be a sufficient injustice to outweigh whatever remedies or cures are effected by the section in other cases.  I might <Col N="1560" /> suggest that, if the Minister thinks there is anything in the point, a remedy still surely does exist in so far as it is possible to frame the Act to make restraint on anticipation no longer applicable to any settlement made after the passing of the Act and in addition, provide, in so far as settlements made before the passing of the Act are concerned, that there shall be a much wider discretion in the High Court than exists now under the Conveyancing Act to relieve that restraint and, furthermore, that the method of procedure shall be very summary, very direct and very inexpensive.</P>
    <P>I see no reason at all why it should not be possible to contrive a method whereby an independent judge of the High Court, say the President of the High Court, could not be approached on something like a minor summons, that is to say, something comparable to a summons in a minor case, to bring a document leading direct to him without any expense, without previous court procedure, and without any procedure before the Master of the High Court, whereby the parties with very little expense could interview him and ask him to lift the restraint on anticipation.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion not on the basis that I think it is any longer applicable or any longer wise, but merely on the basis that there may be people who make settlements relying on that document to break the restraint.  I think this House should be slow to disturb that position.  These are the only matters in general which I would like to put before the House on the Bill.  In so far as it brings up-to-date with social conditions the status of married women, I greatly welcome it; as far as it consolidates the legislation at present existing, it is a godsend so far as practising lawyers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The points about anticipation and about the possibility of affecting the testacy of a woman under the Married Women's Property Act are minor points compared with what I consider is the more major matter, the right of a wife to sue her husband in tort.  I would like to re-emphasise my concern <Col N="1561" /> with that section.  It is not a lawyers' concern nor a question of making a provision which will be awkward or out of tune, but I think it is a social concern.  It is concern lest in the attempt to tidy up the law we may create a situation in which husbands and wives will find it easier to part, or easier to follow the temptation to part, than they do at present in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finlay with all his legal knowledge and experience is competent to criticise the Bill; I, as a layman, have not got that competence and anything I say would be rather in search of information than anything in praise or criticism of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay finds the Bill good in spots, like the curate's egg.  I agree with him that in relation to the matter of present legislation, the Bill is very badly needed; but I read in Section 2, sub-section (e) that a married woman shall be subject to the laws relating to bankruptcy and to the enforcement of judgments and orders as if she were unmarried.  It seems that as we go on through the sections that that particular sub-section is almost put aside.  I find that the Minister's brief says that the Bill is in fact a codification of all the law concerning married women.  It goes on to say that the object of the Bill is to put the married women in the same legal position as single men and women.  It means to get rid once and for all of all the disabilities under which married women at present suffer &mdash;I assume he means legal disabilities &mdash;in their property and also in regard to their ordinary rights in contract and in tort.  These are all the Minister's words.  It seems to me that the Bill does embody something more than codification of existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I read it, the Bill is directed towards endowing husband and wife with separate personalities before the law in the matter of ownership, use and administration of possessions or property, and if I am correct in that belief, based on the Minister's statement that the Bill is to put married women in the same legal position as single men and women, then, in my view, Section 7 is entirely illogical and <Col N="1562" /> its acceptance defeats the object of the Bill.  It destroys the accepted principle of equality before the law which it is intended to ensure.  It does in fact impose on both the husband and wife a specific disability.  Marriage, apart from the special significance it has for a man of my religious faith, is a unique contract and if mutual respect, cooperation and aid do not enter into it, it cannot be made operative.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises that fact when he says &ldquo;she&rdquo;&mdash;the wife&mdash;&ldquo;may need a little capital for her own or for her husband's business, if, in spite of his efforts as head of the family, the head of a family is affected in his business by a period of financial stringency&rdquo;.  If, in his ambition for his family, he proposes to expand his business is it not obvious that his wife whose interests are in the same measure involved will, if she has property, be the first person to come to his aid, the first person to whom he will confide his difficulties and for whose help he will appeal?  Why then should the claim to salvage some of her property in the case of his bankruptcy be denied to her and why should she in this case be denied the status of a single man or woman, which she is denied by the section?  This is the proposal which the Bill makes to give her the same status as that of a single man or woman.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to that section.  I think it is unjust.  I believe it should be deleted, and referring back to sub-section (e) of Section 2 where it is provided that the woman shall be subject to all the laws relating to bankruptcy as if she were unmaried, it seems to me that this section is entirely illogical.  The lawyers in the House will bear with me because of my unfamiliarity with legal instruments when I put the point of view that in Section 9, sub-section (4) a new principle in law is being introduced. Even though for the moment it may be limited in purpose, it is an abrogation of a very wise and ancient code&mdash;that a wife may not be called upon to give evidence against her husband.  It seems to me that a legal principle, once admitted, tends in time to override limitations. Law is intended to protect, not to disrupt, <Col N="1563" /> and if we are to accept this principle we shall have to rewrite the terms of contract.</P>

      <P>In general principles at any rate there can be no quarrel about the proposals now before the House in this Bill.  First of all, I want to join with Deputy Finlay in his tribute to the draftsmanship of the draftsmen responsible for it.  It is a very noticeable feature of Bills coming before the House in recent times and is one to be commended.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we must welcome the Bill.  Of course a welcome can always have reservations and I have no doubt the anxieties expressed by previous speakers are genuine and made with a great degree of sincerity.  Speaking entirely personally I do not share those anxieties with regard to the husband and wife being able to sue each other mutually in tort or contract or otherwise.  I would not have the slightest worry about a situation of that kind obtaining because, as I hope to show in defence of my argument on the various provisions of this Bill, I think it would be a good thing socially, apart entirely from the legal situation, if husbands and wives were mutually aware of remedies which they might not necessarily put into effect but which they knew were there for their own protection; it would be much better particularly that the offending party knew the remedy was there and knew it could be exercised against him or her if needs be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finlay is worried that where a provision falls short of providing grounds for a legal separation there should be a remedy.  He seems to think the existing situation should obtain where legal advisers say: &ldquo;There is no legal remedy for this so you had better go home and iron out your difficulties.&rdquo;  Cannot all sensible people realise what the position would be in what are, happily enough, isolated cases when an offending husband or an offending wife would come to the full realisation that if their conduct falls short of what would give grounds for a legal separation, and where there is no legal remedy, they can go on and <Col N="1564" /> on and on misbehaving and still being careful to keep outside the grounds for a legal separation.  Such a condition of affairs has been intolerable and a remedy should be found for it.</P>
    <P>Under the Married Women's Property Act of 1882 the position is that by virtue of that statute the wife has the right to sue her husband for the protection of her property.  The only change in this Bill is in respect of torts other than torts against her property.  The other point raised as to devolution has not been touched upon in this section.  I do not think it is intended that this Bill, or the provisions of Section 2 of it, should in any way affect the devolution of the property of a married woman.  I would like to think that, a man who was the master of his own house, or a woman who was the mistress of her own house, should have a remedy to correct something that might be going on which might be objectionable either to the woman or to the man.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Moylan, he was obviously referring to competent or compellable witnesses as defined in the Evidence (Amendment) Act of 1853, the Evidence Act of 1869 and the Act of 1877.  In every one of these cases either party are compellable witnesses except in the case where adultery is alleged against either spouse.  In criminal proceedings wives are always regarded as competent witnesses on the application of the person charged only.  Under the Criminal Justice Evidence Act of 1924 in cases of personal violence a husband or wife is a compellable witness in common law but in other cases the statute precludes them.  Though they may be called upon, they may refuse to give evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill makes no change in the case of the competence or compellability of witnesses either male or female.  This is a Bill the general provisions of which should be welcomed not alone by legal practitioners and legal historians but <Col N="1565" /> socially and from the point of view that in its provisions it shows a definite advancement not alone on social conditions but on our civilisation.  This Bill is intended to take away every trace of the days when married women were known as &ldquo;the spoiled children of the Court of Chancery&rdquo;, and it is interesting to note that married women were, up to now, included in our law in a very odd assortment.  We had them included with minors, persons of unsound mind and convicts.</P>
      <P>While I do not see any great objection to having them included with the young, or indeed with their being young themselves, I should like to see them taken out of the categories of the mad and the bad.  In addition to having them lumped together in that way with infants, lunatics and convicts, you have them again divided into three separate categories known as <i>feme sole, feme covert</i> and <i>feme discovert.</i> Translated and shorn of its legal meaning that simply means a single woman, a married woman and a widow.  Strangely enough, the only one of them that the law up to now sought to protect and in fact did protect was the married woman.  The single woman was, so to speak, on her own.  The widow was on her own, but the law, for some queer reason or other, always insisted that the married woman needed protection whereas in fact socially it had to be accepted that when a woman married she was leaving the protection of her own parents and home and had found a new protector.  Nevertheless, the law did not appear to be satisfied with that and insisted on giving her further protection still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, the Court of Chancery was following the principle that the wife in former times, and indeed up to now, was in some respects regarded as a kind of chattel, some part of a man's property which he owned, lock, stock and barrel. Then the Court of Chancery began to treat her as &ldquo;a very delicate flower&rdquo; indeed.  That might be very desirable from a social point of view but to have the protection of the court afforded with such elaboration is something that does not commend itself to me <Col N="1566" /> and I do not think would commend itself to anybody socially interested in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>It was a curious reaction to the marital promise where a man promised to bestow on his wife all his worldly goods.  I think the wording is, if I recollect it accurately, &ldquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow&rdquo;.  The net result of all that was that he got everything and she got nothing.  In our ancient Irish proverbs there is a description of it.  The old Irish people used to say and still say: &ldquo;Is fearr bean ná spré, ach i dteannta a chéile is fearr iad&rdquo;.  Of course, that translated literally probably does not convey the full wisdom of the proverb.  It simply says: a woman is better than a fortune, but the two together are better.  You have got the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; there&mdash;a morally good woman, a practical woman, a good housekeeper, a careful, reliable spouse, are all included in that one word&mdash;that such a woman was infinitely better than getting a fortune with somebody who would be utterly worthless.  The law concerned itself simply with the dowry or fortune, as it is known, and paid no regard to the human qualities apart from that.</P>
    <P>In this Bill a married woman will be able to stand on her own feet.  She will be able to sue and land herself in the position of being sued just the same as a single woman.  That expression we had in the law, and still used outside the law, the <i>feme sole</i>, will disappear for ever.  Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill will abolish the notion of separate property, a notion that had unfortunately been preserved in the Married Woman's Property Acts, and the position with regard to a married woman will now be the same as that of a single woman.  They may sue their husbands in tort and their husbands may sue them.  Deputy Finlay has already given a very full and clear explanation of the position obtaining with regard to motor insurance and I do not think it is necessary for me to dwell any further on it.  This covers a very peculiar anomaly which existed up to now that the wife, who was very badly injured in an accident being driven by her husband, even <Col N="1567" /> though comprehensively insured, was not insured herself unless there was some special separate cover for her.  I think that is the only place where this will have any practical application because I do not at all share the anxiety of other speakers that this will be abused.  As I said before, I think it is a very good thing that people should know there are remedies there and sensible people will take cognisance of the fact that if such remedies are invoked against them it will very probably have a very helpful effect on their conduct.</P>
    <P>This Bill will put the married woman into the same position as her child. The child could take action against the father but the wife could not.  I doubt that there will be any other type of action that will be either trivial or vexatious because I can scarcely imagine, for instance, a husband or a wife suing each other for slander or libel as the case may be.  That brings me almost automatically to the consideration of Section 10 of the Bill. At the moment a husband is responsible for his wife's torts.  In other words, if she slanders somebody the husband is joined for conformity, as we say in the law, and made liable for costs and everything else.  That situation may not apply to all but there are cases where you find women can be quite difficult in the matter of dealing with their neighbour's character; and it is a worry to husbands to have themselves in the position of being liable for every careless or malicious word uttered by their wives whether it be at a tea party, at a bridge party, over the garden wall or any other sort of social gathering where women meet and sometimes outside the ordinary run of the conversation tend to delve into the malicious, the libellous and the slanderous.</P>
    <P>Considerable time has been given already by the Minister, the Attorney-General and Deputy Finlay to this question of restraint on anticipation. If my recollection of restraint on anticipation is correct, it is contrary to what Deputy Finlay says that it came about by accident.  It did not. The late Lord Thurlow, mentioned by the Attorney-General, invented this <Col N="1568" /> particular thing and he is said to have invented it for, of all things, the protection of a relative of his own.  That could not be construed as an accident in any shape or form.  Certainly it was invented at a time when he had reached an age at which his mind might not be quite as clear as it might.</P>
    <P>At one time the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, when pleading for the abolition of the Public Authority Protection Act of 1893, said, if I recollect it correctly, that the late Lord Hailsbury was still stretching his hand out from the grave to deny the people their rights.  In the Public Authority (Judicial Proceedings) Act of 1954 we got rid of Lord Hailsbury's outstretched hand depriving people of their rights and in this Bill we propose to get rid of Lord Thurlow and his invention of restraint on anticipation.</P>
    <P>This doctrine of restraint on anticipation was not considered as a very great principle by subsequent British Chancellors but they felt as Lord Eldon said that he considered it was too late to do anything about it.  The principle of being unwilling to change seems to have operated very much in those days and accordingly he did not question it, because it had already been done by Lord Thurlow and his successor.  The idea of restraint on anticipation was to protect the wife from, as it was put, &ldquo;The kicks and from the kisses of her husband.&rdquo;  In time, of course, it extended much further and allowed her defraud her creditors.</P>
    <P>On that point, a married woman, being able to defraud her creditors in that way, was using her property to the detriment of others and was accordingly flouting the accepted principle that you can do what you like with your property provided you do not injure others.  Section 7 of the Bill is simply doing that.  An English lady lawyer, speaking upon this doctrine of restraint in anticipation, although she supported it, said that it would not be necessary &ldquo;if men were not such cads.&rdquo;  So, this Bill is now putting a married woman in the position of being able to stand on her own feet but also puts mere men in <Col N="1569" /> the position of getting ourselves out of the category, described by the lady lawyer, of being &ldquo;cads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Abolishing restraint does not mean that a husband can get at his wife's property.  She need not capitalise her income, if she has a fixed income settled upon her in any way, if she does not want to, and she is protected from her husband's &ldquo;kicks&rdquo;, as it were, in that respect by the provisions of Section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 2 allows the wife to sue her husband civilly for personal injuries. Most restraints are instituted <i>pro forma</i> and sometimes are attached to the property of a woman while she is still a baby and, therefore, at a time when the settlor, that is, the person making the provision for her, has not the faintest idea whether she will or will not need protection when she gets married.</P>
    <P>A learned English lawyer, Viscount Simonds, put the position this way: Does any father ever say to himself: &ldquo;I do not want to protect my single daughter; I do not want to protect my daughter when she becomes a widow but I do want to protect her when she is married&rdquo;?  That fundamentally is the effect of restraint upon anticipation.  It is a relic of days that are gone and I certainly welcome its abolition in the terms of this Bill.  It was technical; it was elaborate; it was difficult and all such technical and elaborate arrangements designed to fetter property in that way are ill-advised, not alone from the public interest point of view, but from the point of view of the person concerned. If I give two examples from our own law here of how restraint in anticipation works, it will probably be better understood as to why it should be removed.</P>
    <P>There was a case entitled <i>In Re Sawyer's Trust, 1896,</i> 1st Irish Reports, 40 M.R.  That was a case where a married woman had settled personalty on herself for life with a restraint clause.  The restraint was removed in order to allow £500 to be raised by the trustees to allow her son to set up as a practical farmer, thus <Col N="1570" /> relieving herself and her husband (who had a life interest in the remainder of the property) of the expense of maintaining the son.</P>
    <P>That was a case where, if restraint in anticipation was not there, the £500 could have been given to that son forthwith.  What had to be done? The restraint was lifted but only for the specific purpose.  The court had the power to do it.  The principle that emerges from that case is this, that the court has only power to lift a specific restraint; it has no power to lift restraint in a general way.  In order to remove that and to give the son the £500, the mother had to go to court with all the consequent expense involved in such proceedings.</P>
    <P>There was a second case&mdash;<i>In Re Lavender's Policy, 1898,</i> 1st Irish Reports, page 175 C.A.  In that case a married woman effected, in 1885, an insurance on the life of her husband for a period of ten years, and under the policy, described in the margin as &ldquo;wife's policy&mdash;endowment,&rdquo; the amount insured was made payable to her for her sole use if she and her husband both survived that period, which event happened.  The policy was made on condition that certain provisions and requirements annexed to it were to be taken as part of the contract. One of those was &ldquo;This policy is not assignable&rdquo;.  It was held that there was a restraint upon anticipation and that an attempted charge upon the policy during the currency of the ten years was void.</P>
    <P>That was a case in which a married woman could not change the policy, even with her own insurance company, in order to raise money, although a single woman or a man could do so and could charge an insurance policy of a similar type.  That was a case where the married woman imposed the restraint herself.  It was not imposed by any settlor for her.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in regard to restraint upon anticipation that there is no trace of it in Scots law and if any people's habits of living, of thrift generally, modes of life, compare very favourably with ours, it is the Scots. They have not got restraint on anticipation <Col N="1571" /> and it would be well to follow them in that respect.</P>
    <P>Another of the old rules of the common law which needs examination is the doctrine of consideration and this Bill, when amended, will have made another inroad into that doctrine by allowing the <i>jus quaesitum tertio</i> to operate within the family.  Here again we could do well by following the Scots.  It is reasonable to suppose that when Section 11 of the 1882 Act, that is, the Act in relation to married women's property, was being enacted, the lawyers who framed the Bill had a horror of allowing a third party to sue on a contract and saved their faces by introducing from Equity the cumbrous method of the trust where life insurance policies were concerned. Otherwise, the solid citadel of consideration might totter and that, of course, could not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, will make life easier for everybody.  In future, the doctrine of restraint will be as dead as Queen Anne and it will be only a concern of the legal historian. It will no longer be a problem for the practical lawyer or an injustice for the married woman.</P>
    <P>The repealing of all these statutes set out in the Schedule will be a boon to anybody who has to find out what the law is.  Here we have, not alone a consolidating Bill but a reform Bill, rolled into one, and bringing everything up-to-date.  If, for instance, by some queer accident of fate, the whole of our country was destroyed and this record was left, it would show that our civilisation had advanced to a degree that was amongst the foremost in the world in this particular respect because the status of the married woman in society is to a very great extent a useful yardstick of our advancement in civilisation.</P>
    <P>The whole position of the married woman has been a very extraordinary one.  In Bacon's <i>Abridgement,</i> edited in 1832, he says that husband and wife are one according to common law.  The actual quotation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The law looks upon the husband and wife as one person and therefore <Col N="1572" /> as of only one will between them which is placed in the husband.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure that each and every Deputy has heard the old story of the young couple returning from their nuptials.  When the excitement had died down and they were alone, the wife looked at the husband with great sincerity and with great love and said: &ldquo;John, dear, was it not lovely to hear the priest saying that we were one this morning.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, looking at her a little sternly, &ldquo;but do not ever forget that I am the one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That story is probably true and it is enshrined in the common law.  The Romans, whose system of law was extremely modern and up-to-date, regarding the position of the married woman, were much more advanced than we have been prior to the bringing in of this Bill.  Prior to Justinian's time the husband acquired nothing with his wife and anything that came to her during their marriage was hers. We, in 1956, are now bringing up-to-date a position which the Romans had before Justinian's time.  A married woman in Rome in those days had a complete legal status of her own and could own and deal in property.  She was quite independent.</P>
    <P>In all the other Indo-European legal systems the development is from the time at which the married woman had no legal capacity at all to the time when she had equal capacity with her husband.  One of the points of highly developed legal systems is that the legal position of the woman is equated to that of the man.  The original idea in all these legal systems is that a father protects his daughter in her early years; that a husband protects his wife in youth and middle age and that her son protects her in old age. That prevailing idea of the necessity for protection comes from the view that the woman was never supposed to be fit for independence.</P>
    <P>The giving of full legal capacity to the woman is also enshrined in old Irish law and is probably the most interesting thing of all.  At one time a married woman was included amongst her husband's family.  The original principle of total incapacity was before <Col N="1573" /> the principle of <i>condominium</i> and the position of the wife, with regard to contracts, was the same as that of her husband.  Further development contributed to a state of almost equality. Either could rescind disadvantageous contracts made by the other and related to the marriage property itself and in time both husband and wife could have separate property and either could dispose of their own property.  Finally, the wife obtained wide powers of independent contract. She further acquired control of her own contracts and the position arose where the wife was entitled to half the husband's honour price, that was compensation for a transgression against the man's honour.</P>
    <P>Old Irish law was certainly much more highly developed than the common law and here we are trying to get rid of the common law position in regard to the married woman.  In doing so, we are trying to reach the stage that most Indo-European nations have already reached, that the Romans reached before Justinian and that the old Irish law reached.  The old Irish law was much more developed than the common law in regard to the status of the married woman.  Professor Binchy in his <i>Studies in Early Irish Law,</i> published here before the war, dealt with the whole matter and it is on his contribution in this book that reliance is placed by me in making this statement with regard to the superior status of the married woman in ancient Irish law.</P>
    <P>There are people who hold that the ancient Irish State was a matriarchal State but historians are now more or less agreed that there is no foundation for this theory.  I accept Professor Binchy's view and in doing so I am putting this Bill to the House as a Bill that is going a long way towards establishing the position of the married woman as the position that existed in ancient Irish law before the coming of the common law.  We are hereby getting rid of the common law and ensuring a position that, if all our records or traces of our social laws were wiped out and only this one left, our civilisation would be measured by our advances in this regard and would be preserved for the world.</P>

      <P>Not being a lawyer I shall not detain the House very long on this measure.  My opinion about the Bill is that it is scarcely necessary at all but of course it is a good thing to have all this legislation about the married woman embodied in the one statute.  In all the talk we have heard from the Minister for the Gaeltacht he has not dealt with the point made by Deputy Moylan.  That is the discrepancy between Section 2 and Section 7. Undoubtedly, in Section 7, a married woman is not treated as a separate person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to any other individual and I think Deputy Moylan had a good point there.  In this case she is not being treated as an independent person.  She is certainly not being treated as if she were in the position of an unmarried person.  The same applies in the case of a man.  I think Deputy Moylan is right in that matter.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Moylan, I am not a lawyer and I was not aware that a wife could be compelled to give evidence against her husband.  As we are reforming the law here, as well as consolidating it, I think the law should be amended in that respect; a wife ought not to be compelled to give evidence against her husband and neither should a husband be compelled to give evidence against his wife.  If they elect to give evidence voluntarily, well and good, but we should take advantage of this Bill to amend the law in that respect now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> Section 18 says that &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall be construed as validating, as against creditors of the husband, any gift ...&rdquo; There is a common belief&mdash;I am sure it is not correct&mdash;that a man can get rid of his debts by passing on his property to his wife.  It is made clear in this Bill that nothing in this measure will validate that.  Apparently, though that belief is common, it is not the law.  I know of a case where a man got two houses built.  He did not pay the contractor and he passed the property over to his wife.  The contractor has not yet been paid.  I suppose if the contractor had taken the proper steps he could have compelled that man to pay, but there is a general belief that people can avoid their debts by signing over property to their wives.  I am glad it is made clear here that that is not the law.</P>
    <P>I approve of Sections 10 and 11.  If a woman owes money before her marriage, by all means let her creditors sue her.  A husband ought not to be held responsible for his wife's slanders and neither should a wife be held responsible for her husband's slanders. These two sections are quite all right.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 9 ought not to appear in this Bill.  With regard to Section 7, Deputy Moylan made the point that there is a contradiction between Section 2 and Section 7.  That contradiction will need to be cleared up.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker, I am not a lawyer.  For that reason I am somewhat disinclined to enter into this debate.  There is one section, however, about which I am not at all happy.  I refer to Section 2.  Sub-section (a) of Section 2 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sub-section (1) shall apply as between a married woman and her husband in like manner as it applies as between her and any other person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Finlay this evening and I was very impressed with what he said.  He spoke as a lawyer of considerable experience.  He cited instances.  He said that there are very <Col N="1576" /> often difficulties behind the scenes about which nobody knows anything; by virtue of this section, such difficulties may in future be brought into open court.  Unfortunately all marriages are not always happy.  As a medical man, I am quite aware of that. What this section does is to enable a husband or a wife to bring their own personal grievances into open court. Anything that enables married people to do that is most undesirable from every point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht said that the purpose of this section is to enable a husband or wife, as the case may be, to take action against each other in motoring accidents. Now I approve of that but, if they want to do that, why not include a simple section for that purpose and for no other reason? The word &ldquo;tort&rdquo; is used.  Tort means negligence.  It also means nuisance, assault and slander.  Why introduce such an extensive section as this? Why not introduce a simple section to cover what is intended?  Everybody would be satisfied with that and no one would have anything to say against it. The Minister for the Gaeltacht tried to tie up Section 2 with Section 10.  I agree fully with Section 10 and I hold that the two sections have no relationship whatsoever.  Section 10 simply means that a wife may be sued for certain things, things for which her husband will not be held responsible.  That has not the same effect at all as Section 2 because the wife may be sued separately in Section 10 and there is nothing to indicate any relationship as between husband and wife.  It is reasonable to assume that, if a wife is sued under Section 10, she can have the full support of her husband behind her.  At least, he would be with her in his sympathy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 bears a different interpretation altogether.  Section 2 can have very wide repercusions.  If a married couple have a dispute and seek legal advice, it will be possible under this section, if it is passed, that they will be advised that they have a particular action and that will help to weaken the marriage bond.  Any legislation we introduce here should not work in that direction.  I could never approve <Col N="1577" /> of that and I would ask the Minister to introduce some amendment to that section to cover what is intended, and only what is intended, namely, claims for negligence in motoring accidents or anything appertaining thereto.</P>

      <P>When I received a copy of this Bill my first reaction was to ask myself from what source did the demand for this Bill come?  As far as I can see, it is a Bill that has no urgency.  We are living in a rather critical period and we could be dealing with much more important legislation than this particular type of Bill.  I would like to know from the Minister from what source did the demand come at this precise time for this particular type of legislation?  As a layman, anything I may say on this Bill may not be legally correct but, nevertheless, I have heard a view expressed outside; it is a layman's point of view and it may, therefore, be of some little value.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay said that in certain circumstances it is desirable that husbands and wives should keep out of the courts.  This Bill is aimed at bringing them into court.  It provides the opportunity for husband and wife to sue each other.  I rather imagine it is undesirable from any point of view that we should be bringing about what somebody has described as equality. Can anyone imagine a husband suing his wife, bringing her into court, going through all the formalities that the court imposes, of giving evidence, undergoing cross-examination, or imagine the wife imposing the same ordeal on her husband?  Could anybody imagine that husband and wife would live in the same harmony after this as they had lived prior to the action taken by one or the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the marriage contract which has been in operation now for a considerable time has worked satisfactorily.  Does anybody suggest that this legislation which includes these provisions will make the contract any more solid or happier?  I do not think so.  My own view is that it will do inestimable damage, and from that point of view I do not see that this Bill is necessary at all, especially in <Col N="1578" /> view of the situation in which we exist.</P>
    <P>As the former Minister for Justice has stated, we shall be discussing this matter on the Committee Stage and it is quite possible we may find it necessary to put down some amendments to deal with some of the views that have been expressed from this side of the House.  I feel that there is no urgency whatever in regard to this type of Bill and I do not see, personally, why it was necessary to bring it in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Esmonde raised a point with regard to Section 2, but Section 2 is pivotal.  Without Section 2 in its present form the legislation need hardly have been introduced.  The reason why it was introduced was stated at column 832 in the report of the debate of November 8th.  The Minister put it this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To put it shortly, I may say that the object of the Bill is to put married women in the same legal position as single women and men.  In other words, it means to get rid once and for all of the disabilities under which married women at present suffer, not alone in regard to their property but also in regard to their ordinary rights in contract and tort&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very brief and simple explanation of the purposes of the Bill.  May <Col N="1580" /> I refer to what Deputy Traynor has mentioned and which apparently has been in the background of the thoughts of several Deputies while this legislation is being discussed?  Is it a bad procedure to allow husbands and wives to sue each other in the courts? An attempt is being made to create the impression that there are multitudinous husbands and wives ready to rush into court to sue each other for libel or slander or abuses of all kinds. I do not believe that is the case.  The legislation is for the odd case, and it will be a very odd case, in which the husband and wife wish to stand in court against each other.</P>
    <P>Again, is it suggested that there may be a lack of harmony in marriage because the partners are allowed to go into court one against the other, in circumstances in which they are living, apparently, at boiling point, anxious to sue each other for libel or slander or physical violence but are not allowed to come to court to expose this?  I cannot think that there would be any disharmony or that married life would be to any extent disturbed by the provisions of Section 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Attorney-General think it desirable that they should be allowed to go to court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, in the very odd case in which it would be necessary for husbands and wives to sue each other for the protection of rights.  If Deputy Allen would rather have the situation in which people would be living at boiling point and the only thing preventing them from going to court, even though they are fighting at home&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good provision.  Let us take sub-section (2) of Section 7, which is law at the moment.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the husband of a married woman has been adjudged bankrupt she shall not be entitled to claim any dividend as a creditor in respect of any money or other property... until all claims of the other creditors of her husband for valuable consideration <Col N="1582" /> in money or money's worth have been satisfied.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only change being made is that which equates the position of the husband in relation to his wife who has been made bankrupt. Section 2 (1) (e) says that a married woman shall be subject to the law relating to bankruptcy and to the enforcement of judgments and Orders. That means there is no longer this matter of whether or not she is trading on her own.  There is no limitation of any kind that may be adjudged against her because she is the owner of separate property.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finlay expressed a fear in relation to Section 3, that all property, whenever acquired by a wife, belongs to her as if she were unmarried.  On the Second Reading the Minister and myself referred to the fact that, except on one small point, this was not changing the law of inheritance. The one small matter that I mention was referred to at the end of the speech I then made when I pointed out there was legislation in connection with the administration of estates being brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies have asked why not relate the whole question of the position of married women to that affecting them in relation to cases arising from motor-car accidents.  We could not change the law merely in respect of the matter of motor accidents. With regard to the matter of ejectments, I am not quite sure that I get Deputy Finlay's point.  On the <Col N="1583" /> Second Reading I did point out that there was a case reported in the Law Reports where a wife obtained an injunction against her husband debarring him from her house on the grounds that he was keeping away boarders.  Identical circumstances would have to arise in these cases before a separation could be granted. This whole matter can be looked into more carefully later on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan referred to Section 9, which he said would tend to break up harmonious homes.  Section 9 is extremely limited in its provisions and can hardly be said to be new law at all.  The side-note makes reference to &ldquo;Criminal proceedings for protection of property of married persons&rdquo;.  It is pointed out in the first sub-section that whatever is in that sub-section is subject to sub-section (3) of the section. Subject to that sub-section, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every married woman shall have in her own name against her husband, the same remedies and redress by way of criminal proceedings for the protection and security of her property as if she were unmarried.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the same section is also subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) and it gives the husband the same rights as sub-section (1) gives to the wife.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 9 deals with a situation where one spouse may attack the other.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No criminal proceedings concerning any property claimed by one spouse (in this sub-section referred to as the claimant) shall, by virtue of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), be taken by the claimant against the other spouse while they are living together, nor, while they are living apart, concerning any act done while living together by the other spouse, unless such property was wrongfully taken by the other spouse when leaving or deserting or about to leave or desert the claimant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is old law.  Under the English <Col N="1584" /> Larceny Act, because husband and wife were regarded as one, it was impossible for one spouse to charge the other with the larceny of the property so long as they were living together.  Supposing the pair are separated, can one then take an action for larceny of the property?  Not unless the property was taken by the spouse when leaving or deserting or about to leave or desert the other.  That is very limited.  It is old law and there is nothing in it that would lead to the breaking up of a harmonious home because there is prohibition against criminal proceedings while they are living together.  There can be no criminal proceedings while the two are living together or unless the larceny occurred while one or the other was preparing to break up the home.  There is nothing in that that would create disharmony between the spouses.  That is old-time law and, I suggest, good law.  It gives a certain protection that might not otherwise be there.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more to which I should refer.  There was one point raised by Deputy Moylan about witnesses and perhaps the statement of the Minister for the Gaeltacht on the subject may be misunderstood. He referred to competent witnesses and to compellable witnesses. Competent witnesses are those who may be called and compellable witnesses are those who must answer questions when called in court.  There is then the division between civil and criminal proceedings.  In civil proceedings husbands and wives are competent witnesses&mdash;they may give evidence one against the other.  In civil cases they are compellable witnesses in every case except those involving alleged adultery.  In criminal proceedings husbands and wives are competent witnesses but they may give evidence generally only with the consent of the person who is charged.  Without the consent of the party who is charged, a husband or a wife is a competent witness in cases of personal violence, the protection and security of property, bigamy, child neglect and some other matters.</P>
    <P>We are making one change.  Under the Married Women's Property Act, <Col N="1585" /> 1884, a husband or wife was made a compellable witness to give evidence in any criminal proceedings authorised by the 1882 Act.  We are repealing the 1884 Act and we are not making the husband and wife compellable witnesses in criminal proceedings.  The phrase here in paragraph (4) of Section 9 is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...in any criminal proceedings to which this section relates brought against one spouse, the other spouse may ...be called as a witness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is another way of saying they are competent witnesses, but it does not say they are compellable.  If any change is made in the existing law, it is by the repeal of the 1884 Act and the provision contained in the particular sections therein is gone.  The situation is not as bad as Deputy Moylan thought when speaking.  There is not the question of compelling&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there compulsion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>No, competent witnesses may be called.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It really does not matter what &ldquo;may&rdquo; means there if you focus your attention on the phrase &ldquo;competent as witnesses&rdquo;.  That means they may be summoned as witnesses and are entitled to give evidence.  The compellable witness is what the Deputies were after and, as far as sub-section (4) of Section 9 is concerned, there is no trace of compulsion there.  They may be called as good witnesses or may be brought in as witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any other question except that of restraint on anticipation.  I do not think there are many people affected by that nowadays. It was a device for the protection of the property of married women where a good deal of property was settled on them in marriage and where the peculiar circumstance obtained that the father of the girl thought his child should marry but did not think the man was going to treat her properly or in the way he liked and restrained <Col N="1586" /> her from participating in it to protect her from some predatory husband.  Although introduced to cover this particular case, it applies everywhere and has now become the subject of great abuse.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my speech on the Second Reading a couple of cases in England where people were found to be perpetrating the grossest frauds on other people and yet there was no way of getting rid of the restraint on anticipation.  Even creditors were being grossly defrauded.  One of the cases was where people mortgaged property without revealing that it was restrained and, having got the mortgage money and spent it, they stood on the restraint as preventing the property from being attached in order to pay the debt.</P>
    <P>The second point is that there is quite a number of cases in which it would be possible to have the restraint lifted by an appeal to the court; but whether it is lifted or not is a matter for the discretion of the judge, and how he will exercise that discretion in particular cases is very hard to forecast. It is fettered in this way.  Restraint on anticipation may only be lifted if it is for the benefit of the particular married woman.  The case was quoted here of a lady whose husband had fallen into bad health and it was necessary to get a certain amount of money in order to send that person to some good climate like Switzerland to have him recover. That was refused because it could not be urged as for the benefit of the lady.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finlay hoped to have it negatived both in respect to future settlements and old settlements.  I should imagine that that would be met by cutting out from Section 6 where it says &ldquo;before or after the commencement of this Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;before or&rdquo;.  This is not the same case as ordinarily would be talked of in this House in connection with retrospective legislation.  There is a certain amount of retrospection in it.  The restraint has not entirely been fixed.  People have imposed restraint with the knowledge that there is an appeal to the courts and that, at the courts' discretion, it might be lifted.  A person <Col N="1587" /> who is knowledgeable may by a deed before a marriage relieve and get away from the anticipation.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that restraint on anticipation does not affect many people but it affects quite a number of creditors in a bad and dishonest way. People who are supposed to be protected against predatory husbands now find they have got a great protection against paying their debts.  Even in the small number of cases concerned this is a desirable thing to get rid of. I suggest we are doing, as I said in my speech on the Second Reading, what the settlees would have done in most cases if they realised what the results would be.</P>
    <P>This is an old doctrine of no value. Very few people will settle anything in this particular way now.  They have other devices for the future.  Even though it may be restrospective to a point it is retrospective with a good aim.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies will have seen from the explanatory memorandum, the provisions of the Bill are based on the recommendations in the Conroy Report on Reversionary Leases presented in April, 1954.  The Bill repeals the existing statutory provisions dealing with reversionary leases, that is to say, Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and an amending Act passed in 1943, with the incorporation of the amendments suggested by the commission and a few modifications of detail made in the course of departmental consideration or as a result of observations made by the various interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure is a highly technical one and before proceeding to deal with particular provisions I think it desirable to say something about the state of the law as it existed before the <Col N="1588" /> passing of Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the changes which Part V brought about.</P>
    <P>Before 1931 the law was that when a building lease expired the land, together with the buildings erected thereon by the lessee or his predecessor in title, reverted to the ground landlord in accordance with the terms of the lease.  The ground landlord was free to sell or let the property to the best bidder.  In practice the larger estates granted a reversionary or renewal lease on the expiry of the building lease at a rent which although higher than the rent under the building lease was considerably below the full occupation rent of the property.  The practice on the larger estates was to grant the reversionary lease to the person who in their opinion had acquired the beneficial or proprietary interest in the property&mdash; in other words, to the person who &ldquo;owned the bricks and mortar.&rdquo; That person was not always the successor in title of the original building lessee, that is, his descendant or a person who had bought the building lessee's interest outright by way of assignment. Very often it was a person who had bought the property not by assignment but by taking a sublease of it at a low rent for a long term and, in addition, paying a considerable capital sum to the building lessee as consideration for the sublease.  In such a case the proprietary interest in the property had passed from the building lessee to the sublessee, the sublease having had virtually the same effect as an outright assignment.</P>
    <P>Part V of the 1931 Act gave a statutory right to a reversionary lease on favourable terms and its provisions were designed to secure that the leaseholder who was to get the reversionary lease should be the person who had acquired the proprietary interest in the premises, that is, either the person holding the building lessee's interest or, as I have just explained, a sublessee (called a &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo;) whose sublease was really in the nature of an assignment for full value of the building lessee's interest.</P>
    <P>Thus, for example, if in respect of any particular property the building <Col N="1589" /> lessee held for a term of 99 years at an annual rent of £5 but had granted out of his term a sublease for a term of 98 years in consideration of the payment by the sublessee of a sum of £600 there and then and of an annual rent of £30, the 1931 Act regards the building lessee as having parted with the proprietary interest in the property and deems the sublessee to be a proprietary lessee and so entitled to get a reversionary lease from the ground landlord to the complete exclusion of the building lessee.  To put it more technically, that particular sublease is deemed to be a proprietary lease because the capital sum paid (£600) was more than 15 times the rent reserved by it (£30) and because it expired not more than five years before the end of the building lease.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the sublease had been framed so that it expired say six years before the end of the building lessee's term or if the capital sum had been only 14 times the rent reserved (e.g., £420 and £30), the sublessee would not be a proprietary lessee and would not oust the building lessee's claim to the reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>The Act leaves the parties free to negotiate the terms of the reversionary lease but, where they cannot agree, it provides that the court should settle the terms in accordance with Section 48, the main provisions of which are that the reversionary lease should be for a term of 99 years at a rent equal to one-fourth of the &ldquo;gross rent&rdquo;, that is, of the full open-market occupation rent.  When the commission had examined the working of the 1931 Act they came to three main conclusions. The most important one was, perhaps, that the rent which may now be reserved by a reversionary lease is too high and should be reduced to one-sixth of the gross rent from the present fraction of one-fourth.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the commission concluded that certain leaseholders who in equity are entitled to the benefits of Part V are, as the law stands, not eligible for a reversionary lease.  Lastly, the commission thought that compensation for disturbance should be paid to a lessee whose claim to a reversionary lease is <Col N="1590" /> defeated by the ground landlord successfully objecting on certain grounds, e.g., that it would not be consistent with good estate management to grant a reversionary lease.</P>
    <P>The commission's recommendations &mdash;and of course the provisions of the Bill, which give effect to the recommendations&mdash;are based on these conclusions and I propose to confine myself, for the present, to these main recommendations.  That is not to say that many minor changes of the law were not proposed also but most of them are technical in character and would, I think, be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed reduction in the rent to be reserved by a reversionary lease the Conroy Commission said that they had evidence that in the great majority of cases it was the practice to charge a rent lower than might be obtained if the rent were calculated strictly in accordance with the formula provided for in the 1931 Act.  While they appreciated that there were advantages in leaving scope for bargaining between lessor and lessee, they considered that one-fourth of the gross rent was too high a fraction and was so divorced from realities that bargaining powers rested only in the hands of the lessors.  The commission concluded that if the rent reserved by a reversionary lease were made one-sixth of the gross rent no reasonable lessor could have any grounds for complaint.  Section 17 (4) of the Bill gives effect to the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended that Part V be amended in certain respects with a view to ensuring that full effect is given to the principle that a reversionary lease should be given to a leaseholder who has acquired the proprietary interest in the property concerned.  In the commission's view certain leaseholders who had acquired the proprietary interest were excluded from the benefits of Part V.  The property affected by these recommendations may be conveniently divided into two classes, firstly, property in respect of which no leaseholder has a right to a reversionary lease and, <Col N="1591" /> secondly, property in respect of which the leaseholder who at present has a right to a reversionary lease is not, in the commission's opinion, the leaseholder having the proprietary interest.</P>
    <P>As regards the first class of property the commission found that during the last century there was a great deal of building, for example, in the Dún Laoghaire area, under leases which would have been building leases within the meaning of Part V of the 1931 Act if that Act had then been in force.  These leases expired, or were surrendered, before the 1931 Act came into operation and in some cases the ground landlords granted renewal leases, or fresh leases, to the persons holding the lessee's interest under the expired leases at rents which, although higher than the old rents, were lower than the full occupation rent.  The persons holding under the renewal leases (or any sublessees who have acquired the proprietary interest in the property) are not, as the Act stands, building lessees or proprietary lessees and so are not entitled to get a reversionary lease on the favourable terms prescribed by Part V.</P>
    <P>The only statutory rights these leaseholders may have to remain in possession are limited to those they may have under the Rent Restrictions Acts or under Part III of the 1931 Act but, even where these provisions apply, the leaseholders might be obliged to pay a rent considerably higher than the rent prescribed by Part V, that is, one-fourth of the gross rent.  The commission recommended that these leaseholders should be brought within the scope of Part V as also leaseholders of certain other properties in respect of which, for technical reasons, no leaseholder has a right to a reversionary lease, for example, buildings which have been so reconstructed that they have lost their original identity and buildings leased by the ground landlord to purchasers from a builder under a prior arrangement between the ground landlord and the builder. Effect has been given to these recommendations in Section 9, Section 2 (by extending the definition of &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;) and Section 5 of the Bill, respectively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> With regard to the second class of property, that is, property in respect of which the leaseholder at present entitled to a reversionary lease is not the leaseholder who has acquired the proprietary interest, the commission recommended that the law should be amended so that only the leaseholder who had acquired the proprietary interest should get the reversionary lease.  For example, at present the building lessee is the person who is entitled to get a reversionary lease unless there is a sublessee (called a &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo;) whose sublease can satisfy the conditions which Part V laid down with the object of establishing that the proprietary interest had passed to him from the building lessee.  These conditions require, among other things, that the sublease must, irrespective of its duration, expire not more than five years before the building lease and that the consideration money for the sublease must not only be at least 15 times the rent reserved by it but must be paid at or before the granting of the sublease.</P>
    <P>The commission propose that these conditions should be modified so that a sublease should be deemed to have transferred the proprietary interest even if it expires as much as 15 (instead of five) years before the end of the building lease and even if the sublessee does not pay sufficient consideration money at or before the grant of the sublease&mdash;so long as he subsequently pays by way of commutation of the amount reserved a capital sum which, together with the original consideration money, is at least 15 times the rent as reduced by the commutation payment.</P>
    <P>The commission also consider that any sublease which is for a term of not less than 99 years and which fulfils the other relevant conditions should, even if it expires more than 15 years before the building lease, be deemed to have transferred the proprietary interest. These recommendations are incorporated in Section 7 of the Bill.  The commission also recommended that a lessee who otherwise would have no right to claim a reversionary lease should not acquire such a right merely because, in pursuance of a covenant in <Col N="1593" /> his lease, he has reinstated buildings which had been destroyed by fire or otherwise.  In the commission's view the respective rights of the building lessee or proprietary lessee should not be prejudiced by fortuitous happenings of this kind.  Provision is made accordingly in Section 4 (5) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third major recommendation of the commission was that compensation for disturbance should be paid, where a ground landlord succeeds, on certain grounds, in getting a declaration that a lessee is not entitled to a reversionary lease.  For example, a ground landlord may satisfy the court that the grant of a reversionary lease would not be consistent with good estate management.  The commission pointed out that where a reversionary lease is refused the lessee will sustain a severe financial loss even though no business is carried on in the premises. Provision for compensation in such circumstances is contained in Section 15 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>So much for the main provisions of the Bill.  Before concluding, however, I should like to say a word or two about the report itself.  I am sure all sides of the House will agree with me when I say that it is a comprehensive and lucid exposition of a very technical subject.  I take this opportunity of thanking the learned chairman and the members of the commission for having performed a valuable public duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the Conroy Commission for the excellence of their report.  The question I am asking myself is why we have this Bill only now when the report was received in 1954, whereas the report of the commission on rent control was received in 1952, when I was Minister, and I was being asked every couple of months to produce a Bill on rent restrictions.  There is no sign of any such Bill yet.  I agree that this is a good Bill and a desirable Bill but there was more urgency to act on some of the recommendations contained in the report on rent control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that when I was bringing in the annual Bill dealing with rents I was refused it from this side of <Col N="1594" /> the House.  They told me that they would only give it to me for six months and that I would have to bring in a new Bill within that time.  Of course I did not bring it in and it has not been brought in yet.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but there is not much I can say about it.  I am glad to see that leaseholders will now become entitled to a reversion and that the rent that must be charged in default of agreement between the landlord and tenant will now be only one-sixth of the gross rent instead of one-fourth. This is more a Committee Bill than one for discussion on the Second Reading.  I do not know any of the details of it myself but I do know that great injustices were caused to people who were entitled to reversionary leases being refused them.  That injustice appears to be remedied in this Bill and I welcome it.  When the next Bill comes in, perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us why we have this Bill before the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the recommendation of the Conroy Commission in which it states that all existing controlled premises used by tenants or sub-tenants solely for business purposes should be exempted from the application of these Acts.  I would like to ask the Minister when he is going to implement that recommendation. I know of a number of hardships which are being caused by the non-implementation of that recommendation. I agree that premises used by tenants for residential as well as business purposes should remain under the control of the Rent Acts but where the premises are used solely for business purposes decontrol should operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few more words to say and perhaps I might be allowed to finish.  I have brought to the notice of the Minister certain cases of existing anachronisms.  I presume he will, in his reply to the debate on the following Bill, tell us whether he will implement the report of the Conroy Commission in respect <Col N="1595" /> of the decontrol of lockup shops occupied solely for business purposes which have no character whatever of residence attaching to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters I would like to deal with under this Bill.  In one town in my constituency we have a ground rent landlord, a leaseholder, a sub-leaseholder and a tenant and I would like to see some steps taken that would cover some of these.  I would like the Minister to bring in a new section compelling the landlord, 12 months before the lease falls in, to notify, not alone the leaseholders, but the tenant as well, that the lease is falling in, so as to give him some opportunity of taking steps to meet the situation.  There was one case in Cobh recently where the lease of nine houses fell in and the first thing the tenants knew about it was that a local solicitor had purchased the whole lot and was proceeding to deal with them in a different manner.</P>
      <P>I had bitter experience of that also myself when cases arose when we did not know what had happened to leases. Many of these old leases disappear and the only people who hold them and know about them are the landlords.  A clause should be added to this Bill compelling the landlord to notify the leaseholder in ample time that the lease is falling through so as to give him an opportunity of protecting himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the troubled times a large number of leases disappeared between the change over from the old district councils to the county councils.  The first case we had of that was in Carrigtwohill where the lease of the dispensary residence fell in.  We knew nothing about it and the next thing we got was a notice to quit.  We sought legal advice, took the matter to court and were beaten and the end of it was that we had to pay £1,500 for the old house. In Clonmoyle dispensary the same thing happened and in Midleton we had the same trouble.  In all these cases we knew nothing about the leases falling in until we were nailed and had to go along and purchase.  It cost the ratepayers something between £7,000 and £8,000 altogether.  I consider it <Col N="1596" /> absolutely essential, therefore, to incorporate a section in this Bill compelling landlords to serve notice on leaseholders and tenants when the term of the lease is on the point of expiring, thereby giving interested parties an opportunity of taking steps to safeguard their interests.</P>
    <P>I do not know what purpose is served by many Bills that come before this House from time to time, but in my opinion a Bill dealing with ground rents is vitally and absolutely essential. I suggest that the Minister study this matter.  We had an appalling history in Cobh in relation to ground rents.  There were two absentee landlords drawing an enormous amount of money out of the town.  In one case a piece of ground was let to a tenant at £15 per year.  He built £16,000 worth of houses on that property.  He borrowed from the bank for that purpose. When the lease fell in the ground landlord refused to renew either to the bank or to the tenant. The rent was increased from £15 per year to £200 per year.  The unfortunate man who had invested all he had himself and borrowed from the bank as well was just fired out on the road.  We took action some years ago&mdash;I think it was about 1930&mdash;to get the ground rents reduced.  They were reduced by 33? per cent. but a reduction of 33? per cent. was not much of a reduction in a ground rent that had been increased from £15 to £200.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some definite action taken by somebody along the lines I have indicated.  All the law at present seems to work towards protecting the absentee landlord.  I appeal to the Minister to put in an amendment along the lines suggested himself, compelling the landlord to give notice, or else give us an opportunity of putting such an amendment down and having the matter discussed fully here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say about this Bill.  A Bill of this nature, however, with the repercussions it will have on the community in general and on a large number of people in particular, should receive detailed consideration here.  There is little to be said on the principle of the <Col N="1597" /> Bill on the Second Stage.  The genesis of the Bill is simply that a reputable commission was set up to inquire into the problems dealt with in this Bill, together with other problems.  That commission made a detailed report and one which both sides of the House joined in commending.  The report is certainly a responsible document and it shows clearly that a considerable sifting of the evidence offered took place.  It is only reasonable that we should be guided by such a commission and by its report.  The purpose of the commission was to furnish us with some guides.</P>
      <P>In principle, there is nothing objectionable in this Bill.  It is a Bill derived from the recommendations of the commission.  As the explanatory memorandum says the object of the Bill is to give effect to the recommendations of the commission's report on reversionary leases under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  So much for that.  Nevertheless, in the actual matter of giving effect to the commission's report, a number of points of detail must, of necessity, arise.  Here, I think quite frankly that the proper procedure in this case would be to refer this Bill to a Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a Bill which can be dealt with easily in Committee of the whole House here.  A few lawyers will come in, but my feeling is that such a Bill would be better dealt with by being referred to a Committee, which would meet formally and deliberate, as we did, in the case of the Fisheries Bill. The Defence Bill was a different type of Committee.  When the law was being consolidated in relation to fisheries some years ago&mdash;the actual Committee was, I think, abortive because of a general election-the procedure adopted then was very useful. On such Committees there is an opportunity of having references.  There are officials detailed to service such Committees with information.  Here, the only person who has the information laid-on, so to speak, is the Minister and every other Deputy must fend and forage for himself.  In Special Committees certain facilities are available to all.  There is a serious discussion and the Bill can eventually be brought <Col N="1598" /> before the House in a proper form.  I feel that is the procedure we should adopt in relation to this measure.  In other Bills, the more that is done on the floor of the House the better.</P>
    <P>This type of Bill is highly technical and there are serious consequences involved when one is dealing with property holding.  It is for that reason that I think we should adopt the procedure I have suggested.  We have already recommended such procedure and it is now the responsibility of the House to put through proper legislation. I think the best way the House can do that is by delegating, once we have got the principles established, a competent sub-committee to deal with the Bill, section by section, to see if what we propose to put through is what the House intends to put through.</P>
    <P>I put that point to the Minister in relation to this Bill.  While making that recommendation, I would like to remind the Minister of a Bill recently put through this House, frankly not in the most favourable way in which it could be put through.  I refer to the Statute of Limitations Bill.  That was dealt with here in Committee on the floor of the House.  It was examined. The different points were dealt with as effectively as they could be dealt with.  In fact, the Attorney-General came in and gave the House considerable assistance on the Bill.  But the point is that it was put through in probably not the best way.  I sat here opposite the Attorney-General and, though the information asked for was given, it would have been much better if one had been sitting around the table in Room 106, with all the references necessary, in an atmosphere in which the various points could be pursued with more leisure and in greater detail.</P>
    <P>In legislation of this kind, one is faced with either relying completely on the Minister and his advice and on the opinions and knowledge available in the House generally or running the risk of dealing with the Bill in a lopsided and perhaps somewhat delaying manner which may have the effect of prolonging discussion interminably on every section.  I would commend the point of view I put forward in regard to this Bill to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> The Bill is highly technical from start to finish.  Take sub-section (1) of Section 4 which states:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this Act &lsquo;building lease&rsquo; means a lease in respect of which the conditions specified in sub-section (2) of this section are complied with and includes any lease which is deemed to be a building lease by Section 5, Section 6, Section 9, Section 18 or Section 19 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, go to any one of these subsections and you will find the complications of the thing become quite severe. Another thing I notice about this Bill &mdash;it is really a matter for Committee Stage&mdash;it appears to be unlike most other Bills of this nature.  It is a Bill in addition.  Looking at it here, there is no Schedule of repeals.  It simply takes out Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act and it, more or less, substitutes for that.  I am not complaining about that, but it is significant that in this Bill there is no Schedule It is rather an unusual feature in a Bill of this nature which usually has a Schedule of provisions repealed in whole or in part.</P>
    <P>Because of this, I think the Minister might be wise if he considered a small Committee of the House to deal with this Bill.  It might be the fastest way of dealing with it.  Another point about these Committees is that I think they are not limited to sitting when the House is sitting, and in the case of a Bill like this, it should be possible for the Minister to secure expedition by taking the course I suggest and having everything laid on for the next session after Christmas.  Of course I do not believe the present Government will be able to hang on indefinitely but the possibility is that the business this House will have to face from February onwards will be largely the ordinary, routine business of the year which takes a considerable amount of time&mdash; Estimates, financial provisions and so on.  There may not be very much time in that period for a Bill of this kind, and to have this Bill injected into the House in sporadic and irregular doses, as it suits the convenience of Government business, is not the best way of <Col N="1600" /> dealing with it.  It is not a Bill that can be satisfactorily dealt with by putting in the Committee Stage for half an hour to-day, maybe for an hour next week and perhaps for three hours in the week after.</P>
    <P>It is a lawyer's Bill at this stage, but Deputies should not misunderstand me on that.  It is a lawyer's Bill in the sense that it is a technical Bill when it gets to this stage.  I am taking for granted that, by and large, we are accepting the Conroy Report as a reasonable summary of the situation and accepting the recommendations as reasonable recommendations and that in principle we have no objection to a Bill framed on the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I assume that the concrete or substantive points of view that have to be expressed in relation to these important matters will be expressed here on the Second Reading, if anybody has to make any comments or objections, or point out something that has been missed.  Thirdly, we shall have the Report Stage.  Fourthly, under the normal procedure, a Deputy will have no difficulty whatever in bringing such a point before a Committee of the House, the facts of the situation being, of course, that whatever such a Committee is set up there will normally be representatives of all Parties in this House.  In other words, the Committee will be selected by consent of the House and will be fairly representative of the House as a whole.  Therefore, any Deputy in the House has immediate access to some other Deputy who will be largely of his own way of thinking on the Committee if there is a point he wants to raise.  Then there is the Report Stage where this whole thing can be thrashed out again.</P>
    <P>As I am speaking on that matter, perhaps it is an opportunity of saying something else.  Personally, I greatly regret that in the case of another Bill in the past, the Defence Bill, where the Committee procedure was adopted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to say&mdash;and I hope the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="1601" /> will allow me to say it&mdash;is that in that case after we had thrashed out something in Committee and after there had been a voluminous report, a certain Deputy here insisted on recommitting the Bill and in that way defeated the object of the procedure.  Many of us felt that there would be no use in having such a procedure if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, because I want to say to the Minister: do not let that prevent him from adopting my suggestion.  Do not let the fear of that happening prevent us from using a useful procedure when it is available. I am going to be bold enough to suggest the name of a Deputy who does not belong to this side of the House, Deputy Finlay, who is eminently suitable to be a member of a Committee like this because of his practical knowledge and experience of the courts.  Some lawyers at least will be necessary, even if it is not completely composed of lawyers, but no matter what the composition of the Committee is, it will be much more satisfactory if this Bill is examined in Committee where the Minister will have his officials available as is the normal practice&mdash;and the information and authorities can be looked up as the points arise.  There is much more flexibility than there is in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Otherwise, there is the danger that we may have the experience we had with the Statute of Limitations Bill, where the Committee's efforts and also those of the Minister and the Attorney-General &mdash; and I might humbly add my own&mdash;were not as fruitful as they might have been.  I do not consider the handling of that Bill would constitute an example which I would like to quote to show how such Bills should be handled.  Also there is the fear that when this measure comes to be dealt with in the coming months, particularly in the early part of the year, it will either be put on the long finger because of more pressing business of an administrative nature or, worse still, it will be injected into the <Col N="1602" /> House in irregular doses so that the continuity is lost.  Even the same people may not always be there.  There will be different people present on different occasions and as a result the value of this House as the final arbiter and settler of these matters is seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>That is what I urge on the Minister. I think it would be adequate if the Report Stage were dealt with here. Broadly, in regard to the Bill, I, for one&mdash;and I think my colleagues here&mdash;have no particular criticism to offer.  In the light of the Minister's statement, and as a result of reading the Bill in more detail, there may be amendments necessary in the usual way but these can be easily dealt with through the procedure I have suggested. I think the remainder of this Bill is largely a Committee matter.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill in which I think every member of the House should be interested.  However the small attendance of Deputies does not suggest that.  I took the trouble of reading the Bill the other day and I must say that, although I tried to take an interest in it, it was Greek to me.  I would back up wholeheartedly the suggestion made by Deputy Major de Valera that a Committee of the House should be appointed to go into the Bill and that the Committee would be able to assist people like myself in interpreting the Bill correctly.</P>
      <P>When the Committee had discussed the Bill, we could talk it over with them and have certain points cleared up.  We would then know what we were doing.  If this Bill goes through the House in its present form, ordinary Deputies will not understand it no matter what efforts they make to do so.  The suggestion that the members of the House who are capable of discussing the Bill should be appointed as a Committee is a wise one.  I would suggest strongly to the Minister that he adopt the suggestion of Deputy Major de Valera and have such a Committee set up.</P>

The object of the Bill is to extend for a further year the operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts which control the rents of most houses built before 1941.  Deputies will recall that in 1950 the Conroy Commission was set up to investigate the working of the Rent Restrictions Act of 1946 and to consider the question of extending rent control to furnished lettings. The commission was also asked to examine Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which deals with the position arising on the expiry of building leases and certain subleases and prescribes the terms on which reversionary leases are to be granted.  Two reports have been furnished by the Conroy Commission, one dealing with rent control and the other with reversionary leases.  The Government have completed examination of the report on reversionary leases and a Bill to give effect to the recommendations in <Col N="1604" /> that report is at present before the House.</P>
      <P>The report on rent control dealt with all aspects of the rent control problem and recommended that the existing Rent Acts be repealed and reenacted, with the many amendments and extensions suggested by the commission, in one comprehensive statute. The commission proposed that the existing rent controls should be continued, with some increases to landlords who are liable for repairs, and that control be extended to dwellings built since 1941 or to be built hereafter. It also proposed an extension of control to furnished lettings.</P>
      <P>The Government has been giving careful consideration to this problem in the light of these recommendations and having regard to developments since the report was compiled, for example, the improved supply of houses and, more recently, the worsened international outlook.  The problem is a many-sided one to which there is no easy solution, and it will be some time yet before the Government can announce their legislative proposals. Meanwhile, the Government consider that the Acts should be continued, as they stand, for a further period though this will not prevent them from introducing their comprehensive proposals, if available before then, or from making any urgent amendments to the law that may prove to be necessary during the period for which the Acts are being extended.</P>

      <P>As I said when speaking on the previous Bill, the report on this matter was presented when I was Minister in 1952.  Accordingly, it amuses me to hear the Minister talk about the consideration the Government had given to it.  If that is not dodging the column, I do not know what is.  I remember the time when, as Minister, I was pressed very hard to deal with such matters as furnished lettings.  At the time I was given the impression that the then Opposition considered these things as being very urgent.  I am not now as unreasonable with the Government as they were with me in my time.  I should like to say, though, that I think it is high time we had something done about all these <Col N="1605" /> matters.  On the other Bill Deputy Coburn referred to cases where premises comprised both business and residential portions.  My recollection of his suggestion is that such premises should be decontrolled.</P>
      <P>Have the Government come to any decision?  Have they come to any decision about furnished lettings? Have they, in fact, given any consideration to the recommendations made in the report of the commission on rent control or have they simply shelved it?  The Minister says now that many things have been held up by the international situation.  That will be the excuse for a lot of things from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies are well aware this Bill is introduced because of the paramount necessity at the present time that we should do everything possible to stimulate production and exports arising out of increased production.  It is part of the general scheme of measures designed towards that end which were announced by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government on the 5th October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately we are all only too well aware of the necessity to step up exports to the greatest possible degree. However, it is not always fully appreciated or understood that, in relation to our exports and imports, we have to consider not merely the problems <Col N="1606" /> created by the comparative volumes of the one and the other but also the problems that are created by the worsening in the terms of trade, in other words, the position in which we are in international markets forced to pay more for the things we have to import and receive less for the things we have available for export.</P>
    <P>In the first three-quarters of this year that worsening of the terms of trade added no less than £10,000,000 to the trade deficit when compared to 1953.  It is of interest to note that from 1953 down to the present time the terms of trade were worsening all the time for us whereas from 1951 to 1953 they were improving. The rise in import prices between the third quarter of 1953 and the third quarter of 1956, which are the latest available figures, amounted to 8 per cent. and the fall in export prices amounted to 3 per cent. The worsening that those figures disclosed added no less than £3,000,000 to our import bill for the third quarter of this year and resulted in the receipts from our exports being reduced by £.6 millions.  The total of £3.6 millions or one-third of the trade deficit in those months was caused by the worsening in the terms of trade loan.</P>
    <P>Those factors make it clear that efforts must be made and inducements must be given to ensure that our production can be increased and that with an increase in production it will be possible to get a greater volume of exports. If we do not get that greater volume of exports we will not be able to sustain imports, including imports of raw material for industry, at the level that all of us would wish.  As I said, this Bill is one part of the proposals of the Government towards that end.  It is the part that deals with the tax incentive.  The main reasons for the introduction of the Bill are the provisions to stimulate coal production and to stimulate exports.  In addition to those two main provisions I have also taken the opportunity of adding certain other matters to the Bill which will be of assistance in another way.</P>
    <P>The easement of the manner in which wear and tear is given for certain machinery allied to mines will, I think, <Col N="1607" /> be of assistance, and in addition I have included in the Bill a provision for industrial building allowances so as to stimulate building activity.  The Bill also includes the appropriate provisions to arrange the prize bond issue to which I referred recently and which, as I said then, I hope to introduce early in the new year.</P>
    <P>So far as the actual sections and machinery of the Bill are concerned Deputies can see that it is divided into five parts.  The first part, which consists of Sections 1, 2 and 3, deals with the normal construction provisions and gives the usual right of appeal from the determinations of the Revenue Commissioners which are included in Section 2 and which are normal in our income-tax code.  Section 3 is the section that deals with the wear and tear deduction to which I referred.  It provides a more favourable method of computing wear and tear deductions in the case of machinery used in a short life mine or in a smelter working in conjunction with it.  Under the section the wear and tear deductions may at the option of the trader&mdash;and I would stress at the option of the trader&mdash;be computed by reference to the expected life of the mine and the probable scrap value of machinery when the mine ceases to be worked.  It seems to me obviously fair that if you have machinery usable only&mdash;as apart from its scrap value&mdash; in connection with any particular mine, the deduction should be in relation to the length of the operations of that mine rather than the useful life of the machinery and I think it is on that basis that the deduction should be calculated. As I say the option is given in this section for the trader to choose this method if it suits him.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the tax relief for profits from coal mining.  In Sections 4 and 5 are what one might term the machinery sections.  Section 4 deals with appropriate definitions and Section 5 provides that relief under this part of the Bill will be available only to a company which is incorporated, managed and controlled in the State.  In so doing it follows the line of the Bill we dealt with here for <Col N="1608" /> another type of mining approximately 12 months ago.  Section 6 ensures that new coal-mining operations will be regarded as a separate trade for the purpose of assessment to income-tax. It also provides that, in the assessment to income-tax of profits from new coal-mining operations, corporation profits tax will be regarded as having been paid in full notwithstanding that it may be abated under Section 7 of the Bill.  The purpose of that is to ensure that the company will get the full 50 per cent. remission.  If that provision were not included in paragraph (b) of Section 6, the effect would be that such company would not receive the full 50 per cent. remission but that income-tax would be charged on the part of the corporation profits tax that had been remitted.  That, of course, is not our intention, the intention being that 50 per cent. of the profits calculated in this way will be relieved both from income-tax and from corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides relief from income-tax and corporation profits tax from new coal-mining operations, that is to say, coal-mining operations which are commenced after the 30th September, 1956.  The 30th September, 1956, was chosen as the appropriate date as being the last day of the month prior to the announcement by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government that a concession such as this was about to be introduced.  The section accords a 50 per cent. exemption from income-tax for the year of assessment in which the new mining operations are commenced and subsequent years up to and including the 5th April, 1967.  There is also granted a 50 per cent. exemption from corporation profits tax for accounting periods and parts of accounting periods from the date of the commencement of the new mining operations up to the 30th September, 1966.  The difference between the two concluding dates arises, of course, because corporation profits tax is charged on the actual period rather than the income-tax year.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides relief from income-tax and corporation profits tax in the case of profits from existing coal-mining operations.  The section lays down that, over a period of ten <Col N="1609" /> years, income-tax and corporation profits tax for each year on profits referable to an excess of the volume of output of coal over the volume of output of coal in the year ended 30th December, 1956, will be relieved to the extent of 50 per cent.  The ten year period as regards income-tax may begin with any one of the three income-tax years ending on the 5th April, 1960.  The option to choose which year it will start, again, rests with the company concerned.  As regards corporation profits tax, the ten years' period begins on the 1st October, 1956.  This section also provides that, in the assessment to income-tax of profits from existing coal-mining operations, corporation profits tax will be regarded as having been paid in full notwithstanding that it may be abated under the section. That provision is, of course, for the same reason as that applying in the earlier section to which I previously referred.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the dividends paid by coal-mining companies which obtain relief under this part of the Bill.  The rate of income-tax which may be deducted from any such dividend is to be reduced by reference to the relief and any repayments of income-tax are to be governed accordingly. The section also provides that no relief under this part of the Bill will be given in respect of any income which goes to pay charges, such as debenture interest, from which the coal-mining company is entitled to deduct income-tax.</P>
    <P>It is further provided by this section that, where a reduced rate of income-tax is deductible from a dividend under this part of the Bill, the amount of the dividend will, for surtax purposes, be reduced to correspond with the reduction in the rate of income-tax deduction.</P>
    <P>Those sections cover the provisions in relation to coal-mining.  I hope and I believe that, with the introduction of this Bill, containing now those sections dealing with coal-mining, we will succeed in obtaining in relation to what coal deposits there may be in the country the same degree <Col N="1610" /> of interest and activity as we have already obtained in respect of what I may roughly call metallic ores by virtue of the tax incentives that were introduced last year.  Nobody can deny that, following the introduction of those tax incentives last year and the arrangements that were then made, we have&mdash;we are all glad to see&mdash;far more interest in mining in Ireland than ever before in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with profits from exports.  The appropriate definitions are contained in Section 10 and the standard period is defined in Section 11 as being the year to the 30th September, 1956.  This period will apply even though the company which carries on the trade in the year of claim may not be the person who carried it on in the year ending on the 30th September, 1956.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 define the scheme of relief from income-tax and corporation profits tax under this Part of the Bill, the former section dealing with income-tax and the latter with corporation profits tax.  The sections provide, in effect, that, over a five-year period, tax for each year on the profit represented by an increase in the value of a company's exports of manufactured goods, that is to say, goods manufactured by the exporter, over the value of such exports, if any, in the standard period, shall, in so far as that profit is used in the development of the company's business in the State, be reduced by 50 per cent.  The five-year period as regards income-tax may begin with any one of the three income-tax years ending on the 5th April, 1960.  Again, it is for the company concerned to decide, at its own option, in which of these three years it wishes the relief to begin.  As regards corporation profits tax, the five-year period begins on the 1st October, 1956.</P>
    <P>Section 13 also makes provision for the necessary apportionments for purposes of corporation profits tax where relief is claimed for an accounting period of less than 12 months or where there is a transfer of a part of a trade.</P>
    <P>The section also prescribes that, in the assessment to income-tax of propose <Col N="1611" /> fits from exports, corporation profits tax will be regarded as having been paid in full notwithstanding that it may be abated under this section.</P>
    <P>The House will note that in relation to the relief on exports it has been provided in these sections that the profit must be used for ploughing back and in the development of the company's business.  I think everybody will agree that that is a desirable provision. That provision is not included in relation to the coal-mining provisions because mines are a wasting asset and it would not be realistic to include the provision in relation to coal mines.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the owner obtaining the relief from tax because there is a succession in the trade or where there is a transfer of part of a trade or where permanent cessation in a trade occurs.  In relation to exports, as apart from coal mining, there is not uniformity of exports; it is not possible to relate the profits to the volume in the same way as it can be related to volume of coal.  Accordingly the House will note that in this part of the Bill the standard taken is of value and it is by reference to the increase in the value of exports that the concession applies.</P>
    <P>There is the same exemption in Section 15 of this part of the Bill as there was in the former portion to which I have referred in regard to debenture interest and so forth.  When a company is entitled to retain from the payee tax from his interest it would not be right that it should get relief for such tax so retained.  The section accordingly deals with that.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the industrial building allowance.  Section 16 provides for a deduction of 10 per cent. of the capital expenditure incurred by a trader on or after the 13th September, 1956, in the construction of any industrial building to be occupied by him.</P>
    <P>Section 17 defines the building or structure to which the allowance applies.  The buildings are those used for the pursuance of the trade such as a mill, factory or other similar premises or building for the purposes <Col N="1612" /> of hotel keeping.  I think everybody would agree that it is desirable that industrial building should be stimulated and that everybody will also agree, having regard to the importance of the tourist trade as an invisible export, that it is desirable to include hotels in this provision.  The effect, I hope, will be that hotel keepers will now realise that under this concession it would be wise, not merely for the country as a whole, but for their own sakes, to go ahead and build new hotel accommodation so as to ensure that the amount of accommodation available will be such as to meet the need which we have if we wish to increase our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Section 18 defines the basis period by reference to which the industrial building allowance is to be granted. Normally the basis period will be the accounting period ending in the year preceding the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the industrial building allowance should not be given in respect of expenditure incurred in the acquisition of a site, or for work on the site except in so far as it relates to the preparation of the ground for the purpose of receiving the foundations of the building.</P>
    <P>Section 20 enables a company to obtain an industrial building allowance in relation to corporation profits tax where it would be eligible for such allowance in relation to computing income-tax.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will recollect that there has been pressure for some considerable period for an industrial allowance for buildings of the type such as I have provided for in this section of the Bill and I feel sure that its effect will be to stimulate industrial building and therefore greater industrial production in the way in which it is desired.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the beginning I am also taking advantage of this opportunity to include in the Bill the appropriate reference to prize bonds and Part V of the Bill provides the legislative authority required in connection with the issue of prize bonds. Prize bonds will differ in important measures from existing State borrowing. <Col N="1613" /> Instead of earning interest or dividends they will participate in drawing for substantial cash prizes free of income-tax and surtax.  They will not be dealt in on the stock exchange but will be repayable in full at any time. They will combine full security with the chance of a large capital money prize normally found only in a speculative venture.  Prize bonds will form a useful addition to the existing measures for the encouragement of savings and should appeal to a large section of the community if not to all. There is a considerable public demand for opportunities to win large sums of money and the State should not ignore this fact in its efforts to obtain money in respect of capital development.</P>
    <P>Prize bonds will have an outstanding advantage in that regard in that the money cannot be lost and that it may be recovered by the owners whenever they wish to do so.  Because of this also it is proposed to exclude the scheme from the scope of the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956.  In addition, the House will note that under Section 24 I have provided exemption from stamp duty in respect of certain documents which will have to be utilised in connection with prize bonds.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House as part of a scheme to provide, by tax incentive, additional production in coal mining and additional production for export.  The success which followed the introduction of the Mineral Tax Concession Bill in the early part of this year is, I hope, a happy augury in relation to the coal-mining provisions included in this Bill.  The provisions that are included here in relation to profits from exports should now enable our industrialists to go out and, with the additional facilities they will now have available to them, be able to seek foreign markets, markets outside this country which are so desperately necessary in the national interest.  The industrial buildings allowances should assist in modernising factory premises and in the erection of new premises. The Prize Bonds Scheme will form a useful addition to the manner in which the State, for the purposes particularly of production and capital projects, can obtain the funds necessary <Col N="1614" /> for these projects.  For all these reasons, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made it quite clear in his opening remarks that he approached the preparation of this Bill not as an exercise in taxation reform but as a temporary device to deal with present conditions in this country.  It is on that basis the Dáil should consider it.</P>
      <P>The question we have to ask now is whether the proposals in this Bill, which are the Government's proposals or at least, the main part of their proposals, for dealing with present conditions, are adequate to offset the present trade depression, the decline in industrial production, the diminution in employment and the general weakening of the national economy which has developed in this year?  Will this Bill help to get the country back into the position in which it was in 1954, into the position in which production and employment will increase, in which the adverse trade balance will disappear and in which the prospect of national advancement will appear to be a continuing one?</P>
      <P>What are the proposals in the Bill before the House?  There is a proposal that there should be a remission of 50 per cent. of the taxation payable on profits earned on export trade by new companies or by existing companies which increase their export trade, in relation to the profits earned on the increase, and provided they use the whole of the profits so earned for the development of their businesses and distribute none of them to their shareholders. There is also a 50 per cent. remission of taxation upon profits earned by new coal-mining companies or existing companies which are able to increase their production and earn profits in so doing.  There is a proposal for an initial allowance of 10 per cent. in respect of new industrial buildings and a minor alteration in the rules governing the depreciation of plant used in mining operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim, we are told, is to facilitate and induce increased exports and increased production generally to deal with what the Minister has described <Col N="1615" /> as the &ldquo;desperate situation&rdquo; of the country.  I do not think there is any Deputy here who will for one moment believe that the proposals in this Bill will have anything but a minor effect upon that situation.  Let it be said straight away that the Bill gives some aid to those who are trying to expand production and exports in certain industries.  To that extent it represents a welcome change of mind on the part of the Government because both the main proposals in this Bill were resisted by the Government earlier this year when this situation was being debated and these proposals were put forward from this side of the House. I am certain that it will not be seriously contended by any Deputy that these proposals go nearly far enough to give us the results we require.  So far as is known, the deficit in our external payments is approximately £35,000,000&mdash;at any rate that was the deficit in 1955.  What the outcome of this year's operations may be, we do not yet know.  There has been, we are told, some improvement in the visible trade balance, a diminution in imports greater than the diminution in exports.</P>
    <P>In 1955, according to the information available to us, there was a not inconsiderable expansion in the trading stocks held in this country and in work in progress generally.  The Central Bank in its report estimated that in 1955 there was an increase in stocks in that year of approximately £13,000,000 and to some extent the deficit which emerged in our international payments in 1955 was attributable to that increase in stocks.  Since then, because of trade depression, because of special import levies which the Government has imposed, there has been, as everybody knows, a substantial decline in industrial stocks and, in so far as there has been a contraction in imports recorded for this year, it is mainly attributable to that letting-down of stocks.  It does not reflect any permanent improvement in the circumstances of the country.</P>
    <P>The Government's measures have in effect transferred some of this year's deficit to next year, because eventually <Col N="1616" /> these stocks will have to be replenished. Indeed, it can be argued seriously that in present international circumstances it is undesirable that our commercial stocks should be contracted. One would prefer to see, in view of possible developments in the world situation, an accession rather than a depletion of stocks at the present time.</P>
    <P>There can be no permanent improvement in the circumstances of this country until we expand our production generally and expand our exports in particular.  In so far as this Bill indicates a recognition by the Government that that is desirable, it is to be welcomed; but it is undesirable and detrimental to the realisation of the aims, which the Government professes to have, to have Ministers speaking in public referring to the trade statistics of this year as representing an improvement in the national situation, a permanent improvement which suggests that the crisis confronting the country is passing.  That is not true. There has been no permanent improvement at all in our trade situation.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the visible balance of trade is due mainly to the depletion of commercial stocks and not to any rectification of the position. The position can only be rectified if we can get increased production to replace imports and to expand exports. I want to suggest that there is nothing in this Bill which is sufficient in present circumstances to induce that result.  We need increased exports so that we can pay for the goods we have to import.  It is not desirable that we should have to restrict the import of goods that we cannot produce for ourselves.  Many of these special import levies imposed by the Government are operating to depress the standard of living of our people, to make it impossible for them to acquire goods, which they would like to have and the possession of which would mean for them a higher standard of living, because such goods are now priced out of their reach.</P>
    <P>Many of these levies apply to industrial raw materials and are operating to contract industrial production and, in some cases, to terminate export <Col N="1617" /> businesses which had prospects of expanding.  I do not know what the attitude of the Government is to these special import levies.  I do not believe it is possible for any body of men, no matter how clever, to devise a whole series of new taxes&mdash;68 new taxes were imposed in one Order last March and further taxes were imposed later in July&mdash;without making some mistakes in definitions.  I am quite certain that the Government did not know at the time they were fixing these taxes that under them many industrial materials would be caught and that industrial production would be hampered and not helped by them.  Yet, they have, apparently, up to date refused to consider any modification of the taxes, any alteration in the definitions even when the need for it was brought forcibly to their notice by firms affected by them, that unless they got duty-free raw materials to maintain their production they would have to contract it, disemploying their workers.  At any rate, so far as the general national position is concerned we have to record that instead of the increase in exports upon which the nation's safety depends exports are less this year than they were last year and the indications are that they will continue to contract.  I doubt if there is in this Bill any provision which will arrest that decline.</P>
    <P>I have attempted to calculate from the information available to me the total increase in production which is required to enable this country to maintain the 1955 standard of living for the 1955 population, and at the same time meet its external payments. My calculation suggests a 20 per cent. increase in the output of both agriculture and industry is required, and instead of getting that increase, we are getting a decrease and production is going down.  Again, I suggest that the proposals of the Government to arrest that decline in production&mdash;much less expand production to the degree required&mdash;are completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I have urged that members of the Dáil should consider the proposals of this Bill in relation to the urgency of our circumstances.  I concede it does offer some advantage to certain firms <Col N="1618" /> engaged in some industries.  I assert, however, that the proposals in it, indeed the whole series of proposals announced by the Taoiseach in his speech some time ago, are completely inadequate in relation to present conditions. We need quite substantial alterations in our programme, quite substantial inducements to producers, if we are to get that expansion of production, that increase in exports, that spur to enterprise which will give us the higher output and exports which the country requires.</P>
    <P>When these matters are discussed, Ministers frequently defend themselves by pointing to the fact that the previous Fianna Fáil Government did not create inducements of this kind, did not change the tax laws relating to mining undertakings, or give tax inducements to firms engaged in exports. That is correct.  It may be that previous Governments are open to criticism on that account but the fact is that the need for these measures never previously existed as it exists now. The problem with which the Government is inadequately coping and with which the country is faced is one which has developed since 1954 and I think it would be a good thing for public morale if Ministers would concede that, and relate their proposals to a situation which has developed entirely during the period in which they were responsible for national affairs.</P>
    <P>In the period 1953-54, production was increasing.  It was not increasing as fast as we would have liked it to increase but nevertheless employment was going up and unemployment down. The rate of progress was not as rapid as we would have wished but we were going in the right direction and exports were increasing.  In that period we had no serious problems relating to international payments.  What is more than that, we were able to maintain a capital investment programme by public authorities which was probably as extensive as it was possible to organise, and which was providing this country with the amenities of a modern civilised State and getting rid of many of the remaining legacies of foreign rule and certainly giving employment to many tens of thousands of Irish <Col N="1619" /> workers, employment which is now contracting.</P>
    <P>The very serious deterioration in national circumstances which has taken place since 1954 cannot be remedied by pettifogging methods.  If the situation is to be remedied at all, it calls for far more effective stimuli to producers and exporters than this Bill provides.  Once again, in this Bill the Minister has persisted in preserving the pernicious principle of discriminating in taxation between firms engaged in the same business.  There is no benefit under this Bill to a coal-mining concern which is already working to the limit of its practicable capacity.  There is no reward in this Bill for a firm which has already pioneered in the export market and which is sending goods abroad to the maximum extent for which it can find sale for them.  So far as they are concerned in future they will be at a disadvantage in competition with new competitors in their own business and in some instances, particularly in relation to coal mining, that disadvantage may prove very considerable.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong in principle and likely to prove ineffective in practice to maintain that system of discrimination. It is all right now; the Minister may argue that he wants this to stimulate an increase in production or in exports over the present level, but in three, four or five years' time, the origin of this measure will be forgotten and we shall merely have a picture of two firms side by side doing the same job, one being taxed at double the rate of the other.  That principle is indefensible.</P>
    <P>I realise that if the tax concession was given generally to all firms it might mean in relation to certain cases and particularly in relation to firms engaged in the production of beer, spirits and tobacco a serious loss to the Exchequer, and it might be said for that reason, it is necessary to withhold the tax concession from firms already engaged in export business.  If that is so, we at least urge that the Government should decide the particular industries it wants to encourage, that have export possibilities, and give the concessions to every firm in these industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> If the Government does this, they will get not merely a better response now in the matter of increased business but they will have avoided this charge of unfair treatment of the most enterprising firms in this country.  It is the firms that have already gone into the export market that are most likely to expand their production but they get least advantage under this Bill.  It may be because of these tax concessions new firms will be induced to locate industries in this country but I do not think the measure goes nearly far enough for that purpose having regard to the tax laws already operating in the countries from which these firms may come.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the position in relation to the coal-mining industry.  I can speak with some knowledge on this as I am an unpaid director of a small, non-profit-making, coal-mining concern. I make both points clear in case anybody might think I have a personal interest.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill giving tax concessions to the company that will work at Avoca, I urged that the principle of that Bill should be extended to coal-mining undertakings. The Minister argued against it at the time.  He has now gone back on that a little.  He has not put coal-mining firms on the same tax basis as firms that work non-bedded mineral but, nevertheless, he has set out to improve the position a little.  That is to be welcomed as a concession to equity, as a more intelligent arrangement of the taxation laws of the State, but it may not get one additional ton of coal produced in this country.</P>
    <P>It may get some new concerns to start.  I admit that.  However, the practical thing which at present prevents any increase in the output of coal is the inability to get competent workers to go underground to the coal face.  It might be possible to get additional workers if housing facilities were made available.  I know the suggestion has been put forward to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for an arrangement under which housing could be provided for people working in coal mines similar to those which operate in relation to the turf <Col N="1621" /> development schemes.  There are coal-mining concerns which can attract back here to employment Irish workers in Great Britain, provided they can offer them housing facilities.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is competition between firms engaged in coal mining to attract workers from one another because output depends on the number of workers on the coal face.  If a new mine starts in any of the areas in which existing coal mines are operated they may be able to take workers from the existing mines.  The only effect of this Bill will be to give new firms some advantage because they will be exempt from taxation, when the existing mines will not be so exempt.  I do not know whether the possibility of increasing coal production, which it is eminently desirable should be increased to the maximum, has been considered by the Government as a whole or whether it is the concern of the Minister for Finance only.  I know that representatives of the coal-mining industry have met the Minister for Industry and Commerce time and again, to discuss the position with him and trying to get action which would enable them to cope with these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Side by side with these difficulties under which existing coal-mining firms are operating are still more serious ones.  We had an announcement in the papers that in Arigna 50 or 60 workers have been laid off because of inability to dispose of coal produced in the area&mdash;an area in which it is planned that a power station would be operated by the E.S.B. next year and which should be stocking up all the coal that can be produced in that area at the present time. If there is any serious intention on the part of the Government to get increased coal production they would have noted the report that miners are being laid off in one part of the country because the coal cannot be sold at a time when the State concern which will be the ultimate sole market of that coal is frantically trying to increase its supplies from abroad and should, at the present time, be laying in reserve stocks to ensure that the station will be opened and will operate to schedule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> These problems of expanding coal production in this country should all be considered by the Government.  I think it is probably true to say that, assuming the practical difficulties in coal production could be overcome, money for investment in coal-mining would be available.  I urge upon the Minister that, in relation to the difficulties in the coal-mining industry, he should introduce measures, not temporary measures to ease present difficulties but for the permanent future of that industry.</P>
    <P>The biggest outlay of capital in the opening up of a new coal mine or the extension of an existing one goes into the acquisition of the mine itself or into its development.  A large portion of the total capital outlay occurs before one ton comes out of the ground. All that capital has to be recovered out of profits within the lifetime of the mine.  Every other country has recognised the necessity for making some taxation arrangement which will facilitate the recovery from profits of the total capital invested in the undertaking; there is a depletion allowance which takes into account that the mine must cease to operate when the deposit is exhausted and which is designed to enable those who have invested in the undertaking to recover their investment within its lifetime. Up to recently this arrangement did not exist in Britain but the British Royal Commission on Taxation has recommended its introduction and it is to be assumed it will be introduced there.</P>
    <P>I believe if such an arrangement were introduced here it would be a greater inducement to investment in increased coal production than the proposals of this Bill.  The proposals of this Bill will not benefit even new mines unless they get into the profit earning stage.  Some of the existing mines are making no profits at all and in most cases where a profit is earned that profit has to be retained for the purpose of building up a reserve against capital expenditure which has to be recovered while production is still possible.</P>
    <P>If possible, I think it is necessary to get a change in the attitude of the <Col N="1623" /> Revenue Commissioners on the determination of what is capital expenditure and what is ordinary working expenditure in the operation of a coal mine.  I have had a case brought to my attention in the past two months.  In a certain coal mine in this country the main road leading to the coal face had grown so long that a new outlay upon the extension of the conveyor system became necessary.  Deputies will appreciate that as a coal mine is worked out, the coal face gets further and further away from the shaft and that the operation costs tend to increase the longer the mine is in operation.  In the case of this coal mine, the time was reached when the conveyor system had to be extended to meet this difficulty.  The extension did not add one ton to output of the mine, yet the Revenue Commissioners held that the expenditure on the extension was capital expenditure and not a working cost, and consequently not deductible from profits when the firm was being assessed for taxation.  That is a most stupid outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters of which I know from practical experience and likely to have far more influence upon the decisions of individual companies or coal mine proprietors, whether or not they would expand their production under the proposals of this Bill.  If the Government is serious in its desire to get expansion in coal production in this country, then it is to these matters it should be <Col N="1624" /> giving its attention as well as granting the tax allowances proposed here.</P>
      <P>We also have a proposal to give tax allowances to new firms that engage in export trade and to existing firms who increase their export trade in relation to that increase, subject to this condition: that the profits derived from exports are not under any circumstances to accrue to the benefit of the shareholders of the firm but must be retained for the development of the business.  I do not know how that is to be made effective.  I think a child of ten would be able to devise without difficulty ways and means by which the profits of the concern could be arranged so that the dividends could be paid and allowances earned at the same time, except in the case of a firm doing nothing but an export trade.  In that case apparently there could be no distribution of dividends at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's objectives in putting forward this proposal are twofold. Firstly, to induce existing Irish firms to get into the export trade or to extend the scope of their activity in that regard.  Secondly, to induce foreign firms to come to this country and use it as a base for export trade. Let us face up to the fact that any firm in this country going into the export trade is at substantial disadvantages. Most of the industrial raw materials which are processed here have to be imported and the comparatively small size of our undertakings generally mean they cannot be purchased to advantage as might be the case with much larger undertakings. In the main, our production costs are higher, again primarily due to the relatively small size of our undertakings. Our transport costs abroad are frequently very much higher.  As most Deputies know, there are very high freight charges operating on most of the shipping lines from this country to continental ports.  In many cases export abroad is only possible by means of transhipment at a British port.  In all cases it has to be recognised that these transport costs are a very considerable deterrent to an expansion of Irish exports.  In one particular case I was interested in, where I tried very hard to arrange circumstances so that <Col N="1625" /> such a trade would become possible, the whole idea was ultimately killed by reason of the high transport charges which had to be met.</P>
    <P>All these disadvantages can be reduced but none of them can be eliminated entirely.  To the extent that they cannot be eliminated we have got to offset them by our system of taxation or by giving some other advantages to firms prepared to enter the export business.  In the Six Counties these firms pay no local authority rates and they get other forms of State assistance.  In the past we argued that the very substantial aid given in the Six Counties to firms entering into manufacturing business there did not have to be imitated here because we could give on our side what they could not give: the much greater advantage of a protected home market.  But when we come to talk about export business every advantage which these firms have is a real advantage compared with firms operating here, and if we are to get trade in the same markets we shall have to give quite substantial advantages here also.</P>
    <P>To get the export trade in manufactured goods extended by the required amount we need to be thinking of very substantial advantages indeed.  If we are to get capital invested in that trade&mdash;and those who have control of capital for investment will fully understand the risks involved&mdash;then we must do at least as much as other countries are now doing to facilitate and help their export industries.  When the Finance Bill was under discussion here I urged that the tax concession should take the form of a complete remission of taxation on profits in the same proportion as the exports of that firm have to their total output.  That was put forward to the Commission on Industrial Taxation by an organisation called the Irish Exporters' Association. I urged the Government to adopt it. At that time the Minister relied entirely on the fact that the Commission on Industrial Taxation had recommended against any tax concession to encourage exports.</P>
    <P>I think a tax concession of that kind is necessary.  I do not know if the <Col N="1626" /> members of the Government appreciate that there are countries giving tax concessions to exporters as substantial as that.  It is against other firms in other countries that our firms have got to get business abroad.  We cannot afford to do less than they are doing and in our circumstances, having regard to the urgency of our need to expand exports, we may have to go even further still.  I have good reason to know that, if concessions of that kind were allowed and if there was in addition to the initial allowance or in substitution for the initial allowance which the Minister brought in the Finance Act, an investment allowance such as that which the British Government had in operation until last year, we would get quite substantial results.</P>
    <P>Some firms will never venture abroad.  They are doing all right as they are and they have lost any spirit of enterprise.  But there are some very enterprising firms in this country directed by men who are prepared to measure their capacity to find trade and produce goods against the leaders of industry anywhere, if they are given by the Government the necessary aid and the necessary inducements to pioneer in the export markets.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the words in that section of the Bill which purport to define goods mean.  This is Section 10 of the Bill in Part III relating to the granting of tax concessions for exports.  Goods are defined as &ldquo;goods manufactured within the State by the person who exports them.&rdquo;  There are two points arising from that.  The first is the limitation of the concession to firms that export the goods themselves. One of the main weaknesses in our whole economic organisation is the absence of the type of enterprising merchanting house which they have in Great Britain.  Many of the British manufacturers do not export themselves.  Their goods are exported by merchanting organisations which handle the products of many firms and which maintain their agencies and contacts in most countries of the world.  I see no reason why this concession should be limited to goods which are exported directly by the firm which produces them.  Indeed there would be many advantages for <Col N="1627" /> this country if, through granting of further concessions, we could develop that type of merchanting organisation upon which the prosperity of Britain was built up.</P>
    <P>The main point I have in mind here is the vagueness of that definition.  I presume the Minister intends that meat would be regarded as goods for that purpose, that if a meat slaughtering concern buy cattle in a fair, slaughter and dress the meat and export it, that they are manufacturers within that definition.  Would a person who dresses chickens be a manufacturer within that definition?  Every manufacturing operation consists of the buying of raw materials from somebody and the processing of those materials into some commodity or article that the public require.  I suggest that a far more precise definition of &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; is required in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Would turning old hens into chickens for the purpose of export be a manufacturing operation?  I think the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners will get into immense difficulties unless that definition is tightened up.</P>
      <P>I am not arguing for the exclusion of any type of operation which involves the processing of materials into a form which will make them more acceptable to the public abroad but there should be some minimum value added to the raw materials by the processing before anything like manufacture could be accepted as having occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the tax concessions of the kind that I have suggested, and investment allowances and depreciation rates such as those that operated in Great Britain up to last year, and certain other assurances, such as those that would refer to the right of repatriation of capital and profits, the right of foreign technicians to send part of their wages home without restriction, I believe that it is possible to get certain firms now operating abroad to establish factories <Col N="1628" /> in this country to supply part of their export markets.</P>
    <P>I say that, because I have had discussions with representatives of such firms and other people who might be able to influence them and I have always come up against the fact that I could not indicate that there were advantages in this country greater than they had in their own countries which would bring them here, even though they might desire to come here for other reasons. I do not believe that we can get them here unless the trading advantage which they can see themselves securing by accepting an Irish location is big enough to get the right decision made by their boards of directors.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary also to amend in some respects the Control of Manufactures Act.  I indicated at one time my willingness to suggest certain amendments to that Act.  I do not propose to do it now&mdash;I do not suppose it would be in order&mdash;but, in so far as we have in mind firms of substantial size, I have always thought it would be practicable to exclude them from the scope of that Act, that is to say, firms with a paid up capital exceeding, say, £500,000 or £1,000,000.  Where there is investment of that kind in this country, the dangers which we foresaw when the Control of Manufactures Act was passed are not likely to arise.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that, if the Government is hoping through this measure to arouse significant foreign interest in Irish industrial possibilities, they are not going far enough.  They have tried. They have sent their Minister for Industry and Commerce abroad on various missions and nothing has come of it.  I do not know if there is any project under discussion which could be directly attributed to any of these visits but the information given to me in reply to a parliamentary question the other day indicated that, up to the present at any rate, nothing has emerged from that effort.  I hope the Government has learned the lesson of it, that people will not come in here to invest substantial capital sums in industrial activities in this country merely because some Minister goes and asks them to do it.  There has got to be, for business people, a solid, <Col N="1629" /> practical reason why they should come and we have not given that reason yet. Indeed, the proposals in this Bill, as I have said, give to possible new industrialists far less in the way of tax relief than they are already enjoying in the countries in which they are now operating.</P>
    <P>We have also this proposal to grant initial allowances in respect of industrial buildings.  The Commission on Industrial Taxation recommended that an initial allowance of 10 per cent. should be granted, that, in addition, there should be an ordinary depreciation allowance which would enable the cost of buildings to be recovered over 50 years; a wear and tear allowance of 2 per cent. per year.  There were other proposals also.</P>
    <P>When the Finance Bill of this year was being discussed, the Minister pleaded that he had not had time to consider fully the recommendations of that commission and, consequently, was not acting on them on that occasion.  He has had plenty of time to consider them since and I take it that the production of this Bill, with its proposals for an initial allowance only, means that he has rejected the other proposals of the Commission on Industrial Taxation.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to understand what that means.  In relation to a series of proposals which the Minister hopes will induce a substantial increase in production and of exports of industrial goods, it means that, in respect of that element of taxation, we are much more restrictive than they are in Britain or in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>What the Commission on Industrial Taxation recommended was that we should change our tax laws so as to give this depreciation allowance in respect of industrial buildings, to bring it into conformity with the law of Great Britain.  Initially, the income-tax laws of both countries were the same.  They have tended to diverge in the 30 years since the State was established. In this one respect, the Commission on Industrial Taxation recommended that we should adopt the same principles as apply under British law. The Minister, presumably, decided against that course.  Do they think it <Col N="1630" /> is really helping to get people to come in here to establish businesses for the conduct of export trade when we will not give them even the same tax arrangement as they can enjoy if they go north of the Border and put their factory in the Six County area?</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, not merely should the proposals of the Commission on Industrial Taxation be adopted, but that we should do what the British did &mdash;we should change the initial allowance, which is only a loan of the depreciation fund and ultimately costs the Exchequer nothing, into an investment allowance.  The British Government, in their desire to expand their industrial output in the years after the war, operated the system of investment allowances which was a real help to British industrial expansion, so much help that British industrial expansion ran ahead of the target and the British Government withdrew the allowance in order to slow it down. There is no likelihood that our industrial progress will run too fast for us but, at least, let us use the stimuli, aids, and devices which other countries have found effective.  However, I should like the Minister to tell me, am I to take it that the introduction of this Bill, with the solitary proposal for an initial allowance in respect of industrial buildings, means that the other recommendations of the Commission on Industrial Taxation have been rejected by the Government?</P>
    <P>I shall not comment at this stage upon the proposal in relation to prize bonds.  I do not know what amount of money the Government thinks is likely to be raised by that device. The great bulk of the funds that have flowed in the past into Government loans have come from sources where a known rate of interest was the predominant factor.  Pension funds, trust funds of various kinds, reserves of industrial companies, the funds of insurance companies&mdash;these were the sources of most of the contributions to national loans in the past.  They will have no interest in these prize bonds.</P>
    <P>In this case the interest depends entirely on one thing and that is that there may be amongst the general public a desire to utilise these bonds <Col N="1631" /> because of the guarantee of the stability of their value with a prospect of a prize of a sum of money.  This scheme has been tried out in Britain, and I take it the Minister has adopted this method of raising capital funds because it was adopted in Britain.</P>

      <P>The House should be told what success they had in Britain.  In Britain they have an urgent need to draw off excess purchasing power but here there is a definite need for the Government to increase the resources available for capital expenditure because at the present time there is a curtailment of capital investment proceeding with drastic consequences to the country which requires that some step should be taken towards remedying the mishandling of the country's finances.</P>
      <P>We will have many amendments to submit to this Bill.  It is capable of being amended and improved in many respects.  So far as I can see there is no special urgency about the Bill except perhaps with regard to the part dealing with the prize bonds.  The Government may require to get that part passed quickly.  With regard to the rest of the Bill we are of opinion that it is in much need of improvement and that the Dáil should be given time to consider proposals to amend it.  If there is any urgency about the prize bonds I would suggest that the Minister should take that part out of the Bill altogether.</P>

I do not think that, to the extent that the Bill is an inducement to expand production and increase exports, a delay in enactment will have any effect.  Business people will act on what they know will be in the measure. The Government's intentions have been expressed in the Bill as submitted to the Dáil and so far as any beneficial results may follow from the Bill they will begin to operate now.  It is a Bill that should not be rushed through the <Col N="1633" /> Dáil at the end of a session and it is not our fault that the Minister was so dilatory in introducing it.

      <P>I welcome this Bill as being a step forward in facing the realities which we, in this country, ought to face in connection with enlarging our industrial arm.  I think that the Bill can only have a good effect.  It can help us to develop our industrial side and to make it more efficient.  Every person engaged in industry in this country has realised that, on the one hand, whilst we were encouraged with fair words to increase manufacture and increase industrial activities generally, on the other hand the practical steps which should have been taken to bring about that state of affairs were not taken.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest handicaps which industry has suffered from in this country is the fact that we have had an unrealistic income-tax approach to the whole question of industry.  The best way for existing industries to increase their trade and their efficiency is to do so out of profits.  We have not, as a country generally, shown that we really realise the necessity for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has welcomed this Bill and he also said that he thought that it ought to have gone further.  I would say to Deputy Lemass, and I do not say this for any political reason, that it is a great pity that during the many years when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce he was not able to persuade successive Ministers for Finance that we would not get very far in our efforts for industrialisation unless our finance policy towards industry marched hand in hand with our desire to extend our industrial arm.  This is, as I say, a step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It mainly helps people who are engaged in coal-mining operations and those who are engaged in export trade. Naturally, it is to our advantage to do all we can to help exports.  I am sure coal-mining operations are equally of considerable importance to the country generally.  There are, however, other <Col N="1634" /> types of manufacturers who, whilst they may not at the moment actually be engaged in export trade, may in the future, if adequate taxation reliefs are given, be in a position to build themselves up into becoming exporting firms.  That is one point.  Again, whilst any firm is engaged in producing a manufactured article for sale that firm is in some degree or other helping to prevent the import of a similarly manufactured article and, from that point of view, it is only a step or so removed from actual export trading; if it is not actually exporting, it is certainly preventing the export of money, money which we need at home.</P>
    <P>Looking at the problem from that direction, there are degrees of priority in the necessity for helping industrial undertakings.  But they are only degrees.  All industrial activities carried out here are of assistance to our balance of payments problem and all that flows from it.  I am glad to note that we are now going to make allowances for industrial buildings.  I would wish that the same thing might be done generally in relation to machinery. Machinery is vitally necessary to industry.  Many industries rise or fall according to the amount of money they can put into up-to-date and modern machinery.  I hope that we will soon be in a position to give all industries benefit from that point of view. Remember, the industry which is to-day working for the home trade may in the future make itself sufficiently efficient and sufficiently up-to-date to be in a position to enter into the export market.  The export market is, of course, a jungle where business only goes to the strongest and most efficient.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have been anxious to increase the industrial activity of this country.  Looking back over a period of 30 years I think every fair-minded person will admit that this country has been slowly moving forward in the direction of developing its industrial efficiency.  The first Irish Government worked in that direction. The second Irish Government continued that policy.  Indeed, industrial development has now become the accepted policy of the Irish State. During the war years, we all saw the inestimable benefit that industrial <Col N="1635" /> development was to our citizens.  Without those industries, small as some of them were, the position of our citizens here would have been a great deal worse.  They would have lacked many things.  In the view of all thinking people, the case has been made for industrialisation.</P>
    <P>While industrial development has been achieved and whilst development is recognised here as vitally essential, it is not always recognised in the same degree in other spheres.  There is not a real climate of opinion in favour of industrial activity and all that goes with it.  I am speaking now very seriously on this.  We have often been told that our people ought to be keener on buying Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I believe they are very keen on buying Irish goods and I believe that, when a manufacturer presents goods of the right sort and at the right price, our people are very, very pleased to have that article and will support that product to the utmost of their capacity. At the same time we are not an industrially-minded people.  In fact we are not even a very commercially-minded people.  We have failed to realise that industry really works on its profits and that the profits that a firm may make are in direct ratio to its turnover.  With skill and ability and, more particularly, the ploughing back of profits into a firm, in a very short space of time, notwithstanding perhaps the small amount of capital that that firm has, it may be in a position to make large profits and sometimes people have taken the view that large profits are something that should in fact never be made.  That is an outlook that we will have to grow out of.  It is quite a common attitude in countries which are developing an industrial side to their economy.  I say all that, subject to the overriding fact, that in those profits there is no exploitation.  That is why I mention that there is a ratio between turnover and profits.</P>
    <P>We should follow a policy of encouraging industries wherever possible to increase their efficiency by putting in new plant and machinery and erecting new buildings.  In a large measure efficiency in business or industry now <Col N="1636" /> depends on the office staff and the office management.  A whole new technique has grown up in connection with that.  Many of these office aids, as they are sometimes called, which industry now uses are just as indispensable to the efficient running of an organisation as is the machinery which actually produces the goods.  They are part and parcel of the efficiency of industry and are vitally necessary in modern industry. I would like to see them being exempted from taxation just as buildings are, and as I hope will be done with actual machinery used in the process of manufacture.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill. I welcome it very much and I hope that in the future we shall see many more changes in relation to taxation and industry generally, because we must realise that we cannot just get increased efficiency in production and increased exports from industry generally unless we take the steps to see that those improvements can be made. We cannot expect to have modern industries housed in modern buildings with the most efficient machinery obtainable, if we have an income-tax code, and a corporation tax code designed to take the last penny from those industries.</P>

      <P>I realise that there is a certain financial difficulty facing the Government but throwing a certain relief to some people must throw an extra burden on others.  I would like to see in what way this measure will affect our largest industry, agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Government had two courses open to them in regard to this £35,000,000.  The first was to export goods to cover it and the second to produce the goods at home which are at present being imported.  I hold the Government made a mistake there by penalising the people who were producing at home the goods that now have to be bought abroad.  These people mainly constitute the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am chiefly concerned with Part III of this Bill in relation to exports. When we first got into difficulties it was in connection with certain moneys <Col N="1637" /> borrowed which we were told were borrowed for capital expenditure.  One instance of that capital expenditure was given by the Minister for Agriculture on one occasion when he told us that he spent £165,000 borrowed on a 30-year loan, on day-old chicks.  I want to know now if, that chicken having been manufactured into a hen since 1948&mdash;I do not know her age&mdash;we are now entitled to relief on the export of that hen?  Or are we entitled to export relief on the eggs produced by the hen to help us to pay the interest on the money borrowed to buy the chicken?  The money was borrowed to buy the chicken and we shall be paying interest on that day-old chicken for the next 20 years or so.  I do not know what age the old hen will be then.</P>
    <P>Section 10, Part III, of the Bill mentions &ldquo;goods manufactured within the State by the person who exports them&rdquo; and I hold that we farmers, having manufactured the chicken into a hen, should be entitled to export the hen and get relief on that export.  The same applies to cattle. If I hold a heifer calf for three years and then export the animal as an in-calf heifer, am I entitled, having manufactured the calf into an in-calf heifer, to relief on export under this Bill?</P>
    <P>These are the things that concern us, especially when we see that some lads who come in from Canada or New Zealand or somewhere else to dig out minerals are getting relief from taxation. Anybody who comes in here as a manufacturer and starts to export goods can get relief, but will there be any relief for the men who are all the time paying the piper?</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with another portion of this measure.  I am concerned with existing firms.  Will a firm exporting stout and beer or spirits from this country be entitled now to relief in taxation under Section 10? That is a question I would like the Minister to deal with at the start if he would not mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am keenly concerned in that because when we were making our bargain with Arthur Guinness a few months ago he told us that practically 50 per cent. of his stout was now exported and that he had to export it in competition with some firms in Britain and they were getting reliefs.  The difficulty comes in there: in order to get the raw materials for his export we have to produce for Arthur Guinness a stuff called malting barley.  I would like to know what relief the Minister intends giving to those who have to produce that malting barley in competition with the man producing it in Britain who has his artificial manures at £6 per ton less than ours and who has other reliefs as well.  For example, the man in Britain does not care what he gets for his malting barley; the Government subsidises his price.</P>
      <P>Back in 1948 Arthur Guinness admitted that the English farmer had an advantage of a half-crown a barrel over the Irish farmer.  He not alone admitted that, but he gave the Irish farmer a half-crown a barrel more for his malting barley than the English farmer got.  Arthur Guinness said that that clause in his contract cost him £2,500,000.  Of course times have changed and, under this Government, with the cutting down of grain prices farmers have to suffer many disadvantages.  However, when the farmers are making their bargain with Arthur Guinness this year they are entitled to know how they stand.  I am entitled to be told now by the Minister exactly what benefit Arthur Guinness will get under Section 10 of this Act. The other farmers and I will be with Arthur Guinness in a fortnight's time making our bargain and we will want to know then how we stand.  We are anxious to see that Arthur Guinness will not alone maintain his present export trade but that he will double it provided he does not attempt to pay us a price below the economic cost of production for our malting barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> As I have said, we are at a disadvantage compared with the British farmer whose artificial manures are subsidised by £6 a ton.  The British farmer is subsidised in other ways because no matter what price he gets for his malting barley the Government pays him the difference between the price he gets and a definite sum fixed by the Government as a fair price for it.  Because of the disadvantages we are suffering I would put far more faith in extending an Irish industry that is at present on its feet than in efforts to bring new industries into the country.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister how we stand in this regard. Looking over figures, I find that in the first nine months of this year Arthur Guinness exported practically £4,500,000 worth of beer to Britain.  If he could double that figure it would be £4,000,000 off the sum for which the Minister for Finance has put us in the hole.  It might enable us to pay for the foreign wheat we import instead of getting it on tick.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the provisions of this Bill because they might enable farmers to increase production. The Minister should endeavour to make it possible for the farmers of this country to produce barley as advantageously as it is produced in Britain.  I should like also to know what is the position of chocolate crumb in regard to the terms of this Bill.  God knows the Minister might induce his pal, the Minister for Agriculture, to let us know the cost of producing milk.  They are five years at it now.  I am more concerned with the Bill as it affects the agricultural community than with some joker coming in here to start an industry. I am mainly concerned with the man who is here already.</P>
      <P>What effect will Part III of this Bill have on the Irish Sugar Company and on the manufacturers of chocolate crumb?  If these come under the provisions of the Bill what will be the financial benefit to them?  Seeing that the production of beet in this country has gone down by 18,000 acres since we got the benevolent eye of the present Minister for Agriculture on it, and since that situation affects practically the whole economy of the nation to-day inasmuch as we have to find £2,000,000 which has been lost by C.I.E. due to the shortage of freight of 250,000 tons of beet, and seeing that we have to pay the foreigner £3,000,000 for imported sugar to make up for the loss in beet sugar, I am keenly interested in this matter.  I am particularly interested in it since the only sugar that can be used in chocolate crumb to-day is beet sugar.  I take it that is the only reason for growing beet at all.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Afforestation Programme&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was proposed by Deputy MacBride on 21st November, 1956:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that the aim of the afforestation programme of the State should be to <Col N="1641" /> plant a minimum of 1,000,000 acres at a rate of not less than 25,000 acres per year and requests the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure the implementation of this minimum annual rate of plantation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Debate was resumed on the following amendment proposed by the Minister for Lands on that date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the very substantial progress in afforestation made since 1948 under the impetus of the Forestry Policy of the Inter-Party Governments and agrees that hereafter there should be an annual increase of 2,500 acres in the rate of planting until an annual planting rate of 25,000 acres shall have been attained, whereupon consideration shall be given to the future rate of planting to be pursued, in the light of our forest and general economic requirements&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last week, I was dealing with the consumption of timber here in Ireland.  The most accurate information available to us of the consumption of timber in Ireland is to be found in the F.A.O. Report.  They said that, of all the European countries, the consumption of timber in Ireland is the lowest per head.  Every Deputy will realise what that means in terms of employment and in terms of industries based on the by-products of timber.  It means a big loss in manufacturing concerns and a consequent decrease or loss in employment.</P>
      <P>Seeing that we have had the lowest consumption figures, it would, I imagine, have sounded reasonable to the Minister or the various Ministers in the past that the least they would have in operation here would be a policy that would give us, from our own country, our minimum requirements. If we look now and turn from the consumption figures to the import figures we will realise how big a part timber and timber products play in the economic life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> At the present time, according to the leaders of the Government&mdash;and I agree with them&mdash;this country is in a serious position financially.  Day after day we hear pleas made in this House and on the wireless to save more and to spend less.  We are told that the economic freedom of our country is imperilled as a result of the financial crisis that now exists.  Let us see the part timber plays in building up this financial crisis that exists, according to the Government, and which we must all accept exists.</P>
    <P>The restrictions imposed in the past six months have cut across the ordinary people in an unmerciful fashion. They have been deprived of goods that are no longer luxuries or that can no longer be classed in the luxury group. This deprivation and hardship is imposed on the basis that our imports are so much in excess of our exports that, if we do not reduce our imports considerably, the country will be liable to more serious financial troubles than already obtain.  That is the broad picture we face.</P>
    <P>It is only on an occasion like this that we can bring home forcibly to the public the negligent or culpable part played by the State itself in bringing about such a serious situation as obtains.  There is no good pleading with a man who, at the behest of his wife, buys a washing machine.  There is no good criticising the man who will buy a new car after his other one has been only 12 months in use.  There is no use in telling these people they are doing a disservice to the State when we find the State itself setting the bad example.  I say, and I challenge contradiction, that the importation of timber and timber products plays a large part in the disequilibrium of our balance of payments problems.</P>
    <P>In the last ten-year period, in almost equal proportion, timber and paper products have cost us over £135,000,000. In the past ten years we have spent an average of over £13,500,000 per annum on the importation of timber and timber by-products which should and could have been produced within this State.  If anybody here thinks that the importation of this timber and the by-products has gone down, let me disillusion <Col N="1643" /> him.  Let me bring the facts home to him.  Over the year 1955 alone, the importation figures for the same commodities&mdash;for imported timber and by-products&mdash;amounted to £15,500,000.</P>
    <P>This policy of the importation of timber and by-products which this land of Ireland could grow in successful competition with any other country in the world is pursued as a result of the lunatic advice given by the so-called financial wizards who have directed this country's advance for the past 30 years.  The Governments which followed each other in succession relied on the orthodox viewpoint as expressed by the financial wizards.  Instead of putting the available money into the growing of timber in this State that available money was put into external assets that lost value year after year according as the situation developed or obtained across the sea.</P>
    <P>The important lesson to be learned from that is that if we find that, over a 30-year period, the advice given to us had led us into the terrible position in which we now find ourselves to-day, is it not fair to suggest that, in so far as it lies within his power, the Minister for Lands, charged with an afforestation programme, will no longer pay heed or listen to the type of advice that says to him: &ldquo;We will not plant.  We will not invest the money in planting here in Ireland.  We will invest it in British securities, as we have done in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will use the great weight God has given him to ensure that there will be a change of outlook in his Department, at any rate, particularly in so far as the utilisation of our money is concerned&mdash;that it will be spent within the State on development and afforestation rather than diverted to form assets outside the State over which we have no control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would sit on the Department of <Col N="1644" /> Finance.  There are people outside this House who maintain that Irish timber and the by-products of Irish timber are not as good as the imported commodities but I know that that view no longer carries weight.  I do not think any Deputy would subscribe to that view.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister himself on many occasions pointed out the value and the excellence of the Irish products, but we should not leave it to the members of the House alone to point out the excellent benefits to be obtained by the utilisation of Irish timber and so forth.  I gave examples, the last night I was speaking, of the high recommendation by Irish builders, by leading men in the timber trade outside, in connection with the product of the Irish forest.  When we get that viewpoint expressed by leading contractors and builders' providers in the country, that the Irish timber is as good for joinery and for furniture and for all other uses as the imported timber, when we have the statement made that many of the Irish firms prefer to use Irish timber because they find it more suitable, then I see no reason in the world why we cannot go ahead with a very big development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get the Minister's mind away from this midget idea of embarking on a programme that will give us in, say, 15 or 20 years' time our requirements as we now believe they will be, in other words, basing our consumption in 15 years' time on our present day consumption.  If we adopt a big afforestation programme now, there is no doubt whatever that if we are not able to absorb the timber in the bye-products that will accrue from a large-scale programme, we will get sale outside this country for all the timber we will produce.  If&mdash;as it is at the present moment&mdash;we have the position here that the Irish timber is available over the last five years at a rate that is 66 per cent. less than the imported commodity&mdash;and we have that statement from a leading builder here in Dublin&mdash;if we can buy Irish timber equal to the imported commodity at a price that is 66 per cent. less than that imported commodity, surely that would give us confidence <Col N="1645" /> that in years to come, if we had not consumption for all that we would produce, we would be able to get a market abroad for whatever is surplus to our requirements?  I know that the argument, the vein of thought that has been running through the Minister's brief on this for the last two or three years, is that if we reach a certain target&mdash;which I understand now will be 25,000 acres per year&mdash;we will have enough for our requirements as they are envisaged by the Forestry Department. I have no respect, Sir, for that kind of visage which has been shown by the Forestry Department for the last 30 years, when we show only an average of less than 6,000 acres planted per year.  If that is the sort of advice the Minister is going to take, I suggest to him that we will not see this large-scale afforestation programme which is needed at the present moment.</P>
    <P>On the import business again, not only did we import the figures I have given in 1955 of £15,500,000 worth of timber and newspaper products, we imported other products made from timber not included in that figure.  We import annually an average of £3,000,000 worth of commodities, including rayon and nylon, the by-products of timber.  That is an average of £3,000,000 a year spent on the purchase of these things abroad.</P>
    <P>Are we to get into this thing in a big way?  Are we going to be timid about it for our generation the same as the last generation?  Are we going to be afraid of the development of rayon and nylon and all these other processes that have been taking place over recent years?  Would it be fair to suggest that the afforestation people have only just recently heard about these products and that they do not come into consideration at all in the long-term planning that the Department is supposed to be envisaging at the present moment?</P>
    <P>There is another motion coming on here, A Cheann Comhairle, in which I hope to be able to deal more critically with the afforestation people themselves. I think I will postpone some of the matters until then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> One of the arguments put forward here in the past against a large-scale afforestation programme has been the difficulty in the acquisition of land.  I have come into this House on numerous occasions and the Minister has put a pair of horns on me on every occasion that he could possibly do so.  When I criticised him over the slow rate of acquisition, he tried to suggest that I wanted the type of tactics that have been adopted in Hungary to be utilised on the small farms of the West.  He actually painted pictures here to show that I wanted wholesale removal of villages in the West, and he deliberately tried to antagonise those people, to give them the impression that I had no interest in their welfare, only just to see timber planted and to hell with the people who were living in these areas.</P>

If I had my way in this and if I found that persuasion and a price did not achieve what I felt should be achieved and if I felt that the offer of alternative holdings of a reasonable character was not accepted by those people, I would take compulsory powers to remove them out of it.  I give the Minister a present of that now.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  If there is any section of this community which feels they must be patted with doles and reliefs for all time, when there is a chance of economic resurrection for them and a chance of a new livelihood away from the slum areas in which they exist now, if that opportunity is given to them and they fail to accept it, then they can blame no Government.  However, I think there is a duty on the Government not to pay endlessly this form of depressing dole that goes on at the present time, paying the man with the valuation of about £3, keeping him in misery and his family in misery for years on end, with the hope that around the corner, <Col N="1647" /> after some other election, that individual will get a farm of land.  That is the way these people are being codded at the present moment and I have no doubt whatever that, if the Minister accepted the recommendation which is there from Mr. Cameron that the purchase price per acre be raised where land was being purchased for afforestation purposes, where a reasonable price was given the Department would have no trouble in getting those people in mountain areas and in bog areas to give up the necessary land and to move out.</P>
      <P>If the Minister feels like telling me here that there is a reasonable price at the present time, I can assure him from the information available to me that forestry are still as niggardly as ever in the price being offered to people whose land is suitable for afforestation. I cannot believe in acquiring something from an individual who has thrived on it for years and not recompensing him.  I believe he should be properly recompensed; but if he is properly recompensed and still fails to carry out his responsibility as a good citizen of this State, I think the Minister has powers&mdash;and he certainly took them under this and other Acts&mdash;to act and to see that a gentleman of that sort does not hold up national progress. I know what the Minister will say at chapel gates about all that&mdash; and some of his colleagues, too&mdash;but I will put up with it.</P>

      <P>You have plenty of material now, the next time you trot around.  I pointed out here that we have almost 12,000,000 acres of arable land out of the 17,000,000 acres in the country.  That leaves over 5,750,000 acres of non-arable land.  Of these 5,750,000 acres, there are over 3,000,000 composed of land that is very nearly arable; much of it is moorland and much of it very suitable for afforestation. I say that, without touching arable land at the present moment there is sufficient land available in the State to carry out a planting programme <Col N="1648" /> that in a number of years would give us 1,000,000 acres of timber. There is no genuine excuse left now to all those people who have been making the excuses we have heard over the various years.  There is no excuse left unless they have the honesty to say that the real reason is lack of money. If the Minister says it is lack of money, we will all know how to help him.</P>
      <P>I understand that the average intake has not gone past the 15,000 acres per year, that the Land Commission or the Forestry Division or whoever is responsible, have not purchased more than that in recent years for the afforestation programme.  I may be wrong in that.  It would be correct to say that the average intake was 15,000 and let me by comparison mention this.  Since 1870 over 1,250,000 acres of reclaimed land have reverted to their original non-arable state in this country, through lack of lime or lack of attention.  If we work that out on an annual basis, we find an average of 15,000 acres per year.  That is more than we are acquiring for afforestation purposes.  The reason I mention that is that it is one more argument against those who say how difficult it is to get land for afforestation. It cannot be so difficult when we allow that amount of land to revert to its original state.</P>
      <P>If we take the eight year period ending in 1950 we find that over 120,000 acres of the best land in this country were purchased by aliens.  This works out at an annual sale of 15,000 acres to aliens.  If we can sell land at that rate to non-nationals and if we can allow land to go back from an arable state to a non-arable state at the rate of 15,000 acres per annum, surely no Minister is serious when he says there are great difficulties connected with the acquisition of land for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can take objection to anything I have said in this debate in a personal sense.  I do say to him, whether or not he will be still Minister in the new year, that the people who are interested in afforestation are really fed up with the chopping and changing that has taken place in recent years.  There is a feeling of uneasiness about the change in targets <Col N="1649" /> that has taken place and the various excuses given for changing the targets. Consequently there is a lack of confidence amongst the public and that section especially which is interested in the afforestation programme.  There is a lack of confidence in the Department as such; the people feel that there is no real solid plan available to be pursued on a long term basis and that the programme has been chopped and changed to suit the particular wind that blows at the moment.</P>
    <P>In view of the part that timber plays in our imports, I think it time we woke up to the fact that it is absolutely essential to produce, within this State, our requirements in so far as we can produce them.  I believe that whatever hope we have of economic salvation it is going to come through increased production on the land brought about by a vast land redistribution programme, side by side with a stepped-up afforestation programme.  It is only through a policy that will embrace both of these aspects that we will have a chance of preventing the substantial rate of emigration that exists at the present time.  It is only when we have industries based on the soil, and on afforestation, that we will be able to keep at home the young people who are now emigrating.  Wholetime employment is required and not work of a temporary nature so that the youngsters will have a feeling of security that will enable them to settle down here.</P>
    <P>It is argued, of course, that in recent years afforestation has taken on extra men.  In other words, there are 400 to 500 extra men working on afforestation. Let me get this home to the Minister.  Admittedly there is a great deal of extra employment given over the winter months to breadwinners, to young men and to fathers of families. They will get some work now on afforestation, to a limited extent, but that work is not the real benefit to be conferred on the community; it is the work they will be given afterwards, the constant work in the industries that will be set up when afforestation has got under way.</P>
    <P>The peak period for afforestation takes place around January, February <Col N="1650" /> and up to March; the period lasts only for about six weeks.  We are told by the Department that the number of forestry workers went up to 5,200 or 5,300 during January, but if we look six weeks afterwards that figure will have fallen by nearly 1,000.  In other words, the employment is only for six weeks or two months.  Does that suggest that the best type of man still available in the country will hang on for ten months of the year in order to get two months' employment in afforestation during the peak period?  Let us not think for a moment that there is a great all-round-the-year employment content in afforestation, but at the same time I do not want to be taken as criticising what is there.  We cannot have many men at the rate we are planting.  I want the Minister to step up that rate so that the time will be shortened, and shortened considerably, when industries will arise from the afforestation programme that will be initiated now.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that the Minister himself&mdash;and I am glad he is sitting down while I am saying this, because he is generally shocked when I praise him&mdash;has shown a definite interest in afforestation over the periods he has been in office, from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to the present moment. Anything I have said to him on this question of afforestation has been in the hope that it will strengthen his hand with the Department of Finance and any other agencies which have sought, from time to time, to thwart an afforestation programme.  Let me say that no matter whether it is the present Minister or anybody else who is in office, I shall take every opportunity in this House and outside it to criticise the rate of progress where I feel that rate deserves criticism.</P>
    <P>As far as afforestation is concerned, if over the last 30-year period the money that was wasted through investment in British securities&mdash;the money that was allowed to lie in external assets until it wasted through devaluation, through steps taken by various British Governments&mdash;were sunk here in agriculture and afforestation we would not be sitting here tonight arguing the pros and cons of afforestation but we would probably <Col N="1651" /> be discussing the various types of production that would be in process of development as a result of the clear-sighted policy pursued 30 years ago. It is no good going back on the 30 years.  It is time we started to do what should have been done 30 years ago and let it be said, at any rate, that the present generation of young men in this House will not, when they reach the tottering, doddering age of 70 or later, be still looking for the afforestation programme they were looking to see pursued 30 years earlier on.</P>

      <P>I think my amendment is a more direct approach to the question than Deputy MacBride's motion.  While Deputy MacBride's motion was aiming generally at increasing afforestation, I submit to the House that my amendment is putting the same idea in more concrete form and consequently I recommend it to the House.  Deputy MacBride has intimated that he is accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>When the question of afforestation comes up in the House there is a great deal of enthusiasm and as in the case of the speaker who has just sat down, we hear a good deal of enthusiastic nonsense on the subject of forestry. One must approach this question of forestry in a levelheaded way.  The first thing I would like to set right is the remark Deputy McQuillan made that in some vague way it is the Department of Finance that is exercising a stranglehold on the progress of afforestation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am a very foolish Minister but I would like to put the truth on the records of this House in case some unfortunate official in the Department of Finance would find himself saddled with a false charge.  Since I became Minister for Lands I have never had any difficulty <Col N="1652" /> with my colleagues in the Government, either the Minister for Finance or any other member of the inter-Party Government, in getting as much money as I wanted for afforestation. I cannot vouch for what happened during the time of the Fianna Fáil Government but at least during the last three years when Fianna Fáil were in office I do not think there was any stinting of money for afforestation. I want to put that on record so that neither the forestry officials nor the officials in the Department of Finance will carry blame that should not come to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>So there was but there again I should point out it is not the officials that do that.  I think that is definite Government policy, the policy of whatever Government is in power, but I would like to make it quite clear that this Government has never stinted in regard to money for afforestation.  In fact, every one of my colleagues, including the Taoiseach, was on my tail, so to speak, to get more and more done in planting, particularly because we are all perfectly well aware, as well as Deputy McQuillan, of the flight from the land.  As I have said here many times in the poorer areas where there does not seem to be any minerals&mdash;at least if there are they have never been discovered&mdash;the only hope is afforestation, and until such time as minerals may be discovered in these areas afforestation is the best way of using the land.</P>
      <P>However, I definitely disagree with Deputy McQuillan in his method of acquiring land.  Perhaps I am old-fashioned, perhaps I am backward, but I hold that if a farmer wants to sell us his land for afforestation we should buy it provided it is suitable and we can agree on the price.  Nevertheless, I want to register a protest here against what Deputy McQuillan said that once we have offered a man a fair price for his land he should be compelled to move out to make way for trees.  If that is not what the Deputy said I will take it back because I do not want to misquote him.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious for afforestation as any Deputy and I push it as hard as I can but I certainly will not be the one to introduce compulsory measures of acquisition in this House or give anybody authority to take over lands for afforestation purposes in the way suggested.  It is not for the purpose of scoring off Deputy McQuillan that I said what I said but because among the people in the country there is a large body of opinion that does not hold with that Socialist view.  I would never stand for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan said that the present planting is based on the consumption of timber and said I quoted that 15,000 acres would be sufficient to meet the requirements of the country. I did not quote any such thing.  What I quoted was that at the present rate of consumption 3,000 acres&mdash;not 15,000 acres&mdash;would be sufficient for the <Col N="1655" /> commercial timber needs of the country but that we were not satisfied with that and that in 50 years time were banking upon a four-fold increase in the use of timber and, consequently, it would need a yield of approximately 12,000 acres to supply the need.  That left us with 3,000 acres of a balance. Despite that we are going ahead and planting 17,500 acres this year, 20,000 acres next year in excess of what the country needs.</P>
    <P>The rate of land acquisition in 1946-47 was 5,330 acres; in 1947-48, 7,497 acres; 1948-49, 3,782 acres; 1949-50, 9,122 acres; 1950-51, 21,601 acres; 1951-52, 19,107 acres; 1952-53, 19,418 acres; 1953-54, 20,443 acres; 1954-55, 17,497 acres; 1955-56, 18,263 acres and in the first six months of this year 10,311 acres were acquired. That is the growth of acquisition. Everybody knows by this time that planting has been increasing all during the years.</P>
    <P>Might I take this opportunity of paying a compliment to my predecessor in office, Deputy Derrig, who was so suddenly called away in the past few days?  He carried out the afforestation programme in excellent fashion.  I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to a departed colleague and predecessor of mine.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride made a comparison with Britain.  I do not think that the comparison with Britain a fair or a good one.  In the first place, their population is approximately 16 times our population, taking England, Wales and Scotland as a unit.  Their land area is at least three times as big. England is a highly industrialised country and the usage of timber per head is much higher than it is in this country.  But taking everything into consideration, I am very proud of the progress afforestation has made in this country.  Very good strides have been made in regard to the acquisition of land without infringing upon the rights of the people who own the land and that is an important point which we must take into consideration.  If different methods were employed, I admit it would be easier to get land, but I should not like to see any Government nor would I like to be a <Col N="1656" /> member of any Government who would adopt those methods.  There is a way of getting the land.  The progress made in land acquisition in the past few years has been quite satisfactory taking everything into account.</P>
    <P>We have got an intake of over 20,000 acres per year and that is very good having regard to the fact that the Forestry people were geared to a much smaller programme only a short time ago.  On the 23rd November, 1955, I said at column 955 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...it may be of interest to the House to know that Ireland at the moment has 104 acres under timber for every 1,000 of population whereas the United Kingdom&mdash;with much less problems of land acquisition for forestry purposes&mdash;has only 76 acres per 1,000 of population.  Our present planting rate will give us 255 acres per 1,000 of population whereas the United Kingdom's target is 98 acres per 1,000 of population although the United Kingdom as a highly industrialised country will always have a much higher timber consumption per head of population than this country. Actual accomplishment in the United Kingdom at the moment is only 55 per cent. of the target of annual planting on which the above comparison is based.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me quote from <i>The Timber Trades Journal</i> of the 24th November, 1956:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the first time since the war the area planted was less than in the previous year.</P>
    <P>In the forest year 1954 the area planted was 70,400 acres; in 1955 it was 67,900 acres, a drop of 2,500 acres.  A fall in the rate of planting was earlier forecast by the commissioners and it is again their unwelcome duty to say &lsquo;they can see no alternative but to accept a still lower figure as the target for next year.  The reason is simply an insufficient flow of acquisitions of plantable land&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we must admit that there are far better prospects for acquisition in England, Scotland and Wales than <Col N="1657" /> here.  England does not depend on its land and is not a predominantly agricultural country like Ireland.  In Ireland, every bit of land is valuable. For that reason the acquisition of land here is much more difficult but our achievements in that respect are very good under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that other methods could be employed to get the land but they are methods that will not be employed if I can help it.  What was so dearly fought for should not be so lightly thrown away.  Deputies who advocate those methods do not seem to know the feelings which exist in every farmer's mind in regard to the piece of ground he owns.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the course of the debate that there is a huge area of waste land in this country.  My comments in that connection are that waste land is no good to us for planting. We want land that will give us at least a second or third rate crop of timber and not land which will give us no timber at all.  Outside of the entirely barren mountain-tops and other such waste ground, there is a very wide area of land but it could not be described as waste.  If a Land Commission inspector or a man with a dog and gun goes in on the land on a Sunday he will find that no matter how poor it is, there is an owner for it. There is no waste land.  With regard to mountain land, the small farmer makes his living on that particular type of waste ground and, no matter how much we would like to push afforestation, the humblest farmer is as much entitled to his rights as the President or any Deputy.  If he does not want to sell his land for afforestation purposes under any circumstances there should be no law to compel him to do so.</P>
    <P>Let me draw a line between the compulsory powers of acquisition of the commissioners and the powers in relation to the acquisition of land for afforestation purposes.  In the case of the commissioners, the land is taken to benefit the public but it is different in regard to the land acquired for afforestation purposes.  In that case the State grabs the land and gives a small measure of employment until, in <Col N="1658" /> years to come, it will give a very good deal of employment.  There is a big difference in the two things and they should not be confused.  In one case you have a body acquiring land not for itself but for the benefit of the people. In the other case you have the State acquiring land for the State.  The two things are totally different.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the House any longer except to quote again what I said on a previous occasion about European conditions.  European countries are held up to us as an example but it has transpired that a number of European countries have a lot of badly managed forest that does not yield any commercial timber little better than firewood.  I want to quote from the Dáil Debate of the 11th July, 1956, Volume 159, No. 5, in which I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If this country were to do no more than plant 15,000 acres a year henceforward, the future annual yield estimated on a moderate base can be taken as 30½ cubic feet per person.  In other words we have already advanced to a point at which we have a guarantee of a future timber yield more favourable than that enjoyed to day by Europe as a whole and almost twice as favourable as that enjoyed by Europe, less the Scandinavian timber-exporting bloc. The comparison would become even more favourable if account were taken of the high European consumption of timber for fuel purposes.  In Europe, excluding the Scandinavian bloc, fuel consumption accounts for 46 per cent. of the total cut.</P>
    <P>To drive the point home, let us compare our position with that of Denmark&mdash;I suggest Denmark because it is another small country with a comparatively small population and with a prime reliance on agriculture for its economy.  Denmark at the moment has an average yield per acre almost three times the European average and 9.1 per cent. of the country is under forest.  It is authoritatively stated that &lsquo;the demands for afforestation in Denmark have been fully satisfied&rsquo;.  One would not expect to find material for a favourable comparison here but with over one-third <Col N="1659" /> of Denmark's forest's hardwoods giving a lower yield and with 62 per cent. of the total forest area privately owned, 27 per cent. being held by 18,000 proprietors of small holdings, the net Danish yield is only 24 cubic feet per person as compared with the anticipated future Irish yield of 30½ cubic feet per person from a planting programme of even 15,000 acres.  Take into account the facts that 38 per cent. of the total cut in Denmark is at present devoted to firewood and that a much higher proportion of Denmark's population is industrially employed with a higher potential consumption of industrial timber and the comparison becomes even more favourable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>While we have the lowest figure in Europe, I say we are practically the best country in the world so far as tackling the job of afforestation in our country is concerned&mdash;15,000 acres planted last year; 17,500 in the next year; 20,000 acres the year after that; 22,500 the following year and 25,000 in 1959-60.  I think that is a very good programme.  We are not a very wealthy country.  We have not vast expanses of land easily acquired.  England is in a much better position yet they have had to slow <Col N="1660" /> down their programme very much. They have admitted they must have another cut this year on what they anticipated.  When we take into account that we are a land hungry people, that the whole of our economy rests on agriculture, that every 22,000 acres of land acquired each year from the farmers is 20,000 acres stolen or put aside from agricultural production&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, I am not.  I am just putting a point principally because of what Deputy McQuillan said.  Deputy McQuillan lashes himself into a frenzy on every debate.  When the Department of Local Government is being debated he wants £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 spent on the roads; when it is the Department of Defence he wants at least £50,000,000 spent on the Army; when it is the Department of Justice he wants Guards to get paid double what they are getting and to have twice the present number employed to run up the bill to I do not know how many millions; when the Department of Health is up it is the same.  If Deputy McQuillan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers like Deputy McQuillan can catch unthinking people off their guard.  I want to bring the debate back to its proper perspective. I am not speaking against my own amendment.  I am putting it forward for the consideration of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud of what the two inter-Party Governments have done for afforestation in this country.  Like Deputy McQuillan, I am sorry more was not done in the past, but crying over spilt milk is little help to get it up.  I take the position as I see it.  I try to improve it and that is what I am doing.  I think Deputy MacBride will admit the inter-Party Governments <Col N="1661" /> have certainly made their mark in afforestation.  We have deliberately and with purpose pushed afforestation very hard in the West of Ireland where there was a bogey against it, extending back many years.  It was said that land west of the Shannon would not grow commercial timber.  It is there we have to look for the big area of land where we can build suit-ably-sized economic blocks of forest. It is there our emigration rate is highest because the quality of the land is the poorest.  It is there we have the greatest number of small farmers on the land.  It is there we are making particularly good progress at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to decry the notion that nothing is being done about afforestation. From what some Deputies say you would imagine that nothing was being done, and, above all things, they place the blame for what happened 35 or 40 years ago on my shoulders.  I will accept any blame coming to me while I am in office but I certainly will not accept blame for what happened when I was a schoolboy.  I will not have that foisted on me.  I want the House to realise that a smashing great job of work has been done by the Forestry Division, and I hope I will not be accused of being over boastful when I say that no other Department has made such progress as the Forestry Division has.  The idea that officials of the Forestry Division of the Department of Finance are retarding afforestation is just empty nonsense.  The proof is that when the Government gave the green light to go ahead they rose to the occasion even better than I thought was possible.  The proof is that they have stepped up their acquisition rate from 5,000 acres a year to over 20,000 acres a year and their annual planting rate from 4,000 or 5,000 acres to 15,000 acres last year and 17,500 this year.  There certainly will be a further increase next year.</P>
    <P>I think that is something we should be proud of.  I cannot accept blame for the shortcomings of the past. Perhaps other Governments in the past did what they thought right; perhaps forestry did not appeal to them; perhaps there were no Deputies here to bring home to them the importance of <Col N="1662" /> forestry.  Who knows?  I was not here and I will not accept responsibility for what was done years ago.  I will pat myself on the back a little for the progress that was made under the impetus of the inter-Party Governments.</P>
    <P>In concluding I wish to commend this amendment to the House as a solid, constructive one, and one which, I know, will be adhered to by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's ears have been so grossly assailed during this debate that, in self-defence, he will certainly have to expand the forestry acreage even if he is only to use window boxes.  I should like to say at the start that it has never been my experience that money was not available for forestry to an adequate amount or to any needed amount.  I should like to approve of the Minister's attitude towards compulsory acquisition.  This is not Hungary and, until we have some outsider coming here to do that particular act to our people, it will never be done by any Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan also talks about the content of employment in forestry and of the quality of Irish timber and about exports.  The Minister is somewhat at fault for Deputy McQuillan's attitude.  When will Deputy McQuillan and all the other enthusiasts try to remember that forest trees are not Deputy Corry's day old chicks, that they do not grow to maturity in six months, one year or two years?</P>
      <P>Another point is in regard to the quality of Irish timber and here, again, the Minister is to blame.  I have continually pressed him to put out for exhibition some of the fully finished kiln dried Irish timber.  I have not seen Irish timber capable of being used for anything but the roughest work in the past 20 years.  That is the Minister's fault.  Why does the Minister not do something about the kiln drying and at least advertise the fact that this timber is of first-class quality, as I know it is?</P>

      <P>Some of us think that we are either at the forestry cross-roads or that we will be at the political cross-roads one of these days.  I am never impressed by any indignation expressed from the Lobby.  I think it is disrespect and disregard for the dignity of this House and I very much doubt the <i>bona fides</i> of those who exploit that indignation.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister wasted a tremendous lot of time chopping logic, where there was no logic, with Deputy McQuillan.</P>
      <P>The discussion on forestry originally embodied a motion by Deputy MacBride and an amendment from this side of the House.  They disappeared with the days' Order Paper. I am rather at a disadvantage.  I would suggest, Sir, that the reason for introducing a motion in the Dáil on any matter of public importance is to provide an opportunity for suggestions directed to the improvement of Government policy or to call attention to matters which adversely affect its operation.  A parrot-like repetition of baseless assertions, with a statement of uniformed opinion is, for its alleged purpose, but a waste of time and, listening to the debate here to-night on the motion and amendment, and a few nights ago again, I listened to nothing that was new or enlightening. I failed to discover any evidence of the fact that those who spoke had addressed themselves to the formulation of any realistic ideas on matters fundamental to forestry.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride had nothing new to offer.  He did not deviate from his established formula.  We had the usual pious assertion in his speech that the motion or amendment had no Party propaganda significance, that there was no intention on his part of apportioning a blame either for the past or the future, that the motion is a sincere and a selfless one, an effort to get general agreement on a progressive policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to my mind, the acceptance of such a policy demands for its initiation an objective, informed assessment of the problems to be overcome and of the means to be utilised to that end. Instead, we had, in Deputy MacBride's subtle and suave way, an <Col N="1664" /> indictment of Fianna Fáil, of its failure to understand the value of forestry or to do anything that was useful in regard to forwarding the policy&mdash;and nothing else&mdash;nothing that had not already been said <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister is honest, at least in one particular aspect.  He never makes pretence of being anything other than a political partisan.  The very introductory sentence to his motion is a patron the back for himself. He is patron, president, secretary, committee of the Joseph Blowick admiration society, the ultimate in ministerial intelligence and drive, ambition&mdash;An tAire Ó Blathmhaic&mdash; Blathmhaic na gcoillte&mdash;the flower of the forest.  I hope it translates the Irish name correctly.  Holding up the distorted mirror of his imagination, he sees therein the wood of his intellect transmuted into the chemicals and plastics of Deputy MacBride's rhetoric.  It is difficult for me to understand the Jekyll and Hyde&mdash;might I say the Jekyll and MacBride&mdash;mentality of Deputy MacBride's speech. On the one hand, he seems to be trying to construct a raft from the unsound timbers of the Clann na Poblachta Party, that might support him in some way even when the Government to which he so tenuously clings will founder, as it must founder, one of these days.  As a further side to his character, his grudging appreciation of the Minister's work seems to me to indicate that, being a good lawyer, he knows the Constitution thoroughly and knows that, in spite of all that has been unloaded on the Coalition, there is still room for another Minister and perhaps he is again looking for an invitation to take a seat in the Coalition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will prove the relevance of it.  Deputy MacBride knows that comparison has not been made fairly between Irish forestry cover and that of other countries.  For purposes of effective assessment, comparison may be made with certain countries, but the countries to which he refers have histories, conformation of land <Col N="1665" /> and systems of tenure entirely different from ours.  Anybody acquainted with Irish history knows the reason for our forest denudation and knows that the system of Irish tenure has had a profound effect on the pyschology of our people and that an important aspect of forestry development is the question of land acquisition.</P>
      <P>When Deputy MacBride says that we have 1,500,000 acres available for forestry, I cannot agree with him, but if he says that we have 1,500,000 acres suitable for forestry, I would wholly agree with him.  The question is to find out who owns the land and to get the owners to accept that the use of that land for forestry would be more profitable to them than its present use.</P>
      <P>I am just wondering if there is hidden somewhere in Deputy MacBride the same idea of compulsory acquisition as Deputy McQuillan so bravely raised to-night.  The Minister for Agriculture, last week, had a very pertinent question on that matter and he only gave voice to a question that is in the minds of many people throughout the country.  The main problem, which I have raised time and again here in the House, is that of persuading people that certain lands they hold would be better used in their own and in the national interest, if used for forestry than otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody referred to what the British Forestry Commission did.  In the English paper, the <i>Farmers' Weekly,</i> of 22nd November of this year, we read on page 42 that Galbarry agricultural interests took full advantage of an opportunity to acquire stock from the sale of three noted Scottish herds. We read that Mr. R. Midward disposed of his herd, which he had started in 1942, because his farm had been sold to the Forestry Commission.  If we turn over the pages of that journal, we find on page 69 another item.  Here we get the results of the auction of one of the herds from the farm acquired by the Forestry Commission.  We find that 112 cattle, cows, heifers and bullocks, were sold off that farm at the average price of £80 each.  That gives us an indication of the type of land available to the Forestry Commission. If the Minister went down to County <Col N="1666" /> Meath and found a farm on which there were 112 cattle of all kinds valued for £80 each on an average and acquired it for forestry, what would happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what would happen.  I think we are trying to build up, and succeeding in doing so, a very valuable national asset which I hope and believe will serve the nation as long as the nation exists, but such a great and valuable project cannot develop overnight.  A big business must be developed carefully and this matter of forestry is big business.  In such a business, the owners must learn by experience and they must understand that a minor error, understood and rectified in time, may mean the prevention of major and costly errors afterwards.  They must be certain that the foundations they lay are sound. Anyone can run a bucket shop on a shoe string.  It grows like a mushroom overnight and disappears in the morning. We are not sowing mushrooms.</P>
      <P>Those who have reproached Ministers and the Department with tardiness ought to realise that what they have been doing is building for permanency. Because of the foundations laid, the future, if wisdom prevails, is safe. Even the Minister must realise that the very substantial progress made in afforestation since 1948, under the impetus of the forestry policy of the inter-Party Government, is due entirely to the work that preceded it.  If the foundation had not been laid, they could not go ahead.  The Minister knows that the big problem is that of acquiring land.</P>
      <P>Various means of getting rid of the Minister's services have been mooted. Some of these I might approve of and others I might not.  I do not think that we ought merely get rid of the Minister to put some brass hat at £3,000 a year in his place, a brass hat who would be free from all control by the Dáil.</P>

Anyway, I do not want to get at the Minister for that purpose.  He can, as a matter of fact, carry on forever as far as I am concerned.  I think, again talking of what I hear outside, that no organisation that might be set up would have the knowledge and wide experience and the machinery and trained personnel essential to deal with the problem that the Land Commission and its offshoot, the Forestry Branch, have.  Again, it is being discussed outside in various intellectual debates that a separate Ministry should be created.  After all, once the dice has been treated at all you might as well overload it.  There is still room. To my mind we have a Minister for Forestry, such as it is.  The Minister is responsible for the Land Commission, but he is not responsible for its operations and he can, without detriment, confine himself wholly to the work of the Forestry Branch.  It may be desirable at some stage to do something else.  Just now I think we will trust the Minister, seeing that we must trust him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is probably aware, I have on numerous occasions urged a greater measure of agreement here between the Opposition and the Parties constituting the Government.  I have even urged the formation of a National Government. Having heard the Minister and the ex-Minister, there seems to be a tremendous measure of agreement in so far as forestry is concerned.  The only difference is that the present Minister has at least succeeded in trebling the annual area of plantation.  That is a tremendous tribute to him.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that so little was said by either the Minister or the ex-Minister, Deputy Moylan, as to the motion itself.  The motion, and the amendment to it, deals simply and solely with what the annual plantation target should be.  It is agreed that the target should be 25,000 acres per year. I did not hear either the Minister or the ex-Minister address one word to that issue.  Deputy McQuillan, by advocating powers of compulsory acquisition, provided of course a beautiful red herring for prolonged discussion by both sides.  I have never suggested there should be compulsory acquisition.  There is not a word in the motion about compulsory acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan and the Minister both said that, as far as they knew, there had never been any difficulty in obtaining the finances necessary for afforestation.  In 1951, when Deputy Moylan's Government came back into office, one of his first acts was to slash the Forestry Vote by £250,000.  I take it that was not done willingly by the <Col N="1669" /> then Minister for Lands.  True, it was reinstated later as a result of public outcry and public pressure.  I wonder why it is we cannot discuss motions such as this, involving really serious economic questions, without bringing in red herrings and without becoming personal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan made a suggestion which, I think, is unworthy of him.  He suggested quite clearly that my interest in forestry was that I wanted to obtain a seat in the Government.  His implied suggestion was that I was trying presumably to displace the present Minister for Lands.  Surely Deputy Moylan must realise that that was both an unworthy and unfounded suggestion on his part.  There is one very simple answer I can give, if it is necessary to give an answer.  The answer is that I was offered a seat in the Government and declined to accept it.  Why should a matter of that kind be introduced into a debate on forestry?  Is it because Deputy Moylan had nothing else to say?  Is it because he had no answer to the failure of successive Governments over a long period to perform what was one of the simplest and most obvious functions of any Irish Government? I do not think I said one offensive word, either to Deputy Moylan or any one of his predecessors, in opening this motion.  I simply urged that a plantation rate of 25,000 acres per year was the very minimum at which we should aim.  I said that I would like to see a much higher plantation rate.</P>
    <P>Why then bring in these red herrings? Why make a speech about compulsory acquisition?  Why bring in Hungary into a debate on forestry? Deputy Moylan complained that I had said nothing new.  That is so.  Everything that could be said about forestry has been said before, not merely by me but by everybody who has given solid thought to the question of the economic future of this country.  The only useful function I could perform, therefore, in this matter was to repeat what others&mdash;Arthur Griffith and every thoughtful leader&mdash;have said in regard to forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to Question No. 33 on to-day's Order Paper and the reply given by the Minister.  The question is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state (a) whether in September, 1956, a vacancy occurred for the position of permanent auxiliary postman in Drinagh sub-post office County Cork, (b) if a person without means who had satisfactory temporary service, and who fulfilled all the statutory requirements was appointed to the post on 6th October, (c) whether that person after having served in the post for some weeks was peremptorily dismissed and replaced by another person, and (d) the circumstances of the dismissal and of the appointment of the other person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As I explained in reply to the previous question, vacancies for auxiliary postmen are filled from lists supplied by employment exchanges and from persons already temporarily employed.  When the vacancy arose at Drinagh sub-post office, the employment exchange was unable to supply any names and a man was taken on direct.  Shortly afterwards it came to notice that there were, in fact, unemployed persons in the area.  The first appointment was accordingly cancelled and the employment exchange was again approached. Two names were now supplied and the claims and qualifications of these persons, together with those of the person who had been taken on direct, were considered. In the outcome, one of the persons nominated by the exchange was selected as the most suitable. No question of statutory requirements <Col N="1671" /> arises in auxiliary postmen appointments, and the appointments are not permanent but temporary and terminable without notice.  In this case, the man discharged was given a fortnight's notice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply of the Minister was so completely at variance with anything that happened before that I doubt if the Minister was aware of the full background of what occurred in this case. My experience of his administration in the past led me to believe that he did not know all the circumstances. At any rate, I was profoundly shocked by the whole business and in order to give the House some idea of what exactly occurred, I wish to present these details to the members.</P>
    <P>In August, 1956, Mr. Jer. McCarthy, who had held the post for many years, went on sick leave, and Mr. Timothy Keating, who was the only man from Drinagh registered in the branch employment office and who had already acted as temporary postman during Mr. McCarthy's holiday period, was again engaged in that capacity.  Mr. McCarthy resigned from the service early in September and steps were taken by the Post Office authorities to make a permanent appointment.  As stated in the Minister's reply, such positions are filled from lists supplied by employment exchanges and from persons already temporarily employed. When the vacancy in Drinagh arose, the employment exchange was unable to supply any name and a man who was already doing the temporary duty was taken on direct.</P>
    <P>Everything was quite in order up to that stage.  This man was Mr. Timothy Keating, the only man coming within the terms and conditions set out by the Minister in the opening sentence of his reply.  Consequently, on Saturday, 6th October, Mr. Keating was notified by the Drinagh sub-post mistress that he was appointed to the position and she also handed to him the following: (a) measurement form for postman's uniform, which was returned duly filled on Monday, 8th October; and (b) a sealed letter from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs addressed to Dr. P.J. Smith, <Col N="1672" /> medical officer, Drimoleague, the Department's local doctor.  This letter was handed by Mr. Keating to Dr. P.J. Smith on Monday, 8th October, and the latter carried out a medical examination.  The medical officer filled the form and handed it back to Mr. Keating who returned it to the postmistress at Drinagh on the same date. Mr. Keating also got typed instructions regarding his route and hours of duty which he signed and of which he retained a copy.</P>
    <P>The sub-postmistress also instructed him to provide a birth certificate or baptismal certificate.  This was handed by him to the sub-postmistress on Monday, 8th October.  His pay was raised on October 6th from the temporary rate to the applicable rate in force for a permanent auxiliary postman of his age, which was 19½ years. Later in the month of October, two new application forms were issued by the local branch employment office, one being to the chairman of the local labour branch.  On November 3rd, it was intimated to Mr. Keating by the Drinagh sub-postmistress that his employment would terminate on Saturday, 17th November, giving him a fortnight's notice, as the Minister said to-day.</P>
    <P>One of these applicants, the chairman of the local branch of the Labour Party, took up duty as permanent auxiliary postman on Monday, 19th November.  Mr. Timothy Keating is an orphan.  His father, who was a creamery worker and an Old I.R.A. man, died three years ago, and his mother died in September this year. His only support is a brother who is a mechanic's apprentice, and who lives in a labourer's cottage.  Mr. Timothy Keating has no other means of support. He has been unemployed since leaving school, with the exception of periods on relief duty as acting postman for Mr. Jer. McCarthy and the six weeks for which he was permanent auxiliary postman.  That is the employment which is now terminated.</P>
    <P>The serious thing about this is that whatever circumstances existed in the past regarding appointments of this nature&mdash;and they varied at times&mdash;we have here something that never, in my <Col N="1673" /> recollection, happened before.  That is disclosed in the Minister's reply.  He sets out the conditions under which appointments are made and he then shows that an appointment was made in relation to the circumstances which existed shortly afterwards.  This is the serious aspect of the whole business. Shortly afterwards, it came to notice that there were, in fact, unemployed persons in the area.  If that procedure is to be followed in the Post Office services of this country there would be no security for anybody in the Post Office services.  That is one of the things to which I raise very serious objection.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if the Minister were aware of all the circumstances in this case and if he knew the background to this procedure.  The whole thing was disgraceful.  After appointing this young man who had given temporary service to the Post Office, it was found possible to dismiss him in favour of another man in the area.  This young man was the orphan of an Old I.R.A. man who had given good service in a temporary capacity.  At the time when the vacancy was declared he was the only qualified person in the district. He was duly appointed, got his uniform and his medical certificate and was on duty for six weeks when he was dismissed.</P>
    <P>I think it was an extraordinary state of affairs.  The person who was qualified on the relevant date should have been appointed whether he was the chairman of the local Labour branch or not.  The suspicious part of it is that, as the Minister himself says, some time after the appointment had been made it was found there were more unemployed men in the area and that new forms were issued after this young man had been appointed.  Then the whole thing was upset.  Such procedure is something that should be condemned by this House.  Steps should be taken by the Minister to see that nothing like it could occur again.  If there should be a recurrence of such procedure it would be a reflection on the whole system and would undermine any confidence in the method of recruitment to the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>A situation such as this, where somebody comes along and displaces a <Col N="1674" /> person who has been legitimately appointed to a post in the Post Office service, has never occurred before.  It has never happened that a man working in the position and carrying out satisfactorily all the conditions of his appointment was displaced for somebody else because that somebody, subsequent to the date on which the vacancy occurred, went to the labour exchange and registered there.</P>
    <P>The man who replaced Timothy Keating was not registered in the local labour exchange when the vacancy was first there.  He had worked for a local farmer now and again.  He was receiving sick benefit when this occurred and some time after the vacancy became known to occur he was told to go to the medical officer and get a certificate of fitness.  He did that and then went along to the labour exchange and registered and the whole scheme under which the other young man was appointed was upset and the young man, the orphan of an old I.R.A. man, was thrown out of the position he had secured in the normal legitimate way.</P>
    <P>I was very upset and disturbed to-day to learn from the Minister's reply that such a thing could occur in the Post Office service.  Accordingly, I have taken this occasion of calling public attention to it.  I am very sorry it is the Minister who is involved in this because I think I am speaking for many members of the House when I say we have always found him square and fair in all our dealings with him. Of course this may be an isolated incident, but if it is it is about time a stop was put to it so that anything of a similar nature may never recur.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy MacCarthy, I was disappointed when I heard of this injustice to this young man, apparently at the sanction of the Minister.  I feel inclined to believe, like Deputy MacCarthy, that the Minister was not fully aware of the facts of this case.  Deputy MacCarthy may have inadvertently omitted some of the facts surrounding this appointment.  On the day this young man was notified of his appointment in a permanent capacity by the postmistress his pay was raised from the level of temporary auxiliary <Col N="1675" /> postman to that of permanent auxiliary postman.  He then went to the expense of providing himself with a bicycle, having been given details of his duties on Form M.P. 193.  The letters M.P. are very significant in this matter. Subsequently, having been measured and having received his uniform and provided himself with a bicycle, he assumed his duties and had given satisfactory service for six weeks when he received Form M.P. 145 from the post office at Bandon, signed C. Dempsey, saying that he had not been successful in his application for the post.  The Minister, in his reply to-day, told us the appointment was cancelled.  Now which is it?  Was this applicant successful or was he unsuccessful and the appointment later cancelled?  The facts are that this young man, who without any influence, or without a recommendation from anybody, was declared eligible for the appointment and succeeded in getting the position.  Subsequently, the man who was a friend of Deputy Michael P. Murphy, was advised to go to the labour exchange and register instead of receiving the sickness benefits which he had been getting at the date at which this vacancy was declared to exist.  When this other man had registered at the labour exchange the position was readvertised and the young man who had honestly got the job was put out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full forces of the Labour Party in West Cork, with Deputy Michael P. Murphy in the van, were brought to bear against this young man who had been enjoying for six weeks all the comforts that such a position gave him.  It is nothing short of disgraceful that a young man, fully competent of doing the duties assigned to him, should be displaced for no other reason than that he was not a supporter of the Labour Party in West Cork.  I would not begrudge the position to any young man, irrespective of what Party he belonged to, provided he had been honestly appointed to it.  The man who was subsequently appointed had a family, it may be said, while the original appointee had not.  That is not the point at issue here.  The real point in this matter is that no man can feel secure in his position unless he is <Col N="1676" /><i>persona grata</i> with the local Deputy who supports the Government for the time being.  That is a disgraceful situation which should not be allowed to exist, and I would advise the Minister to direct his attention to it.</P>
    <P>The man who was originally appointed to this post had been issued with a uniform, had gone to the expense of procuring a bicycle and was raised from a temporary auxiliary postman to the status of permanent auxiliary postman.  He was subsequently told that his application had not been successful.  In face of that the Minister to-day says the appointment was cancelled.  Such a state of affairs should not be allowed to exist.  Otherwise confidence in the Post Office service and in the manner of staff recruitment will be completely undermined. I am sorry to see this Minister in this position.  It is true that this young man was not registered in the exchange at the time of his appointment because he was working as a temporary postman then.  That cannot be held against his eligibility, however, because neither was the man subsequently appointed registered; he was drawing disablement benefits at that time and he had himself registered on the advice of the local Labour Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be a feature that succeeding Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs have to appear here once or twice, or more frequently, on the Adjournment in regard to the appointment of auxiliary postmen.  It has been the fate of my predecessors and I suppose I could not escape forever.  These appointments are made very frequently, sometimes every week and certainly some every month.  It is not a bad tribute to me that, after two and a half years in office, this is the first time I have had to appear here in relation to such a matter.  As I say, I suppose I could not escape all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Since I had the honour to become Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I have striven to interpret the rules fairly and impartially and to get the best possible service, having regard to the domestic circumstances of the applicants.  I may say that there are numerous applicants for all these posts and that a good deal of consideration must be given to all the applications before an appointment is made.  Any young man who has had a good primary education and who is sober, honest and correct can do the job.  Each applicant, of course, thinks that he is better qualified than any of the others.  Very few appointments have been made in which it has not been suggested that the wrong man was picked, but, as I say, this is the first time that a question has been raised on the Adjournment in relation to the matter since I took office.</P>
    <P>First of all, I want to say that Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy J. Lynch made a mistake when they said the young man was uniformed.  He was not uniformed.  In a supplementary question to-day, Deputy MacCarthy asked if I was aware that the young man was registered at the labour exchange and was the only one registered at the time.  My answer is that this young man did not come to the labour exchange at any time.  When the post office had a vacancy, they sent to the labour exchange for a nomination and the labour exchange said they had no one suitable in that area.  There is a radial distance which is considered suitable for the recruitment of postmen, but that is really a matter for the postmaster rather than for the labour exchange.  I have their letter on the file and if anyone wants to challenge what I have said, he can consult the Minister for Social Welfare and check its accuracy.</P>
    <P>This young man had worked as a casual and, in the absence of a nomination from the labour exchange, he was put on by the postmaster.  He was appointed under delegated powers: that can be done without the labour exchange.  We go there generally, but there are certain times when such powers can be used, as in this case.  At the same time, I heard that there were <Col N="1678" /> three unemployed men in the locality with responsibilities and I cancelled the appointment of the young man.  He had no uniform at the time: that was in the process of going through.  I cancelled it and asked them to go to the labour exchange again.  Then they submitted two names&mdash;the married man and a single man, plus this young man. These were considered.  I gave the position to a man and I object to his being styled a chairman of the Labour Party.  I did not know he was a chairman of the Labour Party.  I knew him by his name&mdash;Donovan.  He has a wife and five young children.  The other was a young man of 19 years.  In view of the fact that the man who had a wife and five children was unemployed, I had no hesitation in giving the decision in his favour.  Since then, the other young man has been engaged on temporary relief work and we have done anything we could for him, short of giving him priority over a married man with a family.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out, the young man in question did not come from the labour exchange.  He was appointed by the Department without my knowledge or consent, under delegated powers.  When it came to my knowledge that there was a more deserving case in the locality, I immediately made inquiries and acted in the way in which I did.</P>
