      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present session to provide for the making of grants in aid of industrial development in areas other than areas to which the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, applies, and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the making, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of grants not exceeding £2,000,000 in the aggregate to the Industrial Development Authority to enable them to perform their functions under such Act;</P>

      <P>On this, Sir, I desire to get some guidance from you.  You have informed me that you propose to rule out of order an amendment which I have moved to this Bill to delete sub-section (4) of Section 2, which relates to the undeveloped areas, on the ground that the Money Resolution provides that the funds to be provided under this Bill will not be usable in the undeveloped areas.  Is it in order for me now, in view of the fact that this Bill is being taken in Committee to-day, by arrangement, to move to amend the Money Resolution so as to permit that amendment of mine to be considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to contest the Chair's ruling in that regard, but the Bill provides for a fund of £2,000,000 to be expended on grants as prescribed in the Bill.  I am not proposing to increase the amount of money to be provided, but merely to enable the board which will function under the Bill to use the money in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would appear to be against the principle of the Bill even if it did not impose a charge on public funds.  I will allow the Deputy to discuss the matter on the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That will do me just as well, although my difficulty is that I hope to persuade the Minister that my amendment is desirable and I want to see him in a position in which he can accept it.  I do not think the Minister has fully appreciated the fact that the exclusion in this Bill of the areas defined in the Undeveloped Areas Act can operate to the detriment of industrial development in that area.  It would be quite reasonable to provide that an industrial concern which qualified for financial aid under <Col N="2355" /> the Undeveloped Areas Act should not qualify for additional aid under this Bill, but there is the possibility that industrial concerns which we would like to see operating in the West will not qualify for aid under either measure.</P>
      <P>When the Undeveloped Areas Act was being debated here, I, as the responsible Minister, made it clear that the intention was, by means of grants given by Foras Tionscal to industrial concerns in the undeveloped areas, to provide against the possibility that a new industrial undertaking there would be at a competitive disadvantage as compared with similar undertakings in the eastern part of the country; and Foras Tionscal was directed to measure the aid they gave in any individual case by reference to the economic disadvantage associated with the selection of a western location.</P>
      <P>There were numerous occasions upon which concerns applied to Foras Tionscal for aid under the Act and were refused on the ground that there was no economic disadvantage associated with the western location.  The examples I will give are, first of all, a project for the manufacture of ground limestone.  The Board contended rightly that ground limestone can only be worked where the limestone is and consequently there could be no other location chosen for that enterprise except the one proposed to be adopted. In other cases, companies proposed to manufacture commodities for sale in the western areas only, furniture for distribution in Mayo, Galway and so forth, or some other commodity which they did not intend should be brought into the more competitive markets of the east, but would be sold only in the western areas.  Again, the Board held that as the intention was to develop a market in the west, the right place to put the industry was in the west and there was therefore no competitive disadvantage in putting it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other cases.  There was a printing concern which intended to do a local business in a western area whose application for a grant was rejected on the ground there was no competitive disadvantage in choosing <Col N="2356" /> the western location.  There is no such restriction put upon the Industrial Development Authority under this Bill. They can give a grant to any industrial concern without any attempt to measure competitive disadvantage, if any, which the industry may have because of location or other circumstances. Consequently, it could happen that a certain type of new industrial project could qualify for a grant under this Bill where a similar undertaking, to be located in the west, could not qualify for a grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it seems to me desirable to exclude altogether from the scope of this Bill the areas which are designated in the Undeveloped Areas Act and I do not think that there is any disadvantage in giving to the Industrial Development Authority under this Bill the right to consider applications from the western counties where these applications relate to projects which Foras Tionscal, by reason of the limitation put upon them, are unable to consider.  If it is thought desirable, a provision could be put in to ensure that a concern which would qualify for a grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act would not qualify for a grant under this Act; but in view of the possibility that there will be concerns which are entitled to apply for aid under neither Act, I think the complete elimination of the western counties from the scope of this Bill is undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I want to protest as strongly as I possibly can to the Minister in relation to the disastrous effect this measure will have on the West of Ireland.  Here, last night, the Minister very cleverly suggested that Deputies like me, who are arguing the case of the West, are, by their arguments, showing a detestation for the rest of the country.  That is, of course, quite untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped to see the Minister introduce a measure here which would be a measure of industrial expansion, not a panic measure such as that introduced here now and for which this Money Resolution is being debated to-day.  The Minister is on record as stating that he was as anxious as any <Col N="2357" /> other Deputy to see industrial development in the West of Ireland.  In the course of a speech here, he stressed the fact that he was worried and perturbed that the Undeveloped Areas Bill, as it then was, would not be of any great benefit to the West.  He stressed the point that he believed more appropriate steps should be taken and he suggested that, if he had the responsibility of dealing with the West of Ireland, he would not introduce such a measure as Deputy Lemass was then introducing; he would produce a far better one, a far more practical measure and one that would ensure that, if private enterprise failed in its responsibility, with all the inducements offered to it, Deputy Norton would induce the State itself to interfere through the Industrial Development Authority and start industrial development in the West, instead of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Now the people in the West of Ireland, as a result of that statement, believed that the present Minister was dissatisfied with the Undeveloped Areas Act.  When it was introduced, he was of the opinion that it would not give any great benefits to the West, that his view was that legislation should be introduced which would give the State authority to establish industries in the West and, at a later stage, these industries could then be either leased or sold to co-operative groups which would establish themselves in various centres throughout the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Remembering that that was the view of the Minister then, is it not rather an extraordinary situation to find that he himself should introduce legislation aimed at expanding industrial production, legislation calculated to do harm to the West of Ireland?  The Undeveloped Areas Act was passed to entice, if I may use that word, or induce, industrialists to go west of the Shannon.  The inducements in the Act were such that the wording of it in many cases, through Civil Service interpretation, prevented almost any attempt at establishing certain industries in the West.  Bad as that situation was, the steps the Minister has now taken have made the position infinitely worse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2358" /> The Minister has stated that he is anxious to see every part of the country get an opportunity to establish industries.  Every Deputy will agree with that.  This is not the correct occasion to argue the merits or the advisability of shovelling out public money by way of large State grants to private enterprise, without any tags. If I were to go into that, I would suggest that any such action of deliberately dipping into the public pocket and forking out £40,000 or £50,000 of public money to private enterprise, without any tags, is a most dangerous form of legislation and one that is in direct contradiction of Labour policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not pursue that line on the Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to make that clear.  Seeing, however, that that line of action has now been adopted and remembering that the Undeveloped Areas Act set the example of giving out this money, I presume the present Minister is following in the footsteps of his predecessor in giving the same type of grant to industrial groups over the rest of Ireland.  I suggest that the incentive and the attraction that were available to private enterprise in the West under the Undeveloped Areas Act will now disappear as a result of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for the Minister to say that grants up to 100 per cent. are available for the erection of factories in the West of Ireland under the Undeveloped Areas Act and that grants of up to 50 per cent. are available for the purchase of machinery and the training of personnel.  Will the Minister tell me, since the Undeveloped Areas Act was implemented in the West, how many full cost grants of the nature he has suggested here were given to the West of Ireland?  Is it not a fact that under this new Bill, which this Money Resolution is to cover, it will be possible for private enterprise to get a grant of up to two-thirds of the cost of starting an industry in places like Dublin and that, in so far as the West of Ireland is concerned, under the <Col N="2359" /> Undeveloped Areas Act, no single industrial project has got more than two-thirds up to the present?  I have grave doubts if any industrial project got even two-thirds by way of grant.</P>
    <P>Does that not prove, therefore, that there is now no incentive and no attraction to private enterprise to go west? Is it not human nature for an industrialist to set up camp in what is, after all, the hub, namely, here in Dublin? I do not want to delay the House on this because I do not think we will get anywhere with it, but I would appeal to the Minister at this stage to give some reassurance to the people in the West that he is prepared to give more than just lip sympathy to their predicament.  I would ask him, before he concludes on this measure, to state specifically what plans or programme he has to meet the grave unemployment and emigration problem that exists in the West.  What plan has he from the industrial point of view, now that he has introduced this measure which, when it becomes law and comes into operation, will undoubtedly have a disastrous effect on any and every industrial undertaking in the West of Ireland?</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the industries set up under the Undeveloped Areas Act got about one-third of the total overall cost.  It has been more in some cases but I think that on the average they got about one-third in grants.  The provisions of this Bill will now offset the attractiveness of any grants that have been available under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>Without interfering with the proposals enshrined in this Bill, that matter can be remedied.  If the present attractiveness is offset by this Bill, then the only thing to do is to increase the amount of the grants given under the previous measure. There is provision in this Bill for a larger percentage of grant than is given by the Department at present. Accordingly, if the Undeveloped Areas Act is to function, is to function properly, and if the West is to get industries, then there must be a departure from the present policy of giving roughly one-third of the total cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2360" /> There are other industries in the West which did not get any contributions from the State because of the fact that there were other such industries in the West previously.  Take for instance the manufacture of Donegal homespun.  Since 1952, new branches of that industry were set up in the county, new branches which have now entered the export market, the dollar export market at that.  They did not qualify for a grant because it was felt that it would be unfair to give them any competitive advantage over similar undertakings that had been established some years ago under their own steam.</P>
    <P>I think it is most unfair now to give grants outside the undeveloped areas and at the same time to exclude completely industries that were about to be started in those areas and which will not qualify for grants because they have some of the characteristics of other industries which started since the passing of the Act and which did not get grants.  I think that would be most unfair, and if there is provision in this Bill which would permit that to happen it should be remedied.  An industry started in the West, which for some reason or other cannot qualify for a grant under the Undeveloped Areas Act, should surely be given the benefits being made available under this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse what other Deputies have said about the obvious effects of this measure on previous legislation passed for the benefit of the undeveloped areas.  I think we stressed the fact here on the Second Reading that there was no spirit of criticism of the proposals of this Bill in our remarks.  It is not that we, representing the undeveloped areas, had any envious feelings toward equivalent help to industries in the better favoured parts of the country, and if the Minister is going on that line I would offer to him, as a very effective reply, that nature itself is the reason.  Nature's dispensation is the reason why there was the discrimination, if such it could be called, in the Undeveloped Areas Act. Agriculture is the main activity of the country.  The great central plain, the <Col N="2361" /> province of Munster and the eastern regions, as we know, have been favoured by nature for the development of agriculture.  No such conditions exist over the greater part of the territory west of the Shannon.  It is inexplicable, therefore, why this present Minister, who has shown such appreciation of factors in many other spheres, ignores this.  I can only conclude that he is deliberately cynical about the effect on these undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I recall, when there was a choice as to the location of an industry between Kerry and Kildare, the Minister favoured Kildare because he represented Kildare.  That was his own statement.  If he was speaking as a Deputy, one could understand it but it does indicate that the Minister has not that solicitude for these areas which we would expect in a man in his high position.  He did seem to think after the last war that industrialists generally in the country were pretty well supplied with finance to expand their industries.  I need not dilate on how he expressed that viewpoint but he was sufficiently eloquent and forceful in his description of the conditions of affairs which he thought existed to indicate that he thought they would not require any assistance by way of legislation to finance any further development which they might conceive.</P>
      <P>This is a marked and noticeable change in the attempts which the Coalition have been making for the last two years to show that they were able to go one better than Fianna Fáil.  Where we had a Parliamentary Secretary to represent those areas, they were not satisfied until they gave them a Minister.  Whether it is the Minister's change or the Government's change I do not know, but certainly there is a very marked change here. There is no question of going one better in respect of the undeveloped areas.  Without any formal recantation a measure is brought in whose obvious effect will be to nullify completely the good effects of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act may not <Col N="2362" /> have been a spectacular success taking all the undeveloped areas as a unit, but there were spectacular results in certain parts of those areas.  While within those areas we may not have had the diffusion of industrial effort which we would have hoped for, industries of a very considerable size and significance were established which would, to some considerable extent, keep migration at least west of the Shannon, and that would have been some achievement.  Now the only hope for industrial development in those areas will be wherever very large scale industries will be capable of establishment for an export trade.  In so far as the home market and the smaller type of industry are concerned, this Bill spells finis and we have no chance from now on of getting those very valuable smaller class industries which would not urbanise our Gaeltacht areas but would give employment of a permanent character.  That development was possible and had shown some signs of giving help under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>If we seem to feel bitter about this we have very good reason for so doing. I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister to have second thoughts about this, whether he would not consider referring this matter to some sort of committee or body, let it be an all-Party committee of this House or some such body, with the aid of the best economic advisers he has got, to try to anticipate and to analyse what its possible effects will be.</P>
    <P>I recall to mind, before the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act, the case of a very interesting project which I had hoped would come to one of the poorest parts of my constituency.  It was an industry which would have given employment mainly to girls.  At the time there was a very heavy emigration of young girls from those areas to England.  The promoters of the project were very interested themselves, from, I should say, patriotic reasons as well as other reasons, in decentralising and coming in to a Gaeltacht district. They examined the project thoroughly and informed me subsequently that they regretted very much their inability to establish the industry in my constituency because of the economic <Col N="2363" /> factors which we all know existed before the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>That is one very striking personal experience I have had and I was very gratified when the Undeveloped Areas Act came into existence to remove those handicaps and relieve such patriotic promoters from the economic disabilities which existed.  Now the Minister, with a complete disregard of the effects on the achievements and possibilities of that Undeveloped Areas Act, introduces, a measure which will wipe all that out.  It is not conceivable that anybody who has £50,000 to invest in an industry in Mullingar, Clonmel or Kildare, will go down to Oughterard or Louisburg with it.  I certainly would not expect them to do it.  I take it that henceforth all the people west of the Shannon can hope for from the direction of industry as we are now experiencing it is to follow the industries as it is quite obvious that, under this measure, the industries will not go to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that there are areas in this country which, owing to the changed conditions, are in as poor an economic plight as certain areas provided for in the Undeveloped Areas Act, but, by regulation or by Order, the Minister could have extended the benefits of that Act to these areas.  Under that system, I think they stood a better chance and I say so for this reason, that these areas could easily have been pinpointed and concentrated on and the Minister, had he so wished, could have made a regulation applying to these areas in response to any local effort they have been able to make. Now the whole field and the whole country is opened wide by this measure and, in consequence, they have to compete with the whole country.  This Bill does not improve the position of these areas at all. Many of them were major military posts and stand more or less in isolation and the change-over was so speedy that in many cases the men have emigrated and the women are working the homes and it is very difficult to get local finance to make the necessary <Col N="2364" /> effort to establish industries in these areas.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act, they could get help if the intention was there, more so than under this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are a number of such areas in the constituency which I represent, places like Kinsale, Passage West, Bandon and others which are well known to the Minister; but in these areas any effort to establish an industry would have behind it the inspiration that they were getting special consideration from the Minister by reason of their position and plight. Now, as I say, the whole field is open, and, in consequence, their chances are lessened because people setting out to establish industries can select any part of the country and therefore these areas will remain in the position which they have been in for the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that more money has been spent by the present Government in the undeveloped areas than by Fianna Fáil.  Surely a start had to be made?  Fianna Fáil in its three years of office had to put that Act through the House and just about the time there was a chance of operating it favourably, there was a change of Government.  Therefore, it is no credit to a succeeding Government to say that they spent more money in their time.  That happens in every case and I think the Act itself, and the idea behind it, which was promoted by Deputy Lemass, was, as has been shown, the first favourable sign of a concentration on industrial development along the western seaboard, in what were known as the congested areas and the depressed areas, away from the big centres of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned last night that there were depressed areas for which nothing has been done, and I would ask him if anything can be done for them under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  I only hope my forebodings are not proved correct and that these areas, which for so long have been looking for development and which have not got the finances to make much of a local effort, will not now go into the background again and be left there to decay under the new idea, so <Col N="2365" /> to speak, of industrial expansion.  To my mind, that was already there, in a general way, and there is now only a providing of the help of certain finances for any part of the country that may be selected.  In consequence, I have to say that I see no great hopes that the position will be improved for these areas we have in mind.  They are depressed, owing to the change-over to national freedom and have been left there, more or less derelict, to decay by reason of lack of local finances and consequently lack of local enterprise. I hope the position for them will change and that the Minister, at any rate, will show that there is some merit in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, the members of the Opposition are talking with different voices, clearly indicating that they have a different outlook on the matter.  Deputy Bartley spoke without, apparently, hearing what Deputy Lemass said.  Deputy Bartley and Deputy MacCarthy say that this Bill will sound the death knell of the Undeveloped Areas Act, a phrase used by Deputy Brennan in the course of this debate.  Speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill, Deputy Lemass said at column 1950, Volume 160, of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister can have his Bill, as far as I am concerned, but I want to make it clear that, in my view&mdash; and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy&mdash;I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So while Deputy Lemass approaches it from the standpoint that it makes no difference at all, Deputy Bartley waxes eloquent about its deleterious effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the undeveloped areas have an attraction.  I think the undeveloped areas will have attractions when this Bill is passed and I cannot see why Deputies cannot comprehend the obvious advantages still residing in the western areas.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act, a board administering the funds allocated for the administration of that Act can give promoters of industry 100 per cent. of the cost of buildings and in this Bill the maximum they can get is two-thirds.</P>
      <P>Under the Undeveloped Areas Act the promoters can get 50 per cent. of the cost of machinery.  Under this Bill they can get nothing.  Under the Undeveloped Areas Act they can get a contribution for the training of workers.  Under this Bill they get nothing.  Therefore, there are clear advantages so far as the undeveloped areas are concerned by locating an industry in those areas.</P>
      <P>In any case, there are other parts of the country besides the undeveloped areas&mdash;some of those areas to which Deputy MacCarthy refers but at the same time wants to give them nothing. How many places are there outside the undeveloped areas which are as badly off as the undeveloped areas and in some cases worse off than some of the places in the undeveloped areas?</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass knows only too well&mdash;and students of past speeches can look at his speeches at the time&mdash;that the intention of the Undeveloped Areas Act was to delineate a certain portion of the country and say that was the undeveloped area but an effort was made, when the Bill was under discussion, to bring in other areas contiguous to those which constituted the undeveloped areas.  If Deputy MacCarthy reads the speech of Deputy Lemass on this, he will see that Deputy Lemass stated that he was not prepared to bring them in but that he would consider what he could do and that if, in certain circumstances, they could get an industry for them it might be possible to apply the benefits of the system to them but no guarantee was given.  That was done in particular so far as I can recollect in the case of Cavan, where efforts were made to get certain areas in there but no Deputy from Cavan was produced to say he disliked this Bill.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Opposition have virtually excluded our eastern, southern and midland Deputies from participation in this debate.  Instead, others have been sent in to wail about the deleterious effects of the Bill which Deputy Lemass, who knows much more than all the others put together, says will have no effect whatever on the western areas.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham raised a question about Donegal homespun industry.  So far as Donegal homespun industry is concerned, of course, the industry has been located in the main in Donegal and no place else or along the western seaboard.  So far as the real handwoven tweeds are concerned that is an industry in the main indelibly associated with that portion of the country.  I do not think that efforts to establish a similar industry in the East, the Midlands or the South will achieve any measure of success.  Deputy Cunningham complained that that industry got no assistance up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Financial (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, passed by the Dáil, that industry for the first time since this State was established will now get a substantial drawback for taxation purposes on its exports over and above a datum year.  They never got that before.  They are getting it now for the first time and, just when they are getting it, Deputy Cunningham was sent in to bewail the fact that they are getting no assistance.  Are they not getting assistance now they never got before in that field?  Can that be denied?  If they stimulate their exports which I hope they will&mdash;their exports <Col N="2369" /> are of excellent quality for which a market is available and is always likely to be available&mdash;then there are distinct attractions to these firms in exporting a number of their products, since 50 per cent. of the profits on the export trade will for the first time be exempt from income-tax and corporation profits tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy hopes it will confer no benefits.  Therefore, he will keep the centre of the stage in this matter as long as he can.  Is that the reason?  So far as the question of where a firm makes an application for a grant to Foras Tionscal is concerned and fails for one reason or another to get the grant, perhaps because there is no competitive disadvantage by going west or maybe for other reasons associated with the unsoundness of the whole enterprise, Deputy Lemass thinks they should get the grant provided for in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the second matter is concerned they will have to run the gauntlet and if we are to do anything there may be some case for examining the question.  I think it should be done through the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If it was felt that there was not a competitive disadvantage to the firm by operating in an undeveloped area the application would be rejected.  In that event there may be a case for saying: &ldquo;We will give you the benefit of the Acts which will apply elsewhere,&rdquo; and I would undertake to have that matter examined in connection with the Industrial Grants Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Lemass knows only too well, the undeveloped areas is really <Col N="2370" /> an arbitrarily defined area, a line of demarcation drawn for administrative reasons more than anything else.  A number of areas on the eastern side of that line are in fact just as badly off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They can be brought in and I have undertaken to bring a number in.  If they go east they can get an industrial grant.  So far as the competitive disadvantage is concerned, if the firm does not get a grant within the undeveloped areas because of the competitive disadvantage, the firm can move over the border, if it wishes, and go outside the undeveloped areas where economic conditions are quite indistinguishable from conditions in the undeveloped areas.  Therefore, while a firm might, on competitive disadvantage, not get a grant from An Foras Tionscal for operation in the undeveloped areas, all it has to do is to move across this virtually indefinable line from the economic point of view, camp outside the undeveloped areas where conditions are exactly the same as they are in the undeveloped areas; and in that case they qualify for entitlement to the two-thirds grant provided under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in carrying on a manipulation of words to that extreme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let Deputy Lemass read it and he will see I am not changing from what I said before. There are obvious advantages.  There are some good, large-sized towns in the undeveloped areas.  There are substantial hinterlands around those towns from which a substantial labour force can be drawn and it is an intelligent and adaptable labour force. The undeveloped areas will continue to give these attractions, while the financial attractions of the Undeveloped Areas Act will remain; and, in my view, they are substantially better than those which will be provided under this Bill.  There are places which deserve consideration outside the undeveloped areas.  It is the money of everyone in the country which is to be utilised for helping the undeveloped areas; is it too much to expect that other areas, in the east, in the Midlands, in the south and in the north-west, should not be denied assistance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, may I ask the Minister now, if an industry is proposed to him outside the demarcation line of the Undeveloped Areas Act, and if it would be a marked advantage to get by Order an extension of the Undeveloped Areas Act to apply to that industry, would he be prepared to consider that aspect, rather than act under this new Bill&mdash;if what I have said would help the industry better?  Would the Minister apply both considerations to his examination of the problem?  I am asking this because I can see this point arising by reason of the fact that it has arisen already and that representations were made to the present Minister and to his predecessor regarding some of these areas, to extend by regulation the provisions of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If the proposition comes up now under this question of foreign industry, would the Minister be prepared to consider both aspects of the matter when he is dealing with the problem?</P>

Far from begrudging those areas the meagre help which is provided for them in this Bill, we were <Col N="2373" /> prepared to see them getting the bigger help which is provided under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  We think that areas such as he has mentioned, like West Cavan, are entitled to the benefits of the Undeveloped Areas Act. Why will the Minister not give those benefits to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 34, to delete &ldquo;in considering&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall not consider&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate to sub-section (3).  The Minister implied, although I am not sure he said it specifically, that it was not intended to give grants under this Bill to concerns proposing to manufacture commodities where the home market for those commodities was being met already by existing concerns.  The Bill, however, is very weak in its expression of that intention.  It provides that the Industrial Development Authority will have regard to the extent to which the existing market is being met by existing concerns.  I think it is far better that that should be stated specifically, both from the point of view of making clear the intention of the Bill and of giving the Industrial Development Authority the basis upon which to refuse to consider applications which are to be debarred on that ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2374" /> That is why I think the drafting of the Bill should be such as to make it quite clear that the Authority is not open to consider applications where they relate to the manufacturer of commodities which are already manufactured by existing concerns in adequate degree.  That is to say, when somebody comes to the Authority, the Authority can say that there is a section of the Bill by virtue of which it cannot consider the application.  As it stands now, the Authority can consider the application and then it has merely to take into consideration the extent to which the existing market is met.  I think it will remove a great deal of apprehension amongst existing industrialists if it is made quite clear now that a grant will not be given to bring a new firm into competition with existing firms which have had no corresponding aid and whose activities are at present conducted on a scale which means they are supplying the whole of the home market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is unnecessarily apprehensive as to the section as it now stands.  This sub-section is based on a corresponding provision in the Control of Manufactures Regulations, 1932, which relates to the grant of new manufacture licences under the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister sees that the circumstances are different?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they are different, very much different; and the home manufacturer is very much more entrenched now than he was in 1932, when it was proposed in the Control of Manufactures Act to permit an outside body to come in here and operate under our legislation, by giving them a new manufacture licence.  At that time, it was not decided that he could not come in at all; it was decided that, in considering the application, regard should be had to the extent to which the market was being supplied or was likely to be supplied by existing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  It was not intended then to <Col N="2375" /> exclude completely the possibility of giving new manufacture licences in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This position here is a considerable strengthening of the situation so far as the Control of Manufactures Act is concerned and it is a vast improvement on the Undeveloped Areas Act in that respect.  The Undeveloped Areas Act contains no similar provision to what is in this sub-section, and so far as this Bill is concerned, it contains greater statutory safeguards for existing concerns. In practice, of course, before grants are made under the Undeveloped Areas Act, An Foras Tionscal has regard to the extent, and a similar operation will apply here.  I think, it having been stated from both sides of the House that the intention is to safeguard Irish industries, safeguard the existing firms, and that point of view being well known to both the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal, there is no likelihood in 1956 or 1957 that the legislation will be used to harm their position in any way or to encourage the establishment here of industries which would not make any great contribution to the strength of our national economy and would result merely in undesirable or, perhaps, cut-throat competition, to the detriment of the industrialists who have borne the heat and burden of the day.  There is no intention that should be permitted.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment the Deputy has submitted would, in fact, place a statutory obligation on the Industrial Development Authority of satisfying themselves before considering an application that the requirements of the public were not sufficiently met by existing undertakings and we might very well leave the authority open to legal action by an existing manufacturer if they found the requirements of the public were already being met.  If that possibility were there&mdash;and I am advised it is&mdash; it would tend to create difficulties for the Authority and for the administration of the Act, and might very well stultify the entire purposes of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2376" /> Another damaging consequence which would flow from the amendment is that it would preclude the Authority from considering applications for grants based on the export market unless the Authority were satisfied that the home market was not being met.  I think it is only necessary to point out these shortcomings of the amendment to Deputy Lemass to convince him that there are adequate safeguards there and that the policy of all parts of the House is well known to the body administering the Undeveloped Areas Act grants and the body which will be administering these grants in order to ensure that the fears which he has expressed will not, in fact, really arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is misunderstanding the point.  So far as the Control of Manufactures Act is concerned, it was never intended to legislate to preclude entirely the possibility of giving licences under that Act to a foreign firm coming into any industry here even if there were existing firms in that industry.  What it was intended to provide was that the extent to which the requirements of the country were being met by existing undertakings manufacturing the same commodity would be taken into account.  Indeed, there have been many instances of firms coming into the textile and clothing trades under certain conditions even though there were Irish-owned firms established in those lines already.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Undeveloped Areas Act there was no such provision and it was not intended to exclude from possible development in the western areas industries which were already established in the east.  The intention was to offset the competitive disadvantage of a western location, it being recognised that these firms would have to get their trade in competition with firms in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister may not appreciate that there is apprehension among existing industrialists because of this provision, and it is not enough to say that it is not his intention or my intention or the intention of anybody else to give grants in certain cases. The decision will rest with the Industrial Development Authority once the Act is there, and it is that Authority <Col N="2377" /> alone which will decide on applications. The Bill, as it stands, does contemplate the possibility of a new factory being established beside an existing factory with the aid of a Government grant, getting trade in competition with the older firm.  I think it is unlikely that the Industrial Development Authority will give a grant in that case, but if somebody comes to seek a grant in such circumstances the Industrial Development Authority will be obliged to consider it and if they refuse to consider it or refuse to give a grant it will cause difficulty for the Authority and perhaps for the Minister. Is it not wiser now to put a provision in the Bill to make it quite clear so that the Authority can point to that provision and say that they are not open to consider such an application? I think it is far better to draft the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>May I say, too, that the argument about the possibility of a legal action is not a very serious one?  If there is such a danger I have no objection to putting in words to make it clear that the prohibition applies only when &ldquo;in the opinion of the Authority&rdquo; the existing supply of goods is adequate. If there is a desire to keep open the possibility of making grants to new firms to make commodities which are already produced by existing firms but where there is a possibility of export trade, that could be provided also.  But that is a dangerous proposal because once a grant is given it is given and nothing more can be done about it.  A firm could apply upon the basis of dubious prospects of an export market with no real intention of developing an export market at all and under the Bill there is no power by which the grant can be recalled if conditions of that kind are not fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question on one point&mdash; what exactly is the meaning of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;?  Who are the public? As we stand, as far as I can gather, the home market here is shrinking every day for any particular industry. This Bill maintains, so far as this sub-section is concerned, that if the home market is being met by the industrialists at present operating you can <Col N="2378" /> still have a grant given to a new industry making the same goods provided it will have a substantial export market available.</P>
      <P>I gather Deputy Lemass's point is that he is worried about the welfare of those industrialists who are already in existence, the men who have factories here.  I think, if it is possible, the question of the external trade, that is sub-section (c) of Section 2, should be deleted from a measure of this sort and that other arrangements should be made to deal with enticing industrialists into the external market because there is a grave danger&mdash;I do not say that such a thing as graft will enter into it&mdash;that all sorts of pressure will be brought to bear on the Industrial Development Authority and subterfuges attempted regarding the desirability of giving grants under certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>For instance an industrialist making a certain commodity, up to the present, may not have extended very far into the export market and it is quite possible that another man may decide to start, and for the purpose of getting a substantial grant, it may be possible for him to put up a very strong case that there is a first-class market in Canada or America that has not yet been probed and that he should be entitled to get a grant from the Industrial Development Authority to start that industry, whereas perhaps in 12 months' time the industrialist manufacturing the same commodity already would be able to expand his business and go into the foreign market himself. Is there not a danger there that grants will be given to men who are concerned purely with taking advantage of sub-section (c) in Section 2?</P>

      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, it is not dealing with the problem of the existing manufacturer. This is a Bill to provide grants for the establishment of new buildings to house new industries which comply with the provisions of Section 2.  It is not dealing with the ins and outs of the export trade or the encouragement of exports, as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Lemass's amendment, if accepted, would mean is that if somebody came here to establish an <Col N="2379" /> industry for the purpose of producing goods entirely for export, you could not make a grant to him unless you were satisfied that the home market was being met.  As it stands, this Bill will enable us to make a grant to a person to engage entirely in the export trade without regard to the other consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass says that, in the long run, these grants will be administered by the body set up to administer them. That is so.  He thinks his amendment would safeguard the possibility that they would make a grant for the establishment of an industry to supply goods which are already being supplied. That is possible under the amendment, too.  With his amendment, the sub-section would read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Authority shall not consider applications for grants under this section when the requirements of the public in respect of the commodities to be manufactured are sufficiently met by undertakings already established.</P>
    <P>All the Authority has to do under that sub-section is to say: &ldquo;We do not believe that&rdquo; and in that case the grant is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Look at your amendment.  If your amendment were accepted, that is how the sub-section would read.  All the Authority has to do under that sub-section is to say: &ldquo;We are satisfied that these commodities are not being sufficiently manufactured here&rdquo;, and, if they say that, well and good.  The Deputy referred to the main Act and said that once the Authority took a decision under the section as it stands, nothing could be done.  You can take a similar decision under the section which the Deputy offers and nothing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This goes further than the Foras Tionscal provisions went.  It goes further than the Control of Manufactures Act went.  We have now pretty well cut out a pathway in relation to which we say: &ldquo;So far as giving aid to industries is concerned, you ought not <Col N="2380" /> to jeopardise the legitimate interests of the manufacturer who is already here.&rdquo;  This Bill is drawn in such a way as to give these necessary assurances. I have repeated the assurances here and Deputy Lemass repeats them for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can frame legislation on the rather temperamental fears of people who can see no safeguard in assurances and who merely feel that there is always danger in them.  There are people who go through the world always surrounded by wolves and crying &ldquo;Wolf.&rdquo;  You cannot get sane legislation if you cater for their tastes or views.  This Bill takes the view of the sensible man.  So far as the industrialist is concerned, his interests will be adequately safeguarded.  If the board goes over the rails, there is a way of dealing with the board.</P>

      <P>Obviously, the Minister will not listen to argument.  I was thinking of trying to save him from difficulty.  If the Industrial Development Authority turn down an application on the ground that existing firms are supplying the goods in sufficient degree, there will develop an agitation of a political kind.  It has been my experience, as Minister, that whenever I rejected an application on the ground that it was not a sound business proposition, the next thing that happened was either that the application was amended or else I got a copy of a resolution from a political club concerning it.  That is why I think it is far wiser to put in the Bill a specific indication that they are not open to consider such matters where, in their opinion, the market is already being supplied.  However, I am prepared to let the Minister have it, if he is not open to conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Attorney-General (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised to look into a matter which was raised by Deputy Finlay.  I should have given a longer explanation last night of the matter involved.  It arose on Section 2.  Deputy Finlay also made his remarks applicable to Section 4 but it can be dealt with on Section 2, which runs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to this Act, a married woman shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) be capable of suing and being sued,</P>
      <P>as if she were unmarried.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is as it stands now.  The suggestion has been made that the section may lead to objectionable actions between husband and wife.  We discussed the possibilities of objectionable actions last night.  The only point which was left over was whether it permitted detinue or conversion and ejectment proceedings and whether, in the ejectment proceedings, the old right of <i>consortium</i> was being weakened or abolished under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have described it last night in this way.  The position, as far as all these actions are concerned, that is to say, actions relating to property, is that a married woman can take them under the law as it stands, and the Bill makes no change whatsoever. Section 12 of the Married Women's Property Act, 1882, gave to a married woman the same civil remedies for the protection, security and recovery of her separate property as if she were unmarried, and it expressly gave her these rights against her husband as well as against any other person.  A wife may, under the law as it stands, sue her husband in trover or detinue <Col N="2382" /> (<i>Larner v. Larner</i> (1905) 2 K.B. 539) and, if she had a trade or business which is her separate property, he may be restrained by injunction from interfering with it, but&mdash;and I want to emphasise this&mdash;it does not follow that a husband can be restrained from entering premises belonging to and in the occupation of his wife in the exercise of his marital right of <i>consortium</i> (see Halsbury, 1911 Edition, page 459).</P>
    <P>In addition to that statement of English law, there are two cases to which I should like to refer.  In <i>Gaynor v. Gaynor</i> (1901) 1. I.R. 217, the court, while restraining the husmand from interfering with the business carried on, refused to restrain him from entering the premises.  The distinction is perhaps even better emphasised in <i>Weldon v. De Bathe</i> (1884) 14 Q.B.D. 339, C.A., which was an action of trespass against a person entering a house bought out of a wife's earnings and in her sole occupation, though the defendant did no injury and entered with the husband's authority; the point being that the entry was for purposes unconnected with the husband's desire to live with his wife.</P>
    <P>The position is this: the 1882 Act, until we can get this to replace it, is law here.  Under that Act, the right of <i>consortium</i> is not interfered with. In the Irish case I have cited, the husband was restrained from interfering with the business, but would not be restrained from entering the premises because it was the marital home.  In the other case, it was not connected at all with the marital relations between the couple.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Finlay, who made this point to me, I would offer him this in answer.  This piece of legislation says a married woman shall be capable of suing and being sued as if she were unmarried.  That only gives the right to sue.  When one comes to the case and when the case is contested, defences to the action remain unimpaired and the right of <i>consortium</i> is still there.  Anything that depends on the marital state is not taken away.  The legislation does not say that the right of <i>consortium</i> is abolished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2383" /> The second point is this: We have had the situation since 1882 of having phrases even wider than those here. The law has been that way since 1882, and cases have shown that the right of <i>consortium</i> can be established.  For those reasons, I would suggest&mdash;and this matter has been seriously considered&mdash;that there is no fear at all of what Deputy Finlay expressed last night.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take Final Stage to-day.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion of the Government, the Dáil is now to adjourn for a period of two months.  I am sure there is no responsible Deputy on either side of the House who is not apprehensive of the economic and social conditions which may prevail and face the Dáil when it reassembles here in February next, if, as seems likely, present trends persist.  In recent years it has not been customary to arrange debates on the motion for adjournment for the Christmas Recess, but in our view it is desirable before the House breaks up for this two months' adjournment period some effort should be made to try to get the Government to face up to the facts of the situation and to their responsibilities regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the last debate we will have in the Dáil in this year.  It is not unusual at this time for reviews to be made of the events of the year which is ending.  I think 1956 will be recorded in history as one of the worst years which this State has experienced since it was established, with the exception, only, of some of the war years.  It certainly has been the only year in <Col N="2384" /> which signs appeared of a decline of the confidence of the public in the country's future prospects.  In the past, on occasions of this kind, in debates upon motions for the adjournment, criticisms were sometimes expressed and were occasionally justified of inadequate progress in the economic and social spheres.  But always in the past, no matter how adverse the circumstances, there was some progress to record.  Now, all the economic indicators tell us that national progress has halted and indeed that the country is losing ground in important directions.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to blame the Government for the situation which has developed and is developing.  It would be very easy for me, if I were only interested in Party political advantage, to occupy the time of the House in contrasting the results which the Government's administration has brought with the fine promises they made to the people during the General Election which put them into power.  It would be very easy to illustrate here by a multitude of quotations from ministerial speeches the many contradictions between the viewpoints and policies of individual Ministers, the general confusion of aim which exists within the Government.  I do not think it is necessary to do that.  Everybody knows that the Government's performance has fallen a great deal short of its promises, that Ministers are frequently contradicting each other in their declarations of the Government's intentions and that the main characteristics of the Government are lack of clear objectives and lack of leadership.</P>
    <P>Whether the country wants it or not &mdash;and there can be no very great dispute as to what the country wants&mdash; this Government will remain in office at least until February 13th.  The purpose of this final discussion is to make an effort to ensure that they will not merely sit down and do nothing during that period, thankful for their release from pressure from the Dáil to take some measures to cope with the grave economic crisis which is developing. We hope that they can find within themselves the capacity to exertion and to constructive and intelligent action <Col N="2385" /> which will at least prevent the situation becoming a great deal worse before Deputies reassemble here on February 13th.</P>
    <P>This year, 1956, saw the revelation, the official confirmation, of the magnitude of the deficit which emerged in 1955 in the country's international payments on current account.  The shock which the people got from that revelation was all the greater because on many occasions during 1955 the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and other Ministers gave repeated assurances and forecasts that there was no ground for anxiety on that score.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget Statement in 1955, referred to the satisfactory international trading position&mdash;which they had inherited and which was revealed by the statistics of 1954&mdash;the absence of any serious deficit in international payments win that year, and assured the House that he had every hope that that improvement in the country's position would be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when introducing his Estimate much later in that year, dismissed as unimportant the evidence in the trade statistics of a growing disparity between the volume of imports and the volume of exports by saying that the increase in imports was the result of stocking-up by business and industrial firms and that he did not believe that we had to fear any crisis on that account.</P>
    <P>When these optimistic forecasts, these assurances, from members of the Government, who are presumed to be familiar with the facts, were proved by the event to be completely worthless and groundless, the Government panicked and, in their apprehension that the deterioration in national circumstances was likely to continue and to grow a great deal worse, they introduced a policy of restriction, a policy designed to lower the living standards of our people, by increasing the prices of many goods through special taxes designed for that purpose, the policy of reducing consumption, through a general increase in taxation and by increasing unemployment, because unemployed men and their families must of necessity consume less.  The growth in the number of unemployed represented <Col N="2386" /> the success of the Government's policy of restriction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the course of a speech made recently in Cork, said that these restrictive measures adopted by the Government had brought about a substantial improvement in the position.  Nobody has any confidence now in any statement made by any Minister and that statement of the Minister for Finance did little to dispel the apprehensions of the public or to restore confidence in the country's future, because it will not stand examination for one moment in the light of the facts as we know them.</P>
    <P>All the evidence that we have shows that the Government is as wrong in its analysis of the situation now as it was in 1955.  It is true that, to the end of October this year, the volume of our imports declined by about 10 per cent. It is also true that, during the same period, the volume of our exports declined by about 6 per cent.  That decline in imports was due to the reduction of the living standards of our people and in considerable degree to the depletion of industrial stocks.  It represents no permanent rectification of the state of imbalance of the country's trade revealed in 1955.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the fact that the terms of trade have moved against this country, that import prices have risen while export prices have fallen, there is nothing in the available statistics to suggest that the measures taken by the Government were adequate to deal with the situation or to inspire confidence that those measures alone will help to put the national economy on a basis of permanent stability.</P>
    <P>Production is falling.  The great need of our economy is to secure an expansion in overall production.  The aim of all policy must be to induce an increase of production.  The Government have declared that the object of the measures that they have applied is an expansion of output in agriculture and industry.  Will they face up to the fact that they failed, that all the things they have done so far have not merely failed to bring about the increase but have not even arrested the decline in production?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement this year, had to <Col N="2387" /> record that agricultural output fell last year by 2 per cent.  That situation has not been rectified since and the whole future prospects of our agricultural industry have been further bedevilled by the circumstance that, while production is not rising, prices are falling.  The agricultural price index for June, 1955, was 104.7.  For June, 1956, it was 94.  That substantial and significant fall in agricultural prices, with static production, means a serious diminution of agricultural income.  It is, perhaps, worth mentioning, in passing, that the decline in agricultural prices has not, however, been reflected in the cost of living and that over the same period the cost-of-living index number showed a rise of seven points.  Industrial production is down by 7 per cent.  Industrial output is now running at a lower level than it has for many years.</P>
    <P>For the first time, apart from the war years, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to record a serious diminution in the number of workers employed in industry.  Unemployment, as shown in the number of workers on the live register, is higher now than it has been at this time of the year for over 15 years and that, notwithstanding the fact of which every Deputy is aware, that emigration is proceeding at an unprecedented rate.  These are the facts to put against the Minister for Finance's assertion that there is a substantial improvement in our position: falling production in agriculture and industry, unemployment rising to crisis proportions, the trade deficit continuing, corrected only by the diminution of imports due to falling living standards.  If that is the Government's idea of what is a substantial improvement in national circumstances they will find very few ordinary men and women to accept it.</P>
    <P>Private investment in production is at a low ebb.  There is no business concern, no company formed to promote any new business activity, which could hope now to raise capital by public subscription through the stock market and, indeed, no company would attempt it.  Government State investment activity has been drastically <Col N="2388" /> curtailed.  The Minister for Finance did not even attempt to go to the public to borrow the amount which he estimated in his Budget statement would be required in this year to finance the announced capital programme of the Government.  Even the limited loan which he sought to raise failed to fill by public subscription, notwithstanding the fact that the terms offered were far and away more attractive than were ever previously offered by the Irish State; terms more attractive than those upon which other countries are able to borrow substantial capital finance at the present time. The failure of that loan to fill was certainly not due to the terms of the loan.  It was due to the disappearance of public confidence in this Government and to the reluctance of those who control savings to subscribe to public loans while this Government is maladministering the affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of investment activity, on private account and on public account, accompanied by the effects of the credit squeeze, still continuing notwithstanding the big additions to the external investments of commercial banks in recent months, is bringing the level of business activity down continuously.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to emphasise for the information of Deputies supporting the Government, if not for the information of the public, that these adverse conditions have developed entirely since 1954.  It is not my intention to assert that in 1954, when the present Government came into office, economic and social conditions in this country were as good as we would have liked to see them.  There were many deficiencies then which the previous Government were working to rectify, but the facts recorded are that in 1954, when this Government took over the administration of the country, we had no serious deficit in our international payments, production in agriculture and industry was rising, unemployment was falling. The number of workers finding jobs was increasing.  The public capital investment programme, which had been expanded considerably in 1953, was continued during the early part of 1954 and through it, not merely was employment <Col N="2389" /> given to many thousands of Irish workers, but the country was being provided with the amenities and facilities we would desire to see it enjoy.</P>
    <P>The situation in which the country now finds itself did not have to arise. It is in that belief that it is possible to hold out to the country the hope that the circumstances of 1954 can be restored.  If the Government could hold out that hope, if they could hold out any confidence, or with truth assert that the measures they have now taken could in time bring this country back to 1954, to the conditions of 1954, then they might be able to face the public with some expectation of getting confidence from them.</P>
    <P>But how many of the Deputies sitting behind the Government thought in 1954 that the maximum hope they could hold out to the people after their period of administration was that by drastic measures, by a restrictive policy, by imposing severe burdens upon the economy of the country, they could in time make conditions as good as they were then, repairing the damage which they had done in the meantime? An equally difficult situation, or an almost equivalent situation, existed in 1951 after the first Coalition.</P>
    <P>It was to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government that the task fell of repairing the consequences of that first Coalition, of rectifying the balance of payments deficit, which that first Coalition Government left behind them, of checking the rise in prices which was proceeding space when they quitted office, of remedying the deterioration which had developed in agricultural and industrial activities. It took us some time to do it but it was done, and by 1953 all the main consequences of the first Coalition had been remedied.  The country's position was not as good as it could have been but nevertheless it was improving.</P>
    <P>By 1953 prices had been stabilised, production was rising, employment was rising, trade was rising.  Exports, in particular, were expanding so as to make it possible for us to import without restriction the materials we require <Col N="2390" /> to maintain production and other manufactured goods which we are not able to produce ourselves.  We had no need then of the policy of the present Coalition, aimed deliberately at promoting unemployment, at forcing down living standards in order to keep the national accounts in balance.</P>
    <P>The Government spokesmen occasionally attempt to excuse their failure to arrest the decline in the national economy by referring to world circumstances. Accident has given them an alibi for their failures and they are going, apparently, to take advantage of that alibi whenever possible.  I want to point out that if this world crisis develops, this country was never less ready than now to cope with it, never less well stocked with essential materials, never less organised to deal with the problems that a worsening in international circumstances can produce for us.  But indeed the worsening of our circumstances is hardly attributable at all to anything that has yet emerged from the international situation.  We have to face petrol rationing for a period, it is true, but in respect of no other commodity can it be alleged that any serious deficiency in supplies has developed nor has any substantial rise in prices yet taken place.</P>
    <P>In the case of petrol, there has been a rise in price.  The president of the British organisation which speaks for those who control tanker tonnage said in Britain that the higher cost of transport of petrol to Britain and presumably to this country by reason of the closing of the Suez Canal would not amount to more than ½d. per gallon.  But the rise in price which has been announced is far more substantial than that.  Apparently a decision has been taken here and also in Britain that no matter to what extent world difficulties may reduce the turnover of the great oil companies, their profits must still be maintained.  The speed and enthusiasm with which the Government sanctioned the increase in petrol prices here are in marked contrast with the way in which they have dealt with applications for price adjustments in other spheres because of rising costs.</P>
    <P>That is the picture of our economy: <Col N="2391" /> falling production, falling employment, a serious deficit in international payments on current account, a drying up of capital, of credit, a restriction of business activity of all kinds.  It is against that background that we have to ask ourselves what the Government are proposing to do.  The Government's proposals for dealing with this situation were announced by the Taoiseach in October last.  In the Taoiseach's speech, made to his Party members on that occasion, he put all the goods in the shop window.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Taoiseach's remarks were devoted to matters which had no direct relation to the situation, and in so far as he was able to report anything cheerful to his audience, he recounted the effects of measures taken by the previous Fianna Fáil Government. What new proposals did he make to rectify the deterioration in the circumstances which had developed under his administration?  Let us examine them.  There was a proposal to establish an agricultural council to advise the Minister for Agriculture. There was a proposal to establish an industrial council to advise the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Now, heaven knows that both these Ministers require all the advice they can get and far be it from me to cut off from them any advice that might be made available to them.  But what use will these councils be in present circumstances?  What is the basis for any expectation that they will be able to spur the Government into some positive and constructive action? There is also to be a capital investment council.  What that is going to do is by no means clear.  No doubt there are very competent people on those bodies.  One of them is on record as saying that emigration&mdash;the fact that emigration is possible&mdash;should be a matter for rejoicing.</P>
    <P>If that mentality is to inspire the recommendations of that council, perhaps it would be better to cut off the Government from any advice that council may give.  Apart from this collection of councils to add to the variety of boards, commissions and committees which the Government <Col N="2392" /> have appointed, what else did the Taoiseach announce as representing the decisions of the Government to adopt measures to deal with the new and worsening situation with which they are faced?  He mentioned an intention to extend facilities for providing credit for farmers.  Nothing more has been heard of that since.  The Government do not regard it, apparently, as a matter of urgency, certainly not calling for the same expeditious action they considered it necessary to take to protect the profits of the oil companies.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement that superphosphates would be supplied to farmers at world prices.  That proved to be a phoney.  There was not a farmer in the country who did not read into that announcement, and who was not expected to read into that announcement, an intention to reduce the price of superphosphates.  I do not want to prolong my remarks by using quotations to support them, but I say it is clear from the statements made by farmers' organisations and in their journals that the Taoiseach's announcement was intended to mean that the price of superphosphates would be reduced.  It was not.  In fact, it is going to be increased.  The timing of that announcement, when farmers would normally be ordering their supplies and when merchants would be stocking up, merely operated to upset the trade.  In the end, it turned out that the Government were proposing merely to revoke a tariff which nobody paid anyway.</P>
    <P>We had the announcement of this tax concession to coal-mines which I calculate may cost the Government, on the most optimistic basis, a few hundred pounds a year, and which, by its introduction, merely shows that the Government have not yet begun to understand the factors which are limiting the expansion of coal output.  We had the announcement of the proposal to give certain tax concessions to firms increasing their export trade, a concession which, if we got a 10 per cent. increase in the overall export of manufactured goods, can operate to deprive the Government of revenue to an extent of perhaps £10,000.</P>

      <P>That is my calculation. Again, that measure operated to show that the Government have no idea of what is needed to bring about an expansion of exports on the scale we need.  We had this Industrial Grants Bill, the Bill which we discussed here this morning and which I believe may well do much more harm than good in the overall expansion of our industrial production, apart altogether from the evidence it contains of the Government's decision to weaken the policy of encouraging industrial expansion along the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>Irish industry undoubtedly needs investment and there is at the present time a greater necessity than ever to revise and improve the machinery by which industry can have access to capital.  It is clear that in that regard the Government have no programme or even an idea for a programme.  There was an announcement of an intention to increase the capital of the Industrial Credit Company by £250,000.  I do not know if even that increase has been effected, but the dimensions of that figure and the absence of any indication of what the Industrial Credit Company could do with that meagre addition to their resources, again shows that the Government are not even thinking on a plane on which an effective policy might be found.</P>
      <P>Then there was the announcement that the Government had decided to give partial effect to the recommendation of the Commission on Industrial Taxation regarding the depreciation allowance on industrial buildings.  That is the sum total of all the new proposals contained in this well-advertised speech of the Taoiseach, the speech which has since been described not with very much confidence but considerable repetition, by Government Deputies as representing a comprehensive programme for rectifying the present national circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relate these proposals to our needs. <Col N="2394" /> This country needs, if my calculations are correct, as rapidly as possible an increase in total production, an increase in output from both agriculture and industry of not less than 20 per cent. on the 1955 volume.  It would need such an increase in output, either for export or for the replacement of imports, in order to balance the trading account of 1955.  The actual deficit in international payments in 1956 may be less than it was in 1955, but that diminution has been brought about in a way which cannot be permanently maintained, a way which must be conceded to be undesirable.</P>
    <P>There is no worthy national aim to be realised by bringing about a lowering of the standard of living of our people, denying them access to the goods which cannot be drawn from home sources and which they may desire to purchase and need to enjoy a fuller life.  We need to get new investment activity back to the 1953 level and I stress the need in that way in order to indicate that what is required is something that was done before so that we can understand the practicability of doing it again with more competent administration of the nation's business.</P>
    <P>In 1953, new capital investment absorbed 15 per cent. of the total national resources of that year.  In 1956, new investment has fallen to 7 per cent. of total resources.  In the firm conviction that everything turns on the effect of Government policy in introducing substantial additional investment, supplemented perhaps by action to bring the policy of the banks into line with the national need, I assert that the policy announced by the Government, the programme set forth by the Taoiseach in his speech in October last falls lamentably short of what is required.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be difficult in certain circumstances to get the level of savings back to what it was.  It has to be recognised that any substantial expansion of capital investment requires a considerable improvement in the volume of savings.  It was done before when circumstances were favourable.  It can be done again. What is it that induces savings?  What are the circumstances in which people <Col N="2395" /> will be content to set aside any part of their resources from current consumption to invest in future possibilities? The most essential condition for a successful effort in expanding the volume of savings is the restoration of confidence in the country, confidence in the stability of money values, confidence, above all, in the integrity and competence of the Government in office.</P>
    <P>It is because confidence in these things has been undermined that the Government is unable to draw funds for capital investment, that the whole level of investment activity is contracting. Confidence in this Government does not exist amongst the people of the country.  That is the vital factor in the situation and it makes it a matter of duty for the Government to decide to give the people of the country an opportunity of rectifying the position if they desire to take it. Whether it is true or not, it is generally believed amongst all sections of our people, amongst those who inspire new business activity, amongst those who control and direct the policies of trade unions, amongst those who speak for our farmers&mdash;all the groups in the community whose decisions can influence the course of events&mdash;that this Government has lost the confidence of the people and that there will be a change of Government soon. Whether that is true or not, it is a critical factor in the situation and it is one that the Government cannot leave out of account.</P>
    <P>Whatever the difficulties of the time, it is clear these questions cannot be resolved until there is a general election. A general election is the first essential step to the initiation of any programme of national recovery.  If that general election should return the same Government again with a majority here, then the power of that Government to give leadership, to take effective action, to plan ahead in confidence of the people's support, would be vastly increased; but if the Government are refusing to face up to the issue, to the need for a dissolution and consultation with the people because they fear they may lose office, then it means only that they are putting their Party interests <Col N="2396" /> before the national interests.  That is what the people of this country believe they are doing.</P>
    <P>Any suggestions, therefore, for effective action in this situation which might arrest the economic deterioration that is proceeding, which might put disemployed workers back into their jobs and slow down the flow of emigration, must start with a General Election.  It is futile for the Government to think, in present circumstances, that they can do anything other than preside over a further deterioration.  The evidence is indisputable. The failure of the public to subscribe even the limited amount of the loan floated last October, notwithstanding the terms, the result of a whole series of by-elections this year, all make it clear that the public has no confidence in the Government and in these circumstances the Government is practically powerless.</P>
    <P>What could a new Government do? I believe the mere prospect of a new policy, the chance of more effective administration, would by itself go a long way to restoring confidence in the future of the country.  I believe that it would produce, by itself, an immediate revival in business activities, that it would influence the decisions of business boards and managements all over the country to expand rather than to curtail the scope of their activities; that it would inspire our people to the effort to save so that funds would be available for capital investment, either through the medium of private enterprise or public authorities.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that confidence in the country and in its future can be restored and with that restored confidence will come an immediate easement of many of our present acute difficulties.  It is quite true that the Government which might take office after an election would have to show that the confidence placed in it by the people was fully justified.  If a new Government should proceed in the same dilatory way of the present Government and prove no more capable of devising an adequate programme and applying it with energy and consistency, then the outlook for the future would be very black indeed.  But if we get a Government with clear aims and <Col N="2397" /> which knows what it is doing, capable of following a consistent line and particularly a Government which was not bedevilled by irresponsible pledges or promises given recklessly to secure votes then the forward movement of the nation, which was proceeding in 1953 and 1954, can be resumed.  Indeed I am certain of this, that if the Government even now announced its intention to seek the dissolution of the Dáil some time early next year, the effect of that announcement on economic conditions, the level of employment, business activity and on the volume of trade would be almost instantaneous.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the period of new year resolutions.  Is it possible that anything that can be said here will inspire the Government to make the new year resolution that they will give the people the chance to which they are entitled in any democratic State to change the Government and to rectify the serious effects of misgovernment? If the Government will make that new year resolution now, then they can perhaps hope that the last few months of their administration will not be as disastrous as the earlier years.  I ask them not to deny the people that chance.  The people want the opportunity of reconsidering the decision which they took in 1954.  They cannot be refused that opportunity except by men who are not interested in the nation's welfare but concerned only with their Party political prospects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has condemned the Government and wants them to start off by making a New Year's resolution but he did not add to that that he is hoping that at the tailend of the resolution he will come in again in the position he was in between 1951 and 1954.  Deputy Lemass can forget certain things when he wishes to do so but he waxed eloquent when he said the Government has not got the right to deny the people an election.  Does he not remember the occasion when the Leader of the Opposition stated here as Taoiseach that it would be only when it suited Fianna Fáil that they would have an election because he believed <Col N="2398" /> that what suited Fianna Fáil would suit the nation?  Apparently what was right then is completely wrong now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass after his trip the other day to explain the impossibility of putting into operation a suggested policy of the trade union movement comes back to us and tells us everything we are doing is wrong.  Everything he did was right; everything his Party did was correct but I can say quite frankly and honestly on behalf of the Labour Party that we are not satisfied that everything is well.  We do not go with our tongues in our cheeks, we are not just here to support the Government and completely to oppose the Opposition.  If the Opposition want to put up their case at least we are entitled to say to them: &ldquo;Give us a policy which we can examine.&rdquo;  Have they done so?</P>
      <P>According to the reports of their last Árd-Fheis Deputy Lemass himself made it clear that, as reported in a newspaper which always gives an accurate report of these things, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, on November 21 last:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They must now be thinking in terms of two or three months at the outside.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>hoping for an election, of course,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They had no wish to produce a half-baked policy or one which could not be properly checked officially.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently after all the years that he has been a member of the Government, Deputy Lemass in 1956 is afraid of producing his Party's policy which he says is, at the present time, only half-baked.  Are we expected then to listen to the so-called sincere pleading of Deputy Lemass for an election when he has only a half-baked policy?  I notice, as many of us did who are anxious to try to seize any opportunity to benefit the people of this country, irrespective of politics, that at the Árd-Fheis neither Deputy Lemass nor the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the £100,000,000 scheme, the blueprints of which were prepared 12 or 18 months ago.  Apparently they were only half-baked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present policy of the Government, according to the Opposition, is <Col N="2399" /> wrong.  We are entitled surely, if that is so, to examine an alternative. Is it admitted by the Opposition that they have not got the alternative ready?  Deputy Lemass mentioned much about expenditure and about the financial difficulties of the Government.  As the Leader of the Opposition is present, perhaps at a later stage he will explain what he meant by the following which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on Wednesday, 21st November:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present time, Mr. de Valera continued, something was happening which never happened before.  I remember the time when I boasted in the Dáil that shortage of money had never yet prevented us from doing something we thought nationally desirable.  I would not like to say that to-day.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps we may come to that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It may be that the view expressed by Deputy de Valera on that occasion is one to which more thought will have to be given&mdash;the question of the shortage of money, the availability of money and the use of money.  At any rate, during the discussions on various occasions in this House much was said, usually by the Opposition, against the Government.  I admitted, when in opposition, and I admit it now, that the tragedy in this House is that, when one is in opposition, one is expected to abuse the Government for everything. I will go further and say that there are members of the Parties supporting the Government who badgered the Fianna Fáil Government just as much as Fianna Fáil are doing now.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to ask where does that get us?  If we are supposed to be sincere in our desire to serve the people, will we continue the policy of obstruction when we are in opposition and a policy of defence when in Government? I should expect a little more at least from the Front Benches of Fianna Fáil, having regard to the long number of years they were in power in this country.  It is true, perhaps, that there are some younger members who <Col N="2400" /> may have a little to learn as regards argument and otherwise.  They might in the circumstances be excused on account of youth.  If we are going to make any sincere attempt to examine the policy of the present Government in relation to what it may be doing or what it may not be doing, according to Deputy Lemass, I would say that it is about time Fianna Fáil came out into the open and endeavoured to bake their half-baked policy themselves.</P>

      <P>Ná bí ag caint in aon chor anois.  Two and a half years ago, we had an extraordinary situation in this House in so far as it developed from the expressions of none other than Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera.  On that occasion, we asked them a simple question.  It was a question upon the answer to which much depended.  Every member of the House may recollect that, when the Budget of 1954 was being discussed, amendments were put forward by Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera objecting to an increase in the price of tobacco and spirits.  We asked, if we gave them our support, would they be prepared to put their amendment into operation if they became Government?  Of course, they said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  From that day on, every move they have taken in this Chamber in that respect is quite obvious to us.  Every move was based on their own political advantage whatever the cost might be to the overall economy of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Deputy de Valera remember his words on that same occasion two and a half years ago when he came in here and in a most sinister fashion suggested that the handling of the Ministry of Justice by the Labour Party was the beginning and the end of all decency in this country in relation to its effects on everything dealing with justice?  Are we still supposed to believe that these so-called responsible members of this Assembly are sincere when they attack the policy of the Government and ask for an early election?  I do not want to waste time, but in fairness to Deputy Lemass, I <Col N="2401" /> would say that he did not do so in relation to any quotation here.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party, I am interested in trying to solve some of the damnable problems that confront not only this House but the people as a whole.  I am entitled again to draw attention to an important statement by Deputy de Valera at the Árd Fheis when he said during the course of his speech in relation to agriculture that it may be essential in future to consider the possibility of a form of bonus to increase production.  That was published in heavy type in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  With that statement I agree, and I assume all the delegates agreed, including, of course, Deputy de Valera, but apparently it is not what is said that matters but who makes the statement.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Lemass deny that for their own Party advantages in a by-election in the constituency of Laois-Offaly and in their published statement of policy, they omitted parts of the statement of the Labour members in this Chamber?  A statement made by a Labour member saying exactly what Deputy de Valera said in the Mansion House was altered to suit the policy of Fianna Fáil and instead of being put down as it should be and as it is recorded in the debates of this House, Deputy Lemass and the propagandists of Fianna Fáil went so far as to say that a Labour Deputy said that all Government grants should be stopped, and left it at that.  Apparently, we are to forget all this.  We are to believe in the overall sincerity of members who are more anxious to get back to power and to put into operation the policy of 1951 to 1954 than anything else.</P>
    <P>I remember in the middle of 1950 or 1951, before the general election, the inter-Party Government were accused of heavy importations into this country. The Taoiseach at that time pointed out that it was the policy of the inter-Party Government to stockpile in case of the danger of a world-wide eruption. In 1951, Fianna Fáil came back to power and, as statistics will prove, stockpiling had been almost completed in many ways.  It was a good job for the Fianna Fáil Government that the <Col N="2402" /> inter-Party Government in that period arranged for stockpiling, because we know how international prices soared owing to the war in Korea.  But while they attacked the Administration of 1948-51 for stockpiling, they were not prepared to admit afterwards that, coupled with their restrictive measures to try, as they say themselves, to come back on an even keel in relation to the balance of payments, the stockpiling helped them.</P>
    <P>No; instead of that, when industrial endeavour weakened in the 1952 period and when industrial workers were unemployed, Fianna Fáil members then found it convenient to say that it was the stockpiling of the previous Government which was the cause of the trouble they were facing.  Deputy Lemass speaks of the present unemployment figure.  I can assure Deputy Lemass and the members of Fianna Fáil that these figures are as much a heartache to the members of the Labour Party as they are to any other Deputy.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to remind the Party opposite that we faced this critical situation, too, in 1952, and if the figures for unemployment then are compared, we can see that the tragedy of that time was as severe on the people as it is to-day.  It is no consolation for us, when we refer to emigration, to say that it is at such or such a figure this year, but we know for a fact that Fianna Fáil seem to be prepared to make a clear-cut statement that emigration exists only when an inter-Party Government is in power. Be that as it may, it is of no help to us to know that emigration exists on such a large scale.  I am sorry to say, in the few remarks I have made here in relation to an alternative policy, that we of the Labour Party have no alternative to some form of policy based upon an inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>History will recall that the policy of the 1930's was based upon a mild dictatorship. We never could support such a policy and we never shall.  In relation to our position in this inter-Party Government, let it be understood that we are not smiling at the position; we are not saying that everything <Col N="2403" /> in the garden is lovely.  Very often we are saying the reverse, and we make no secret of the fact that we are not satisfied in many ways that the difficulties which confront us are as difficult as some people believe them to be.  We start by saying we are convinced that part of our present trouble is that to a certain degree we are following a policy which we ourselves in opposition condemned in 1952, a policy of restriction, a policy in which the Budget of 1952 showed to have dire results.  What strikes me most forcibly is this.  Does it mean that, no matter on what side members may sit, they are to be confronted with a policy, based on financial difficulties of which some people may tell us, but in the last analysis a policy of complete credit restriction?</P>
    <P>Last February' or March, when speaking on one of these discussions, I tried to point out that, as far as we believed, much of the policy being put into operation would have dire effects in relation to employment during the winter period.  Perhaps experience teaches and perhaps, as we have the experience now, the Government will understand that the policy of 1951 and 1954, which to us was a wrong policy, would of necessity also be wrong and could not have our support if it were to continue in the 1957-58 period.  We cannot have it both ways.  As a democratic Party, we believe in the policy of the Labour Party being such that unemployment on a high level, and credit restriction so noticeable, must of necessity be false to an Irish economy based on Catholic and Christian principles.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the problem mentioned by Deputy de Valera when speaking at the Ard-Fhéis, that of the scarcity of money.  I begin to wonder if it means that in the near future a reorientation of grouping in this House may solve one of these problems. Strange to say&mdash;and I am admitting it here quite openly&mdash;we realise on many occasions that there are members on our left and on our right who are expressing exactly the same conservative views in relation to <Col N="2404" /> finance.  I notice that some people do not seem to like to hear the words &ldquo;credit restriction&rdquo;, at a time when everyone knows that credit restriction is not only there but is hampering trade.  For instance, the figures show that in two important activities in commercial and economic life, over £6,000,000 has been, as it were, withdrawn, that is, between the wholesale trade and building, in relation to bank allowances or credits from the banks. Apparently some people would not wish us to say that, some people on both sides of the House.  We are entitled to ask a simple question: is it for the welfare of the people engaged in these two industrial or commercial sides of life that such a policy is being implemented?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, Deputy MacEntee and many other Fianna Fáil Deputies have been on many occasions bewailing and bemoaning our lot in relation to the reduction of our external assets and, indeed, Deputy de Valera has, too, by saying that they may have gone down a bit.  How do we know but that within the next couple of months there may be a further devaluation in England?  Is that going to help it? Will it interfere with the average man and woman in this country, trying to eke out a living, just as it affects anyone in a higher position?</P>
    <P>When speaking here a while ago, Deputy Lemass mentioned the relationship of present import and export prices.  We all know how severely we are being affected by present agricultural prices in the export market and we also know our difficulties in relation to imports.  Deputy Lemass, of course, is continually pointing to the golden era of 1952, 1953 and 1954; but he did not say here this morning what he said a few years ago, when he admitted that, in relation to the importation of goods and import prices around 1953, we had come to the period of fairly normal stability in relation to import prices, nor did he say that during those few years very high prices prevailed for our agricultural produce on the export market.  We know we are caught; we know our difficulty in relation to the balance between what we get for what we send out and what we must pay for what we get in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2405" /> Much was said some months ago and again this morning about the introduction of the levies by the present Government. If the present Opposition want to condemn that, they must be reminded that they voted for it last March, even though then in many ways some of their back-benchers tried to pick out different import levies and point out the dangers.  At least, there was a certain amount of common ground between the Opposition and the majority of the Government. Therefore, our whole problem must be based upon some missing point that none of us seem to be getting at or, if we are getting at it, we are afraid to continue to face the problem or we have decided to throw in the sponge. They have made it quite clear, all the way through, that they were satisfied to continue.  Whether it was that, in their belief, the Central Bank had sufficient power or not I do not know, but we cannot look to Fianna Fáil for a change of policy in relation to any monetary problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>I wonder can we look to the Minister for Finance for a different outlook from the conservative outlook of Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael?  If we cannot get it, this country will suffer and if we cannot get it, the only thing that may help democracy for the next few years is the fact that up to the present time there is no one on the horizon who could take over this country as a dictator.  Had such a person been available, we could throw our hats to the wind for the next 12 months preaching about democracy, when we are not prepared to utilise democracy and our own position in this matter, to provide for the people and for the economic security which should be theirs, rather than face increased emigration year after year since this State was born and a figure wavering between 50,000 and 70,000 of people unemployed. They are human beings.  It may be said by some that it is not the function of the Government to provide employment, but it would be said by us and by others that so long as we have 70,000 unemployed&mdash;God forbid it should become 80,000 or 90,000 within the next few months&mdash;our responsibility to them is much greater than <Col N="2406" /> it is to those who can afford to pay £1,000 or £2,000 for a car.</P>
    <P>In regard to saving, I would like to know is it the intention of the present Minister, or is it his belief that all we can get in that way should be put into capital expenditure to build up a truer, saner, Christian economy in this country?  Are we to be limited in that way?  Many of us are members of local authorities.  To-morrow, Deputy Corry, who has just come into the House, and myself with many other members, will be facing the problem of estimates for the coming year in a certain local authority.  All Members of this House will be in the same position during the next few months, and it is extraordinary, but true that, when these estimates are examined, we will find that a very high percentage of every pound spent or supposed to be spent on important work in rural areas such as water and sewerage works, house-building, etc, will be spent on interest on the money we have to beg in order to put our people into decent homes.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not the time, nor would I be the person, to delve into a subject which is supposed, at any rate, to be an important and a highly-secretive matter, the discussion of high finance; nevertheless, when we in local authorities are seeking for people living in condemned houses the right to decent homes, when we, under various Health Acts passed in this House, advocate and try to secure for people in rural areas such amenities as water and sewerage, why should it be that the Government are satisfied to have a very small minority charging a huge majority in this State for such essential services at such a high rate?  I am not going into the matter now because I know many other members of the House are anxious to speak on this and that the time for this discussion is limited, and I do not want to occupy much more time.  But I will say, where this Government is concerned, we cannot allow things to go on as they are.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Government, and to mention something which Deputy Lemass omitted from his speech to-day, the Government has to its credit the fact that we now have through the introduction of mining operations in <Col N="2407" /> West Cork, and Avoca in Wicklow, and in Meath, a form of prosperity moving into the country which is in itself the key to a certain amount of peace and happiness based on economic conditions in these areas.  We know that, please God, while Deputy Lemass may wish for an early election in 1957, we who are living at the mouth of Cork harbour know we shall be able to say: &ldquo;thank God an oil refinery is being erected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But with such a record of achievement in these fields alone, why must credit restrictions have such a complete grip on the people of the country no matter what Government is in office?  That is a problem that will still confront us.  We believe in supporting this Government; we believe that from 1948 to 1951 it had a creditable record. There are, so far, many achievements to the credit of the Government and much can be pointed to as being for the benefit of the country in the future, but must we stop at that?  I say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the next few months each of us will be studying closely the returns as issued by the Statistics Office in relation to unemployment.  We want to co-operate with the Government and we believe the other Parties in the Government also want to co-operate with the Government.  Let us hope common sense will prevail in relation to dealing with the most vicious problems of the present time, the credit squeeze and the tragedy of unemployment, and that instead of an early election in the New Year, in compliance with the wishes of Deputy Lemass, the Government will make a New Year resolution that will become a determination to tackle this problem as it must be tackled if we are to survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the speeches so far, one by Deputy Lemass and the other by Deputy Desmond. Needless to say I fully agree with what Deputy Lemass has said and, strangely enough, in regard to Deputy Desmond, it is not so much that I disagree with him but that I rather pity him in the position in which he finds himself.  He feels he should not support <Col N="2408" /> the present Government and yet he is doing so.  He has made several efforts to indicate that the Labour Party outlook is different from the policy being carried out at the moment and that this is justification on the one hand for being in the Labour Party at all, and on the other hand, it seems to be justification for not supporting Fianna Fáil or the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I do not care two hoots whether he supports Fianna Fáil or not; it does not matter one way or the other.  When we find people getting up, placed in the middle of the House as these people usually are, they seem to think because they sit in those seats, they must have one leg on either side of the House.  It is for that reason I pity Deputy Desmond, because nobody can really ride two horses at the same time.  Very often it results in a fall. For the Labour Party to do that is not, I think, a very good indication for the future of the Party nor is it good for the country that this should be so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond, I take it, is talking for his Party when he says they are not satisfied with Government policy particularly in regard to credit and credit restrictions and the financial policy generally.  If they are not satisfied with it, why do they support it? It is the whole story of the Labour members and others, indeed, outside the Labour Party, who come into the House and make a good speech against the Government and immediately afterwards walk into the Division Lobbies to vote for the Government. That situation has been about played out.  The people clearly see through this business of trying to ride two horses at the same time, very often the two horses going in different directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, again talking for Labour, says that Fianna Fáil has no policy.  Then he amends that to read that they have, on their own admission, a half-baked policy.  Apparently he has been reading very assiduously the report of the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. One would almost think, to listen to him, that he spent his time at that Árd-Fheis during the entire period that that body met.  However, the present Government's policy does <Col N="2409" /> not satisfy him.  Fianna Fáil, on the one hand, has no policy and, on the other hand, has only a half-baked policy.  Nevertheless, he still says he will support the present Government. That is scarcely the reasoning one would expect from an adult and from somebody talking on behalf of what should be a responsible political Party in an Assembly such as Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Desmond and to the Labour Party&mdash;taking it that his statement that a half-baked policy is the only thing which Fianna Fáil has &mdash;that half a loaf at any time is better than no bread.  The fact is that if we have only a half-baked policy, he knows well that the people on the other side of the House, including himself and his Party, have no policy whatsoever.  If he wants to get the best of what is going, the obvious thing is to come and get a share of the half loaf rather than go where there is no bread at all.  He can scarcely expect to get bread where it does not exist.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to go back and to deal with our position as we found it in 1948.  I am not going to go back 20 or 30 or 40 years at all, but just to 1948 when we had the misfortune to have a Coalition Government thrust upon us for the first time.  It was an unhappy event.  At the time the Government changed hands, Deputy Lemass, from these benches, said to the new incoming Government, to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet, that we were handing over this country to them in good shape.  I think the words used were that we were handing over the ship of State in good shape and that we hoped to get it back in the same condition when the next general election came around.  Deputy Lemass was able to say that then.  Nobody could contradict him.  Nobody attempted to contradict his statement that everything in the country was in a proper and shipshape condition.  Nobody attempted to stand up to deny that our State and the finances of our State and our general economy were in a sound condition and in a condition that could have gone on to better things. Thus, by their very silence, we can take it that Deputy Lemass's statement was true&mdash;and there are many <Col N="2410" /> figures to prove it to-day, just as there were then.  However, apart altogether from the figures, no voice was raised to deny what he then said.</P>
    <P>As was foreseen, the Government changed after three years.  What did we find?  We did not find the Taoiseach or the members of Fine Gael or of the Labour Party or anybody else sitting on the Government Benches in 1951 and saying that the ship of State was in good condition and that they were handing it back to us as they had got it from us in 1948.  That was not the case.  It was not said&mdash;and the reasons why it was not said by the then Coalition Government were very plain. They could not say it.</P>
    <P>We found, when we resumed Government in 1951, that the sound economic and financial position of the country as we knew it during our former terms of office no longer obtained after a short three years of Coalition Government. We found that the adverse balance of trade had increased enormously. To me, and I think to any ordinary person, the adverse balance of trade is the real index of how our country is progressing.  The position as regards the adverse balance of trade had deteriorated drastically.  When we resumed office in 1951 we found that it had mounted to £61,000,000 or £62,000,000.  As the months wore on and as we came around to the time of the 1952 Budget&mdash;our first Budget as the new Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;we found that not only were we carrying this unduly high adverse balance of trade but we were faced with a deficit in the Budget&mdash;a deficit which would have to be met&mdash;of £15,000,000.  I have heard it said before and I am sure it will be said again to-day that the previous Coalition Government did not leave a deficit of £15,000,000 in their 1951 Budget.  Very likely they will say it was only £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 and that the other £9,000,000 was brought about by Fianna Fáil.  That is absolutely untrue and even those people who are likely to get up after me and say that what I say is otherwise will know that what they say is untrue.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in the initial kick-off, there was a gap of £6,000,000 or <Col N="2411" /> £7,000,000 in that Budget.  It was purposely left there in order that the Budget could be dressed up to look not too unpopular in view of the forthcoming general election.  On top of that concealed £6,000,000 or £7,000,000, there was expenditure that must come and that was already committed before and during that general election.  We had the attempted purchase of votes being perpetrated by the then Coalition Government inasmuch as they committed the State in the ensuing financial year to increases all round to various sections of the community, but they did not make any provision for those increases.  If you add those figures to the original £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 of a deficit which they knew to exist when the Budget was first framed and faked in 1951, you will find that the deficit we had to meet and contend with in 1952 amounted to £15,000,000.  That is the position in which we found ourselves on resuming office as distinct from the condition of the State when we handed it over to the Coalition Government in 1948.  We received it back in 1951 in a shambles, and that shambles had to be rectified. Something had to be done about it immediately.</P>
    <P>As a result of serious consideration, the 1952 Budget was introduced&mdash;and the most voluble critics of that Budget were the very people who had brought about the mess during the period from 1948 to 1951.  That Budget was introduced to try to clear up the mess, but we found that all sorts of charges were being made.  There were charges that the taxes imposed were unnecessary. There were charges that our Government were over-budgeting and that there would be a surplus.  When the people who are now sitting on the Government Benches were challenged in regard to the charges which they were making, they alleged that the motive of Fianna Fáil in introducing that unfavourable and unpopular Budget was that we thought the people were living too well, that they were eating too much and drinking too much and that something must be done about it.  They alleged that Fianna Fáil liked to see the people going round in hair shirts. That was the type of propaganda at <Col N="2412" /> that time and that was the type of speech made by people from whom better would have been expected. They were being made by members of the Front Bench of the then Opposition, both inside and outside the House.  Such a stink and such a confusion was created in the minds of the people from 1952 up to the general election of 1954 that I think it is true to say that never before was an electorate so bamboozled and so confused going to the polls as were the people of the Irish nation in the general election of that year.</P>
    <P>It was because of this confusion and lying propaganda that the people were misled.  I honestly believe that those who repeated that propaganda so often now have come to believe it themselves and for that reason appear to be sincere when talking to the general public.  As far as public life in this country is concerned, I think 1954 brought us to a new low level in the tactics adopted.  To-day, we hear a lot about brainwashing behind the Iron Curtain, but I think the type of propaganda, this repetition of falsehoods, carried out for the two or three years' life of the Fianna Fáil Government would compare with some of the brainwashing processes being carried on behind the Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>The result was that the people were misled in 1954 by a conglomeration of figures&mdash;none of which was true&mdash; which was repeated and repeated. Added to that was the propaganda that if only Fianna Fáil could be got out of office, not only would these taxes imposed in 1952 be unnecessary, but a £10,000,000 reduction in our taxation burden could be brought about within ten minutes of a new Coalition Government taking up office. As we all know, that was a lot of poppycock, a lot of big talk to try to catch the unthinking voter.  Added to all the propaganda that had gone on in the previous years, it had its effect.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we had a very mixed result in that 1954 election.  Despite the fact that Fianna Fáil still emerged as the biggest Party by far in the House, we had the spectacle of people who expressed different viewpoints during the election campaign coming <Col N="2413" /> together again.  We had the spectacle of people getting votes for reducing taxation while their pals got votes because of their promises to increase social benefits.  We had the spectacle of the Party that held and continues to hold its position, and increase its numbers more than any other Party or group in the House, being left in Opposition while Parties or groups that had nothing in common, except a lust for power, got together again in 1954, just as they had in 1948, and got in as the Government.</P>
    <P>More power to them if anything good had come from that episode of 1954.  However, we know that is not so.  In 1954, as a result of the policy followed by Fianna Fáil from 1952 onwards, the financial crisis with which we were faced in 1951, 1952 and 1953, had been met and overtaken.  There was no longer an adverse trade balance of £60,000,000 such as was bequeathed to us by the previous Coalition Government in 1951.  That had been virtually wiped out and, as I have said, that is the index by which we may measure the well-being of the economy of any country.  In addition, we did not have any deficit of any proportion in our Budget.</P>
    <P>We had wiped out those two legacies left to us in 1951 by the time the General Election of 1954 arrived.  Just as in 1948, the new Government got the ship of State in sound condition.  They got it in such a condition that the progress which had been interrupted by the Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951 could be continued.  But what do we find?  In two short years, the position that obtained after three years of Coalition Government in 1951 is now coming about again.  The financial position is much worse than it was in the years of that first Coalition.  The savings of the people had not been got through completely in the first Coalition's period but they certainly were got through in the second period, which I hope is now coming to an end.</P>
    <P>It appears that this rake's progress which was interrupted&mdash;fortunately for the country, but unfortunately for the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;is being continued. It began in 1948 and is continuing to-day <Col N="2414" /> with that break in between.  We are now heading more quickly than ever for the break-up of this State as a unit of any significance than at any time previously and even during the previous Coalition Government's term of office.  We find that, instead of our finances being in a healthy State as in 1954, our balance of trade is again mounting.  Last year it was somewhere in the region of £35,000,000 and this year, as far as any of us can calculate and being as charitable as possible and allowing for all errors, it will be around the £22,000,000 or £30,000,000. If the Minister can wipe that out before the end of the financial year, I will be very glad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy talking about the calendar year or the financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about both years; the Minister may use whichever suits him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be fair to the Deputy.  When he talk about £22,000,000 to £30,000,000, is that for the calendar year or the financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be for a year comparable with the year for which I quoted a figure of £61.7 million. That was the year 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Deputy means the calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial year.  That figure does not indicate that the Government is doing any of the things promised.  Although they took over the country in a sound condition, it is now in a bad way.  In addition, we must remember, even though it may be rather sickening to have to do so, that they have made a mess of our finances and of our adverse trade balance position. We also find that promises were made that, if the people now in Government got into office, taxes would be reduced, social benefits would be increased and, above all, the cost of living would be reduced, by subsidy, if necessary.  All of us know that, to-day, taxes are greater by £10,000,000 to £12,000,000 than they were in the years of Fianna Fáil, of which so much complaint <Col N="2415" /> was made and, in addition, I doubt if there is even one item that has to be purchased by the housewife and that is computed in the cost of living figure that has not increased in price, whereas we were promised that prices would be brought down and that, if necessary, subsidies would be used towards that end.</P>
      <P>All those things are bad enough&mdash;our finances gone haywire, our country, as it were, on the verge of bankruptcy, higher prices for foodstuffs and higher taxes&mdash;but all these things would be overcome if our employment position were sound.  If, while all these increases had to be met there was plenty of work available at good wages, the hardships that now assume such alarming proportions would not be so great but, side by side with increased taxation and the increased cost of living and the messing up of our finances generally, there is a recession in employment and an increase in emigration.</P>
      <P>When we inquire into the causes of all these things we find that the financial crisis brought about by the Government's wanton ways is responsible. It is responsible to a large extent for the position in regard to public works and buildings and other public works and it is responsible in a big way for unemployment and emigration. An equally large part is taken in this matter by the complete flop and recession that has taken place in regard to agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember, 12 months ago cattle were from £8 to £9 a cwt.  It was an abnormal price, undoubtedly.  The present Minister went strutting around, patting himself on the back for the great job he was doing for the cattle trade.  Then came the bang and, in the beginning of this year, prices dropped very considerably, despite the assurances we were getting before Christmas of last year that everything was well, that everything in the garden was rosy so far as the cattle trade was concerned.  In January, the cattle trade suffered a severe set-back.  What was the remedy?  The Minister for Agriculture and others talking on his <Col N="2416" /> behalf and on behalf of the Government said, &ldquo;Do not mind the recession in the cattle trade.  The <i>Irish Press</i> and Fianna Fáil are responsible for that.  It is they who have brought about the sudden decline in the price of your cattle.  They are sabotaging the country.  Do not sell your cattle now.  The markets are being glutted because of Fianna Fáil and the <i>Irish Press</i> articles on the cattle trade.  Do not glut the market with them now. Hold them until the month of April and I assure you that £6 per cwt. will be got for your cattle.&rdquo;  I remember at that time thinking over what Deputy Dillon had said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture. On hearing the month of April mentioned, I took it to be the 1st April and recognised that that was All Fools' Day and was convinced that anyone who held cattle on the say-so of the Minister for Agriculture could be well classed among the people after whom that day is named.  It is only too true that anyone who kept cattle until April on the assurance of the Minister for Agriculture that the price would be £6 per cwt. found that they were fooled, if not fools.  Since then they have had to sell at a greater loss than they would have incurred by selling in January of last year or they are still holding the cattle and they still cannot get the £6 a cwt. that was promised by the Minister for Agriculture and other Government speakers. That is only one of the items but as it is the most important of our agricultural exports it is the one with which I wished to deal in detail.</P>
      <P>In the case of other farm produce what do we find?  We find that prices declined by reason of the ordinary rules of supply and demand or that the Government stepped in, as they did in regard to wheat, to ensure that the price was brought down and the farmer was left worse off than he had been before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That position has created a great deal of unemployment and a very large proportion of our emigrants are people from the small and medium-sized <Col N="2417" /> farms.  They are members of farmers' families who have suffered and who do not appear in the unemployment lists. They are to be found to-day in Scotland or England.  They are the uncounted thousands who have left this country.  They are people who do not draw unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  They are not listed as unemployed.  Others may be at home with no money and no work. They are the unknown people of this country who have been badly hit by the present Government's policy and mishandling of agricultural markets and agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>The latest effort by the Minister for Agriculture has flopped back in his face.  Turkeys are going around now as the rats did in 1949, when oats were a glut on the market.  The rats were then going around shouting &ldquo;up Dillon&rdquo;.  The turkeys, knowing their necks are safe in nine cases out of ten, are going around shouting the same thing.  It is not to our advantage that that should be so.  It is very much to our disadvantage that to-day there is no price for turkeys, bad prices for cattle, uncertain prices for tillage crops such as potatoes and, in particular, very bad prices for oats.</P>
    <P>During all these months, from every side of the House there have been calls going out to the farmers to increase production.  We on this side of the House make those calls on the farmer to-day but we know, while we do so, that the Government should help the farmers and that the only real help a Government can give the farmer at any time is an assured market and an economic price.  The farmer is not getting that from this Government.  The farmer's experience is that this Government is more likely to slash prices, if they have anything to do with it, than to increase the welfare of the farming community.</P>
    <P>While, as I say, there are cries from all sides of the House for increased agricultural production, the people in Government and supporting the Government make those cries with their tongues in their cheeks because they know very well that they are not doing anything to encourage production by improving prices and ensuring markets <Col N="2418" /> which, as Fianna Fáil know, is the only true way to increase production on farms to-day.  Although we all make the same calls, the difference is that there is hypocrisy in the calls coming from the Government and there is truth in the calls that come from Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil would not do as has been done by this Government, particularly in these trying times.  We would not reduce the farmers' income by a deliberate act, as was done by the Government in the case of wheat.</P>
    <P>All these things that I have mentioned bring about a situation that is unhealthy and bad for the country. We know that to-day there are on our unemployed list, to say nothing of those who do not appear on it, upwards of 70,000 unemployed.  We know also that there is a reputed figure of 40,000 leaving the country during the year.  My knowledge of this trend is that it is greater to-day than it has been at any time in my memory and that 40,000 is a very low estimate of the total number leaving the country.  Here is the rub: the people leaving the western seaboard to-day are not migratory workers, as of yore.  They are emigrating, not migrating.  They are going to England and Scotland and America and elsewhere.  They are not returning seasonally as they did in the past. They are remaining abroad and they are sending back for their brothers and their sisters, or their wives and their families, or their fathers and their mothers.  The doors are being closed; the houses are being locked up.  If the Minister sitting in the Front Bench now does not believe that, time and petrol permitting, he might possibly be able to take a little trip along the western seaboard of my county during the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>There he will see, as I see every day and every week and as others see right down the western seaboard, the houses being closed&mdash;houses that are better than anything that existed there 30 or 40 years ago.  These houses were built under a Fianna Fáil Government for the people in that part of the country. They are now being closed.  The locks are going up on the outside of the <Col N="2419" /> doors; the windows are being shuttered up.  The houses are being closed, in many cases, never to reopen, and this Government comes along then, with its head in the clouds, telling us that this is no fault of theirs, that they are doing as well as any other Government ever did, that they are really in difficulties and that they cannot be blamed.  That is utter rot, and nobody knows it better than the people sitting on the Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>So far as taking an independent view in this matter is concerned, an O.E.E.C. Report on conditions in the Republic of Ireland cannot be said to take a prejudiced view.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of yesterday, the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A survey of economic conditions in Ireland, made by O.E.E.C. last September ... states that the primary aim of economic policy must be to bring inflation under control.</P>
    <P>The survey, which covers in general 18 months to the middle of this year, states that Ireland's economic situation began to deteriorate in 1955, after several years of internal financial stability and lower external deficits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could anything be more damning, coming from a body that is not prejudiced in any way and that is not concerned about the internal politics of this country?  But there it is: after several years of stability, the position has been worsening since 1955.  One might ask why did the position not start to worsen in 1954?  For the very good reason that, although we had a Coalition Government in the latter part of that year, that Government was working a Fianna Fáil programme and so it was not until the Government got itself right into things in 1955 that we find the position worsening drastically from then onwards, until we find ourselves really up against it to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to put one or two matters before the Government and, in particular, before the Minister for Local Government as a result of not being able to get it across to him in the <Col N="2420" /> debate on housing the other day.  The position in our county in relation to housing, as in relation to other public buildings, is that we are neither doing nor starting any new jobs.  We may be continuing what we had already been engaged at, but we are not and we cannot go on with any new work. That, of course, is adding its quota to the hardships the people have to bear. I want to know from the Minister for Local Government what is the position in relation to local authority housing in Donegal?</P>
    <P>What is the position?  Why are tenders which have been submitted to the Department being held up?  Why have tenders which have been submitted as long ago as January of this year not come forth from the Department since then?  Why is it that a number of other tenders, which have been submitted and in relation to which there is no earthly reason for non-acceptance, have been held up? The prices on those tenders are better than we have been able to get for some considerable time for comparable buildings.  Yet, these tenders are being held up needlessly and recklessly and without any thought for either the workers who are being put out of employment or the poor people who are waiting to be housed.  But that is what is being done by our Minister for Local Government.  It is being done by him to his own county, not only to Cork and Dublin and the other places mentioned here the other day but to his own county of Donegal, in relation to which the Minister should really know the facts, even though he obviously does not know the facts in other counties.  Our position in Donegal now is a glaring example of neglect shuffling, side-dealing, misrepresentation, bluff and all the rest of it.  A better example of all that could not be found in any of the other 25 counties so far as the Minister for Local Government and the Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have submitted tenders to the Minister for a number of specific instance houses&mdash;47 to be exact.  The 47 having eventually satisfied all the various nonsensical queries that we were asked, the Minister in September <Col N="2421" /> could no longer stave us off and from our county council there went out, from September until to-day, a stream of S.I. tenders for the various houses, amounting to 47 in number. Tenders for these houses have been sent to the Minister over the past three months.  So far, we have got sanction for two, despite the fact that we have better tenders and more competitive tenders than we have had in years for comparable houses.</P>
    <P>We have also houses of a scheme type in Donegal, Killybegs, St. Johnstone, Lifford, Dromore, just outside Letterkenny, and various other places. All of them are lying with the Minister in his Department, some of them since January last.  Eleven months have passed and we are still waiting for sanction.  Yet, the Minister comes in here, as he came in last week, and as other Ministers will come in now, and say that housing is not being held up.  Housing is being held up.  Housing has been held up and, apparently, it will be held up for some time in the future.  All the talk and all the blurb to which we have been treated here in relation to money being available and all the confusion that has been created about the £4,000,000 and the £1,000,000 for the City of Dublin&mdash;all that just does not wash when it comes to dealing with a local authority down the country, a local authority which needs the houses and which has done everything within its power to get the houses, which has cleared the way in every direction, which has tenders lying in the Department of Local Government for which sanction will not be given.  Yet, the Government expects public representatives and the people they represent to accept that these houses are not being held up.  I would like the Minister at present occupying the Government Front Bench to say to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, what the position is in regard to Donegal. If my figures do not correspond with those which the Minister for Local Government has, I should be very glad to straighten them out and let the Minister see how true are the points I have made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> As I have said, the position to-day is very different from what it was in 1954.  It is certainly very different from what it was in 1948.  The similarity between those two years is that on both occasions Fianna Fáil were leaving office.  On both occasions our finances were reasonably well controlled and we had every indication that our production was increasing, that industry was expanding and that we could look forward to a period of progress in all directions.</P>
    <P>Yet here is what we get: a financial crisis of the first magnitude which is now admitted even by Deputy O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary, who went round for months contradicting the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and others and telling the country that there was no crisis.  Even he now has been converted to the belief that we are in a bad way and that we must do something about it. We have an agricultural prices' slump brought about in no small way by the Government.  The cost of living has gone up instead of being brought down as promised.  Unemployment is soaring. Emigration is more rampant than it ever has been.  The land project was stopped, but I hear there is some move now to accept applications, though these will not fall for payment until this Government has left office.</P>
    <P>There is this disgraceful situation about the lack of winter relief grants which are in greater need than ever before.  They were wiped out practically entirely in every county, particularly along the western seaboard. Add to that the failure of the National Loan, the bogus call for higher production in agriculture while at the same time agriculture is being strangled.  Then we had the petrol rationing about which I should like to say something to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It will be brought to the notice of the Minister that a considerable number of people in this country have bought their cars on hire purchase.  As a result of the drastic cut which has had to be made in petrol, private motor owners and the owners of lorries will find themselves in the position that unless the Government do something about it their vehicles will be <Col N="2423" /> taken from them by the hire-purchase companies.  Could the Minister examine the position and see if some arrangement could not be made whereby payment due on foot of hire-purchase arrangements in regard to petrol-driven machinery would be pushed back for the duration of the petrol rationing?  I would seriously ask the Minister to consider that matter, because if it is not done the present situation will create not only hardship, but, in some cases, will result in complete loss of livelihood and in the owners of such vehicles having to leave the country altogether.</P>
    <P>All of these things are only too true. All that remains for me to say is that, having made such a mess of things, having misled the people to such an extent, having bluffed and codded the people in every direction over the past two or three years, the Government now, even at this late stage, in order to save whatever little face there is left, should go to the country and ask the people if they still want them.  The Government, as well as everybody else, know why they will not go to the country; they know that if they go they will be put out.  Nevertheless, even at this last hour, the Government might salvage some of whatever respectability they have by going to the country and seeking the people's verdict. During Fianna Fáil's last term in office the present Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the present Minister for External Affairs and many others came in here on a Vote of Confidence in 1953 and talked until we were sick listening to them about why the then Government should go to the country because certain by-elections had not gone in their favour.</P>
    <P>If there was any truth in those assertions then I would say there is ten times more truth in them to-day, when you look at the results in Carlow-Kilkenny, Laois-Offaly, Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere.  You will find the same picture in every place.  The people in each community have indicated once and for all that they are finished with the humbug of a Governmen who say one thing one day and do another thing to-morrow.  The people <Col N="2424" /> have indicated that they want to represent them a Government composed of honest people who mean what they say.  The only thing the Government now can do to redeem themselves is to go to their bosses, the electorate of Ireland, and ask them in a general election for their verdict.  If they do that, they know that the few of them who come back will be sitting over here.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief because there are others who would wish to participate in this debate.  This question was introduced not for its realism but as political window-dressing. If there is any disillusionment in this House it has been provided by the lack of realism that obtains in the various debates.  We all know this has been a difficult year.  We must admit the fact that no matter what Government were in office they would be faced with the very same difficulties. Different Governments may have different remedies, but it must be admitted that the present Government have been working in the worst year in the history of this State.</P>
      <P>The fact that they have taken corrective measures is a tribute to their realism and courage, as Deputy Desmond has said.  It is all very fine to be critical, destructively critical, because that seems to be the whole tenor of the Opposition speeches here. They have provided no alternative. They have not even offered a suggestion as to what they would do if they were in Government during the past two and a half years.  I am afraid we have gone completely away from the standard of the Parliament we read about in our youth, the standard of Grattan's Parliament here in Dublin in 1778.  Judging by the procedure here in recent years we can never hope to emulate what that Parliament produced before the Act of Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I came across a document issued in the Sinn Féin election of 1918.  It certainly gives me food for thought.  This document was put before the people of Cork in 1918.  It told them&mdash;and I believe it to be historically true&mdash;that in 1800, when we lost our Parliament, we had a population <Col N="2425" /> of 8,500,000 and we paid then to Great Britain £2,000,000 a year in taxation.  In 1918, the year of the Sinn Féin General Election, we are told in this document, we had a population of 4,500,000 and we paid £50,000,000 a year in taxation to Great Britain.  In this year 1956 we have a population in the Twenty-Six Counties of something around 2,750,000 people.  We pay £135,000,000 a year in taxation.</P>
    <P>Does that not bring home forcibly to us how mismanaged our affairs have been in the last quarter of a century since we took over control of our own affairs in 1922?  Is it not a challenge to this Government, as it has been for all Governments down the years, as to whether we are capable of conducting our own affairs along realistic lines in accordance with the people's wishes? On the assumption that democracy is government by the people, for the people, I think there has been a great diversion from that principle on many occasions in recent years.</P>
    <P>We talk about increased production, and may I bring this respectfully to the attention of the House?  We are told very forcibly from the Opposition Benches, and we know it is too true that we are losing at the rate of 40,000 people a year.  Let us assume from the recent statistics, that by the end of this year we will have lost 200,000 people.  Assuming they are all adults why do we not, in accordance with the general set-up some years ago, reduce this House proportionately to what it was then?  Great Britain, I would say in her wisdom, gave us a representation in the English Parliament under the Act of Union, of 100 members for the whole thirty&mdash;two counties.  To-day we have 207 members for the Twenty-six Counties Surely this is an overloaded institution and surely the output from this institution is not the output that would command respect and admiration in the country?</P>
    <P>We must put this House in order if we are ever going to get back the good will of the Irish people.  They see there is a great deal of waste in the Government and in all the Governments down the years, that there is a great deal of waste in all Government Departments in the State.  We must remedy that <Col N="2426" /> situation sooner or later.  Out of evil comes good, they say, and out of this depression may come the realisation that more effective measures must be taken to deal with the situation.  If we look objectively at things and if we are earnest and patriotic enough we will see that there should be no such thing as the violent opposition that is occasionally displayed in this House. In this little island of ours we cannot live in isolation.  Our wealth and independence depend on the situation abroad.  Unfortunately all this year we have been exporting goods on to a falling market.  The value of these goods has dropped and the raw materials for our industries and the manufactured commodities we brought in here have unfortunately gone up in value.  The Government is not to blame for that situation and any Government in office would have to face up to that same reality.</P>
    <P>One thing that strikes me forcibly is that we injected into our economy in the last two years something like £20,000,000 extra and we have not got the production commensurate with that £20,000,000.  That £20,000,000 was injected by way of increased wages, increased salaries and increased social benefits, and that is one of the besetting problems of our economy.  I believe we have gone beyond our means in our social standing here in relation to our present production, and the sooner that is realised the better.</P>
    <P>There is a great cry now for a general election.  I do not know whether that is meant in an earnest spirit or not.  The people are the masters all the time and they will get the Government of their choice.  I would not like to see a general election taking place now.  I believe the Government have sufficient ability, sufficient realism and courage to deal with the situation.  Now that they have tackled the problem and set the country on the right road they should get the chance of implementing their aims and their programme in the hope that this country will show some improvement in 1957 that unfortunately it was unable to show during 1956.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about creating this kind of an atmosphere in what should be a serious discussion is that it prevents any kind of reasoned or objective analysis of the problems which the House has to deal with.  In addition, I think very often it precludes those who take part in this kind of childish, irresponsible and ill-informed crossfire from appreciating the actual problems and the basis on which we have to deal.  There is unfortunately a complete lack of realism and objectivity in most economic discussions in this House.  They are used mainly for the sake of the eternal political Party warfare, and that applies to both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The only argument put forward from the Opposition Benches in the course of this debate has been that they would be a better Government.  They did not utter one word about policy or suggest one remedy that they would apply.  They merely took the line: &ldquo;We would be a better Government.&rdquo; Could anybody have confidence in a Government of that type as being a better Government, with that complete lack of responsibility and lack of self-control? The situation which the country faces is far too serious to allow a continuance of this eternal wrangling and irresponsible Party warfare.  Surely we should be able to face up to the problems that confront the country reasonably and objectively.  The country is probably facing a struggle for its survival.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is a sufficient appreciation in this House or in the country generally&mdash; although possibly there is a better appreciation in the country than in this House&mdash;of the seriousness of the position which faces us.  It is a position that is not new, a position that has existed, as far as the economy of the country is concerned, since this State was set up.  The truth of the matter is that the economy which we took over some 30 years ago has suffered from an adverse trade balance and an adverse balance of payments except in a time of war or emergency. <Col N="2430" /> We suffer from one of the highest rates of unemployment in western Europe, a rate of unemployment which does not really disclose the full extent of the unemployment which exists because it is masked by emigration.  We suffer from a fall in population.  In the 30 year period from 1926 to 1956, we have exported 673,000 of our people.  In the last ten years from 1946 to 1956, and both sides can take credit for it, we have exported 319,000 of our people. In addition, we have this chronic high rate of unemployment.  We took over control of our own affairs in the hope that we would be able to build an Ireland in which people would be able to work, an Ireland in which they would be able to live.  We have failed in achieving that completely.</P>
      <P>In 1926, we had a working labour force, or a working population, of 1,220,000.  That has fallen now to a working population of 1,184,000.  Possibly the most serious aspect and the most worrying aspect of the position is revealed by the figures that in the five years from 1951 to 1955, some 37,000 people were disemployed in the agricultural sector of our economy.  To a certain extent, that was a continuance of a trend which has been there the whole time, possibly accelerated, but what is really alarming is that during the same period, we were able to provide only 1,400 jobs in the other sectors of our economy and that was despite the genuine efforts made by successive Governments and despite the fact that we poured millions, if you like, into attempting to secure a right rate of industrial development.</P>
      <P>While we disemployed, in five years, 37,000, we were able to create only 1,400 new jobs or approximately 300 jobs a year.  I wonder if one added up the amount spent in the promotion of industrial developments in that five-year period, how much each one of these 300 jobs a year costs.  Those are alarming figures which illustrate the complete and utter failure of the policies which we have been pursuing on both sides of the House.  It is that which makes me so impatient with the irresponsible Party warfare which mars any attempt at a constructive approach to our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the principal cause of our failure arises from our investment policies and from the fact that we made our economic development subservient to the accumulation and maintenance of vast foreign investments and that we starved our own economy of the capital which was required for its development.  I think that is one of the main reasons; it is by no means the only reason.  I think <Col N="2432" /> that our lack of planning, our lack of informed technical advice and possibly, also, our lack of informed Governments over the whole of that period were contributing factors as well.</P>
      <P>One of the present problems in politics is that for some extraordinary reason neither of the major Parties seem to be prepared to face up to the extent of the problem which faces the country.  None of them seems to be prepared to realise and admit that it is not a question of patching up the economy here and there, but that the problem involves the complete reconstruction and readjustment of our economy.  I do not know whether that reluctance to admit the reality of the problems comes from a fear that the Parties might be blamed for creating these conditions in the past.  I do not think that matters now.  I think the position is far too serious to allow of recriminations about past inaction or past action.</P>

      <P>Particularly the younger people in the Parties, people like Deputy Flanagan and the younger people on both sides of the House, ought to make an objective analysis of the extent of the problem.  It is no use coming here and talking about unemployment and emigration and deploring these evils.  We all deplore them, of course, but it is no use doing that while at the same time we pursue the policies that cause them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning some Deputy from the opposite benches&mdash;I think it was Deputy Blaney&mdash;talking of the Labour Party and myself, asked why we supported the present Government if we did not agree with its policies.  The answer is extremely simple.  We know that the alternative to Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance is Deputy MacEntee and we know that Deputy MacEntee's policies will be far worse than Deputy Sweetman's.  Not only would you have a credit squeeze now, but, in addition, subsidies would possibly also be removed to reduce the consumers' purchasing power, because that is exactly what he did in 1951-52, <Col N="2433" /> but undoubtedly one of the main obstacles to any kind of progress is this unwillingness of both sides to face up to the extent of the problems that confront the country.</P>
    <P>In my view and I think in the view of anybody who makes an objective analysis of our problems, it is quite obvious that nothing short of long-term comprehensive planning can remedy the structural defects which have now become endemic in our economy.  The announcement by the Government early in October of the setting up of an investment committee, the provision of short-term capital for agriculture and various other measures, was welcomed.</P>
    <P>They were all steps in the right direction, but I think they were completely insufficient.  I think that all isolated measures operate in a vacuum. The position of our economy now is that it is not only stagnant but it is going back.  We are marching backwards and nothing short of a comprehensive long-term plan which will determine the annual rate of investment required, assess the consumption requirements and the export requirements of the population and deal comprehensively with every aspect of the economy can be of any value.</P>
    <P>Many good measures were taken in the past&mdash;isolated measures both by the Fianna Fáil Government and the inter-Party Government.  Many good projects were initiated&mdash;the E.S.B., Irish Shipping, Bord na Móna and so on.  They are all completely inadequate to deal with the problems with which we have to deal and they are now nearly vegetating in a stagnant economy.</P>
    <P>I notice that a manufacturer recently pointed out that the loss in falling population represented to him an annual loss in sale of the goods he was manufacturing of, I think, some 300,000 to 400,000 units per year.  One cannot hope to develop the economy of the country or to expand production in a situation in which our own market is contracting not only in purchasing power, but in numbers as well.  That is the situation we are in.</P>
    <P>The most heartening development&mdash; indeed, the only heartening sign I have <Col N="2434" /> seen in recent times&mdash;has been the very careful and well-considered analysis made by the trade union movement, the Trade Union Congress, a week or two ago.  It was a realistic attempt to assess the difficulties of our economy and to put forward long-term proposals. If I may say so, it was the only constructive approach in our public life to the problems which are gradually but steadily destroying the economy of this State.</P>
    <P>I have dealt so far mainly with the long-term approach to our problems.  I do not want to monopolise too much time, or I could say a lot more in regard to them.  I wish to say a few words now in regard to the immediate crisis&mdash;for it is a crisis.  I find myself in profound disagreement with the policy which the Government has pursued since the beginning of the year in regard to the present crisis.  We had a credit squeeze, first of all, a credit squeeze for which the Government may not have been wholly responsible but nevertheless a credit squeeze which set in motion a deflationary situation, in which we had mounting unemployment the whole time and which inevitably had to result in the curtailment of investment.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of investment resulting from the credit squeeze has led to a fall in production.  The fall in production is clearly shown by the figures which were given in this House yesterday in regard to industrial goods.  In the course of the year, the index for the production of industrial goods, which stood at 107.7 in September, 1955, fell to 98.2 in September, 1956. That is the steepest fall recorded in our industrial production.  That was bound to happen when the credit squeeze was instituted.  It was bound to result in a curtailment of investment, which, in turn, was bound to result in a fall in production.  That has happened.</P>
    <P>It is of no use for the Minister or Deputies opposite to deny that there has been a credit squeeze.  There has been an extensive credit squeeze during the course of the year.  I do not want to bore the House unduly with figures, but may I mention one or two?  Bank advances in the first six <Col N="2435" /> months reduced by £6.2 million. Taking the year as a whole, there was a reduction in bank advances of £4.6 million, that is, from mid-October, 1955, to mid-October, 1956.  We find that £3.3. million of that reduction was in respect of advances to local authorities. Hence we have had a curtailment in housing and so on.  Therefore, it is fatuous for anyone to come along and say there has been no credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>The import levies were inevitable and necessary, but they, too, were bound to create a certain amount of disemployment. In addition to that, the Government curtailed public works, though at a later stage&mdash;and a little bit too late &mdash;they restored £1,000,000 to public works and works of that kind.  On 27th November last, the Government issued a circular to local authorities which will have the effect of practically stalling local authority works for a period of three or four months.</P>
    <P>I think these measures were unwise and indefensible.  As I have said, we were bound to have a certain amount of disemployment as a result of the import levies, but that could not be avoided.  In that situation, the policy of the Government should have been aimed at seeking to expand employment, in view of the inevitable unemployment likely to arise as a result of the credit squeeze and the import levies.  With a little foresight and very little more expenditure, provision could have been made by the Government to expand expenditure on productive work, on such things as the land project, drainage schemes, afforestation and the building of schools throughout the country.  I think all these steps should have been taken earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to speak too long and there are many things I have to leave unsaid, but I would appeal to the Government to revise its attitude in regard to the immediate crisis. We are facing a situation in which I believe unemployment will range from 90,000 to 100,000 in the early months of the year.  Remedial action has to be taken, not when the crisis is on top of us, but before that.  At <Col N="2436" /> the moment we spend close on £100,000 a week in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, that is, in ten weeks we spend £1,000,000.  Would it not be better to use that money, or portion of it, to provide employment rather than waste it, one might say&mdash; because it is very nearly waste&mdash;in paying people to remain unemployed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A request has been received from the Provincial Newspapers' Association that advertisements regarding the rationing of petrol and oil should be inserted in the provincial Press.</P>
      <P>I have considered this request and I am satisfied that the publicity already afforded the petrol and oil rationing scheme through the Press and radio is adequate consistent with reasonable expenditure.  If, at any time, it would appear that the publication of advertisements in the provincial Press is necessary the matter will be further considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that in rural Ireland quite a large number of people do not purchase the daily papers, that they depend for their information on the weekly papers which they read from cover to cover and in view of the fact that the only alternative source of <Col N="2439" /> information available to them with regard to petrol rationing is the radio, would the Minister not agree that it is very awkward at times for the public to have to take the full facts in connection with rationing from the radio announcements?  In view of that fact, would he not reconsider his decision and make the advertisements available to the provincial newspapers so that the people in rural areas will know definitely what the position is with regard to rationing of oil and petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree, and even people who have only cursorily glanced at the daily newspapers will agree, that there has been abundant publicity for petrol and oil rationing.  The radio is also being used for the purpose of publicising the arrangements.  I personally think that the publicity so far accorded to these arrangements is adequate and, as I say, consistent with reasonable expenditure but if there is any clear evidence that there is need for publicity in the provincial newspapers I should be only too glad to have the matter considered. I think, however, judging from the number of the letters that have reached me on the subject, everybody seems to have an intimate knowledge of what the arrangements are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

I am in the position at the moment that I am getting letters from people inquiring what is the exact position in regard to the rationing, and that is due to the fact that the people are not fully aware of the conditions laid down by the Minister.  I would ask him to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility of extending their existing plant to enable them to undertake the manufacture of containers to supply the requirements of the food processing industry was examined by the Condensed Milk Company late in 1954; and the company then reached the conclusion that it would not be an economic proposition for them to undertake such manufacture, particularly in view of the heavy capital outlay that would be necessary. I understand that the possibilities of economic production are even less favourable now than they were in 1954.</P>

The instructions outlined the methods that should be adopted for stabilisation, including the withdrawal in certain circumstances of the protection of the Trade Disputes Act and the imposition of severe penalties; made provision for the exemption of certain classes of workers, and indicated that <Col N="2441" /> the duration of the Bill should be two years.</P>

      <P>I would imagine that this question would be more appropriate to the Minister for Local Government, but in regard to a recent accident, is the Minister aware that there was a hoarding on the approach road in connection with some building in Lime Street which completely obstructed the view of the river and that at that point there was no protection? Can any provision be made in regard to that?  After all, the Government cannot leave such important matters completely to the local authority and that seems to be what is happening.  Can any provision be made to ensure that this type of accident does not happen?  There has been a large number of accidents on the quays in recent years.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the cost per lb. of producing turkeys for the market as it is subject to wide variation, depending on such factors as: the extent to which the food for the birds is grown by the turkey producer; the age at which the birds are sold; the incidence of disease and mortality in the flock; the turkey rearing system employed; and the level of efficiency of feeding and management generally.</P>
      <P>The prices paid to producers for turkeys also vary widely, depending on the sex, quality and weight of the individual birds, differences in the prices ruling at different local markets, and day-to-day fluctuations in market prices generally.  Accordingly, in the absence of details of the numbers and weights of all turkeys sold by producers so far this season and the price paid per lb. in each case, I am unable to indicate the average price being obtained by producers in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that in County Monaghan turkeys are being bought at prices ranging from 1/- to 1/3 per lb.; and, if so, if he will consider, even at this stage, providing a subsidy to help the farmers over the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the prices paid recently to turkey producers in County Monaghan have ranged from 1/- to 1/2 per lb., live weight, for cock turkeys and from 1/6 to 1/8 per lb., live weight, for hen turkeys of first quality and that lower prices have been paid for inferior birds.  The unsatisfactory prices prevailing for turkeys this year are due to the increased supplies of turkeys on the British market consequent on the increase of production here and in Great Britain where turkey numbers are over 70 per cent. above the 1955 level.</P>
      <P>It is not practicable to pay a subsidy for turkeys sold on an entirely free market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that even since I put down that question the position has deteriorated?  In Monaghan yesterday, farmers were paid from 10d. to 1/-.  The farmers do not expect the Minister to sit idly by while the price of turkeys continues to drop.  This will have a very bad effect next year.  It will mean that there will be no turkeys next year.  Even at this late hour, the Minister should do something to ease the position for the farmers.  We were expecting the Minister to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy feels, as I feel, genuine and sincere sympathy for people who have gone to the trouble of producing turkeys only to find the market as unsatisfactory as it undoubtedly is.  I think the Deputy will agree with me there is <Col N="2452" /> nothing I can do to control the extent to which turkey producers in Great Britain expand their production, and, when we are faced with an increase of 70 per cent. in turkey production in Great Britain, the result is not only a most unsatisfactory price for our producers but an equally disastrous price for producers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I must say that these difficulties have been further exasperated by the persistent mild weather that has obtained since the first week in December making the purchase and storage of turkeys even more difficult than it otherwise would have been.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that my latest advice, which reached me in the last quarter of an hour&mdash;we are keeping practically in hourly contact with the London market&mdash;gives me no hope that there will be any further improvement in the market between now and Christmas.  I hope producers will avail of the best prices they can get for their birds which they have to dispose of in the Christmas season.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether it has been brought to his notice that for some months past the sanctioning of new work under the Land Project has been so drastically curtailed as to amount comparatively to an almost complete shut-down, and that contractors have had to dispense with almost 80 per cent. of their skilled men, and that <Col N="2453" /> some have had to dispose of their machinery; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware and do not accept that the position is as set out in the Deputy's question.  The position, in fact, is that expenditure under the Land Project up to the 30th November in the current financial year was £2,012,000 as compared with an expenditure of £1,866,000 during the corresponding period of 1955-56, that is an increase of £146,000.  A balance of approximately £679,000 is available for the remainder of the year and it is anticipated that approximately the same amount will be expended this year as last year, when the expenditure was the highest ever recorded.</P>
      <P>On the 17th October last, I received representatives of the Land Project Contractors' Association and discussed the operation of the project generally with them.  I pointed out that the number of contractors had increased considerably and that with the technical skill they have acquired they were disposing of work more rapidly with the result that work and earnings were necessarily more thinly spread over their increased numbers.</P>
      <P>In 1954-55 there were 126 contractors seeking contract work under the Land Project; there are now 174, and it is manifest that unless it were thought desirable to expand the annual appropriation for the project indefinitely and to increase the staff to an unwarranted extent, it would not be possible to provide continuous employment for a continuously increasing number of contractors engaged on land reclamation work.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that work under the project is proceeding normally and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like one point clarified.  I presume the Minister is aware that the question as I worded it asks whether the matter has been brought to his notice?  Would the Minister now state whether the people who made representations to him, that contractors had to dispense with 80 per cent. of their skilled men, were making representations on what are now discovered to be untruths?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain exceptions to prove every rule.  But that there may be misapprehension or misunderstanding on the part of people who have overlooked the fact that their own numbers have increased from 126 to 174 is to my mind very understandable. However, the fact remains that, from my point of view, I cannot give as much employment out of the same sum of money to 174 contractors as I did to 126 and unless I ask Dáil Éireann to give me unlimited sums of money and authority to employ unlimited numbers of civil servants to supervise the expenditure of the money, I cannot undertake to employ all the contractors no matter how many enter into this business.</P>

      <P>There was no ministerial decision prior to 1947 to purchase jet aircraft.  Hard surface runways have been provided at Baldonnel because they are necessary for the efficient all-the-year-round operation of our aircraft. Prior to the provision of the new runways Baldonnel Aerodrome had been non-operational for long periods each winter owing to the water-logged condition of the ground.

      <P>The number of such petitions was 14,192.  In 8,261 cases the Referee was not of the opinion that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case that the applicants were persons to whom the Act of 1934 applied and, accordingly, he had to refuse to re-investigate the applications. The position in regard to the remaining 5,931 cases as at the 30th November, 1956, was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Number of favourable reports, 1,501; number of unfavourable reports, 3,375; number still under consideration, 1,055.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will indicate the sources from which the commercial banks increased their gross holdings of sterling assets by £20.5 millions in the past four and a half months&mdash;from £209.6 millions on 30th June, 1956, to £230.1 millions in November, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase of £20.5 million in the gross external assets of the commercial banks between 30 June, 1956 and 20th November, 1956, is accounted for as to £6.6 million by an increase in deposits and other liabilities incurred outside the State.  The remainder of the increase in external assets represents increased liabilities to Irish depositors.  It is due, as to a <Col N="2459" /> total of £8.9 million, to the realisation of sterling securities by the Central Bank and Departmental Funds and, as to the balance, to the seasonal inflow of earnings from tourism and to the improved trading position resulting from the measures taken by the Government earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I might add that the improvement in the banks' position since June does not mean that the economy as a whole is building up external assets.  For the calendar year 1956 there will be a substantial deficit in the balance of payments, involving an equivalent reduction in the country's external reserves.</P>

      <P>I do not intend, either now or in the foreseeable future, to take any steps to devalue the currency.  On the contrary, as stated clearly and categorically by me in this House on 25th July last (Dáil Debates, Volume 159, columns 1602, 1603) the Government are determined to take whatever measures are required, however unpleasant, to safeguard and maintain the value of the Irish £.  This principle of Government policy was again affirmed by the Taoiseach in this House on the 26th July (Dáil Debates, Volume 159, columns 1987, 1988).  The safeguarding of the exchange value of <Col N="2461" /> the Irish £ by correcting a dangerous balance of payments situation was, of course, the sole purpose of the special import levies and other measures taken by the Government earlier this year.

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the allocations made for rural employment schemes.  The allocation for these schemes in County Dublin for 1956-57 is £1,950, as stated by the Deputy in his question, to which, of course, must be added the local contribution of £650, making available, accordingly, a total of £2,600 for these schemes.  This compares with £1,200 available in 1955-56, £400 in 1954-55 and nil in 1953-54.</P>

Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that his miserable pittance of £1,900 for the abnormal number of unemployed in County Dublin at the present time&mdash;even in the town of Swords there are 100 unemployed&mdash;<Col N="2465" /> would not give them three weeks' work?</P>

      <P>The gauge readings taken in the ten years 1940-49 show that the average levels of Lough Corrib over that period were 28.7 feet above Ordnance Datum in summer and 30.1 feet in winter.  The minimum and maximum levels recorded during that period were 26.9 feet and 32.0 feet, respectively, above Ordnance Datum.</P>
      <P>The levels will continue to depend on meteorological conditions and other factors.  The Corrib-Clare drainage scheme is designed to provide a summer level not exceeding 28.0 feet above Ordnance Datum and to pass a flood of 660,000 cubic feet per minute without causing the level of Lough Corrib to rise above 30.0 feet over Ordnance Datum.</P>

      <P>The possibility of acquiring a site in the vicinity of Government Buildings to provide accommodation for the Oireachtas and some Government Departments was first raised in 1933.  Proposals of varying <Col N="2469" /> extent were suggested for consideration between that date and 1944. These proposals ranged from a site of about 12½ acres comprised in the block lying between Merrion Square South and Lower Baggot Street to an area of approximately 78 acres bounded on the south by Merrion Row and Lower Bagget Street; on the east by the Grand Canal; on the north by Lower Mount Street, Grattan Street, Hogan Place, Fenian Street, and Lincoln Place, and on the west by a line drawn from the junction of Lincoln Place and Clare Street to the western end of Merrion Row.  The latter proposals visualised a long term development including sites for public buildings other than Government offices and the Oireachtas accommodation.  None of the proposals reached the stage at which detailed plans and estimates were prepared, but the figure of £11,500,000 was mentioned in 1944 as a rough order of the cost of the acquisition and clearance of the 78 acre area and the erection thereon of State buildings.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circular letter to which the Deputies refer will not have the results suggested.  In the first place, the circular letter relates to projects not yet undertaken and will not affect works which are in progress.  Secondly, the object of the circular is to have what was intended to represent standard <Col N="2472" /> practice in regard to borrowing procedure adopted by all the local authorities concerned so that the best possible use can be made of available capital and that no portion of such capital will be tied up by being reserved to meet liabilities of an uncertain nature that may not mature in the financial year to which the appropriate loans are relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this circular has created a considerable amount of confusion in the minds of local authorities in relation to work actually in progress, will the Minister say whether he will take steps now to notify local authorities that it does not affect in any way works which are at present in progress or for which sanction has been obtained?  Secondly, is it not a fact that the effect of the circular will be to prevent local authorities from, as heretofore, initiating works awaiting sanction, in anticipation of sanction, and whether that will not inevitably create a considerable amount of unemployment in the course of the next two or three months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that local authorities were in any doubt as to the fact that they should proceed with works in progress.  I most certainly will make it clear to local authorities that they should proceed with such works.  The circular does not, in fact, refer to such works.  With regard to the second query, all I can say is that we are trying to adopt a standard practice for all local authorities and we are anxious to ensure that capital will not be tied up in any financial year, capital on which there might be no draw until the following year.  It is really organised planning we are endeavouring to procure.</P>

Of the successful candidates from the special two-year course, seven have obtained permanent appointments in the service of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that any specific undertaking was given that permanent appointments would be available for the trainees when they had completed their course.  The making of permanent appointments to the grade of Health Inspector is a matter for local authorities in the first instance, but I would like to point out to the Deputy that on the 3rd June, 1955, my Department circularised local health authorities pointing out the high quality of the training received by the students attending the two-year course and requesting that the authorities should review the adequacy of their Health Inspector staff, in view of the desirability of giving the successful students an opportunity of competing for permanent posts in the local authority service.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the latter portion of the Minister's reply, is he aware that when these officers filled in their application forms to undergo the full two-year course run by the Dublin Vocational Committee they were informed by circular letter that 15 permanent vacancies <Col N="2485" /> existed at that time in 1953 and that a further five vacancies per annum were expected to be available each year afterwards?  Many of these men left good jobs in order to undergo this course and would the Minister not agree that they were given more or less a guarantee of employment on the conclusion of the course?  Would he not now undertake to ensure that permanent employment is given to all these officers at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

The Deputy is correct in saying that they were informed that probably five vacancies would arise in the following years.  I would, however, direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that it is the responsibility of health authorities, in the first instance, and the position is kept under review by me and by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  The last speaker on the Government side of the House was Deputy MacBride and it is about time that Deputy MacBride's <Col N="2508" /> tactics and those of the remnants of the Clann na Poblachta Party were finally exposed in this House. We see letters almost nightly in the Dublin evening papers, under <i>noms-de-plume</i>, which are obviously inspired by the Clann na Poblachta supporters.  Deputy MacBride at least has seen the writing on the wall.  Last Saturday a meeting took place&mdash;and let him deny this if he likes&mdash;of the Clann na Poblachta National Executive.  At that meeting, Deputy MacBride gave a dissertation on the present economic crisis and the difficulties facing the Government and on what he as leader of the Clann na Poblachta Party suggested and how the Government treated his suggestions. There were a few members, I am glad to say, of the Clann na Poblachta Party who were a bit tired of Deputy MacBride's tactics and a vote was taken.  The vote was that the three members of the Party would withdraw from the Government before April.  Deputy MacBride pleaded with the members of the National Executive to be allowed to stay on and support the Government until April.  I think the voting was 38 to 2.  He chose to-day to come in and criticise Deputy MacEntee and members of the Fianna Fáil Party for speeches which they had made and general Fianna Fáil policy and I am simply taking this opportunity of exposing the hypocrisy of Deputy MacBride and his two companions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity of saying some words here.  I had hoped to get in on the housing debate and deal particularly with the problems which exist in Limerick.  Every Deputy could talk about the housing difficulties of his own locality, but the information I will give the house in the few short minutes at my disposal will stagger the members of the House. The housing position, as set out by the City Manager and not by me, is incredible at the present time.  In a reply to a question in this House, the Minister for Social Welfare showed that there are now over 800 men unemployed in Limerick City more than there were this time last year, not taking into a consideration those who have emigrated.  Things are critical in <Col N="2509" /> Limerick and the highest incidence of unemployment is in the building trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance chooses to say that the whole financial crisis in the country at the present time is attributable to circumstances outside the control of the Government.  I am now going to expose something which the Government is directly in control of.  Through the neglect and apathy of the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and the Government generally, this unemployment position in Limerick has been caused.  I believe the position is the worst in the country, comparatively speaking.</P>
    <P>We have one housing scheme in Limerick which is worth £75,000 for which we have applied to the Minister for Local Government for a loan.  We have another housing scheme of £330,000.  We also have schemes of site development and applications for further housing.  The application for the loan of £75,000 has been with the Minister for Local Government for many a long day.  I think it could be said it is with him since shortly after he came into this House.  The Minister for Local Government has actually come to Limerick and opened a scheme and made a very nice speech congratulating all parties concerned, and what did we get?  We did not get a light.  But what does the Minister for Finance say?  On November 2nd when the heat was being applied and when questions were being put down here weekly, the Department of Local Government recommended that the Commissioners of Public Works should pay this loan.  The houses are built and occupied and we have not received one shilling.</P>
    <P>There is another scheme in Limerick which is known as the Garryowen scheme, costing £330,000.  In the case of this scheme, £140,000 has already been spent and we have to pay the contractors every month.  We did not get a light for that scheme either, but on November 2nd also the Minister for Local Government recommended that the Commissioners of Public Works should pay the grant allocated.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to housing in Limerick is most serious.  We have <Col N="2510" /> reached the limit as regards our overdraft accommodation with the bank and in that connection I should like to refer to a statement made on 29th November, 1956, by the Minister for Finance in reply to a question by me in this House.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance if he would state in relation to the Limerick Corporation what proposals for loans from the Local Loans Fund were at present before him, the present position in each case, and when payment would be made.  In reply, the Minister for Finance said that proposals in relation to Limerick Corporation for loans from the Local Loans Fund amounting to £410,200&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is a travesty of the whole general economic policy of the Government and this travesty in Limerick is but a typical example of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would not have even enough intelligence to appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister would have enough intelligence to grant the loans to the Limerick Corporation which he admitted on 29th November are due to us.  As I was saying before I was interrupted by the Minister, his reply to my question was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Proposals in relation to Limerick Corporation for loans from the Local Loans Fund amounting to £410,200 under the Housing of the Working Classes Act and £26,500 under the Sanitary Services Acts are at present before me and are being examined departmentally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And now let the House hear what follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Pending the completion of this examination, I cannot say to what extent these proposals will be accepted.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he cannot say to what extent the proposals will be accepted in respect of houses completed, occupied and the builders paid <Col N="2511" /> by the Limerick Corporation by overdraft, the interest on which is being subsidised by the ratepayers of Limerick City.  It is about time the Minister for Finance copped himself on and told the people of this country a bit of truth.  The Minister further stated in his reply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy will appreciate that detailed scrutiny of proposals involving such substantial outlay from the Local Loans Fund is essential in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, in reply to a Supplementary Question, the Minister said that only last month or this month these matters were put before him, which was an admission by the Minister for Finance that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, had fallen down completely on the job.  It is scandalous to say that there is a sum of £410,000 owed to the Limerick Corporation and that the housing of the working classes is held up.  We cannot embark upon any future schemes.  We have got to the highest peak of the amount we can draw from our treasurers, the Munster and Leinster Bank, and we are in the position that we do not know what the future holds.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the housing of the working classes is bad enough, but what is the position in regard to private building and housing under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts?  I can tell the Minister straight off.  On 11th June, 1956, a mortgage was signed by Limerick Corporation and the Commissioners for Public Works for £100,000 which sum in the main covered people who had erected houses, had houses which were substantially erected or who had entered into arrangements with contractors. Since 11th June, 1956, all the Limerick Corporation has drawn is £40,000 and we cannot, despite deputations and pleadings by the City Manager, myself, Deputy Carew and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, get the £60,000, out of the Minister for Finance and even if he gives us the £60,000, we are in the position that private building in Limerick at the present time is stopped because the total commitments at the <Col N="2512" /> present time in Limerick are £98,260. If we get the £60,000 in addition to the £40,000 we have got already, it will leave us with only a couple of thousand pounds.</P>
    <P>Private building has stopped in Limerick and housing of the working classes has been held up.  The Minister for Finance will not tell us when we can get the money or how we can get it.  There are very many members of the present Government who criticised Deputy Smith and the Fianna Fáil Party, when the rate of interest rose before, for not giving consideration to people who had entered into commitments under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts or make some concession to them with regard to the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>What is the present position with regard to the rate of interest?  It is that all future issues from the Local Loans Fund are lent at 5¾ per cent. Even though the Minister for Local Government in his Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, gave the local authority the power of lending that money at any rate they wished&mdash;1 per cent. if you like&mdash;nevertheless, no member of a local authority asked the ratepayers to subsidise private housing or housing under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts by lending the money at a lesser rate than that at which they can borrow it.  People have entered into commitments in Limerick and have built houses and instead of 5¼ per cent. the City Manager is trying to charge those people 6¼ per cent., the 5¾ per cent. which the Minister for Finance intimates was the borrowing rate at which they would get the money and the ½ per cent. extra for administrative costs.</P>
    <P>I could talk all day on this question and expose the whole position in regard to housing, but I want to give my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, who has some important points to make, an opportunity of presenting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have even three minutes to be able to say something.  I do not intend to deal <Col N="2513" /> with the general economic situation, but I do wish to say a few things in regard to the position obtaining in the part of the country which I represent. It is a part of the country which is dying, where the old customs and traditions are falling into disuse, where the social fabric is disintegrated and where migration to supplement part time production at home has been supplanted by whole time emigration with no home production at all.  The effect of the policy of this Government on the area I represent has been far worse than on the tillage areas of the country and it has been conceded that the congested areas have a proportionate higher productivity.  The mainstay of our economy, eggs, poultry, pigs and bacon has been destroyed by the present Administration.  At the present time, our capacity to produce and our capacity thereby to be an asset to the country has been ruined by this Government.  Let any Minister in this Government who talks about sabotage come to the West of Ireland and he will see nothing there but empty houses to-day.  The songs that used to be sung in these homes are no longer sung because the people are not there to sing them.</P>
      <P>If the Government are satisfied about the present position, as their smug appearance to-day would suggest, they should have no qualms about going to the country; but they are not and they will get their answer if they come to the West of Ireland from the people they have sabotaged.  This very day the Government have passed an Industrial Grants Bill which is designed still further to stab those people in the back and is also designed to get us away from the policy of decentralising industry in this country. I hope that the day will come soon when we will be able to get back to the policy enunciated by Deputy Lemass in introducing the Undeveloped Areas Bill when he said that his Government would go even further in order to give a chance to the people in the West to get back on their feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have spoken here on our having too many social welfare benefits. That may be so, but social benefits are not what the people in the West of Ireland want.  They want work <Col N="2514" /> and a chance to contribute to the nation and make a living for themselves. Social benefits are only substitutes and we are fed up with substitutes in the West of Ireland now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, at the commencement of his speech this morning, on this debate, asserted that he thought that the year 1956 would be <Col N="2515" /> recorded in history as one of the worst years which this State has experienced since its establishment.  Whether or not that statement be true, there can be no doubt that the year 1956 presented this Government with difficulties and problems which faced no other Irish Government since this State was established.  Whatever view may be taken of the manner in which this Government have faced and tackled those difficulties and problems, there can be no doubt that those difficulties and problems existed and I assert that there can be no doubt that those difficulties and problems existed through no fault of the present Government. They were not due to anything that we did or omitted to do, or that we failed or neglected to have done.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the fact, which cannot be denied, that there were very serious difficulties confronting the country economically and financially during the last year, we would have been entitled to expect, and I think the country would have hoped, that the Opposition would have faced this debate to-day in a serious and responsible mood, thinking not of their own political Party advantage but of the good of the country as a whole. That is what the country was entitled to get from the Opposition: that is what it has not got in to-day's debate.  That is what it has not got since these difficulties began to appear and since they became more and more serious.</P>
      <P>We were told during the course of the debates in March and July of this year, when the Government, through the Minister for Finance, introduced in this House the measures which they deemed necessary to meet with and cope with these difficulties and trials, that the Opposition, much as they disliked the present Government&mdash;Deputy de Valera forgot himself so far as to say that he detested this Government &mdash;would help us and help the country in its trials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say here, at the outset of my remarks, that from the time these difficulties appeared until the present, so far from giving one single piece of help to the Government or to the country in the nation's difficulties, the <Col N="2516" /> Opposition have set themselves out in every possible way, at every time, and in every direction, not merely to embarrass the Government but to prevent the Government or the country from taking, and submitting to, the necessary steps to retrieve the economic and financial ills that were affecting this country.  In spite of their hypocritical suggestion that they were going to help, they never gave us the slightest help, nor the slightest constructive suggestion at any time.</P>
    <P>It is part of the democratic system, on which the smooth working of the democratic machine depends, that there should be an Opposition which will do its duty to the country.  The democratic machine requires a Government and it requires an Opposition. That Opposition does not fulfil its duty to the country by carping, destructive criticism; it must give some constructive suggestions or proposals, particularly in circumstances such as affected the country in the last 12 months.  Day after day the Order Paper of this House has been filled to overflowing with questions designed not to help the economy or the finance of the country, not to give courage and heart to the people in their trials and difficulties, but in order to suggest that the evils afflicting the economy and the finance of the country were entirely the fault of the Government and that the Opposition should reap the harvest or the crop that has been set with the heavy toil of the present Government over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>If there had been anything wrong with the measures taken by the Government to deal with the unemployment and financial situation and to cope with the problem of the imbalance of our international trade, it was the duty of the Opposition to point out where we were going wrong and to suggest measures different from those which we were taking to cope with the situation.  Instead of that, we had the Opposition unanimously agreeing to, and accepting, every measure taken by this Government to cope with the difficulties, financial and economic, that were confronting us. We got a unanimous vote in March and we got another in July.  Neither in <Col N="2517" /> March nor in July, nor since, either inside this House or outside it, has there been any suggestion that measures taken by the Government were not the correct measures, nor has there been any indication given that the Party opposite, the Fianna Fáil Party, had they been in Government here during the last 12 months, would have taken other, different, or better methods.  We are entitled to say, therefore, to the country, and I believe the country understands it now, that we took the proper measures which had to be taken, that we as a Government, an inter-Party Government&mdash;a Coalition Government if you like to call us that&mdash;were strong enough in times of stress and trial to stand the strain put upon us and to take unpopular measures which were deemed necessary in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Then the Party opposite set themselves out merely to fish in the troubled waters and to try to gain for themselves political party advantage at the nation's expense.  We would have thought that, even to-day, when Deputy Lemass speaks of the necessity for holding a general election, and says that this Government should be made do some work during the holidays, or what are called the holidays, we would have got some constructive suggestion from him or some of his colleagues. Throughout the whole course of the debate, we heard no constructive criticism, nothing but carping criticism and the lowest form of political propaganda. Therefore, I say that the Fianna Fáil Opposition deserves badly from the country.  It has failed in its duty as an Opposition and I assert, too, with confidence, that the people will recognise that we have done our duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the fashion for Fianna Fáil to decry myself and my colleagues in the Government, and to use all the epithets they could think of in their descriptions of us, in an attempt to show how we could not possibly succeed when put to the test in a time of difficulty.  We have at least proved to the country that we are able to face difficulties in a way that no Fianna Fáil Government would ever have been able to face them.  I want to interpolate a tribute to my colleagues here: I have worked with them now for five and a half years, two and a half years with my present colleagues and three years with some of them in the first inter-Party Government, my Labour colleagues and my farmer colleagues, and I can say this with absolute confidence&mdash;never during all that time had we the slightest measure of bitterness or disagreement.</P>
      <P>During the last 12 months, we worked, not as Deputy Lemass would have people think, doing nothing, but day and night facing the problems we had to face.  We worked as a team in a way that Fianna Fáil never worked, and never could work, and at least we have reached the position now that, having tackled the problem, we can see some hopeful signs of recovery and some hope that we can now plan the policy that I indicated in my speech on the 5th October of this year, and to which Deputy Lemass made a few slighting references.</P>
      <P>We have come to the country now at the end of this hard, tough year with something to show and some hope for the country, and above all with this hope for the country&mdash;that Fianna Fáil will never again inflict themselves as a Government on the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We looked for an alternative to the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Lemass may make slighting references to the speech I made.  That speech was not as full, or as comprehensive, as a plan for long-term economic policy might be, but at least it was a policy, and it was not a policy confined merely to the pages of a booklet or pamphlet.  It was not merely a number of pious platitudes or pious hopes, but it was a policy of definite proposals, and in the <Col N="2519" /> short time that has elapsed since this Parliament reassembled in the autumn of this year, in practically every single case, we have put that policy into concrete shape.  We have passed a Bill through the Dáil to give that incentive to the export trade which is so vitally urgent and necessary in order to remedy our economy.  We have given incentives to industry, to mining, and above all to agriculture, which is so vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>What alternative policy have the Opposition put forward?  We have it from the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that they have no policy.  Where is the policy of Deputy Lemass for spending an additional £90,000,000 to £100,000,000 without recourse to taxation or savings?  Where is that policy that was flourished here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody knows that the Tory finance policy of Deputy MacEntee is opposed to that policy.  We have here, at least, the situation that we have a concrete policy and concrete proposals on which the people can judge and on which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are prepared to be judged, but which will take time to operate.  Against that, we have Deputy Lemass's flamboyant scheme for full employment, for getting £90,000,000 to £100,000,000, which if put into operation, would cause the greatest inflation that any country ever heard of, and the greatest unemployment that ever afflicted any Government.  But, of course, it got no further than the pamphlet.  Knowing Deputy Lemass, it is the type of thing that we are accustomed to hear from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come here now, having done our duty and able to show the result of what we have done, and able to show <Col N="2520" /> that we can at least see the light.  I do not say to the people that we have a cure for every ill, or that we have cured all the ills, but what I do assert is that we have reached the point where we can plan for that expansion which is vitally necessary if we are to get out of our financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>We started out on three lines of policy early in this year when it became apparent that the country was faced with serious economic and financial troubles.  Our first task was to deal with the imbalance of payments, to tackle that as everybody knows now, by means of the levies.  Those proposals, I repeat, got unanimous support from this House.  Those were the first measures we had to take. Those measures were necessary when it became evident in the early part of this year, that immediate steps had to be taken to halt the deterioration in the balance of payments and to prevent the development of a situation that would defeat all our hopes of economic advancement in the future.</P>
    <P>Those measures were brought in in March and, when the March measures were deemed not sufficiently strong, we strengthened them further by the measures we brought in in July.  They aimed at securing the stability which is so essential as the basis of our economic and financial programme. Time and again we made it clear that the first essential was to cut down expenditure on the import of nonessential goods.  That had to be done at once and we made it clear that our immediate problem was to deal with the imbalance of international payments. Before anything else was done, that had to be done.  Equally, we made it clear that the steps we took were of a temporary nature and that the remedies that were applied at that time were merely palliatives and were not of such a kind as to produce permanent solutions of our financial and economic problems.  What had to be done had to be done at once and it was done.  We knew that the measures then taken were unpopular and unfortunately would cause some unemployment.  We had to face that, but we had to face it because we knew it was necessary in the national <Col N="2521" /> interest to face it, and we did it for that reason and we are very glad now to be able to say that those measures have achieved quite a degree of success.</P>
    <P>I should give the House some particulars of the measure of success that has attended our efforts in that respect. Our troubles arose because we were bringing in too much goods and exporting too little.  Deputy Lemass this morning suggested in the course of his speech that any improvement that has been effected in our balance of international payments has been due to the restrictive measures that were taken.  I want to give the House and the country this encouraging intelligence&mdash;that since the 1st April this year we have an encouraging increase in our exports.  I do not for a moment say that the increase in our exports is sufficient.  It will require very arduous effort, on the part of our farmers particularly, and also on the part of our industrialists, to secure the further expansion of exports which is vitally necessary and essentially urgent.  But at least we are entitled to take courage and encouragement from the fact that since the 1st April of this year there has been an improvement of more than £3,000,000 in our exports. That is, as I say, not enough but at least it is encouraging and is a trend in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Exports were £1,000,000 greater in the second quarter of 1956 than in the corresponding quarter of 1955.  They were also £1,000,000 up in the third quarter of 1956 over the corresponding quarter of 1955.  We have just this afternoon received the November figures.  Again, we are glad to say they are even still more encouraging.  The November figures are £1.1 million up in this one month over the corresponding month of November last year.</P>
    <P>That does not exhaust the whole story.  It merely shows the improvement in our exports.  The most recent figures for our November exports and imports show an improvement.  In November, 1956, our imports were £13.8 million in value, showing a reduction of £4.7 million on the corresponding month of November last year.  Exports were £10.5 million, <Col N="2522" /> showing an increase of £1.1 million on November, 1955.  The import excess was only £3.3 million in November, 1956, thereby showing a reduction of £5.8 million over November, 1955.</P>
    <P>Deputies and the country will recollect that the first two months of this year were very unfavourable months, but taking those bad months into account, and comparing the 11 months January to November 1956 with the same eleven months of 1955, the trade deficit shows a reduction of £18.9 million.  The improvement since the end of February 1956, is £25,000,000. If we take the period from July onwards, when the Government measures were having full effect, in the five months to the end of November of this year the trade deficit had been reduced by £17.7 million compared with 1955 and by £2.5 million compared with 1954.  That is something which at least gives us encouragement.  It shows that the measures we had the courage to take have been successful&mdash;measures, in the taking of which and in the carrying out of which, so far from getting any help from the Opposition we got nothing but efforts to sabotage, not the interests of this Government, which do not matter, but the vital interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind that our savings have improved&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;savings&rdquo; I include our bank deposits and small savings.  When we take these developments into account &mdash;the growing and encouraging improvement in our adverse trade balance and the increase in our savings&mdash; we can say that they are the base on which we are entitled to plan for economic expansion which is the only permanent remedy for the economic problems of the country.  We may have our credit difficulties, our high taxation and our levies in the interests of the country.  These may be, and were unavoidable in the short term. However, what is vitally necessary for permanent improvement is production through savings, and that is the policy on which this Government stands and will work.  It will require the co-operation of all sections of the community and every effort that can be made by every person of goodwill in every walk of life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2523" /> It may be that the working people, represented by the Labour Party, will have to exercise restraint in regard to wages, as they have in the past few months when they might have acted to the contrary.  It will involve a tremendous effort by our farmers to produce more for export.  It will also require a very big effort by our industrialists to produce more for export.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and his colleagues sneered at the policy for production which we produced on the 5th October of this year, because we proposed to set up councils and consultative committees. I am proud to be able to say I had a part in the setting up of those committees.  We believe that this country cannot prosper without co-operation and consultation between the Government and all sections of the people.  We believe the farmers will give better service, and will understand the problems that face any Government which is trying to deal with agricultural matters, if they are brought into consultation and if their advice is taken and if, above all, they are made to feel they are taking part in a great enterprise, something which is building up the nation and which is for their own good as well.  That is the philosophy behind the setting up of the Agricultural Production Council and the Industrial Advisory Council&mdash;to consult the people most vitally interested, to get from the people who know the problems, who are skilled in the tasks they have to fulfil daily, advice on the way to deal with these matters and to enable them to hear from the Government, or from spokesmen on behalf of the Government, the difficulties that face a Government in dealing with the problems, and thus to find some solution of the problems that face both industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil had done their job in the 18 years during which they were in office, if instead of neglecting agriculture, they had built up the agricultural industry as they now say it should be built up, if they had spent their effiorts in that direction as they did in other matters, if they had faced the fact that the economy and the finances of this <Col N="2524" /> country must rest on the solid basis of a prosperous and developed agricultural industry, then we would not have had to face this year or in any other year the imbalance of our international payments. But, of course, everybody knows that Deputy Lemass rode roughshod over the agricultural interests when he was there in office for 18 years.  We have done our job.  We can face this country knowing that we have had the hardest task any Government have had to face.  We have done our duty by the country and we will continue to do it.  We have had to face a hard road but we now see the light ahead and the hope of building upon what has been achieved in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have no illusions that everything is grand.  We have every reason to believe that there are formidable tasks facing us&mdash;tasks that would certainly appal even the most experienced administrators with long traditions of government.  We know that we have to face these tasks even now, notwithstanding all that we have done in the past but we know that we have a policy in which we believe.  We have a country in which we have faith and a people who, we think, when they get the proper lead from us&mdash;as they are getting it&mdash;will respond to the efforts that are necessary to bring this country out of the condition into which it was brought by Fianna Fáil. We believe we have done a hard, and a thankless but a necessary job.  We face the future not with any degree of complacency but knowing that we have even more formidable difficulties to overcome than we had before.  We are going to do that job in our own time and, when we have done it and when we have had time to bring our policy into operation, we shall face the country with confidence knowing that Fianna Fáil will never disgrace these benches here again.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement consisting of two tables, the first of which gives for 1938-1956 the average weekly earnings in a week in October (September for 1955 and 1956) for all industrial workers in industries producing transportable goods.  The second table shows the annual averages of the minimum weekly rates of wages of permanent male agricultural labourers without free house or allowance of any kind in each of the years 1938 to date. In the case of industrial workers it is not possible to give separately the averages in the Dublin area.  In the case of agricultural workers separate particulars are shown for the Dublin districts.</P>
