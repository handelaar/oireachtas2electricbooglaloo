    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have given consideration to the serious demographic position revealed by the recent census, and what immediate steps it is proposed to take to arrest the trends disclosed therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to say that the volume of net emigration in the period 1951 to 1956, as indicated in the Preliminary Report of the Census of Population, 1956, is a matter of grave concern to the Government, as it is to Dáil Éireann and to the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The problem of emigration is a long-term one, to solve which only long-term remedies can be effective.  As was stated in the Majority Report of the Commission on Emigration and other Population Problems (paragraph 470),</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Almost all the influences which determine population growth are matters which properly depend upon personal decisions, and with regard to them, the role of the Government should be to encourage and, where necessary, to initiate economic and social activities which produce conditions favourable to increased population, leaving people free to take their decisions in the light of these conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been, and will continue to be, the Government's policy to &ldquo;produce conditions favourable to increased population&rdquo;.  We will vigorously press forward the implementation of our <Col N="464" /> policy of promoting an expanding economy, higher levels of agricultural and industrial production&mdash;with an increasing surplus available for disposal at competitive prices abroad&mdash; and better living conditions at home. It is by these methods that we can secure the means whereby a growing population can be maintained in comfort and in economic security.</P>
    <P>As was stated by the Minister for Finance in this House on the 13th March, 1956 (columns 326-7):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must concentrate on the efficient production of goods.  That has been, is and will be, the primary aim and object of this Government, for, without it, there cannot be any hope of making our country prosperous, of increasing employment or of securing a permanent increase in the standard of living of all our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that statements similar to that outlined by the Taoiseach have been made to this House from the year 1948 onwards and that, in spite of that, the rate of net emigration has stepped up considerably? Therefore, since no measures taken by the Government have even helped to stem emigration, is it not reasonable to suggest to the Taoiseach that a new dynamic programme be put into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that it is easy to say that a new dynamic programme should be put into operation; it is another matter to find such a programme and put it into operation.  It will be generally agreed, I think, that the only real, permanent solution for the problem of emigration is a greatly accelerated increase in output, both agricultural and industrial.  That must be the primary aim of all measures taken; otherwise, they are just futile and picking at the problem.  In the view of myself and my colleagues, the real aim of all measures taken must be directed towards increasing production. Increased production can give an increased standard of living and it is the standard of living in places abroad that is attracting our people.  Until we get a standard of <Col N="465" /> living comparable with that obtainable abroad, we will not be able to keep our people at home.  Increased economic activity founded on increased savings, directed towards increased investment in the country and producing increased productivity and an increase in goods will enable increased incomes and an increased standard of living to be obtained for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the greatest rate of emigration is from the West of Ireland and would the Taoiseach say where, in recent years, Government policy has shown any proof or any sign that it has a bearing on the solution of the problem of emigration in the western areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, would the Taoiseach say if the visit paid by the Tánaiste to the U.S.A. was also designed to introduce the economic measures of which he spoke and to get increased production and prosperity in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Answering the last Deputy's supplementary question first, I think the aim of the Tánaiste in his visit to America was to secure the necessary capital for investment in this country in order to increase production which is so essential if we are to deal with emigration.  That is in line with the general policy on increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McQuillan's supplementary question on the measures taken by the Government in the West, I think both the last Government and the present Government have been endeavouring as far as possible to concentrate on the problems of the West, with a view to keeping the people there.  Again, it is a question of the standard of living of our people, some of whom are able to earn a fairly substantial wage in the West but who will go away because of a personal desire that people have to improve their standards.  But until we are able to get an increased standard of living by increased agricultural production and increased economic activity in the West we shall never be <Col N="466" /> able to do anything more than scratch the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that both the present Government and previous Governments have so far, despite their efforts, failed to deal successfully with the problem of increased production and increased employment, would the Taoiseach consider the advisability of formulating an agreed long-term economic development programme in order to deal with this question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, appreciate the fact that we would be perfectly willing to consider any such suggestion.  I think he has already made that suggestion and I think he will admit we have already agreed to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of 1947 and 1955 the estimated national income, and the estimated percentage of such income paid in local and central taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan) Denis J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated national income in respect of 1947 was £297.1 million.  The corresponding figure in respect of 1955 is not yet available, but for the year 1954 the estimate was £448,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total taxation (both direct and indirect) by all public authorities in the years 1947-48 and 1954-55 was £69.3 million and £114,000,000 respectively. Expressed as a ratio to national <Col N="467" /> income total taxation amounted to 23.3 per cent. in 1947 and 25.4 per cent. in 1954.</P>
    <P>It may be mentioned that to consider fully the relationship of taxation to the various aggregates of income and expenditure used in national income statistics, account should also be taken of subsidies and of transfer payments (e.g. old age pensions, children's allowances, etc.) from public authorities to persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the measures taken in connection with publicity designed to attract to alternative services passengers who fail to obtain accommodation on the Dún Laoghaire/ Holyhead route during the forthcoming tourist season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to a somewhat similar question by Deputy Coogan on the 8th May.  I have since been informed that British Railways are this season drawing particular attention to the Fishguard services as an alternative for travellers who cannot be accommodated on the Holyhead/Dún Laoghaire route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that throughout Britain there are notices up in railway stations and other places advertising the Rosslare, Waterford and Cork routes in the same way as the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route is advertised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say in what way the company which runs the services have decided to advertise them. I explained in my reply on 8th May that a number of proposals designed to improve facilities for passenger transport across the Channel had been considered and the policy designed was one to attract passengers to alternative services, that is, those passengers who fail to obtain accommodation on the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route.  I know that the railway company concerned is calling the attention of <Col N="468" /> travellers, who cannot be accommodated on the Holyhead/Dún Laoghaire route, to the fact that there is an alternative route available from Rosslare to Fishguard.  What their advertising arrangements are in Great Britain I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it should be possible for the Minister to indicate whether or not there is any publicity? If a person wants to travel to Ireland and he cannot get accommodation on the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route, surely it is not suggested that it is publicity to tell that person there is an alternative route?  I suggest there should be some publicity given to the other routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not misunderstand what I have said.  I know that people, when they apply for tickets, have been told of these alternative routes.  In addition to that I have been told by the British Transport Commission, by no less a person than the chairman of that commission, that one of their methods of providing increased facilities for passengers between the two countries is publicity designed to attract such passengers to alternative services.  I cannot say where exactly they advertise these facilities; neither can I say what the method is.  In any case, I think that must be left to the British Transport Commission, over which I have no control; but they will be made aware of, and are, I believe, alive to the necessity of publicising alternative services to relieve pressure on the Holyhead/Dún Laoghaire route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said but it seems to me we have been waiting a great number of years for British Railways to give publicity to routes other than the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route.  Would the Minister not consider making more explicit inquiries as to what the position is, because I am rather doubtful about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that since discussions took place with British Railways we passed through the pressure on transport last Christmas <Col N="469" /> from the point of view of passengers and no one failed to get through in one direction or the other.  Since then we have passed through the Easter pressure on transport and, from the point of view of passengers, no one failed to get through.  I set out the alternative arrangements in reply to a question on 8th May.  Apparently, that reply was either not clearly understood or examined in detail.  From that point of view, perhaps the Chair will now permit me to repeat the reply given then:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The British Transport Commission have... indicated that they have taken a number of measures to improve the cross-Channel services. These measures include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  An increased number of extra sailings on both the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead and Rosslare/ Fishguard routes during July and August.  On the former route there will be 25 extra sailings inwards and 24 outwards during these months.  On the latter route there will be four extra inward sailings and one outwards.</P>
      <P>(b)  Increased accommodation for third-class passengers.</P>
      <P>(c)  A 20 per cent. reduction in fares in mid-week from 1st May to mid-September.  This inducement was introduced last year, but this season it has come into operation six weeks earlier.</P>
      <P>(d)  Increased allocations of sailing tickets to London, Birmingham and Manchester offices.  Previously these tickets have been based mainly at Holyhead.</P>
      <P>(e)  Publicity designed to attract to alternative services passengers who fail to obtain accommodation on the Dún Laoghaire/Holyhead route.</P>
      <P>I hope that these arrangements may result in improved services this year and I have asked An Bord Fáilte to keep this matter under close review.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far, there has been no failure by any person that I know of to obtain <Col N="470" /> transport.  Certainly no complaint has reached my Department of anybody failing to secure the required transport. The matter is being kept under observation both by my Department and by An Bord Fáilte.  We have come through the Christmas period and the Easter period, when only some of these arrangements were in operation, and there has been no failure to provide the necessary transport.  Now, do not let us look for difficulties that are not there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he is forgetting that there is also another alternative route, namely, the City of Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is an alternative service between Fishguard and Waterford.  Nothing is done about this service.  It is not advertised nor is anything done to publicise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether primary school children in Dublin receive regular traffic drill, specifically organised either by the teachers or the Garda Síochána and whether the scheme includes Glasnevin, Finglas and the adjoining areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the resumption of normal motor traffic in November, 1945, members of the Garda Síochána visited schools throughout the State, including Dublin City and gave lectures on road safety to the children.  As far as Dublin City was concerned that arrangement was discontinued in September, 1947, due I understand to the fact that the Garda authorities, owing to a shortage of personnel and a considerable increase in traffic and other duties, were unable to allocate any members to continue these lectures. It was felt also that, as the Gardaí had given the initial series of lectures, the school authorities including the teachers would be able to continue the talks in the course of their ordinary school work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to keeping the matter of road safety constantly before the minds of the children a variety of <Col N="471" /> measures have been adopted by my Department in recent years in cooperation with the Safety First Association of Ireland.  Posters prepared by that association have been issued to, and have been prominently displayed in the schools.  Short talks on traffic dangers are regularly given by the teachers before the pupils are dismissed and where there is a considerable element of danger the children are trained to leave the school premises in an orderly manner and a teacher usually accompanies them to the school gate or exit.</P>
    <P>In the case of the newly developed area of Finglas, Glasnevin, the majority of the children&mdash;about 1,300 in number&mdash;are being conveyed in C.I.E. buses to suitable schools in the old city area pending the provision of new schools and the completion of those in course of erection in their own locality. Specific loading points for the outward journey have been designated and the queuing up and loading of the children is supervised by officers of the transport company.  On the return journey the teachers or the school authorities accompany the children to the loading point in the vicinity of the school.</P>
    <P>As regards the schools in the Finglas district itself, I understand that the Gardaí in that district, which is outside the metropolitan area, occasionally visit these schools and give talks on road safety to the children therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that home-produced raspberries were left unsold, he will state why permission was given for the importation in 1955 of 712 cwt. of raspberry pulp from the United Kingdom, 1,710 cwt. from the Netherlands and 1,188 cwt. from Canada; whether he is aware that, because of the uneconomic price being paid for Irish raspberries, fruit growers are going out of business, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences for the importation of raspberry pulp were not issued until notification was received in my Department from the Irish National Fruit Growers' Association that all home-grown soft fruit available from the 1955 crop had been purchased by the jam manufacturers.  The <Col N="477" /> raspberry crop last year was very much below average and import licences were issued for such quantities of raspberry pulp as were needed to meet home requirements until the 1956 crop would become available.  Since 1953 prices for soft fruit have been settled by direct negotiation between representatives of the growers' association and the jam manufacturers and I am not aware that growers are going out of the business because of the price agreed upon for raspberries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. James Tully Mr. James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, not alone last year but over the last number of years, a much higher price has been paid for foreign pulp than was paid for Irish raspberries? Is he also aware that because the jam manufacturers in this country are controlled by a ring they are preventing the fruit growers from getting a decent price for their crop with the result that those fruit growers are definitely going out of business?  Will the Minister consider setting up some machinery by which an official of his Department can assist in the fixing of the price of fruit and so prevent this ring from forcing a very low price on the Irish producers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that his objectives and mine are substantially identical but handsome is as handsome does.  Therefore, I would direct his attention to the fact that the price agreed for raspberries in 1954 was £93 6s. 8d. per ton; the price agreed in 1955 was £98 per ton; the price agreed in 1956 was £107 6s. 8d. per ton&mdash;not an inconsiderable contribution towards the expansion of horticultural production in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that even this year's price is at least 3d. per lb. under the price which was paid for foreign pulp, even Canadian pulp, for which I presume Canadian dollars had to be made available and on which freight had to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly I am not so aware, but I do think it is relevant to observe that the prices increased by <Col N="478" /> £14 10s. per ton to the current year. However, I shall look into the matter referred to by the Deputy.  I am not aware that more is being paid for foreign pulp.  I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind that, whatever is being paid for imported pulp, they are allowed to bring in no pulp until they have purchased all available Irish raspberries at that price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the advertisements announcing increased postal charges have been grossly inadequate and that there is widespread dissatisfaction because of the number of surcharged items circulating through the postal system, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the publicity given to the increase in postage rates was inadequate, or that the amount of surcharging was abnormal for a period immediately following a change in postage rates.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive statement setting out the revised rates, which came into effect on the 4th June, was released to the Press including the provincial Press on the 9th May.  News bulletins from Radio Éireann that night quoted the new rates.  The daily newspapers of the following day, 10th May, gave prominence to the change and quoted the new rates and the date from which they took effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A change in postage rates and charges inevitably results in some underpayment of postage until the public has become accustomed to the new rates; this does not, of course, apply to items such as parcels and <Col N="480" /> registered packets which have to be handed to a Post Office official.  A special notice, in postcard form, quoting the revised rate for printed papers, was delivered in the business areas of Dublin and main provincial cities during the week preceding the 4th June.  Announcements on the radio, emphasising the new rates for printed matter, i.e., printed papers and newspapers, were made on Sunday, 3rd June, Monday, 4th June, Tuesday, 5th June and Thursday, 7th June.  Six-inch two-column advertisements were inserted in the two Sunday newspapers of the 3rd June and in the three Dublin and the Cork daily newspapers of Monday, 4th June.  These advertisements, which bore an effective pictorial design, stressed the most important aspect of the changes as far as underpayment of postage is concerned, namely that the minimum postage on printed matter was 2d. This was supplemented by news items in the Sunday papers of the 3rd June and in the daily papers of the 4th June.</P>
    <P>On and from the 4th June, all Post Offices displayed a notice showing the revised inland postal rates.</P>
    <P>The extent of underpayment of postage, which resulted in surcharging, was, in the case of printed papers, in no way abnormal for the occasion of a change in postage rates and adjusted itself very rapidly.  The number of printed papers surcharged in the first three days, 4th, 5th and 6th June was about 5 per cent. of the total number of printed papers posted.  This figure dropped very substantially in the next three days and the position was back to the ordinary level by the end of the first week.  Underpayment on other postal items, the postage on which had been increased, was insignificant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last increase in the rates of unemployment benefit was effective from 3rd July, 1952.  Between mid-May, 1952, and mid-May, 1956, the consumer price index increased by 16.5 per cent.  The implementation of the new rates of unemployment benefit will increase the present rates as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>25 per cent. for single man or woman and for married man and wife;</P>
      <P>23.3 per cent. for married man, wife and one child;</P>
      <P>22 per cent. for married man, wife and two children;</P>
      <P>22.6 per cent. for married man and one child;</P>
      <P>21.1 per cent. for married man and two children.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that the rates of unemployment benefit payable since July, 1952, are those which were proposed in the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, and between mid-May, 1951, and mid-May, 1956, the Consumer Price Index rose by 23 per cent.</P>

As regards the remainder of the Deputy's question, I have to say that the savings promotion work carried out by the committee up to the present is directed to the country as a whole, <Col N="484" /> and has been mainly general in character, aimed at inducing individuals to save while leaving them free to choose among the various facilities for savings which are available.</P>
      <P>Inquiries concerning the establishment of savings groups have been received from a number of firms and explanatory literature has been issued.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking in this debate on this Estimate on Thursday last, I was endeavouring to give a summary or sketch of the work of this Department for some years past in the area with which the Vote deals.  I said that some 20 years ago I took my courage in my hands in an endeavour to get something effective done to resuscitate these areas which I then considered were in process of rapid decline.  Since then no substantial progress has been made with regard to the matter with which the Vote deals.  For the past 20 years, I have watched the rapid decline which would ultimately result in the entire depopulation of certain areas involved in this Vote.  I am exceedingly sorry that I have to state to-day, without fear of contradiction, that unfortunately that forecast has been borne out.  That is a real tragedy, to my mind.  During that period we had each year on the appropriate Estimate a plethora of speeches in this House and in the country, appealing particularly to the people of the Gaeltacht to preserve the Irish language, telling them that the fate of the Irish language and Ireland as a nation depended upon the preservation of these areas and on the use of the Irish language by the people therein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is elementary that, from the beginning, this problem was, is and will continue to be an economic one. <Col N="505" /> I have no doubt about that.  In my opinion, the failure of the economic development of these areas has brought about the position in which we find ourselves to-day.</P>
    <P>In this debate speeches have been made by Deputies from whom I expected a greater sense of responsibility. They are coming into the House now on the issue of a new census return.  Speaking as if something extraordinary had happened in this country overnight they try, apparently, to use that for political purposes.  This should not be a political problem.  It is a problem for this House, for everybody in this House and particularly for the people who come from and were born in these areas, whose people have lived there for centuries.</P>
    <P>I shall not be here in 25 years' time, I expect, in the normal operations of nature, but I definitely forecast that within that time there will be entire areas and entire parishes in the area covered by this Vote in which there will not be a human being.  These are areas where our people have been since the time of the Plantation and the time of the clearances in this country. Our people have been there for 200 and 300 years.  Very many people in this House have their roots in those areas.  They were reared there; their fathers and their grandfathers were reared there.  We love every boghole in them, every piece of reclaimed land. They were part of our lives.  They were embedded in our bones.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy to see hundreds of the homes in these areas closed up.  The people have left them and it is probable that these homes will never be reoccupied. When I look at them I think of the verse:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;&ldquo; Deserted is my own good hall.</P>
    <P>The hearth is desolate.</P>
    <P>Wild weeds are gathering on the wall,</P>
    <P>My dog howls at the gate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Within the last 20 years, some 50 homes in my native parish have been abandoned and have been closed down. Imagine the effect in a normal parish of, say, 600 families, of some 50 or 60 <Col N="506" /> homes being closed down for ever. That is a continuing process which will in time produce the condition of affairs that I have already described. Nothing practical has been done to deal with this problem.  There has been talk, talk, and talk; there have been speeches, speeches, and speeches.  The problem to be solved is an economic problem.  Preserve the people and you preserve the language.  We did not preserve the people and accordingly we lost the language.  The solution consists in solving the economic problem.  This House will not be 100 years older when there will be no problem to solve.  I am emphasising the economic side of the problem, since it is the only side with which we are faced.  If we solve the economic problem, we will solve the whole thing.</P>
    <P>There will be nobody left but old people in the Gaeltacht areas and people who will never get married.  The result will be that the language will die.  We set up a Department to do something and we have done something. What is required is industrial development and there is no industry in these places other than the fishing industry.  I am glad to say that an effort has been made to push matters in that respect.  I hope that this trend will be energetically pursued, and when I say &ldquo;energetically,&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;energetically&rdquo; in its ordinary connotation.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to place in at least every two parishes a factory of some kind which will give employment to the young people when they leave school.  What is the use talking about doing this, that and the other thing, while we leave the young people whistling at the cross-roads, with no money in their pockets to buy clothes, to go to the pictures or to attend a sports meeting?  There is no use in sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that is not the situation. Deputies come in here and talk about the situation revealed in the census. What is the census but a return of the actual existing state of affairs, and where have those Deputies been living all the time?  Did they not see what was taking place in their own constituencies? The whole thing is nothing but claptrap, an effort to get their <Col N="507" /> speeches published in the local papers, while all the time the matter they complain of is getting worse.  Something will have to be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, the Gaeltacht Department set up a factory.  It is an excellent factory and is doing well, but the tragedy is that it is purely local.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be fuller development in this connection.  Other factories should be opened somewhere else in the Gaeltacht areas in order to give employment and provide a weekly pay-packet for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Even to-day there is on the Order Paper&mdash;it is the first question on the Order Paper&mdash;a question by Deputy McQuillan: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach whether the Government have given consideration to the serious demographic position revealed by the recent census.&rdquo;  Expressions like &ldquo;The serious demographic position&rdquo; would make one mad.  I want to boil down the problem. It is nothing but an economic one.</P>
    <P>In this connection, this Department is now passing from the Minister's hands.  This House and the areas involved will expect a lot from the new Minister, General Mulcahy, who is the Minister-designate for the new Department which is about to be set up.  We all know the idealism, the enthusiasm and the energy of Deputy Mulcahy, but the House should appreciate that he is now undertaking one of the most serious problems of his life.  The House should not expect too much of him.  It will be a long and arduous road.  Industries should be placed in different areas and two or three parishes combined so that the people living in these areas will have easy access to the factories.  As I said, let us not expect too much of the Minister.  Let it not be thought that, with his idealism and enthusiasm, he can produce the rabbit out of the hat overnight.  That cannot be done.</P>

Tá cónaí ormsa sa Ghaeltacht agus tá a fhios agam gur oibrigh na hoifigigh seo go cruaigh, agus rinneadar rudaí maithe mar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus muna bhfuil rudaí chomh maith agus ba mhaith linn iad a bheith, ní ar na hoifigigh atá an locht.</P>
      <P>Rinneadh cuid mhaith oibre úsáid-each agus éifeachtach ansin le cúig bliana fichead anuas.  Is fíor le rá go bhfuil rudaí níos fearr sa Ghaeltacht inniu ná mar a bhí siad san aimsir sin.  Le 20 bliain anuas, nó mar sin, do rinne gach Rialtas gach aon rud do b'fhéidir leo don Ghaeltacht agus chun caoi níos fearr a thabhairt do na daoine sna ceantair chúnga ann.  Mar sin féin, tá mórán le déanamh fós má táimid chun na daoine óga a choimeád sna ceantair sin.  Bliain i ndiaidh bliana, tá siad ag imeacht agus tá níos mó díobh ag imeacht anois, agus le cupla bliain, ná mar d'imigh ag aon am le 100 bliain.  Mura bhfaighaimid cabhair gasta ón Rialtas, ní fada go dtí nach mbeidh sa Ghaeltacht ach sean-daoine.</P>
      <P>Thug Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta cibé cabhair do b'fhéidir leo ach ní leor é sin. Tchí gach aon duine inniu a chuireas suim sa pháirt sin den tír gur gá go ndéanfadh an Rialtas i bhfad níos mó don Ghaeltacht agus do na ceantair chúnga ann chun na daoine óga sna ceantair sin a choimeád iontu.  Is í an Ghaeltacht an chuid sin den tír a choimeád an teanga náisiúnta beo chomh maith le nósanna an phobail Ghaelaigh.  Ceapaim, agus dúirt mé an méid seo cheana, nach mór d'aon Rialtas a dhian-dícheall a dhéanamh chun cabhair a thabhairt don chuid sin den tír.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be brief on this very important Estimate.  The only reason I <Col N="509" /> intervene is that as this may be the last occasion on which we may get an opportunity for speaking on this Estimate for Gaeltacht Services I, too, should like to express my appreciation of the work done by the officials in that part of the country during the past 20 or 25 years.  As I have already said, if the position in the Gaeltacht areas to-day is not all we should like it to be, it certainly is not the fault of the officials of the Gaeltacht Services.  They have laboured hard and long all down through the years to build up our little industries there and to make the lot of the people in the Gaeltacht much better than they found it.  Much has been done.  Every Government that we have had in this country during the past 30 years has certainly improved the lot of the people in the Gaeltacht and the congested areas there.  We have to-day, thanks to the generous Government grants that have been given in the past, the best houses, I would say, to be found in any part of rural Ireland.  This has brought about a great change in the Gaeltacht.  It has also helped the development of the tourist industry in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>Our native manufacturers have been helped in every way and to-day we find that the famous Donegal homespun industry is known from one end of the earth, I might say, to the other.  The fashion centres of the world to-day are clamouring for the lovely tweeds that are turned out in such perfection under the aegis of the officials of Gaeltacht Services.</P>
    <P>We are glad to hear from the Minister that our toy industry is flourishing also.  We hope it will continue to flourish.  All these things have helped, even in a small way, to keep our people at home.  However, sufficient has not yet been done because to-day the trek from the Gaeltacht and the congested areas there continues apace. The young people are leaving daily. In some parts of the Gaeltacht our schools, if they are not closing down, are dispensing with the services of one or two teachers.  That is an appalling condition.  Is it not sad that, after so many years of native Government, we <Col N="510" /> have to say these things in this House about one of the areas that should be the dearest possession of the nation, that is, the Gaeltacht area?  We hope that something will be done very shortly to help the economic position of that area.</P>
    <P>I would say that, if the Gaeltacht is to be saved, it will call for a much bolder policy than has been embarked upon in the past.  Time is running short and to-morrow may be too late. I would appeal to the Minister and, through him to the Government, to take immediate steps to save the Gaeltacht for the nation before it is too late.</P>

      <P>Nílim den tuairim go bhfuil leas na Gaeltachta ag braith ar an Rannóg seo, chor ar bith. Aontaím leis an moladh a thug an Teachta Ua Breisleáin d'oifigigh Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta as ucht an méid a rinneadar agus an méid atá á dhéanamh acu le leas na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Mar sin féin, ní dóigh liom gur ceart nó gur chóir nó gur fairaílte d'oifigigh Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag braith ar na seirbhísí sin amháin.</P>
      <P>Is é mo thuairim féin agus, ar ndoigh is é tuairim gach duine sa Ghaeltacht san Iarthair, pé scéal é, gurb iad seirbhísí na Roinne Leasa Shoisialaigh is fearr a dhéanas leas don Ghaeltacht.  Tá mé féin, ag cheapadh nuair a tugadh cuid acu, ar aon chaoi, isteach sa Dáil seo 20 bliain ó shoin, go raibh an Ghaeltacht agus na ceantracha bochta in aigne an Rialtais chomh mór is a bhí na cathracha móra.  Mara bhfuil an Ghaeltacht bánaithe ar fad, agus má tá aon Ghaeltacht ann, is é mo thuairim gurb iad seirbhísí na Roinne Leasa Shoisialaigh is ciontach leis sin.</P>

Ansin chualamar Aire Stáit eile ag rá ar Mheastacháin Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta nach raibh <Col N="511" /> sa tuairim sin ach amadántacht.  Im thuairim, is féidir linn leas áirithe a dhéanamh don Fhíor-Ghaeltacht trí thalmhaíocht ach má tá an Ghaeltacht ag braith ar thalmhaíocht tá mé ag cheapadh gur fánach a bheith ag fánúint le feabhas a theacht as.</P>

Bhí mé ag léamh i bpáipear nuaíochta inné tuarascáil ar chaint a rinneadh nuair a hosclaíodh Feis i lár na tíre.  Bhí an cainteóir ag cur síos ar an olagón faoi mheath na Gaeilge agus dúirt nach raibh staid na Gaeilge ag déanamh imní dho.  Ní hé an rud céanna é leas na teanga Gaeilge agus leas na Gaeltachta ach, ar ndóigh, tá baint eatorthu. Le cupla bliain anuas, tá saghas reabhlóid ar siúl ins an Ghaeltacht, eaglaisí agus séipéil agus tithe scoile a dtógaint agus cé go bhfuil sé fíor go bhfuil imirce tréan gach bliain 'ta daoine óga ag éirghe aníos níos treise ná sin agus tá blath ar an nGaeltácht thar mar shileanns daoine.</P>
    <P>Má fhiafraitear díom cé acu de na seirbhísí go léir atá ag déanamh an maitheas is mó don Ghaeltacht, cuirfhidh mé san gcéad áit an t-oideachas. Ina dhiaidh sin, tiocfaidh seirbhísí sóisialacha agus cuirfidh mé talmhaíocht agus iascaireacht san tríú áit. Maidir le talmhaíocht, muna bhfuilimid sásta dul chun cinn le scéimeanna mar na tithe gloinne, níl fágtha ach féarach na sléibhte.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a dúras maidir le seirbhísí Gaeltachta, ba mbaith liom taca a thabhairt don méid adúirt an Teachta Ua Breisleáin mar gheall ar an maitheas a dheanann oifigigh na hOifige sin.  Is minic a chluinim daoine, go mór mhór Teachtaí, ag déanamh compráid idir an obair a déantar amhlaidh agus an obair a dhéanfadh <i>private enterprise.</i> Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon chothrom ins an gcompráid sin.  Do bhí daoine ar an dtaobh seo den tigh á rá seachtain ó shoin&mdash;agus daoine ar an dtaobh eile&mdash;gur fearr a stiúródh gnólucht phríobháideach na seirbhísí seo.  Tá an méid sin ceart go leor chomh fada agus a théann an ráiteas sin ach dá gcuirfí na dualgaisí céanna ar na daoine príobháideacha, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh an rath céanna ag <Col N="512" /> baint leo agus a bhaineann le seirbhísí faoin Stát.  Dar ndóigh ba mhaith liom, más féidir é, na tionscail bheaga go léir a bheith fé chúram daoine príobháideacha. Ba mhaith liom rud ar bith a bheith fé <i>private enterprise,</i> in ionad faoin Stát, ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir le héinne dul isteach in Inis Bóifin, cuir i gcás, nó Litir Muláin chun ceann de na tionscail seo do chur ar bun agus dul i gcomórtas le gnath-tráchtáil na tíre.  Sin é an deifir.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar sin, ní bheadh éinne dhá cheapadh go mbeadh cuntas seirbhíse mar sin ar an dul céanna leis an saghas cuntais a bheadh ar fáil ó tionscail suite i lár na tíre nó anseo in Áth Cliath, ach tá locht le fáil agam ar an mbealach inár tugadh an Meastachán seo ós comhair na Dála.  Do léigh an tAire ráiteas amach ar dtús ach ní fhuaramar formhór an ráitis sin go dtí go raibh an díospóireacht fé lan tseol.  Ba cheart go mbeadh ráiteas den tsaghas sin againn roimh ré san slí céanna ina bhfaighimid <i>explanatory statement</i> nuair a tugtar Bille nua isteach ag cur síos ar cad a bhíonn sa mBille sin.  Ba mhaith linn an fhaisnéis a bheith againn roimh ré, cuir i gcás ar cé mhéid oibritheoirí atá fostaithe ag cniotáil, ar bhréidín, agus ar bhréagáin agus uile. D'fhéadfaimís dul níos faide agus cuntas d'fháil ar na ceantracha in a bhfuil siad scapaithe.  Sin rud amháin.  Ba cheart go mbeadh faisnéis againn ar an díolachán ar an margadh in Éirinn agus san gCoigcrich chomh maith.  Ba mhaith an rud é an fhaisnéis sin a bheith againn más féidir leis an Oifig é do sholáthar i dtreo is go bhféadfaimis cur síos ar na rudaí sin nuair a bhéadh an Meastachán seo ós ár gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Níl fhios agam an é polasaí na Roinne Tailte, maidir leis na tionscail seo, polasaí réigiúntach, cuir i gcás an bréidín do choimeád i dTir Chonaill, bréagáin do choimeád in áiteacha eile agus an cniotáil in áiteacha eile fós.</P>
    <P>Más é sin an polasaí atá ann ní féidir locht a fháil air, ach san am chéanna tá mé ag cheapadh gur cheart tionscal an bhréidín a scaipeadh níos mó ar fuaid an Iarthair.  Ar ndóigh tá mé ag caint anois ar mo dháilcheantar. Ba mhaith liom aithbheocaint tionscail bhréidín láimh-fhite a bhunú.  Níl a fhios agam an féidir tionscal bréidín <Col N="513" /> lámh-shníofa a bhunú mar tá nós acu san Iarthair a gcuid snáith a chur go dtí na monarchain i nGaillimh.  Tá na fiódóirí ag éirí gann san Iarthair anois. Nílim a rá go bhfuil siad imithe ar fad, ach tá siad ag éirí gann.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire breathnú isteach sa bpoinnte seo&mdash;an féidir tionscal an bréidín a scaipeadh go Gaillimh Thiar.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, tá rudaí eile nach bhfuil faoi chúraim na Seirbhísí seo agus b'fhéidir go bhféadfaí iad a thabhairt anall faoi na Seirbhísí seo.  Tá mé ag cuimhniú anois ar phroiseasú na muiríní.  Tá tionscal eile, tá sé i gCill Chiaráin, ag deanamh obair ar shlata mara.  Nuair atá an obair déanta ar na slata seo cuirtear thar sáile iad go hAlbain le rudaí éagsúla a dhéanamh leo. Deirtear gur &ldquo;secret trade&rdquo; atá san obair sin agus nach féidir é a dhéanamh anseo faoi láthair.  Tá freagra agam ar sin.  Is é an freagra atá ann go bhfuil dream againn anseo ar a nglaoitear <i>Industrial Research.</i>  Níl fhios agam ar cuireadh an cheist seo ós a gcomhair. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire i ndon rud éigin a rá faoi sin nuair a bheas sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht; b'fhéidir go mbeadh sé i ndon a rá cén dul chun chinn atá déanta ag an dream sin.  Más rud é nach bhfuil tada déanta faoin gceist seo, b'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé ós a gcomhairé. Rud maith a bheith ann dá mba i gCill Chiaráin atá i gceart lár na Gaeltachta, áit a bhfuil na muiríní go sár fairsing a déanfaí an obair ar fad ar na slata mara.</P>
    <P>B'fhacthas dom, agus mé ag smaoiniú ar an gceist seo, go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mb'féidir proiseasú na muiríní a dhéanamh i gCill Chiaráin in ionad iad a thabhairt go Gaillimh chun an obair sin a dhéanamh orthu. Cuirtear na sliogáin go Gaillimh chomh maith leis na héisc iad féin.  Sin pointe amháin, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Talmhaíochta féachaint an féidir an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ag caint ar thionscal an bhréidín, agus ba mhaith liom anois traoslú agus comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh le hoifigigh na Roinne i dtaobh an fheabhais atá tagtha sa <Col N="514" /> bhfostaíocht sa tionscail sin le cúig bhliana anuas.  In ionad céad fice is cúig, tá 238 daoine fostuí sa tionscal sin anois.  Tá an pháigh ardaithe ó £22,300 go £55,690 sa tréimhse chéanna agus tá díolacháin an bhréidín imithe ó £107,800 go £250,600.  Creidiúnt mór é sin go lucht stiúrtha Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  Ba mhaith linn níos mó den fheabhas sin a fheiceál.</P>
    <P>Sin é an fáth go raibh mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire an tionscal sin a scaipeadh leasmuigh de Thir Chonaill, cé nach mór linn an rath atá acu ansin i bhfostaíocht agus in airgead.  Tá mé lán-chinnte nach mór dóibh i nDún na nGall dá mbeadh an tionscal bhréidín scaipthe go ceanntracha Gaeltachta eile.</P>
    <P>Ní fhéadaim an Meastacháin seo a ligean tharam gan tagairt a dhéanamh do cheist na dtithe.  Duírt mé anuraidh, agus mé ag caint ar an Meastachán céanna, go raibh caint acu i gComhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe go gcuirfear stop leis na deontais bhreis-foilíontacha. D'iarr mé féin agus Teachtaí eile ar an taobh seo den Teach ar an Aire níos mó airgid a sholáthar faoin tSeirbhís seo.  Dúirt an tAire an t-am sin&mdash;agus tá mé a cheapadh go raibh a lán den fhírinne aige,&mdash;go raibh sé fógraithe ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe go raibh orthú stop a chur le tithe nua a chur suas sa nGaeltacht.  Ach tá níos mó airgid soláthraithe faoin scéim seo i mbliana.  Táim lán-chinnte gur chuir go leor daoine a bhí ag braeth ar thithe nua a dhéanamh deis orthu féin ar fhaitíos na bhfaitíos nach mbeadh aon deontas le fáil agus táim cinnte chomh maith de bhárr on bíobhocha a rinneamar gur chuidíomar go mór leis an scéal a réiteach, agus má chuireamar scannradh ar dhaoine, fiú amháin ar an Aire féin, b'fhuí toradh an scannraidh sin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Meastachán le haghaidh Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng ar siúl seachtain ó shoin, bhí caint ag Aire eile, agus, ós rud é go bhfuil sé ina Theachta Dála do Dháilcheantar a bhfuil Fíor-Ghaeltacht mhór ann, táim a cheapadh gur ceart a chuid tuairimí ar an gceist seo, tithe sa bhFíor Ghaeltacht, a lua <Col N="515" /> ar an Meastachán seo.  Is é atá i gceist agam an tAire Rialtais Aitiúil. Duirt sé, agus é ag caint ar Mheastachán Oifig na Gaeltachta agus na gCeantar gCúng, ag colún 1744, Imleabhar 157, de na Diospóireachta Parlaiminte den 7 Meitheamh 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is true some effort was made by Fianna Fáil to give the people of the Gaeltacht better houses under the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts.  But how were those Acts administered? First of all, to qualify for a grant for a new house, an Irish speaker had to undertake to demolish the house in which he was residing. If the son or daughter of that man wanted to get married and take advantage of the Acts, they could not do it because they did not own a house of their own which they could demolish.  As a result of that kind of administration, the people were driven out; they were cleared out of the Gaeltacht areas.  The Acts should have been amended to permit any Irish speaker to take advantage of the grants to build a home for himself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Agus derimse tuille den chinéal céanna. Leanann an tAire:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the same time, under the 1933 Land Act, Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht were prohibited from giving a parcel of land as a site for a house to their sons or daughters, simply because it was decided by Fianna Fáil that these holdings were uneconomic and should not be subdivided. Every person who got married in the Gaeltacht had to provide or buy a new house, or else get out.  Let me assure the House that, if you amalgamated 20 of these holdings in the Gaeltacht, you would not make an economic holding out of them.  In fact, if you amalgamated the whole Gaeltacht, you still would not have an economic holding.  A considerable amount of damage to the Gaeltacht was done under the Gaeltacht (Housing) Acts and under the Land Act of 1933.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Cá bhfuilimid anois?  Tá an tAire atá i bfeighil na seirbhísí seo sa Teach seo, an tAire Tailte, ag oibriú polasaí i <Col N="516" /> dtaobh cúngacht talún sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus sna ceantracha iartharacha ar fad, agus chun críocha an pholasaí sin tá cosc ag an Aire mar Aire Tailte ar an darna teach a bheith ar aon gabháltas amháin.  Tá cuid mhaith céille agus reasúin leis an bpolasaí sin.  Anois tagann Aire eile as an Rialtas céanna agus ar cheist atá gar don Mheastachán seo, Meastachán Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta, tá polasaí contráilte ar fad dá oibriú aige.  Ba cheart don bheirt aca agus don Rialtas polasaí a shocrú agus cuspóir a aimsiú faoin gceist seo ionas nach mbeidh dhá Aire san Teach seo ag bréagnú a chéile in a thaobh.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil díograsóirí na Gaeilge ar fud na tíre ag iarraidh bailtí beaga Gaeilge a bhunú san iarthar.  Tá siad ag ceapadh nó ag ligean orthu féin go bhfuil siad a cheapadh gur ag bánú na Gaeltachta atámuid nuair nach ligimid do dhaoine an darna teach a dhéanamh ar aon ghabháltas amháin.  Mar atá a fhios ag an Aire Rialtais Aitiúil ós rud é go dtagann sé as Gaeltacht i dTír Chonail, tá i bhfad níos mó ná dhá cheann agus in áiteacha, go mhór mhór thiar i gConamara, cur i gcás, tá suas le chúig theach ar ghabháltas amháin agus is í an cheist is achrannaí agus is casta dá bhfuil le reiteach ag na coimisinéairaí talún. Is fusa go leor dul isteach ar ghabháltas nach bhfuil aon tiononta air agus é a roinnt ach nuair a thagas siad ar gabháltais a bhfuil an oiread sin tionóntaí air tá a fbios acu chomh casta is atá an scéal.  Ba cheart don Aire Tailte ceist a chur ar a chomh-Aire agus gan a bheith ag caint mar shórt Delphic Oracle.  Sílim go raibh a theanga in a phlúc aige nuair a bhí sé ag caint an lá faoi dheireadh. Ceapaim go bhfuil chuile dhuine sa Teach seo, go mór mhór daoine a bhfuil cead cainte acu san iarthar, ar aonfhocal faoin gceist seo.</P>
    <P>Is é atá titim amach san Iarthair, go mór mór i gConamara, go bhfuil siad ag dul amach ar an gcimin agus go bhfuil siad ag tógáil botháin ansin, nach bhfuil deontas ar bith le fáil ina dtaobh agus go bhfuil siad ag cur fúthu ansin&mdash;mac tionónta ag pósadh iníon tionónta eile.  Ní bheadh <Col N="517" /> fonn ar cheachtar de na tuismitheoirí iad a choic.  Cruthaíonn sé sin fírinne dár dhúirt mé nuair a bhí mé ag cur ceann ar an gcaint seo, gurab iad na seirbhísí leasa shóisialaigh is mó a dhéanas leas do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Sin é an cruthunas is mó, go bhfuil cuid de na daoine óga sásta socrú síos agus muirín a thógáil air agus marach na leasa sósialaigh ní fhéadfaidís pósadh ar aon chor.</P>
    <P>Tá mír amháin anseo mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó, sin é, Mír G. Má tá cuid ar bith den &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo; ag baint le aon chuid den Mheastacháin seo, beidh sé le fáil i Mír G&mdash;(1) Loans for purchase of machines and equipment for rural industries; (2) Loans for purchase and repair of turf boats; (3) Loans for purchase of boats, carts and draught animals for use in connection with marine products industries; (4) Loans for purchase of boats for Transport Services; (6) Miscellaneous Loans. Ní fheicim thíos ansan ach bhóta samplach&mdash;£5&mdash;do chuile ceann acu sin.  B'fhéidir go mbreathnódh an tAire isteach i gcuid acu seo.  Cuir i gcás (2)&mdash;Loans for purchase and repair of turf boats.  Tá mé a cheapadh go bhfuil gá leis an tseirbhís sin a chur i bhfeidhm agus iasachtaí a chur ar fáil i gConamara.  Deirtear liom go bhfuil an méid bád atá ann le móin iompar ó Ghaillimh ag éirí gann agus fágann sé sin go mbeidh ábhar tine gann ar mhuintir an oileáin agus, ar ndóigh, tá go leor &ldquo;lorries&rdquo; ag teacht isteach anois i gConamara agus iad i gcomórtas le lucht na mbád. Ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfaí an oiread cúnaimh do na daoine a bhfuil bád acu agus a theastuíonn deasú uathu a thabhairt dóibh agus iasachtaí a thabhairt do dhaoine nach bhfuil bád ar bith acu ach a bhfuil fúthu ceann a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Maidir le (3), ní dóigh liom go bhféadfainn cás mór a dhéanamh faoi ach maidir le uimhir (1), tá mé a cheapadh go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach&mdash;Loans for purchase of machines and equipment for rural industries.  Baineann sé sin go dlúth le tionscal an fíodóireachta agus tionscal na cniotála.  Tá cailíní agus, ar ndóigh, mná pósta a bhíodh ag obair <Col N="518" /> sna hionaid chniotala sul ar phósadar, a b'féidir a chur ag obair ina dtithe féin.  Ar ndóigh, d'fhéadfaí go leor a dhéanamh le teacht isteach an teallaigh a mhéadú ar an tslí sin, áit a bhfuil cailín stuama ann.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil a thuilleadh le rá agam ach d'fhéadfadh duine labhairt go leor rudaí sa Mheastachán seo. Is leor a rá go bhfuilimid, tríd is tríd, sásta go bhfuil a ndicheall dá dhéanamh ag lucht stiúrtha Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil, dá bharr, leas muintir na Fíor-Ghaeltachta dá dhéanamh acu agus mar sin, is leasc liom tagairt a dhéanamh do phointe amháin a ndearna mé tagairt dó anuraidh.  B'fhacthas dom nár thaithnigh sé le oifigigh agus lucht stiúrtha na hOifige é a lua anseo i nDáil Éireann ach, ar ndóigh, ní le locht a fháil orthu nó lena seirbhísí nó stiúradh na seirbhísí a cháineadh a rinne mé tagairt dó, agus sin é, méadú a fheiceáil ar an chuid den chaitheamh airgid seo. Tá sé gaibhte suas £6,000 ó anuraidh. Tá an Meastachán le h-aghaidh rural industries gaibhte suas £20,000.  Ní chuirfidh mé síos a thuilleadh air sin ach is leor, tá mé ceapadh, a mheabhrú do na daoine, ar fónamh, atá ag stiúradh na seirbhísí&mdash;is leor rud ar bith a thaispeáint dóibh, chun go ndéanfaidh siad a ndicheall chun é leigheas. Ní dóigh liom gur ceart locht a fháil orthu ar an ngnáth-chaoi.  Má fuaramar locht, má b'fhacthas dóibh go raibh mé ag fáil loicht orthu, bídís cinnte gur mise an duine deireannach sa Teach a gheobhadh locht ar sheirbhísí atá chomh maith agus chomh fiúntach le na seirbhísí seo.</P>
    <P>Caithidh mé, ar ndóigh, cuidiú, freisin, leis an Teachta Ó Breisleáin sa méid adúirt sé faoi chomh córtasach agus chomh oibligáideach atá na h-oifigí seo nuair a chuireas duine isteach orthu faoi rud ar bith.  Bail ó Dhia orthu agus ar an obair atá ar lámha acu.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>This branch of our services has in the course of this debate been referred to by the Minister, in reply to some Deputy or other, as being a social service and not a business enterprise.  Whether it is a social service or a business enterprise, <Col N="519" /> surely it must either extend or fail&mdash;not remain static.  If it is a social service, there must be, if there is to be that element of justice blended with equity in the administration of this service, principles upon which the service is worked and principles the application of which must be general and not reserved for operation in favour of certain individuals or certain sections.</P>
      <P>This is a service which, whether it be on a business plane or whether it be a social service, is for the benefit of the community and which must, if it is to follow suit at all from its title, be something that not alone, is expected to but should, foster the development of the language.  The Gaeltacht housing services are operated from this section, and while I fully appreciate that the provisions of the Housing Act of 1929, in the award of these grants, were to a very great extent fluid and discretionary and, at the same time, that the Act of 1934 did tighten up and restrict the type of person to whom grants would be allocated, there is still, in my opinion, a discretion residing in the Minister on the allocation of such grants.</P>
      <P>As I recently had to say in another place life, happiness and the comfort of families are not to be found in the absolute application of Acts of Parliament or to be found in balance sheets. Progress will be found in all aspects of life and, not alone in Gaeltacht Services, by an approach that has some temper of humanity in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of housing services I want to refer to a particular instance of which I have personal knowledge, which personal knowledge and interest give me an opportunity to refer to it here.  I am told in relation to a certain application to Gaeltacht Services for a housing grant that because the man of the house does not happen to have Irish, though the woman of the house and their ten children have Irish, they are still precluded from obtaining a grant. The examination conducted on such a high and searching plane by the people responsible for the allocation of grants <Col N="520" /> can tell me that while the woman of the house has Irish she has not got practice in it.</P>
    <P>They go on then to a rather startling explanation with regard to the Irish of the children.  They say in regard to the children: &ldquo;Níl ach Gaeilge na scoile ag na bpáistí.&rdquo;  The Irish which those children are learning is being taught to them by two teachers who are from a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area, whose language from the cradle has been Irish and the language that they impart to the children concerned is the language of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>What is the difference between the language of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Gaeilge na scoile?  By virtue of what particular specialised learning are officials of Gaeltacht Services enabled to make a distinction between the Irish taught by a native Irish speaker in charge of a school in the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and in an area scheduled under the 1929 Act, and Gaeilge na scoile?</P>
    <P>If that is the way in which it is proposed to further the interests of the language I do not see much hope for it.  Is an application of this kind to be turned down because it is determined on the highest possible plane of examination that, while the woman of the house has Irish, she has not practised it?  All that, apparently, can be decided by a cursory visit to the house. Is it to be decided in the same cursory manner that there is some clear distinction between the Irish taught by a native Irish speaker who is a qualified national teacher and Gaeilge na scoile?  When officials of this Department go back to re-examine this matter, and spend considerable time and public money on re-examining it, what business it is of theirs, in their queries with regard to housing needs and the Irish language to make a specific inquiry as to whether I have been recently in that village and that house?</P>
    <P>I will pursue this matter both inside and outside the House until justice at least is done and no sour taste is left in the mouths of little children who live in parlous conditions in a house which is almost falling down, just because their Irish is only Gaeilge na scoile though they have learned it from <Col N="521" /> a native speaker and from their mother.</P>
    <P>It has been my privilege in the course of the last few years to make representations on behalf of the people I represent with a view to an extension of the services rendered by this Department in certain areas of my constituency. I have been told that the placing of machines for knitwear in houses would not pay; that increasing the number of machines already in the recognised centres would not pay.  Now, if this is a purely social service, one must be prepared to lose.  If it is not a business enterprise, then I agree with the Deputy who has said that it could not pay, but, if it is a social service, then there must be some expansion, even at the risk of its not paying.</P>
    <P>In two areas in my constituency, in Blacksod and Corclough, north-west of Belmullet, two sets of excellent buildings&mdash;lighthouse dwellings&mdash;are on the market.  I happen to know that the centre in Belmullet is at the moment overcrowded.  I have been led to believe that it is proposed to build a new centre there.  That was the information I was given when I made inquiries recently.  I was recommending an extension of the Bellmullet industry out in the Corclough direction. There is a building now available there at a reasonable price and I should like the Minister to give full consideration to the matter.  In Blacksod, there is the same type of building available at an equally reasonable price.  If the Minister is serious about extending this business, or making this social service fully effective, there are two areas in which he can extend it at a very slight capital cost.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Bartley, I do not think the administrative cost of Gaeltacht Services is justified by the results achieved.  Neither am I satisfied that the method by which the work is done, the method by which the goods are marketed, the method by which the workers' difficulties are handled, are the correct methods.  My view is that headquarters is not alone out of touch with the needs of the community which they are supposed to <Col N="522" /> serve, but they no longer care, so long as a skeleton service is continued, and a not very well articulated skeleton at that.  Having regard to my own observation and experience, it is not without reason that I come in here to criticise the workings of this branch of the Department of Lands.  I do not think anybody can accuse me of ever having criticised the workings of any Department of State up to this&mdash;in fact, I have always given full credit&mdash;but in this case I am forced, as a result of observation and experience and particular knowledge, not alone of the administration of Gaeltacht Services, but of its handlings of matters of a more complicated nature, to the conclusion that this branch is, as I have said, not alone out of touch but no longer cares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the people I represent in South Kerry, I ask the Minister to consider the position of the Ballinskelligs Fíor-Ghaeltacht district, in an effort to find out whether or not something can be done towards the development of some little industry in that area.  Ballinskelligs is the only Fíor-Ghaeltacht district in South Kerry.  There are in it buildings vacated by the British Government and still in the possession of this State.  I understand the Board of Works holds them.  These buildings would be very suitable for small industries in that area.  Down the years, we have been urging different Governments to do something by way of developing some little industry in the Ballinskelligs area.  Now that a new Ministry is being established for the Gaeltacht, I think it is opportune to raise the matter on this Estimate, so that the Minister can take some steps towards the setting up of some industry there when the new Ministry comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter to which I wish to refer is that of Gaeltacht housing.  Down our way, certain applicants have a grievance.  Time and again, they have been turned down because all the members of the family are not Irish speakers.  Indeed, we had a case recently where all the family, with the exception of one were Irish speakers; a grant was refused on that <Col N="523" /> ground.  Whilst not suggesting that exceptions should be made, I think the matter should be reconsidered.  I know that a speaking knowledge of Irish is, as a matter of principle, an essential qualification: Irish must be spoken and practised in the home. That has been laid down in legislation. Nevertheless, I think it is somewhat invidious to debar people who are urgently in need of housing, simply because one member of the family does not have a fluent speaking knowledge of Irish.  I urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude in that regard. We will be very grateful if anything can be done, because this problem has come up time and again in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this Estimate has been most constructive and most helpful.  I was glad of the note struck by many Deputies who congratulated the officials of Gaeltacht Services on the work they have done throughout the years, particularly when it is now the intention that Gaeltacht Services will become merged in the new Gaeltacht Ministry about to be set up.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the officials of the section on the work they have done all down through the years.  There is a good deal yet to be done and, while it is a fact that there is a flight from the land in the Gaeltacht areas, I do not think that the fault can be laid to the door of this particular body of officials.  I hold that they have done a good job of work; I shall give a brief outline of it to show the work they have been doing.  If anybody has been at fault it was not the officials; rather was it the fault of the House itself because of the fact that legislation was not passed or ideas put into operation to help to stop the flight from the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back to the beginning, the work of what is now known as the Gaeltacht Services began with the Congested Districts Board many years ago.  That work took the form of small cottage industries, handicrafts, beekeeping and better means of production <Col N="524" /> on the land.  Some aspects of that are being attempted to-day on a much improved scale by the various county committees of agriculture. That work went ahead up to the first World War.  Certain aspects of the work being done, particularly the handwoven tweed industry, experienced a boom during the years of the first World War and, just as surely, it experienced a catastrophic depression in the years immediately following.</P>
    <P>It was during those years immediately following the first World War that this House was set up and the country got its independence.  In those years, the depression had hit the Gaeltacht Services, or what has since become known as Gaeltacht Services, with the result that the total output of tweeds towards the end of the year 1930 had dropped to £30,000.  It was then that the Government established a Gaeltacht Commission of Inquiry and one of the first results of that was the Gaeltacht Housing Act of 1929.  The commission also recommended that, where possible, the few weavers who had the tradition left to them should be put to work and the tweed industry expanded.  From the figures I shall give, it will be quite clear that the officials of the Gaeltacht Services have certainly done the work well.  I am not exaggerating when I say that when the Gaeltacht Commission of Inquiry was sitting in 1926, 1927 and 1928 there were not more than a dozen real traditional weavers left in the country. There were two or three in Galway, two or three in Mayo and half a dozen in Donegal.  The others had emigrated or had taken up other means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>In 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1932, the Government got to work and put the industry on its feet with the result that the tweed industry alone has given a very satisfactory return.  About 1930 or 1931, unfortunately I have not got accurate figures with me, the sales of tweed amounted to about £10,000 a year.  That amount has grown steadily down through the years to quite a remarkable extent.  Not alone has there been that significant expansion but the trade has changed so much that the <Col N="525" /> homespun tweed is now a very small proportion of the output of the service. Instead, there is a tweed of first class quality millspun and handwoven commanding a ready sale in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and as far away as Italy and Spain.  In all these countries it enjoys a very high reputation.</P>
    <P>This year the total sales of tweed amounted to £250,675.  The total sales of machine knitwear, hand knitwear and gloves amounted to £130,648 and the total sales of toys, shopping bags and various other small things amounted to £68,163.  The total sales were nearly £500,000 this year as compared with £30,000 in 1928 or 1929. Some Deputies seem to be under the impression that there was a recession in the amount of work done and that there was no improvement.  On the contrary, there has been a very steady and heartening improvement, particularly in tweed, all down through the years.  Since 1948 the amount paid in wages increased from £8,315 to £55,690 and the number employed from 141 to 238 in the same period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was anxious for information with regard to new machinery in the Kilcar factory.  It might not be out of place to mention that machinery to the value of £70,000 has been installed.  The machinery bought and installed last year includes a Spenstead wool blending system costing £2,680; a cloth raising machine costing £2,592; a new fancy twisting machine, costing £2,204; a loose wool dyeing machine, costing £1,948; an extension to wool drying machine at £1,400; a piece scouring machine, costing £767; a piece shearing machine, costing £753; a piece rolling machine, at £125; two Universal winding machines, at £120 and a Flake motion, attached to carding machine, at £131.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig might like to know that, in that regard, the machinery installed during the years replaces to a great extent the second-hand machinery which was the only type available in 1943 when that mill at Kilcar was first turned over to spinning and all the processes of wool-cleaning, <Col N="526" /> such as scouring, drying, carding, dyeing and everything that happens to the raw fleece until it becomes the finished yarn that goes out to the weavers.  New machinery to be bought during the coming year includes a rapid bobbin winder at £850; a Knop-dyeing machine at £740; an electric examining machine, at £600; a piece doubling frame, at £550; a cloth-brushing machine, at £450; a pattern-cutting machine, at £300; a truck at £180, and 25 looms, at £1,380.  The total amount involved is £5,050.  That, I think, will make the Kilcar factory one of the most modern, not alone in County Donegal but in the whole country.</P>
    <P>Marketing was mentioned by some Deputies.  I want to say that, on the sales side, a complete network of sales organisation was set up at home and in many countries abroad, notably the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland, West Germany, France and Great Britain.  Resident agents have been appointed in these countries and competent selling agents also operate on the home market.  Their efforts are supported by judicious advertising and promotion of special displays at international fairs such as Frankfurt, Hanover, Munich, Toronto and New York.</P>
    <P>This sales campaign has yielded remarkable results.  Ten years ago, in 1945-46, sales of tweed were £64,000. By 1952-53 they had virtually doubled at £110,502.  Last year, 1955-56, they had more than doubled again and realised just £250,000.  And of this £250,000, £125,000, or half, was sold on export markets.  This hand-woven tweed produced over 100,000 dollars last year.  I think that is a very good record for the tweed section of the Department.</P>
    <P>Knitwear has shown a fairly spectacular expansion.  It is not quite as spectacular perhaps as that which tweed has shown, but nevertheless sales have been maintained at between £120,000 and £130,000 per year, and steady employment has been given to about 300 girls.  In addition, some 600 to 700 are being given a most useful source of additional income from part-time work.  The wages bill in the <Col N="527" /> knitwear industry has risen from £38,761 in 1945-46 to £52,058 in 1955-56.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages bill has risen from £38,000 in 1945-46 to £52,000. There is no doubt about that.  Deputy McQuillan will probably be able to convert that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a question on the marketing?  Supposing a business man here in Dublin, through his business connections in America, is in a position to sell a large amount of tweed, will he be allowed to carry on direct negotiations with the Department, or must the business transaction be carried out through the accredited agent in New York?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be carried on through our accredited agent in New York.  It is obvious you could not have a system whereby everybody could ask for this, that or the other thing.  The agent is only too glad to effect any sales and to help out in any way.  Such a person would get every help and facility from that agent, just as much as if he came here and dealt directly with headquarters.</P>
      <P>In connection with housing, I have some figures in regard to the number of houses that have been built.  Deputy Derrig asked for the actual number in each county.  I have the figures from the commencement giving the numbers down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal, 897 new houses built, 1,051 reconstructed, total amount of grants paid, £191,000; Mayo, 727 new houses, 292 reconstructed, total amount of grants paid, £103,000; Galway, 1,172 new houses built, 514 reconstructed, total amount of grants paid, £196,000; Clare, 46 new houses built, 24 reconstructed, total amount of grants paid, £5,700; Kerry, 1,344 new houses, 983 reconstructed, total amount of grants paid, £245,000&mdash;incidentally, the highest for all the congested counties; Cork, 342 new houses, 612 reconstructed, total grants paid, £71,000; Waterford, 144 new houses, 109 reconstructed, and total amount of grants paid, £19,600. <Col N="528" /> Altogether, the housing section of Gaeltacht Services built 4,672 new houses, reconstructed 3,585 and the total amount of grants paid was £832,358.  Loans in respect of the same houses were advanced to a total of £203,082.  I think that the fact that, since the 1929 Act was passed, 4,672 new houses were built, together with 3,585 reconstructed and almost £1,000,000 in grants has certainly contributed very much to the improvement of housing conditions in the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>From the little travels I have had abroad, I believe that the new houses in these areas compare more than favourably with similar houses in other countries I have seen.  They compare favourably with Scotland and some other countries as well.  While some Deputies might think they are not up to the mark, I hold that they are a good, substantial, snug house.  They are not too large.  It is not too difficult or too costly to keep them heated, and nowadays, since water and sanitation and electricity supplies have become available, they compare more than favourably with similar houses in other countries&mdash;countries which have not perhaps the same urgent housing need as we have in this country.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies&mdash;I think Deputy Bartley, Deputy Lindsay and Deputy Brennan&mdash;mentioned that the question of Irish is being taken too seriously by the officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to leave me out of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy mentioned that and also the fact that houses will not be given except to replace the old ones.  The Deputy mentioned that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Bartley's mind on that aspect of housing and I am all with him, because I doubt the wisdom of the statutory condition which prevents the Minister for Lands making a grant available in the Gaeltacht except to replace an existing house.  That restriction was <Col N="529" /> put there for a very obvious reason, and, no doubt, a good reason, but there are times when I doubt the wisdom of it.  I doubt it when I see the flight from the land, and I ask myself, when I see somebody leaving the Gaeltacht who might have settled down and built a house there, but for that restriction, if the restriction is having the effect of adding more people to the flight from the land which we all deplore so much.  I am all the way with Deputy Bartley in that.</P>
      <P>To come back to the case of Irish, it is definitely laid down that Irish must be the spoken language of the home.  That is a statutory condition. I think Deputy Lindsay mentioned that the Minister had discretion.  The Minister has no discretion when the statute lays down very clearly that such and such conditions or qualifications must apply.  The Minister has no discretion in that case.  It may come as a surprise to those Deputies who criticise the officials of the Department that, if the officials err at all, they err on the side of leniency.  In every case where it could possibly be done, the grant is made available to these people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lindsay in particular had one case in mind.  He seems to think, because he had an interest in it, that that is the reason the person was denied the grant.  That is an exaggeration. In fact, it is more.  I think it makes a charge against the officials that is not founded in fact.  The truth of the matter is that the housing inspector carries out an investigation to find out exactly the type of house that is going to be built, what the plans are, and so on.  So long as it is laid down as a statutory condition in the Housing Acts, he must be satisfied that Irish is the spoken language as otherwise he would be leaving himself open to a lot of trouble.  He must be satisfied that Irish is the spoken language.  The Housing Act says so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It does not leave any discretion to the Minister or the <Col N="530" /> officials.  Every single one of us comes up against borderline cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector makes his inquiries.  He has the terms of the Act before him and he must furnish a report.  If he furnished a report to the effect that the family had not Irish, he would be leaving himself open to disciplinary action and possible dismissal.  It would be serious to deny some poor family the benefits of the Act passed for their benefit.  If the inspector worded the report in such a way as to deny that person the grant, it would be very serious.  I can assure the Deputy that such an inspector would get short shrift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I know the case the Deputy has in mind.  Since he brought the matter to my notice, I have asked for a more careful investigation to ascertain whether the inspector overlooked anything.  If there is any doubt, the benefit of it will go in favour of the applicant for the grant.  I can assure the Deputy of that.  I meet several such cases.  I can own constituency and Deputies come to me with borderline cases.  I can assure Deputy Lindsay and the other Deputies from the Gaeltacht areas that their cases will be carefully scrutinised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another useful branch in which there has been very pleasing expansion is the branch which has come to be known as the marine products section.  Inquiries in this connection started in 1947.  I will give the figures in regard to the tonnage and the amount paid to gatherers and Deputies will see the expansion for themselves.  In 1947-48, 2,514 tons of searods were purchased at a cost of £8,913; in 1948-49, 2,801 tons were purchased at a cost of £11,372; in 1949-50, 3,296 tons were purchased and the amount paid was £15,392; in 1950-51, the amount purchased was 2,558 tons and the amount paid <Col N="531" /> £12,155; in 1951-52, 3,338 tons and the amount paid was £16,678; in 1952-53, the tonnage dropped to 1,518 and the amount paid was £7,048; in 1953-54, the tonnage was 1,557 and £7,630 was paid to gatherers; in 1954-55, the tonnage was 1,034 and the amount paid was £5,106; in 1955-56, 2,716 tons were purchased and the amount paid was £14,890.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wonder why the same amount of searods has not been gathered and paid for each year.  It all depends upon the weather and the storms which root up that type of seaweed from its hold on the rocks and on the floor of the ocean to throw it upon the shore.  The fluctuations are due to the type of autumn which is experienced and which influences the particular harvest for gatherers.  Last year, the weight of searods had jumped to almost the highest figure ever, 2,716 tons.  That is due to the weather more than to anything else.</P>
    <P>Another useful branch which has only been started is concerned with carrageen.  In 1953-54, 14½ tons were collected and purchased from gatherers. Last year, there were eight tons and this year there are 143 tons and a total of £10,000 paid to gatherers.  That is an aspect of the work done by Gaeltacht Services which is not adverted to by many Deputies.  If we take £14,890 for searods and £10,000 for carrageen, making a total of almost £25,000 paid to gatherers along the western coast, it can be seen that it forms a very useful source of profit during the idle time to most of the gatherers.  That branch was pushed as hard as possible.</P>
    <P>Every ton of searods that can possibly be secured the Department is only too willing to take.  The price paid in 1947 was £4 10s.  Last year, £5 5s. per ton was paid to the gatherers and this year it will be increased to £5 10s. in order to induce people to take an interest in case any searods may go to waste.  Much of the gathering of searods is done in Galway, Donegal, Mayo and Clare.  It does not extend further south or east than the mouth of the Shannon, but in case searods should be thrown up on the coasts of Limerick, Kerry, West Cork or <Col N="532" /> Waterford, we are inducing people to gather and collect them.  We could easily handle almost double the tonnage that is coming in at the present time.  As a market is guaranteed for that type of seaweed, there is no question at all of being afraid to handle the job.  We could do with much more than we are getting.</P>
    <P>In the matter of housing, searods, tweeds, knitwear and toys, very pleasing expansion has been effected by the Gaeltacht Services officials down through the years.  The record I have given of their work is one to be proud of, and, if there is still a flight from the land in these areas, it is not due to the officials of the Department. They have done their work well.  The number of girls and people employed is increasing yearly.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Brennan of Donegal who seems to think that private enterprise could handle this matter better than Gaeltacht Services. Private enterprise would not be coming to the Exchequer with a loss of £110,000 a year, the loss which the section suffers at the present time. How would that affect the economy? In my opinion, it would affect it by closing down all the scattered industries from Malin Head to Cape Clear at the present time that are so useful and placing them, perhaps, under one or two or three roofs where one supervisor might replace five or ten that we have at present.  There would be no employment in the country districts. It would be one more piece of centralisation that all of us deplore.  I am certain it would mean the withdrawal of the very useful employment that is being given in the outlying backward districts at the present time. There is no other view to take of it. Deputy Brennan seems to think we should hand it over to private industry. I do not agree.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that, except for the sheep that grows the wool, Gaeltacht Services produce every single part of the finished tweed.  If my information is correct, the private industries do not spin the yarn or dye the wool or card it or give the same <Col N="533" /> employment.  They buy the yarn already spun and then proceed to weave it and sell the cloth.  They do not give quarter the employment which Gaeltacht Services give.  I think I am correct in saying that they give it in towns, where there is always a chance of some employment.  They do not give it at the back of God's speed, where the Gaeltacht Services division gives it.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Brennan is doing a very serious disservice to the people of the Gaeltacht by suggesting that these industries should all be gathered under one roof or handed over to private industry.  I do not believe private industry would make half as good a job of it as Gaeltacht Services did.  I am not saying that just because I am the Minister in charge of that Department and I am not saying it just to please the officials.  I want to show my appreciation of what I think is a job of work very well done and better done than by anybody else.</P>
    <P>The total amount of privately produced handwoven tweed in the country at the present time is only half the amount which Gaeltacht Services are producing under greater difficulty. They produce everything but the sheep.  They buy the wool from the farmers.  Then they wash it, scour it, dye it, card it, dip and spin it into yarn.  The yarn goes to the weavers in the cottages or weaving marts.  Gaeltarra Eireann take the tweed and sell it.  As anybody will admit who has been abroad and attended exhibitions at which Gaeltacht tweeds were shown, the quality of the tweed can compare with the best in the world.  That is a revolution in such a short space of time.  We should not forget that, during the war, cloth of any kind was very valuable.  That induced a rapid manufacture and output and, as a result, in some instances the quality suffered.  All that has been completely overhauled and changed.  The quality and the designs of the tweed are as good as you will get in any part of the world.  The fact that we have been deluged with demands for the cloth rather than having to try and push the sales is surely a tribute to its high quality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I want to refer to a matter that is taxing the mind of any serious person in the country, that is, the flight from the land and particularly from the poorer areas.  I think that if I mention another section of the Department of Lands now it will not be out of place. I believe, and I have said it here before, that while Gaeltacht Services, tweeds, toys, knitwear, and the marine products industries are doing a magnificent job of work in their own sphere, something bigger than Gaeltacht Services or than what the new Gaeltacht Department was designed for will have to be brought to bear on these areas if we are to save the remnants of our Irish-speaking people.  I believe that that is the aim of every Deputy and of every decent and broad-minded person.  The Geological Survey tells us that we have little or no minerals, particularly in those areas where the land is poor.  I firmly believe that afforestation is one of the best means of bringing employment on a large scale into those areas. At Question Time to-day, the Taoiseach said that increased production is the key to all this problem. That is very true, but increased production and increased employment go hand in hand.  They are two opposite points in the same circle.  It is the old story of which came first, the hen or the egg.  I submit to the House that, while the Gaeltacht Services people have done a magnificent job of work, nevertheless the new Gaeltacht Ministry should not be asked to assume responsibility for a job that it, in its turn, is surely not fitted to do, namely, to bring employment on the scale which afforestation can into places like the West where the land is poorest.  The flight from the land is greatest from that type of area.  This is the most appropriate Estimate, of the whole 71 Estimates in the Book of Estimates, to speak on this subject.  I know it is engaging the attention of all Deputies.</P>
    <P>Seeing that we have no minerals, such as other countries appear to be blessed with, and that we have nothing under the surface of our land, we can only make the best possible use of the surface of our land.  From that unfortunate <Col N="535" /> surface, the people are flying. The only other way of attracting our people to stay in this country is to push afforestation and make the best possible use of it.  We purchase a lot of foreign timber each year.  Even the youngest of us will scarcely live to see the trees we are planting now come to maturity but if we start now it will give a proper utilisation of the poor land, stabilise a certain population there, give healthy and useful employment and it will help to redress the serious position in the balance of payments, some fine day.  With the rising trend of markets all over the world, it would be only reasonable to expect that the cost of materials which we import will increase rather than diminish.  An adverse trade balance will have the effect of increasing rather than diminishing&mdash;that is, unless we step up our own production here, and afforestation is one of the ways to do that.</P>
    <P>It is unfair of Deputies to criticise the Gaeltacht Services Division for not being better.  I think the figures I have quoted, showing the expansion down the years, are a credit to that Division.  It is the general intention of the Government that the Gaeltacht Services Division should change hands and go over to the new Ministry for the Gaeltacht.  When they are going, we will give them a clap on the back and wish them God speed.  I think the House should thank them very sincerely for the work they have done. If what they have done for the past number of years under the Department of Lands is any indication of what they are capable of doing under the new Ministry then, when this Division comes under the new Ministry, the new Minister for the Gaeltacht will have a very creditable and praiseworthy tale to tell this House this time next year.</P>

      <P>There has not been a lot of research, to be quite truthful about it.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, searods are taken in, dried, <Col N="536" /> ground into meal and sold.  Most of the processing is done according to a secret formula that we do not know anything about.  Approximately 243 tons of carrageen were taken last year and cleaned and dried.  That, in its own way, is very creditable.  There was an experiment last year to fulfil a certain order.  Ascophyllum or bladder weed was manufactured and turned into cattle meal&mdash;roughly 100 tons of it&mdash;but the market for that seems to have petered out.  There is no research worth talking about going on.</P>
      <P>I forgot to mention that Deputy Derrig asked where the new knitting centre in the South would be established. It will be established at Ballingeary, County Cork, and will be opened in a few weeks' time.  It will give employment to about 15 girls when it is opened.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Greyhound Industry Bill, 1955&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16a:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In Section 26, to add to the section the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    <P>( )  on the coming into operation of this Act and pending the making by him of the Order under sub-section (6) of this section the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club.</P>
    <P>( )  On the coming into operation of this Act and pending the making by him of the Order under sub-section (6) of this section the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver and manager to carry on the business of the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited, for the sole benefit and advantage of the club.</P>
    <P>( )  On the coming into operation of this Act and pending the making by him of the Order under sub-section (6) of this section the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver and manager of Powerstown Park Limited, to administer the affairs of the club for the sole benefit and advantage of the club.&mdash;Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am in order, Deputy MacEntee reported progress on this section on the last occasion. As outlined by him, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure, first of all, that between the coming into operation of the Act and the making of the Order by the Minister for an establishment day, the assets, if any assets remain at that time, will be safeguarded for the board, and through the board, for the industry and the people of this country.  The Minister stated, by way of interruption or <Col N="538" /> cutting-in, that there would be no avoidable delay and that eased Deputy MacEntee's mind somewhat.  In my opinion this Bill could be a <i>fait accompli</i> if the Minister had adopted a more reasonable attitude and had agreed to accept some of the amendments which were put before him in no antagonistic spirit.</P>
      <P>To get back to the point of the amendment and Deputy MacEntee's feeling that even, in spite of the Minister's assurance, there may be this delay, I would remind the Minister that Section 9 of this Bill deals with provisions in relation to the appointment, term of office, etc., of ordinary members of the board.  Sub-section (1) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall, before the establishment day, appoint six persons (of whom not less than four shall be members of the Standing Committee of the club) to be ordinary members of the board and the term of office of every person so appointed shall commence on the establishment day, and if any such person dies before the establishment day, he shall be deemed, for the purposes of sub-section (4) of this section, to have died on the establishment day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely that suggests that there will be some delay?  That, as I say, is the main reason for the amendment put down by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
      <P>The first portion of the proposed amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Section 26, to add to the section the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  On the coming into operation of this Act and pending the making by him of the Order under sub-section (6) of this section the Minister shall make an Order appointing an independent qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that if this Bill became law to-morrow morning, I have no doubt that the Minister would turn round on the day after to-morrow and try to declare what the establishment day <Col N="539" /> was going to be.  The Minister should also bear in mind when the establishment day is declared, or an Order made appointing the establishment day, under this Bill or under the Act itself, the club itself will have to reorganise its affairs which will take some considerable time.  In other words, some six to 12 or 18 months could pass.  Eighteen months is an exaggeration, but they will have to reorganise themselves.  Therefore we have the position in which, first of all, this Bill has to become law and then the Minister makes an Order declaring the establishment day.  Then the club has to reorganise its affairs and that is one of the main reasons&mdash;what is going to happen in the interim period &mdash;why Deputy MacEntee wants (a) an independent qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club.</P>
    <P>In my humble opinion, the other sections of the amendments put down by Deputy MacEntee could be considered superfluous.  If the Minister agrees to appoint an independent qualified person as receiver to administer the affairs of the club, I cannot see why we should also need a receiver and manager to carry on the business of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Ltd. and a receiver and manager of Powerstown Park, Ltd.  I maintain that if the Minister did agree to put in an accountant or somebody like that in the interim period to administer the affairs of the club as suggested in the first paragraph of the amendment to Section 26, the other parts of this amendment would be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>One might question the necessity for the amendment and the grounds for the fears that any of these assets of the club might be depleted. At the outset, I wish to say that I have no doubts regarding the present Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club that anything would be done in a dishonest way by such individuals when they meet.  Unfortunately they are not all attending meetings but I do not suggest that even if only certain members turn up, <Col N="540" /> anything dishonest will ensue.  I say that, in the light of previous experience, the Minister should seriously consider taking some steps to protect the future of the industry.  The report of the advisory committee set up to inquire into the industry, of which Deputy A. Barry was a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19, paragraph 109, states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Although the resolution setting up the company directed that the property and assets thereof would be held by trustees of the Irish Coursing Club and by the directors of the company, no trust deed in these terms was executed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The same paragraph of the report states earlier:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1924, the Irish Coursing Club decided to promote, jointly with the secretary of the club, a publication to be known as the <i>Coursing Calendar.</i>  By 1928 this paper was firmly established.  The club then decided by resolution to take complete responsibility for the paper and for this purpose incorporated a company known as the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, of which the share capital of £5,000 was subscribed from the funds of the Irish Coursing Club.  On the formation of the new company the secretary of the club in consideration of certain financial arrangements made with him, agreed to assign to it all his interest in the <i>Coursing Calendar.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the end of the paragraph, the advisory committee have this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We feel satisfied that the directors and shareholders of the company do, in fact, hold the property and assets in trust for the club, but it would seem desirable that the position should be regularised by the reorganised Irish Coursing Club.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a typical example of the slipshod method in which the Irish Coursing Club do their business.</P>

The trust deed has not been executed.  I must disagree with the Minister.  I would like to be very clear on this matter.  In the assignment by the late Mr. T.A. Morris to the Greyhound and Sporting Press, it is stated, <i>inter alia:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The said Thomas A. Morris started, originated and carried on the business of publishing the said <i>Coursing Calendar</i> on his own behalf but handed over, as a voluntary payment, half the profits thereon to the said Irish Coursing Club, and whereas owing to the difficulties in having the printing of the said <i>Coursing Calendar</i> carried out at Clonmel without erecting special printing works, an agreement was entered into between the said Thomas A. Morris and the members of the said Irish Coursing Club that if the Irish Coursing Club would join in forming a company which could erect such works&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The said Thomas A.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of protecting the assets of the club.  That is the important point.  Everybody in the House and throughout the country is aware that the disposal of Powerstown Park, one of the largest assets of the Irish Coursing Club, is in contemplation. If that is rushed through with undue haste, it will be a very serious matter.  In view of this legislation, I think the Minister should make his position clear on the matter, even though I agree he has no power over the club at the present time.  He could certainly communicate with the Irish Coursing Club, expressing his view that no sale of Powerstown Park racecourse should take place.  In case the Minister thinks that either my suggestion or the amendment is frivolous, I should like to quote from a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Irish Coursing Club, held in Jury's Hotel on Tuesday, May 1st, 1956, at 2.30 p.m.  The Standing Committee discussed the question of Powerstown Park, and I quote from the <i>Sporting Press</i> of Thursday, 17th May, 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Arising out of the minutes of the previous meeting re Powerstown Park, Mr. Ahern said it was decided at the meeting in Clonmel to get a valuer to value the land and buildings. The president and himself contacted Mr. Smith, of Smith and Griffin and Co.  They were accepting a 30 guinea fee.  Mr. Smith had given Mr. Ahern copies of the report to-day, which is the valuation of the property.  He had valued the lands separately.  He asked the secretary to read the report.  Mr. A.J. Morris said if he was an interested party they might prefer if he withdrew while they were discussing the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on and indicates that some were for and some were against disclosing the valuation put on it by Mr. Smith of Messrs. Smith Griffin:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The secretary said he had made <Col N="544" /> an offer for renting himself but there was no offer for purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The offer made by the secretary was a rent of £1,200 per year and in the document, circulated to everyone in this House, the Powerstown Park racecourse is valued at £26,000:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When one considers that the present day value of the Greyhound Sporting Press is estimated at £60,000 and of Powerstown Park at about £26,000...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am trying to show that this question of Powerstown Park could be disposed of and the sale completed before this Bill even becomes law.  I agree that at the present time the Minister has absolutely no control over the Irish Coursing Club, but surely through his good offices with the club he could ensure that they will do nothing until this Bill becomes law.  The report goes on further and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The secretary said at the meeting in Clonmel that Mr. Cox asked was there not someone who would offer an overall rent.  Subsequently he offered £1,200 rent and to take over the whole thing&mdash;that is, land and race meetings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be fantastic to give these premises of Powerstown Park racecourse to any individual or body of people for a rent of £1,200 per year. The balance sheet of Powerstown Park is in a sound position.  There is over 168 statute acres and over £12,000 has been spent on it by the Irish Coursing Club themselves.  To agree to a rent of £1,200 per year&mdash;to use Mr. Morris's words &ldquo;to take over the whole thing, land and race meetings&rdquo;&mdash;would be fantastic, and the Minister should step in.  Mr. Morris continued in the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was no final decision as regards whether they would sell or let or what price they would take. The decision was to get an independent valuer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Henehan said if they let or set the premises to Mr. Morris and company with the right to establish a factory at Powerstown Park, he <Col N="545" /> maintained it would injure the amenities and it would be impossible to sell the property afterwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me hark back again to our amendments. There is an area of 168 statute acres and a racecourse showing a good profit down through the years and the figure of £1,200 a year is ridiculous by comparison with their own valuation of £26,000.  Notwithstanding that valuation, the secretary, on his own behalf or that of his associates, offers that small sum.  The Minister knows well that the grazing rights on that 168 statute acres of land would be very considerable.  Then, into the bargain, there is a certain portion of the lands of Powerstown Park which is admirably suited for the manufacture of pottery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy's argument that a receiver should be appointed as an alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole basis of my argument and it is connected with paragraph (c) of Section 16 (1).  The report continues with Mr. Connolly, another member of the Standing Committee, stating that he had been trying to calculate what it was worth and he thought a rent of £1,200 would not justify selling it or leasing it.  Our friend Mr. O'Donoghue was at the meeting and he asked would it be possible to get an expert to examine the present position.  Evidently Mr. Smith of Messrs. Smith Griffin was not expert enough for Mr. Paddy O'Donoghue.  At that meeting there were some other views expressed and Mr. Cox asked would Mr. Morris continue to write the leading article in the <i>Sporting Press.</i>  That concluded the meeting of the Standing Committee of the 1st May.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 2nd May, at 2.30 p.m. the Irish Coursing Club had their meeting at which the secretary stated that there had been no developments in the Greyhound Industry Bill. That was in the opening paragraph of the report of the secretary's remarks. They came then to Powerstown Park and Mr. Rahill said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... for a long time past they had been considering the question of Powerstown Park, which was the property of the Irish Coursing Club. <Col N="546" /> It was not making as much as they would like it to do but if they sold or let it, it would be with the condition that they could still hold the National Coursing Meeting there. They had got a competent firm of valuers to make the valuation as to the value of the property.  The Standing Committee had not decided on anything yet but they would be doing something within the next few months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement by Mr. Rahill was an indication that within the next few months something definite would be done; they would decide either to sell or hold it.  It would be reasonable to assume that by July or August something definite would be done.  Supposing this Bill does not go through in the present session&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Mr. Rahill continued:&mdash;&ldquo;They were not giving away anything to anybody&rdquo;.  He asked for an expression from the members whether it should be let or sold.  The report continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. M. Ennis thought they should be very reluctant to sell the land.  Just take, for example, that they got £20,000 they would get applications from every club in Ireland for some of the spoils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> They would be mad to part with a property like Powerstown Park.  Mr. P. O'Donnell endorsed Mr. M. Ennis's remarks.  The balance sheet of Powerstown Park indicates how the business is moving and it would be worth a lot of money in time to come.  Colonel Kelly asked why did they propose now to sell the property.  Mr. Rahill said they had not decided on anything yet.  Colonel Kelly asked what put the bad thought into anybody's head.  The secretary stated that this had been going on for quite some time&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the bad thought of selling Powerstown Park&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;following the report of the advisory committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The secretary throws the onus for the suggestion of selling Powerstown Park on the advisory committee, which, of course, is incorrect.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They sowed the seeds at one stage.  It was felt by some members that the return from Powerstown Park was so small that some steps should be taken to realise the investment or see if something could be got out of it.</P>
    <P>It was referred to a subcommittee and it reached the stage when they would not take the responsibility.  The views of the committee were divided.  In response to a query if an overall letting was possible, he (the secretary) had offered £1,200 per annum on the understanding that he would be free to erect a factory building there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now we have the position.  I am bringing it to the attention of the Minister and I am sure that after he reads the facts he will accept Deputy MacEntee's amendment.  We now have an offer from the secretary of the Irish Coursing Club to pay £1,200 a year for the use of the lands, the house and permission to erect a factory on 168 statute acres and to run race meetings there and to take all the profit which such race meetings would make.  Even Deputy Barry would agree that that would be a good business proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give my opinions on what these people say now. The secretary went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Other members thought it would be better to put it up for auction and it was decided to get the opinion of the general body of the Irish Coursing Club.  Mr. Whittle thought the members of the club were hardly in a position to give a considered view or give a decision regarding retaining Powerstown Park... Mr. Rahill said the secretary would read the valuer's report if they liked but it was only a guide as to what the value of the property was in case they decided to sell or let it later. Mr. C. Murphy thought the valuer's report should be read.</P>
      <P>The secretary said in reply to a question that the holding was 167 acres and there was a profit from racing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is on the records of the House once and for all.  I having brought it to the Minister's notice.  It is on his head if Powerstown Park is sold before this Bill becomes law.  He can prevent it.  First of all, he can go a long way if he says he will accept Deputy MacEntee's amendments in whole or in part.  He would more than meet us if he gave an undertaking that he would communicate with the Irish Coursing Club suggesting to them that he is alarmed at the information disclosed to the Dáil by Deputy O'Malley on the 19th June, that Deputy O'Malley pointed out that an offer had been made by the secretary of the Irish Coursing Club for 167 statute acres, the house, the lettings of such lands, the building of a factory there and any profits derived from racing. Would the Minister consider communicating with the secretary saying that he would much prefer if such a decision <Col N="549" /> were deferred until the Bill became an Act?</P>
    <P>On the question of the other portion of Deputy MacEntee's amendment No. 16a, that is, the question of the Greyhound and Sporting Press, Limited, that is also a matter over which the Minister at the present time has absolutely no control.  The advisory committee's report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The advisory committee's report stated&mdash;page 35:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited appears to have been remarkably successful from the outset and the value of its assets, including buildings and equipment, is estimated by the Irish Coursing Club to be at present at least £60,000. This estimate includes buildings which were erected in recent years at a cost of approximately £14,000, and includes also plant and equipment said to have cost £18,000.  This heavy expenditure on the construction of new buildings and installation of equipment was stated by the Irish Coursing Club to have become imperative when the printing company <Col N="550" /> was informed by the military authorities during the emergency period that it would have to vacate certain buildings held on lease by it in Clonmel...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the committee go on to state:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole, we have some doubts as to whether in the circumstances mentioned, the company was justified in expending, on the erection of new buildings and more particularly on the installation of new and elaborate printing machinery, large sums which, properly speaking, belonged to the Irish Coursing Club and to the greyhound industry.  We have no information as to whether the Greyhound and Sporting Press Limited decided on this expenditure or whether the sanction of the Standing Committee for the expenditure was sought.  The company appears to hold liquid assets to the value of £13,000 approximately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is a very important point to show how they transact their business:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although these assets include Government Securities earning only from 3¾ per cent. to 4 per cent., no effort has been made to redeem 6 per cent. debentures to the value of £4,000, held personally by the senior joint secretary of the Irish Coursing Club who is also the manager of the <i>Coursing and Racing Calendar.</i> Here it might be noted that income and corporation profits tax to the amount of £24,800 was paid by the company since 1933.&rdquo;</P>

In the minutes is disclosed <Col N="551" /> the fact that they have under contemplation at the present time the disposal of one of their assets dealt with by Deputy MacEntee in his amendment, namely, Powerstown Park, Limited.  I am now endeavouring to point out to the House that if they dispose of one asset such as Powerstown Park there is nothing to prevent them from doing the same with another asset.</P>

    <P>SECTION 21.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;issued after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to give relief from estate duties by assessing at two-thirds of their value shares of Irish companies issued after the passing of the Act, subject to the limitations imposed in Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932.  While the main purpose of that section has our approval as being in accord with the general policy of our Party to induce, by tax measures, interest in Irish, as against external investments, it seems to us that the Minister has gone a long way towards defeating the purpose&mdash;if that is his purpose&mdash;by limiting the concessions to future share issues.</P>
      <P>I doubt if the enactment of this section will influence very much the success of future share issues by Irish manufacturing concerns, but there is advantage to be secured by inducing greater stock market activity in the shares of Irish concerns generally.  If that can be done by measures of this kind, or any other measures, then new issues are likely to have a much better chance of succeeding than otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty, I think, at the present time is that stock market news relates more frequently to British stocks than Irish stocks.  There is not a great deal of movement in Irish stocks but there <Col N="552" /> is always some development of interest on the British stock market.  The result is that the attention of prospective investors is more frequently directed to British market news than to Irish news.  That is detrimental to our industrial development.  Anything which tends to create greater interest in the issues of Irish companies and greater activity in regard to them can be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I think it would help to secure that position if this very limited concession&mdash;which will not involve a very great deal of money&mdash;was extended to all issues of stock.  There seems to be something anomalous and wrong in giving a concession of this kind which can only be realised upon the death of the owner of the stocks, to persons who in future may decide to invest in issues of Irish companies and to withhold it from those who so invested in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister or his advisers have fully considered all the complications which these proposals may involve for companies whose shares are quoted on the stock market and for the management of the stock market itself.  A financial writer in one of the morning papers commented on the provisions of the Finance Bill&mdash; both the section dealing with the extension of Section 7 of the 1932 Act and this section.  He said in relation to the earlier section we have already discussed dealing with Section 7 of the 1932 Act and having given an illustration of the effect of that section in relation to a particular company&mdash;this is from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was therefore essential to distinguish between the old and the new capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The writer was referring to the effects of the limitations in the Act of 1932:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only way around the matter was to create a second equity and as preference shares were also similarly issued, it was necessary to create a new line of preference shares.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are quite a number of Irish companies whose capital is <Col N="553" /> spread over several different issues in a similar way and for the same reason.  The new amendment of the Finance Act of 1932 will clear the way for a welcome consolidation of these issues, providing as it does for the formerly ineligible capital to become eligible for the abatement of income-tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is reintroducing these complications all over again.  The writer did not appreciate apparently that this section is limited to shares issued after the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>I think that the very limited scope of this section has not been appreciated by those interested in these matters. There are many Irish companies with authorised capital in excess of their issued capital.  No doubt at some stage they intend, if business expands, to issue shares to the authorised limit. Is it contemplated that these additional shares issued will have a different standing to those already issued?  They are, according to the Bill, to be described and designated so that they can be clearly distinguished from the earlier issues.  Is it contemplated that these two classes of shares will have different quotations on the stock market?  This section only applies to shares issued to the public in respect of which there is a stock market quotation.  What is the position regarding shares of which only a part of the nominal value was subscribed and on which there is a call liability?  Are these shares deemed to have been issued before the passing of the Act and therefore not eligible or will they qualify under this Act because part&mdash;perhaps the major part &mdash;of the total amount to be subscribed will be paid after the qualifying date?</P>
    <P>I attemped to make a calculation as to what the cost might be if this section was extended but I could not. There is always considerable doubt as to what the yield of estate duty will be in any one year.  The Minister announced in the financial statement that he got a &ldquo;wind-fall&rdquo; yield from death duties last year.  That can arise any year, but, so far as it is possible to estimate, it does not appear to me that the cost to the Exchequer over any length of time can be very considerable. <Col N="554" /> This concession is limited to shares of companies which have been issued for public subscription.</P>
    <P>We know from the report of the Industrial Taxation Committee that the amount of capital put into Irish industry by public subscription for issued shares is much less than half the total investment in Irish industry. The great majority of companies engaged in industry here are private companies, the shares of which have not got a public quotation and which do not qualify either for this concession or for relief under Section 7 of the Act of 1932.  Having regard to the nature of our industrial organisation, to the experience of the past of the manner in which industrial capital is raised, there does not appear to me to be any reason why this concession should be restricted to shares to which Section 7 of the 1932 Act applies.</P>
    <P>I think it is inevitable that, whatever form our future industrial development may take, a large part of it will result from the activities of private companies.  I should imagine that is not an unusual position in smaller countries where industrial units are smaller in size also and where there is a natural desire to hold the control of these smaller units within the family group of the person who initially started them.  I do not know if the Minister has considered this point.  If he is not prepared to do so, I do not suppose any arguments here will persuade him to change his mind, but it seems to me that if he has in this section the idea which I expressed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister always listens to good arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not noticed that so far on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy's arguments are not good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be the explanation. If the Minister has in mind the idea of promoting greater interest amongst potential investors in Irish companies, then it appears to me he is far more likely to get that result if he extends this concession generally to all <Col N="555" /> such shares issued by these companies rather than confine it to future issues. There certainly will not be, until after the passing of the Act anyway, any new flotations; and the Minister could not even specify the date of the passing of the Act at the moment.  I ask him to remember that this section is a permanent section.  It is not merely intended to apply this year only; it will remain in force until repealed.  In ten or 15 years' time, people holding shares in Irish companies will be trying to check back to find out whether these shares were issued before or after some date in June or July, 1956, knowing that, if they were issued after that date, they will be worth more than they would be if they were issued prior to that date.  I think, inevitably, as soon as this section has been in operation for a few years and that position arises, some Minister for Finance will have to extend it generally; and it seems to me to be preferable to do that job right now than leave a situation such as I have described to be tidied up at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that one of the difficulties in relation to interest in Irish industrial stocks is the lack of a market for those stocks.  It is a fact that people who are investing in Irish industrial equities invest to hold rather than to buy temporarily and sell again at a later date; that has been the experience and the practice all through the years.  Greater stock market activity would undoubtedly arise and make the position easier for future industrial issues, if that were not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy looks back, he will, I think, find that the Party to which I have the honour to belong made that point rather forcibly to him when he was on this side of the House.  If he looks at a blueprint for prosperity, he will find that that is clearly set out as one of the ambitions and one of the aims.  It is precisely because of that, and because of our anxiety to assist in that, that I widened the scope of Section 7 of the 1932 Act.  There is something to be said on both sides in <Col N="556" /> relation to this section, but my principal aim is the incentive or inducement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will agree with me at once that, in relation to issues in the past, there is no question of inducement or incentive, and, to do as he suggests, would be to give an uncovenanted benefit in so far as existing holders of shares are concerned.  I do not think the wording of the Deputy's amendment quite carries out what he had in mind.  I am not, however, making any point against him in that respect, but, purely for clarification, I ask him to realise that amendment No. 8 would mean that any issues made here not merely since 1932 but since the inception of the State, or even prior to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 of the 1932 Act must apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would reap the same benefit.  In relation to sub-section (5), he will find that the relief would apply irrespective of whether or not they were 1932 Act cases.  As I understand the Deputy, the case he wants to put, irrespective of the wording of his amendment, is that any issue made since the passing of Section 7 of the 1932 Act should have the benefit of this provision.  I have provided that it shall apply to new issues because it is in relation to new issues that I want to provide the inducement for further industrial development, so that, with these new issues for further industrial development, we will be able to get a greater employment potential in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned preference shares.  It is perhaps unfortunate that, in existing international financial circumstances, preference shares have ceased to have the appeal they had some time ago.  At the moment I think I must certainly ignore their existence. There is another way of dealing with the matter somewhat on the lines of the Deputy's suggestion, that is, to give the concession to the shares of any company when a further new issue is made.  I considered that because I wanted to avoid any sub-division.  It is a possibility, but, on the other hand, if we did that, we would be giving a <Col N="557" /> certain benefit in respect of past issues to shareholders in one company as against shareholders in some other company.</P>
    <P>On the whole, there seems to be a preference for the incentive and inducement side of the picture, bearing in mind that what I was particularly anxious to do was to promote the ease and interest in new issues rather than that I should give a benefit to the holders of past issues.  It was solely because of that that I ultimately suggested to the House the framing of this section in this particular way.  So far as existing issues are concerned, the Deputy will agree with me that they are there, and that there would not be any benefit to the national economy as a whole by merely improving the status of those holders.  In respect of further extensions and new investment, there would be a benefit to the economy if it was easier in any way to induce capital to flow into those issues.  It was that which particularly influenced me when I was framing this section and I think the Deputy will agree that, over and above everything else, it is the incentive provision which is the overriding question.  I am not saying that I am shutting my mind in any way in respect of a greater extension of the concessions which I have introduced at a later stage.  I am not.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk Party politics on this section because I regard it in a different light, but there is something to be said for the view that it is desirable to try it out in this way to see if it works as an inducement.  Perhaps, if it is a successful inducement, it might be worth while extending it at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister completely misconceives the prospects of the whole situation.  It would be much more important to give the concession to existing issues rather than to shares not yet issued.  It would create more interest in them and would promote more dealings in them in the market.  It would create a better atmosphere in the market which would tend to encourage investors to put capital into Irish issues.  When a company decides that it can extend its operations and employ new capital, the <Col N="558" /> first thing it does is to see how its existing shares stand.  If they are at a discount that settles that issue there and then because there could be no attempt made to get capital from the public in such circumstances.  To give concessions to existing issues would be far more likely to create interest and to extend activities, rather than to give a slight concession in respect of new issues.</P>
      <P>When a company finds it possible to make a new issue, it is the prospect of earning profits and paying dividends that will attract investors.  The new issues will not attract investors unless there is that interest in the Irish stock market which does not exist at present.  It happens that, at the present time, the stock market is almost completely stagnant.  It would be futile for anyone to think of raising any substantial amount of money until that situation is changed and it is the business of the Government to try to change it.  There is no desire, in my mind, to reward people who have already invested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 25, before &ldquo;on&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in any accounting period ending.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps it would be more useful to discuss the amendments and the section together.  The main purpose of the amendments is to effect some improvement which I think is necessary in this section.  I have been asked to move both the amendments standing in my name by persons concerned with the operation of the section.  So far as the first amendment, which deals with the accounting period rather than with specific dates, is concerned, the approach came from firms of accountants who anticipate difficulties arising out of the provisions of the section.  The other amendment comes on behalf of particular firms who happen to be caught in the sense that they have incurred substantial capital expenditure this year, but will not qualify for the initial allowance under this section.</P>
      <P>All we are talking about here is an advance of the wear and tear allowance. Over any length of time, it will not cost the Exchequer anything.  The amount of depreciation allowed on any machine will not be any greater but the effect of the section is to allow a greater proportion of the total in the first year.  I take it that a firm is entitled to choose whichever it prefers and that a firm does not have to take the initial allowance unless it sees some advantage in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something to be said for the proposal of Mr. Lynch, in his minority report of the commission, that every firm should be allowed to fix its own depreciation policy and to take 100 per cent. allowance in the first year, <Col N="560" /> if it so wishes, and to forego all allowance in the subsequent years, or, on the other hand, to spread it equally over the life of the machine.  That has been the system in Sweden but I see that a Swedish commission on industrial taxation has recommended that that arrangement be terminated so there must be some defects in it.  From the viewpoint of the Minister for Finance it is undesirable to have any provision which makes it impossible for him to estimate what his revenue in a full tax year will be.  I take it that this section is drafted to ensure that it will cost nothing this year.  I propose the first amendment which will improve this section and will cost the Exchequer nothing this year.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to clarify, if he can, what is meant by the term &ldquo;the day on which the sum in question becomes payable&rdquo;.  Nobody seems to know precisely what that means.  A firm which has ordered a new boiler, or some new machines, or new plant of one kind or another, may have to pay part of the total cost with the placing of the order and may have to pay another instalment at some stage during the process of manufacture of the machine before its installation here.  The final payment may come later, either on the installation of the machines or some time after they are in operation.  Their difficulty has been to know what is meant by &ldquo;payable&rdquo;. Is it the date on which the firm becomes liable to make the payment, or is it the date on which they actually pay?  I admit that that problem would arise, not quite as acutely but almost certainly in some cases, if my amendment was accepted.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the first amendment is to remove the possibility of arguing with the Revenue Commissioners as to whether the date upon which the sum becomes payable was before or after 6th April, 1956.  If it is clear that the amount became payable within the accounting period ending after 6th April, then there is less room for contention and less need for precision as to the actual date on which the sum became payable.  So far as I can see, it makes no difference whatever to the Exchequer, but it will, according to <Col N="561" /> the very responsible firms of accountants which have made representations to me on the matter, ease their task very considerably.</P>
    <P>The other amendment is different. It is the practice at present&mdash;indeed it is prescribed by the regulations of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;that the normal wear and tear allowance does not begin to be calculated until the machine has gone into productive use. That is a common-sense provision.  I do not know why it is being departed from in this case.  There are many instances&mdash;I know of some myself&mdash; where a company purchased additional machinery with the intention of embarking on a new line, or of extending production, and for some reason or another they decided not to bring the machines into use for some months, or perhaps even a year; they decided that the market was not favourable for the launching of the new line or encountered some other difficulty, perhaps even a capital difficulty, in getting the machinery into use.  They can have it paid for, installed in their factory and ready to go into use, but the wear and tear allowance does not begin to be calculated, except from the day they press the button and put it in productive use.  The mere fact that it is there in the factory and has been paid for does not qualify them for the wear and tear allowance on it.  It would simplify matters for everybody if the same regulation applied in this case and that the first year of the operation of the machine, the year in which it first came into productive operation, would be the year for which the initial allowance should be granted.</P>
    <P>These are the two proposals.  I do not know if either appeals to the Minister.  Both have been urged and put forward by very responsible interests, and I think they should be considered.  I have another amendment here which I think I should deal with.  It concerns secondhand plant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we going to deal with the three together?  I am quite agreeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister knows I have many times in the past <Col N="562" /> expressed strong opposition to the starting of new industries with secondhand plant.  In so far as it was possible to do so by means of official pressure, it was always exercised to encourage the acquisition of new up-to-date plant rather than secondhand plant.  But there have been many cases where that was not practicable, except at the cost of very considerable delay.  There have been other cases where the acquisition of secondhand plant, which was by no means obsolete, was of very considerable advantage to the firm concerned. Indeed, the Minister may know of a new project which is developing at the present time and which is based upon the purchase by a company here of the whole of a plant which was in operation in another country by another company.  The plant is as up-to-date and as efficient as any in the world, and that decision to buy the complete plant and transfer it from another country to a factory here makes it possible for that industry to be established in much less time than would otherwise be necessary, and with other very considerable advantages.  It would seem to be unfair, in that instance, at least, to deny the advantages of the initial allowance, assuming that the firm desire to claim the initial allowance in respect of that equipment.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that throughout industry as a whole there will be many cases where the right decisions will be to acquire a secondhand machine or a bank of machines, which are technically sound, because immediate delivery can be secured, or because they can be acquired in a variety of circumstances at somewhat less cost than new machines.  It is drawing the line far too tightly to deny the advantages of the initial allowance completely to machines which are classed as second-hand&mdash;I am not quite sure what is meant by secondhand&mdash;and it is going to be a continual source of difficulty to the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether any particular machine is secondhand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another capacity, I had to supervise the purchase of a very elaborate machine some years ago, and because the machine was elaborate and very costly and represented a big underhand&mdash;<Col N="563" /> taking by the firm concerned, we insisted that it should be installed completely and put working by the manufacturer before being dismantled and transferred here, so that the defects or inadequacies in the machines would be fully exposed before we incurred the cost of transporting and erecting it.  That machine could not in any sense of the term be described as secondhand, but it was, in fact, used in another country before being transferred here.  For how long would it have had to be in use to merit the description &ldquo;secondhand&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I think that this official discouragement of the use of secondhand plant, if that plant is not modern in design or as modern as can be secured, should be left to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in so far as this section is concerned, the capital expenditure on the plant should rate for the initial allowance, irrespective of whether it was new or secondhand. I would strongly support the Minister for Industry and Commerce in using his authority to discourage the acquisition of secondhand plant, if new plant is available, but I think it is his job and not the job of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the section itself, I should say that, in our view here, the initial allowances for which this section provides are not nearly adequate to the requirements of the present situation.  We can have different views as to the effect of tax concessions and tax inducements in stimulating industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>In my own opinion they are a very effective stimulant.  We need at the present time a very considerable expansion in industrial production.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke last year on his Estimate about the satisfactory progress of industry. Last year industry recorded a 3 per cent. increase in its total output&mdash;an increase which was far short of that attained by any other country in Europe and very far short of what we need here if we are to deal with the unemployment and emigration position by the expansion of the number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> The number of new jobs in industry increased by 1,500.  On my calculation we need about ten times that increase if we are to secure a reasonable prospect of employing our people and of checking emigration.  We would not even abolish emigration but check it in its abnormal features.</P>
    <P>I personally was very disappointed with the report on industrial taxation. I admit the committee was not asked to advise on the measures required in the emergency situation which has now developed.  They were asked to deal only with the incidence of the existing taxes on industrial profits with a view to eliminating anomalies and considering how they could be modified so as to encourage industrial expansion without prejudice to the general revenue; but in the present circumstances we need a great deal more than that if we are to bring into industry that influx of new capital and enterprise which is needed to get expansion on the scale we need it.</P>
    <P>In any event the Minister has only taken one of the recommendations of the commission and has implemented it here.  I urge him to say as soon as possible during the course of the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, if he can, and, if not, later, that all the recommendations of the commission will be implemented, if not in this Finance Bill, then in next year's Finance Bill.  That announcement made now would have as stimulating effect as the actual enactment of the sections of this Bill which would give effect to the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The stepping up of the wear and tear allowance is perhaps the more important of these recommendations and if firms knew they could go ahead now, incurring new capital liabilities to acquire new plant knowing they would get the initial allowance to help them in their financial difficulties in this year, and this higher rate of wear and tear allowance in other years, that would be far more likely to do good than the absence of the Minister's declaration in that regard.  All the evidence which we have is that the rate of taxation in industry is restrictive of development.  That was said by the American experts brought over <Col N="565" /> here after the war to report on economic conditions and whose report aroused a great deal of discussion at the time.  It is the view of everyone who examined the position objectively. While we could perhaps defend the heavy burdens of taxation on industry by reference to the whole tax position, in times when the country was going forward, anyway, we have got, in a period like the present in which we appear to be going backwards, to take more revolutionary steps to change that situation.  A reduction in the taxation on industry would be a step in the right direction even if that reduction in taxation was so arranged that firms could not benefit by it except they used the additional resources made available to them for the expansion of their activities or to improve and modernise their plant.</P>
    <P>In Britain, after the war they brought in this initial allowance and in a very short time they repealed it again and replaced it by the investment allowance.  The allowance was far more effective in stimulating new industrial expansion.  Indeed, so effective was it in stimulating new industrial investment that they withdrew it again and replaced it with the initial allowance this year.  But their problem is entirely different from ours. They have to stamp down upon the rate of expansion of industrial investment.  We have to stimulate it very urgently and very definitely. It would seem to be good policy to use here the instrument they found effective there.  There is one further point I want to make.  It is not clear from the wording, although I take it it is intended, that this initial allowance will apply to mining concerns. The Minister might let us know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carew</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, under this section, to draw the Minister's attention to the position of small Irish shipping companies which are in a very different position from industrial concerns which buy machinery from year to year.  From representations made to me by the people concerned, I feel they have a case and I should like the Minister to give it consideration.</P>
      <P>We are aware that any Irish shipping company which wants to acquire a new ship and has to place an order has to put down capital with the order together with so much as the ship is being built.  Most small Irish shipping companies do not buy new ships.  I understand that the practice with most of them is to buy secondhand ships. Secondhand ships could sometimes be described as new ships.  When a ship is four years in operation and is due for its first survey, it is usually at that period or some time afterwards that the small Irish shipping companies acquire their ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to sub-section (6), &ldquo;new&rdquo; means unused and not secondhand. That being so, these small Irish shipping companies are completely debarred from any benefit whatever even though they acquire a ship after being four years in operation.  I understand that the shipping world considers a ship four years in use as a new ship. It is a ship that has stood its test.  I would respectfully say to the Minister that consideration should be given to Irish companies who have to purchase ships in that way perhaps through lack of capital.  Furthermore, I feel the Minister should allow a company who have acquired a ship within the accountancy period of that company to benefit from this concession.  He <Col N="567" /> has stated that, after the 5th April, the initial allowance will apply.  Consider a company whose accounts are made up to the 31st December each year.  They would be within the accountancy period and yet they would not be entitled to get any allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a county where racing is either the chief or else one of the big industries.  Even the horse that comes second at the Curragh always gets some consolation. I should like if, in a sporting way, the Minister would give some concession to small shipping companies who may have acquired a ship within the accountancy period.  I understand that shipping has always been treated in a different way from ordinary industries from the point of view of taxation and in particular from the point of view of wear and tear.  I understand, further, that the revenue authorities in England treat ships so acquired in that way.  Therefore, I would respectfully ask the Minister to consider that point and give Irish shipping companies, who have their difficulties, the benefit of the concession. These companies may not be able to acquire new ships and have to depend upon getting ships that have been in operation for six or eight years and that might be considered good ships and seaworthy in every way.</P>

      <P>If that is correct, this point arises.  I knew that the committee had recommended this initial allowance for ships but I assumed the Minister let it stand over with others and that he merely implemented it for industry this year.  However, if the Minister states that this section applies to shipping and to shipping companies, then I would strongly support Deputy Carew's point that sub-section (6) should be reconsidered.  I think the great majority of the smaller Irish companies acquire ships which could be classed as secondhand ships.  They should not be prevented from acquiring ships of that type by the provisions of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Lemass is discovering, as we go along, that I did more than he thought I did when he made his rather petulant comment about my reading of the Industrial Taxation Committee's Report on the Budget debate.  Having regard to the time at which I received this report, it is somewhat surprising not that I have failed to implement all these provisions but that I have been able to take provisions out of it and to implement them in this year's Finance Bill.  I happen to know that every single member of the committee believed when they presented the report to me that they were presenting it too late for me to do anything in this year's Finance Bill.  Occasionally, we are able to outpace even the most ambitious hopes of the businessmen concerned in this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's officers could have guessed a year ago that this would be one of the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had plenty of opportunity to guess what would be in it when he was sitting on this side of the House, but he did not. <Col N="569" /> I am interested also to hear the Deputy say he believes there should be taxation incentives in relation to our problems.  I think I can fairly say that only two taxation incentives of any substantial consequence were provided in recent years.  There is the mining tax about which the Deputy is wrong when he says it does not apply to any existing Irish company.  Irish companies are able to get benefits under that Bill.  The Deputy need not worry himself in that respect.  The second is these initial allowances.  If Deputy Lemass or any other member of the House will turn to the summary of the recommendations that are in the majority report, I think he will agree that, since this report was presented to me approximately one month before the introduction of the Budget, it is not a bad effort to deal with matters that have been included to the extent to which I have included them.</P>
      <P>The initial allowance for industry covers shipping.  Certain of the other problems and particularly the main question of wear and tear rates being changed are larger problems.  In relation to wear and tear rates, I would particularly draw the Deputy's attention to paragraph 142 of the majority report in which it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We were frankly surprised to find that revenue wear and tear allowances amounted to approximately 80 per cent. of the depreciation actually written off by industry, and that an increase of approximately 25 per cent. in wear and tear would be adequate to bridge the gap completely.  The 1946 values shown for plant and equipment for the 83 companies provide an important clue as to the actual position.  In that year the written down value was £0.8 million, so that it may be safely assumed that less than £0.4 million would be included for pre-1947 plant and equipment in the 1953 balance sheet figure of £2.4 million.  In other words, the wear and tear allowances shown relate to post-war plant and equipment almost entirely.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that not merely were the members of the committee surprised by <Col N="570" /> finding that that was the fact: I think very few people appreciated that such was the case.  I do not want anybody to fail to appreciate the wealth of information that there is in the survey made by the committee.  Deputy Lemass suggested he did not think it had adequately covered the task.  I do not know whether the Deputy meant that in any way as a criticism of the committee but probably he did not. Still, I think it would be wrong to allow it to go on the records of the House without saying that I, for one, appreciate and accept very fully the vast amount of work that was put by the public-spirited members of this committee into their analysis of the situation and their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I hope that the report, as I have already stated, will be read by everybody who is interested in this proposal. I hope it will be studied carefully and that we will have an opportunity later, when there has been more time for more detailed study, of discussing the problems thrown up by it.  I have made it clear already, in respect of the other recommendations and other matters that arise from the analysis of the committee, that I shall examine them as soon as possible, but it would be quite unrealistic for Deputy Lemass or anyone to suggest that I should indicate my views either for or against those other problems at this stage.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may also remember that some time ago there was a fairly consistent canvass of Deputies and members of the other House and generally of the public, on certain calculations that had been put before them.  The main majority report, in its analysis, shows where these calculations went awry.  I do not suggest that in any criticism of the author of those calculations but he had not available to him all the information in the normal order of things.  Much of the information upon which it is necessary to base an analysis of the kind in question will be confidential to the companies concerned, and because of its confidential nature could only be analysed accurately and satisfactorily by those who had not merely the published accounts but also the full accounts before them.  The paragraphs <Col N="571" /> from No. 152 onwards deal with that aspect of the situation and I think it would be desirable that those people who have read the previous memorandum should read those paragraphs so as to enable themselves to ascertain and to appreciate the facts.</P>
    <P>Before I come to any amendments that are tabled by Deputy Lemass in any detail&mdash;or rather to the first two amendments&mdash;perhaps I might deal with the matter that was raised by Deputy Carew initially: the question of ships is one that is treated separately in the committee's report.  I felt, however, when I was framing this section, that it was desirable that shipping should be given the initial allowance.  I received some representations from the Irish Shipowners' Association only last week.  The representations are based on two points. In the first case, they wish the allowance to be given in respect of the last period prior to the 6th April, 1956. They based their representations for that concession on what transpired in England.  They suggested in a memorandum to me that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1945, when he was introducing the initial allowance which was to come into operation on the 5th April, 1946, allowed for such initial allowances, expenditure that had taken place since 1944.  The Shipowners' Association suggested to me that because of the fact that he had, so to speak, brought back the date in his case, I should do the same here. They completely overlooked, however, the facts of the situation.  The facts were that in Britain the Chancellor announced his concession in the Budget of 1944 and indicated that he was going to give initial allowances in respect of any machinery or plant that qualified for them as from that date.</P>
    <P>He brought the legislation into existence a year later, but it was stated by him that the legislation would be operative as from 1944 and it is clearly correct that it should be from the date of the announcement that the legislation would be operative rather than from any earlier date.  Again, the reason for that is the same as that which we discussed on an earlier section, that the whole purpose of this <Col N="572" /> allowance is to provide, if you like, by means of interest-free loans&mdash; which is one of the terms that it has been described by in the Taxation Concession Committee's Report&mdash;an incentive to persons or firms or companies to buy new machinery.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, therefore, I cannot possibly accept that representation that we should date the operation of the allowance back, as it was made to me by the Shipowners' Association.  The case upon which they founded their representation, as I have indicated, has no justification in fact.</P>
    <P>So far as Deputy Lemass's amendment No. 12 is concerned, I cannot accept it.  This is the one dealing with the question of secondhand machinery.  I feel very strongly indeed that too often secondhand machinery has been brought in and what has happened in effect is that the old clothes have been passed on to the poor relations by certain companies, to those who did not go into the modern machinery that we need if we are to make our goods highly competitive, make them efficiently, or to increase our productivity.  I think Deputy Lemass agrees with me that it is undesirable that in any case secondhand machinery rather than new machinery should be purchased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would not agree with it as a policy for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to encourage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot blow hot and cold.  You have a taxation incentive inducing people to carry out the policy, and this cuts across the policy.  I believe the policy of utilisation of new machinery is the right policy, and equally I believe that, when it is the right policy, the incentive in the taxation code must follow rather than cut across that policy.  One of the reasons is that I feel some of the machinery introduced in that way was not as modern, as up-to-date or perhaps as efficient as it might have been.  There were cases where it was the contrary, but Deputy Lemass knows, just as I do, of the case where it was not all that it might have been. In the incentive provisions I am putting <Col N="573" /> into this Bill, I am not going to cut across that policy, except where there is a clear basis of certification.</P>
      <P>The reason I say &ldquo;except where there is a clear basis of certification&rdquo; is that I accept the point made by Deputy Carew that there is, in shipping, a basis of certification, that it is possible to consider shipping on a different basis.  Some of our smaller ship-owning concerns would unfortunately find it impossible to purchase new ships, no matter how desirable the purchase of new ships might be.  In shipping also, there would not be the same possibility of switching from one company to another as might exist in respect of ordinary machinery or plant. The House can appreciate that it would be extremely difficult in the case of secondhand machinery to prevent companies passing secondhand machinery from the parent to a subsidiary company or from one subsidiary to another subsidiary.  If we permitted secondhand machinery, they would in that way be able to obtain initial allowances again and again.</P>
      <P>That possibility does not, in my mind, arise at all in the case of ships and I am prepared therefore to consider, between now and the Report Stage, whether it might not be possible to meet the case put forward by Deputy Carew, and which was made to me by the Irish Shippers' Association, and supported by Deputy Lemass in respect of the waiving of the restriction on secondhand commodities in Section 6 as far as shipping is concerned. I am not prepared to accept it in respect, of industry generally because I think it would cut across what is the correct policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as amendment No. 10 is concerned, the effect of that would be to do what I do not think this House should do.  It would mean that we would be giving concessions to a firm on the fortuitous basis of the date on which not this House but the firm itself fixed its accounting period.  I do not think the House should do that in relation to taxation provisions.  In relation to taxation provisions, we should ourselves lay down the date and should accept the responsibility <Col N="574" /> for so doing.  The date should be that named by the House.</P>
    <P>Let me give a simple example to the Deputy.  Take two firms.  Firm A has an accounting period ending on 31st January each year; firm B has one ending on 31st December each year. Both firms buy machinery and in due course the amount due for that machinery becomes payable.  Let us say both firms pay on 15th January, 1956.  Under the amendment of Deputy Lemass, firm A, which has its accounting period up to 31st January, does not get the allowance because its accounting period closed on 31st January, 1956, but firm B, which has its accounting period up to 31st December this year, does get the allowance.  Frankly, I think that is wrong.  I think it should be the same for all taxpayers concerned and that it should be a date fixed by this House. There should not be the fortuitous period of time which the various concerns fix for their own convenience rather than the income-tax year.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 seeks to fix the basis upon which the initial allowance will be given as being the year of the coming into use of machinery rather than the year of the expenditure.  I think the expenditure is the better test.  The purpose of the initial allowance, as clearly the Deputy has shown in his remarks he appreciates, is to provide an incentive which will induce the firms to go in for the purchase of more modern machinery.</P>
    <P>Very often that purchase will be spread over a period of time.  As far as the future is concerned, therefore, the allowance based on expenditure will be more beneficial to the firms than the allowance based on the date operative for the wear and tear arrangements.  If a company decides to-morrow to purchase machinery, and places an order for machinery that may come in in four six-monthly periods, it would mean that they probably will pay an initial deposit when they place an order, a further sum when the first part of the machinery is delivered and further sums right through the contract up to its conclusion.  If the contract for that machinery extends over one year, <Col N="575" /> then the effect of my provision will be to give the firm concerned their allowance sooner than they would get it under the Deputy's amendment. Under the Deputy's amendment, they would not get the allowance at all, until the whole machinery was installed and in operation.  Under the provisions in the Bill, they will get the allowance as and when each sum becomes payable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is because that is the purpose that the allowance is based on expenditure, and, being based on expenditure, where a company has to put down money in advance, it will assist it to purchase on a basis like that.</P>
      <P>I can see people who have already made payments naturally being anxious, if they could utilise their ingenuity, to find any method of asking me to go back without making it appear too obvious that that is what they are doing.  So far as the future is concerned, my suggestion would be far more beneficial to industry and I would suggest to the Deputy that, when he was framing that amendment, he was not really thinking of the future at all.  I must think of the future and I am sure the Deputy also will think of the future because this will be permanent legislation and it would be unwise to prevent that future benefit being given by reference to past circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly I do not understand the Deputy when he indicates that there has been a suggestion that the words &ldquo;become payable&rdquo; create difficulty in interpretation.  If I make a contract for the purchase of machinery, on that contract it will probably be set out that I have to pay a deposit of x per cent., that I will pay a further sum perhaps when a certain amount of work has been done on the contract and a final sum when the machinery or <Col N="576" /> plant in question has been installed and is in working order.  In so far as the meaning of the words &ldquo;shall be payable&rdquo; is concerned in relation to the deposit, it will be payable on the signing of the contract.  Therefore, the date of that payment is the date of the signing of the contract, and as from that date that sum so paid as a deposit ranks for the initial allowance.</P>
    <P>In respect of further payments on account, the contract provides when they must be paid.  As soon as the circumstances arise in which they become payable, they will rank for initial allowance as from that date.  The anxiety is to ensure and to provide that, all through, in relation to expenditure on new plant and machinery, immediately the money becomes payable, the benefit will accrue as from that date, so that if the contract is one payable for a series of periods the concession that is given here to the extent of the tax on the initial allowance will go to create a reserve to meet the next instalment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of secondhand machinery, I think the Minister is misinterpreting the function of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has the responsibility for guiding and directing the industrial development policy.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I repeatedly made known, by speech here and elsewhere, my dislike of any developments based upon secondhand plant.  On many occasions where individual concerns came seeking protection or assistance under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, or some other form of Government help, they were refused it because their plans contemplated reliance, in the main, on secondhand plant.  I insist that it is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it is entirely wrong for the Minister for Finance to seek through this tax arrangement to give effect in a hit or miss manner to that policy which in the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is based upon examination of individual proposals and knowledge of particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give certain examples which have arisen to my knowledge in this <Col N="577" /> regard.  I know one case where a company purchased the most up-to-date plant in the world to go into a particular industry.  It purchased plant so expensive that it ran out of cash and within three or four months of starting operations, it ceased operations and went into liquidation.  It was a first-class plant.  No better plant could have been purchased and it had been working merely for three or four months when it was then purchased by other firms and transferred to their factories.  These firms that purchased that plant would not qualify for the initial allowance on that capital expenditure, notwithstanding all the Minister said about the need to give them aid at that stage, merely because that plant was in operation for three or four months.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, if that case came before him as a trade loan application or in some other way, would know precisely what was involved and would know that there was no departure from the policy of securing the most modern and up-to-date plant in that case.</P>
    <P>I mention again the other type of case which is now arising, of the actual transfer of the whole of a very modern and up-to-date plant from a factory in Europe to a factory in Ireland.  That arrangement involves not merely a considerable saving in capital outlay, but a far more important saving in time to the firm concerned, because a complete unit is being transferred, a unit the parts of which were originally purchased from a number of different suppliers, specialists in their own line. There will be many instances where a firm desiring to get plant quickly will find that they can do so only by buying plant already in use.  It is still true, as far as British suppliers are concerned, as well as some continental suppliers, that there are long waiting periods for the delivery of new plant.  No doubt that situation will change in time, but it has not changed yet.  It is improving to some extent, but any firm now proposing to buy new equipment must expect a long waiting period before any manufacturer can deliver it to them.</P>
    <P>If that will mean, as it often might mean, the survival of a firm, it is not <Col N="578" /> unusual for it to seek to obtain equipment of the type it requires from some place where it is already in use and from which it can be transported without delay.  That equipment need not be inefficient or obsolete equipment; in fact, it may be quite suitable for the purposes of the firm.  While recognising that these cases are exceptions to the general policy of discouraging the building up of Irish industry on secondhand plant, I still say that the acceptance of such circumstances as a justifiable departure from policy is a function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce rather than the Minister for Finance.  I am quite certain that that section of the Bill will land the Minister into a great deal of trouble.  He has already had to undertake to modify it once to meet the case of the shipowners and there will be many other cases of a similar kind which will arise, where he will regret his insistence on retaining the section as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be quite clear about that.  What I am asking the Minister to provide is that where the Minister for Industry and Commerce agrees that some particular development is desirable, even though it involves the use of plant already in use, and he undertakes to assist that concern by a tariff or by a trade loan guarantee, the Minister will not negative his decision by refusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Deputy is suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that how it will work out?  Even though the Minister for Industry and Commerce considers it desirable and encourages the firm concerned to go ahead on the lines proposed and although he undertakes to help them to get into production, the Minister for Finance will say, nevertheless: &ldquo;That firm will not qualify for the initial allowance under my Act.&rdquo;  The Minister has not even attempted to define what he means by secondhand plant and ultimately that matter will go to the courts and anyone can guess what interpretation the courts are likely to put on it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the other points that I raised, I think the Minister realises how far-fetched his arguments were&mdash; this importance of dealing with the future&mdash;but this issue of the future only arises in the case of a firm which some time in the future may incur payment for plant which will be spread over two years and even there I cannot quite see the relevancy of his remarks. It is quite true that one of my amendments is mainly concerned with the problem that arises at the transition period.  The Minister says it is fortuitous that some firm's accountancy period may end in January and another firm's accountancy period may end in December.  It is equally fortuitous that some firms, in 1956, installed plant in March and others did not install it until May.  One qualifies and the other does not qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Deputy in the very least; but is it not quite obvious that his amendments are <Col N="580" /> framed <i>ad hoc</i> on certain specific cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one of them, to deal with a specific case that I know of.  It is equally fortuitous, I say, that in the case of one firm the plant was brought in and paid for and in the other case it was brought in on the same day and not yet paid for.  In one case the allowance is given; in the other case it is not given.  I think the Minister should be concerned to remove these anomalies.  Undoubtedly, the line suggested in the case of ships would do it&mdash;date it back a year anyhow, but that would involve some diminution of revenue to the Exchequer this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, in regard to the case he mentioned, surely it is not whether it was paid but whether it was payable. As I understand the Deputy, in both the cases he mentioned a minute ago the amount was payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the machinery did not come into use and does not qualify for the wear and tear allowance until after 6th April.  That is what we are talking about.  We are not talking about a sum of money that the Minister takes out of the Exchequer and pays out. We are talking of an advance of the wear and tear allowance.  The total wear and tear allowance that the manufacturer gets is not increased by one penny.  If he elects to take it in ten equal instalments, as in the past, he can do so or he can get 20 per cent. in the first year and reduce the allowance in subsequent years.  That may be of some advantage to him.  The Minister described it as an interest-free loan.  It is not quite that, but that description is near enough to convey the general idea.  There is no question of the manufacturer getting a greater allowance <i>in toto</i> because of this Bill.  He merely gets part of the allowance pushed forward in time and I submit, therefore, that the calculation of that allowance and the dating of that allowance should be based on the same principles as the principles on which the present wear and tear allowance is based.  That wear and <Col N="581" /> tear allowance is calculated from the day on which the machine goes into productive use.  If that date is adopted for the initial allowance, no problem will arise in any case, in the particular case I am aware of or in the numerous other cases that I may not be aware of.</P>
      <P>The other amendment is different, in so far as this is a permanent arrangement. It did not prove very permanent in England; it went on and off and on again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but my argument is the other way round.  It is a question of the accountancy year.  It is to avoid difficulty in persuading the Revenue Commissioners of the day upon which the machine was paid for or the cost of the machine was payable. It is just as simple to take the other device, to say that, if in that accounting year this amount became payable, the initial allowance is paid. Again, what difference does it make to the Exchequer?  Not a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the difference in persuading them if a sum was payable in a financial year, an income-tax year or an accounting year?  There is no difference.  If there is difficulty in one case, there is difficulty in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the accounts of a company.  The accountant makes up the accounts and calculates the profits. There is a calculation as to the amount of depreciation that may be deducted before tax liability is assessed.  That is the job of the accountant in relation to the accounting year.  Now, the Minister is introducing a new complication.  That depreciation allowance is different if the expenditure was incurred after the 6th April from what it would be if it was incurred before the 6th April in this year.  That will be an immense complication in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, I have said that very reputable and responsible firms of accountants in Dublin&mdash;more than one <Col N="582" />&mdash;have urged this change.  It does not cost the Minister a penny to make the change and there can be no disadvantage to anybody if the change is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely adverting to the fact that there have been cases when the interpretation put on the law in the courts was different from that given by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the question of the amount of money that it is desirable to take from the Racing Board for the purpose of the Exchequer this year.  I think it is undesirable that we should take anything.  I think it is indeed a breach of faith on the part of the Government to attempt to take it.  There was an implied undertaking given to those responsible for the organisation of horse racing when the Act establishing the Racing Board was passed here that the machinery set up for the purpose of securing revenue for that board would never be used for the purpose of securing revenue for the State.  The Minister has decided to attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>I argued on the Second Reading that the revenue of the board is not sufficient to enable it to meet the charge put on it without very serious consequences to the whole horse-breeding industry here, for which the racecourses are the shop windows.  I admit that the accounts of the board would suggest that some sum in or around £70,000 or £80,000 might have been paid out to the Exchequer this year. The board last year appropriated to various reserves that amount of money and assuming that it gets the same revenue this year as last year it could, perhaps, pay that amount to the Government for this year, but not for two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested in the course of a few remarks on the Financial Resolution that this is a charge for one year only and may not be repeated next year.  I think it is obvious that it cannot be repeated next year and that whatever damage may be done this year by the imposition of the charge, it will be impossible to levy a similar charge next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some discussion here as to the possibility of the board's revenue <Col N="585" /> contracting this year.  I expressed the view that there were signs that the board's revenue would be substantially less this year than last year, that its ability to meet this charge this year would be substantially less than last year.  The Minister referred to a meeting where the attendance and tote receipts were larger than last year and apparently relied on that to sustain his hopes that revenue would not contract.</P>
    <P>Rather than express a personal view I am going to quote an article from the <i>Irish Field</i> which can be taken as authoritative and indeed it is obvious that some of the information which it obtained must have come from official quarters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The revenue demands would appear to be badly timed for already there has been a very noticeable decrease in betting through the tote at recent meetings and this can be taken as an indication that the bookmakers will have handled considerably less.  Since the Curragh meeting on May 9th there was a drop in tote takings at all except four of the 19 meetings up to Leopardstown of Saturday last, while at the Limerick Junction meeting on Thursday the amount handled was £6,521 against £11,104 last year.  The total decrease for the period mentioned is over £30,000 and thus over £3,000 in the amount accruing to the Racing Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The revenue of the board last year would have made it possible for approximately 25 per cent. to have been paid to the Exchequer without diminution of the services provided by the board, or any increased charge on anybody.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I move that the Minister should content himself with taking, this year, 25 per cent. of the board's gross revenue.  I think he should have regard to what the revenue of the board is likely to be before deciding how much of it he is going to take.  I suppose there will be no likelihood that the board's revenue will contract so much that the £140,000 he is going to take will absorb the whole of it, <Col N="586" /> involving the elimination of all their expenditures on the subsidisation of stakes, transport and so forth, but nevertheless, some contraction of revenue is likely and the Minister's claim on the board should be expressed, in my view, as a percentage of its revenue rather than a fixed sum, regardless of the revenue.</P>
    <P>The board decided, as we are told, that it would be impracticable to seek to recoup the amount the Minister is going to take from them by increasing the levy on bets with bookmakers. They announced their view that to attempt to do so would involve such a substantial falling off in the amounts staked and attendances at meetings that they could conceivably get less money from the higher levy than they are getting from the present levy.</P>
    <P>They have decided to increase by 5 per cent. the deduction from the tote pools in order to off-set this charge, making a total deduction of 15 per cent.  We do not know what that may yield in revenue to the board.  Its total gross revenue from the tote last year was £190,000 and it is possible that a 50 per cent. increase in the amount of the deduction will bring about a 50 per cent. increase in that revenue, and bring in, say, £90,000.  Personally, I think that is unlikely.  Even if the tote dividends are not likely to be seriously reduced, there is likely to be a falling off in betting with the tote by reason of the fact that the public are being made aware of what they did not perhaps previously appreciate, namely, that there was this deduction from the pool.  The additional 5 per cent. deduction will mean less than a 5 per cent. diminution in dividends, but that is not the way in which the public will think of it.  The public will think of the 15 per cent. that the board is deducting, deducting to hand over, in the main, to the Minister for Finance for Exchequer purposes.</P>
    <P>Now, if my proposal were adopted, the amount of the charge on the board's revenue which the Minister would impose would be limited to the additional revenue the board may get in by reason of that alteration in the deduction from the tote pools.  I am sure most members of the House were <Col N="587" /> perturbed to learn that the chairman of the board, who was at one time a well-known figure in this House, Mr. William T. Cosgrave, has resigned as a protest against this action of the Minister for Finance.  Mr. Cosgrave, although politically opposed to this Party, was appointed to that position by the Fianna Fáil Government and retained there by us, because we believed that he, as chairman of the board, would ensure its proper direction, its development on sound lines, and because we expected, too, that he would, through his personality and administration, bring prestige to that organisation we had set up for the specific purpose of aiding the industry here.  It is, I am sure, a matter of concern to everybody that he has taken such exception to this proposal of the Government that he preferred to resign rather than be associated with it.  That may perhaps bring home to members of the Government and its supporters in this House how strong the feeling is that the Minister for Finance has made a serious blunder in bringing this proposal to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I feel sure the Minister realises that now and would not, if he were framing his Budget over again, propose this charge upon the board's revenue.  I urge on him that he should consider fully the desirability of withdrawing the proposal now.  I think he will add to his personal reputation, if he does so.  The effect upon the Budget will be negligible.  The Minister is budgeting for £130,000,000 and nobody can believe that he will not be £1,000,000 out one way or the other: no body of men, however clever, could estimate the volume of expenditure or the yield of taxation so accurately that the margin of error would not be at least £1,000,000.  Within the limit of £1,000,000 the Budget will balance or fail to balance and the £140,000 the Minister hopes to garner from this charge is of very little importance in relation to the soundness of the Budget as a whole.</P>
    <P>The importance of that revenue to the Racing Board is very considerable and the evidence that the Government, having made a blunder, could appreciate that it had done so and rectify <Col N="588" /> it would be encouraging to many sections of the community, many sections which expect the Government to make many more blunders, which, everybody will hope, they will be equally prompt in rectifying when they are pointed out to them.  Whether the Minister accepts the proposal I put forward, that he should be content with 25 per cent. of the board's revenue this year, leaving the other 75 per cent. for the discharge of the functions for which they were set up, or would prefer the substitution of some other percentage, I would ask him to agree that his claim upon the board's revenue should be expressed as a percentage of the whole and that he should not just merely state a figure and say: &ldquo;I will get that, no matter what harm it does, no matter how you have to contract your activities, no matter what percentage of your total revenue it may be and no matter to what extent it may exhaust your revenues and leave you unable to carry on in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On a percentage basis, the board could, perhaps, plan its activities with more accuracy and more efficiency, whereas, on the basis of the Minister's proposal, it will find itself in the position that of all the money it gets in by deductions from totalisator pools, by levies upon bookmakers, or in any other way, it has, first of all, to set aside by far the greater part to hand over to the Exchequer and can only plan its programme for the year on the basis of what it calculates the residue will be after the Minister for Finance has got his whack.</P>
    <P>I have some hope that the Minister will recognise that he has made a mistake here.  I am quite certain that this levy was his idea.  Looking along the Front Bench of the Government, I cannot think of any other member who might have suggested it to him or forced it on him.  This was his idea and I am quite certain that, if he decides to drop the idea of the tax, no member of the Government will object and certainly no member of the Party sitting behind him will object, either.</P>

      <P>We are under the impression that the Minister rushed into this, without having given it serious consideration.  When one studies the accounts up to 31st March, 1955, as presented by the board, one sees that the revenue from the tote was £190,000.  When the overhead and operating expenses were deducted, the balance to the general purposes account was £113,000.  There was, therefore, out of the tote account a net figure to the general purposes account of £113,000.  Now, from the collection of levies on bookmakers' bets, the total taken in was £134,000. Expenses reduced that sum to a net £125,000.  We have two figures: £113,000 from the tote and £125,000 from the levy collection on bookmakers' bets.  That gives a total of £238,000.  Interest on investments yielded some £9,000 and there was a small balance from the previous year of £4,000.  If the Minister insists on a sum of £140,000 being assessed on the board in the present financial year, he must agree that the board will have to cut its expenditure under one or more headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the main items that will suffer?  Outside of office expenses and general expenses, the board last year contributed in stakes alone £105,000. They subsidised, or contributed, in whole or in part, to the carriage of horses to the extent of £37,000.  They made grants for the improvement of racecourses and of the totalisator buildings to the extent of £15,000.  To the <i>Irish Horse</i> and to the <i>Irish Racing and Breeding</i> publication they contributed over £3,000 which is distributed all over the world as an <Col N="590" /> advertisement and towards throwing a good light on the potentialities of the bloodstock industry.  They had a figure of £40,000 in reserve for stakes and for the carriage of horses and after all this expenditure all that was left to carry forward was a little over £12,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not stated which of these sections is to suffer.  Is it to be the contribution towards stakes?  We all know that many an owner can ill afford to run a horse without winning at least one stake in a year.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made no statement as to how the revenue is to be obtained.  The board has since repudiated his statement and has said that it would not be in the interest of racing to impose any further tax on the revenue from the bookmakers. They have got that out of their heads.  Suppose that there is no interference with the contribution towards stakes.  That means that that figure of £105,000 stands.  Suppose also that the Minister does not touch the grant which is being paid towards the improvement of racecourse buildings. There are contracts being carried out at the present time which will run into the next financial year.  That figure of £15,000 seems to be an average figure.  If the grants towards the stakes, the carriage of horses, and the publication of the <i>Irish Horse</i> and <i>Irish Racing and Breeding</i> are to be continued, would the Minister tell us where the revenue is to come from? Looking at the matter in the best possible light, if the board will get in this <Col N="591" /> year the £250,000 which it got in last year, and if they are to continue to expend the money as I have stated, and, at the same time, to pay the Revenue Commissioners £140,000, I think it is a physical impossibility for them to do so.  They cannot do it unless they dispose of some of their investments.</P>
      <P>The tenth report of the board should be out by now, but I find in the ninth report that the gross revenue for 1955 showed a contraction of £10,375.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the tenth report.  According to that report, in 1953, the yield in the levy on course bets, the bookmakers' section, to the Racing Board, was £153,000.  In 1954, the figure fell to £144,000, a drop of £9,000; and in 1955, the yield fell further to £134,000.  From 1953 to 1955, we have a drop of nearly £20,000 in the levy on course bets, one source of revenue to the board.  In 1953, the totalisator took in nearly £180,000.  In 1954, it took in £195,000 and in 1955, there was very little difference as it took in £195,000 odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out in the ninth annual report, signed by the chairman, Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, in the fourth paragraph, that racegoers in general are not concerned with gambling as was evidenced by the fact that 80 per cent. of the tickets on the totalisator are purchased in 2/- and 4/- units.  The marked proportion of the purchases of tickets is on the minimum unit.  It is quite obvious, and the Minister will agree, that there is a move on to squeeze out the small man from race meetings in this country.  Some weeks ago, the Minister gleefully announced that the figures for the Gowran Park meeting had increased.  Gowran is not characteristic of the other race meetings as it was one that was started comparatively recently, or one that has been revived recently.  In the past number of months, the only meeting which has shown increase in receipts was a recent Curragh meeting, which could be regarded as exceptional, <Col N="592" /> owing to the fact that it might be looked on as a try-out for the Derby. The day after the Minister brought in his Budget was a fine day and there was no apparent reason why the attendance at the Curragh should have dropped to the fantastic figure which it did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures were down by thousands of pounds.  The fact is that the punters said to themselves that there was obviously no point in considering going racing under the present Minister.  In the first place, it cost them more money to get there owing to the increased tax on petrol. The punter was paying extra to get to the course and then was getting very little yield from any bets he might place.  I am trying to bring home to the Minister what the ninth annual report of the Racing Board states&mdash; that 80 per cent. of the investments on the totalisator are in 2/- and 4/- units. The Minister is now going the right way to squeeze these small people out. If the Minister studied the reports, he would see that the dividends on which the totalisator is paying off have also dropped considerably.  I do not know whether the public is generally aware of the amount which the Racing Board contributes to various racing activities whereby the admission charges are kept down.</P>
      <P>It now appears that this is one of the sections, apparently, or one of the headings under which the Racing Board will have no option but to make a change.  The expressed wish of the Minister is that the stakes will not be interfered with, but in order to comply with the Minister's request it is quite obvious that the board will have to get its revenue somewhere. It would appear that a reduction in the amount they contribute towards admission charges will have to be made or that the contribution will have to be done away with altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer.  The Minister referred <Col N="593" /> to it in a very vague way.  Would he state, or could he state, whether it is definite that it is only for this year that the board will have to comply? That would change the complexion of the whole matter.  If Deputy Lemass's amendment were carried, it would mean, on the latest available figures, about £65,000.  I think that the board could manage to meet that for this year, and they could then postpone any drastic decision, such as cutting the contributions for the carriage of horses, for stakes or for racecourse improvements. If they could not meet it on that occasion, they could realise some of their investments, but that should only be as a last resort.  I trust that the Minister will say it is only for this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put down by Deputy Lemass.  I feel that in introducing this taxation the Minister is taking a retrograde step.  It is only a few years ago since a Bill was introduced in this House for the improvement of racing in this country.  As has been ably pointed out by the mover of the amendment, this is a completely retrograde step from the national point of view because it interferes with an industry which is merely struggling along and endeavouring to improve from year to year.</P>
      <P>We all know the state the racing industry was in before this Bill was introduced.  We now have the position that the punter must pay everything. We are told that no matter what extra taxation is put on, it is not going to interfere with racing at all.  The Minister is well aware that this increased taxation which has been introduced in the Budget is bound to have a detrimental effect, not alone on the board but on the encouragement of racing generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a big obligation to put on the &ldquo;bookies&rdquo;.  They have to come along and collect this money.  It has been pointed out here that the small man may be squeezed out altogether.  I feel that in this instance we could aptly apply the old saying that it is often dangerous to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  I feel that that is what the Minister is really doing if he insists on having his pound of flesh <Col N="594" /> collected.  He is doing great harm to the industry that this House tried to protect some years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose in any way to offer any comment on one portion of the remarks of Deputy Lemass except to say that I too regret that the chairman of the Racing Board thought it fit to resign.  The service that he has given to that board has been extensive and has been long. It was with great regret that I learned of his decision.  The chairman of the board, of course, is appointed as chairman by the board and not by the Government or by any Minister. Deputy Lemass was somewhat incorrect to that extent.</P>
      <P>As I understand Deputy Lemass's amendment and the statement he made, his purpose is to make the amount that would be payable fluctuate according to the takings. That was my original proposal, and if I made any blunder then in the eyes of Deputy Lemass, the blunder I made was in acceding to the request of the Racing Board's deputation that came to see me to change the fluctuating basis, which I had originally announced, to the basis of the fixed sum.</P>
      <P>So far as the proposal introduced is concerned, Deputy Lemass said I was the sole author of it.  I have no desire to shelter from any responsibility.  I introduced the Budget; I brought in the provisions of that Budget to this House; and I stand over all of them. I have no desire whatever to avoid any responsibility in that regard.  I will say this: that throughout the 12 months preceding the Budget I received many representations from many parts of the country, let alone this House, that I should, in considering the financial proposals that I would bring to it, consider putting horse racing on the same basis as, shall we say, greyhound racing or other entertainments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greyhound racing pays entertainments duty.  Those who go through the turnstiles to greyhound races pay duty as they pass through.  Those who go to horse racing do not pay that entertainment duty; and I freely give this to Deputy Lemass: that I refused to <Col N="595" /> accept those representations that were made to me because I accepted the view&mdash;I knew it was always the view of the Racing Board and I agreed it was the correct view&mdash;that the better method of dealing with the finances of horse racing was to keep the admission charges down as low as possible and to take what was necessary from the betting, whether it was through the bookmaker or through the totalisator. So far as the totalisators are concerned, I saw figures computed which showed that the additional 5 per cent. would have a very small effect, indeed, on the payment of any dividends, other than the extreme outside price dividends. I do not think there would be any great difficulties amongst punters if the dividend they got on the tote were 21/- instead of 22/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a fair price, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us, if we won that amount, would be quite satisfied to take the 21/-.  On the smaller dividends, there was, in fact, no real difference on a series of figures that were worked out for a specific series of meetings.  In France, for example, the tote deduction is 15 per cent.  It does not have any effect there and, frankly, I do not think it will have the slightest effect here, notwithstanding the statement of Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>My original proposal included that additional 5 per cent. for the tote and it also included a further 2½ per cent. for the levy on course bets.  The form of the legislation is such that all I could do was indicate to the Racing Board that they could increase the levy on bets laid on the course by that amount, if they so desired.  In that respect, it was not for me to fix the percentage they should charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the members of the Racing Board that a change in the levy from 2½ per cent. to 5 per cent. would have the disastrous results they suggested.  I did not agree that was so before they came to see me and nothing that has been said or that I have heard since would lead me to that belief.  In fact, as we all know, when the board was set up initially, the levy was 5 per cent. and it was <Col N="596" /> subsequently reduced to 2½ per cent. The purpose of the manner in which I originally introduced these proposals was to take a fluctuating percentage not from the Racing Board, but admittedly, as Deputy Burke said, from the punters.  That is a better method of doing it than doing it by entertainments duty.  I think the method I suggested could have operated without detriment to the functions of the Racing Board and without the suggestions that have been made.</P>
    <P>The Racing Board came to see me. They said that, rather than leave it on the fluctuation basis I had suggested, they preferred to have the amount set as a fixed sum.  It was at their request that I changed the basis from 2½ per cent. levy on course bets and a 5 per cent. levy on the tote to the fixed sum now contained in Section 29.  I told them that, so far as I was concerned, once I had accepted their request in that respect, how they made the money available was their business, but that there were three things I wanted to be assured upon and I obtained an assurance from them.</P>
    <P>I wanted to be assured that the way in which they would do it would not prejudicially affect the assistance given in the form of State money, because I felt that, without that assistance, that State money, it would not be possible for owners to keep horses in training in the present circumstances.  I got that assurance.  I told them that, so far as I was concerned, I regarded the assistance given for the carriage of horses to meetings as being essential to ensure an adequacy of runners. Without an adequacy of runners, there would not be the public attraction.  It was because of that inadequacy, due to the hard going, that the meeting to which Deputy O'Malley referred was so badly patronised.</P>
    <P>The third thing I said I thought was essential for the bloodstock industry was that the board should be enabled to continue its propaganda, publication of the <i>Irish Horse</i> and the <i>Year Book</i> which had an immense effect in making the Irish bloodstock industry known throughout the world, particularly as apart from the British bloodstock industry.  I got a specific <Col N="597" /> assurance from the Racing Board in respect of these three items.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the tenth annual report of the board.  He omitted, however, to refer to one sentence of it: &ldquo;Most of the essential schemes for reconditioning and improving racecourse tracks and buildings have now been undertaken.&rdquo;  That was in the report for the year ending 31st March, 1955.  There was the further task of completion largely carried out last year.</P>
    <P>I just want to correct one suggestion made by Deputy Lemass on an earlier stage.  He purported to quote an article from the <i>Financial Times</i> and to suggest that the correspondent of the <i>Financial Times</i> had described this proposal as like a factory owner disposing of his tools.  The <i>Financial Times</i> correspondent did not so describe this proposal.  If the Deputy looks at it, he will see that the <i>Financial Times</i> correspondent was quoting an opinion that was given to him, not his own opinion, and one which he was controverting to some extent.</P>
    <P>This is not as it has been construed, perhaps deliberately, by some people, a tax on the bloodstock industry.  I want to be perfectly fair.  I do not include Deputy Lemass amongst the people who so deliberately construed it, though it was quite clear that he had one purpose in one suggestion.  As I said, this has been construed as a tax on the bloodstock industry.  There is no justification whatsoever for that construction.</P>
    <P>The proposal which I introduced was a tax on less essential expenditure, and if anybody can suggest to me that betting, either through bookmakers or through the tote, cannot fairly be described as less essential expenditure, then he is a better man than I am.  It was a tax on the less essential expenditure and not in substitution for the levy that was there already to go to the Racing Board, but one to be superimposed on the ordinary revenue of the Racing Board, so that the Racing Board would have their revenue which they had collected <Col N="598" /> over the years for the purpose of improving the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest difficulty in defending the tax on less essential spending of this nature.  In the circumstances of our times, it is not a tax on the bloodstock industry.  It is not going to affect, according to the assurance given to me by the board, the three vital methods of assistance they have already given and are giving to the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I think the Racing Board have made a mistake in refusing to alter the levy on course bets. However, the Act gives them the power to do so.  They requested me to fix that sum, instead of fixing it by a percentage.  I think that my way would have been a better way.  I am not, I hope, so obstinate that, when people suggest a method to me by which exactly the same revenue will be made available to me, I am not prepared to consider their suggestion. That is what I did in this case and it is on that basis that the section is framed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister inadvertently made a case himself for a reduction of the tax.  He said that at one time it was 5 per cent.  Why was it reduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that, no matter what taxation he will put on the punter, it will not affect the Racing Board.  To bring that statement to its logical conclusion, it means that no matter what taxation you put on anything, it will not affect industry, and, in this case, the assumption is that it will not affect the Racing Board at all?  Why, then, did we introduce a Bill to try to help one of our national industries?  The Minister inadvertently made the best case as to why that tax should not be imposed. Listening to him, one could only come to the one conclusion.  He wanted to prove that, if taxation was imposed, nobody would suffer.  Of course somebody will suffer.  Surely if the punters, <Col N="599" /> the bookmakers and all concerned have to pay more, it follows that the Racing Board will have less money for carrying out the job this House wants them to carry out so far as horse breeding and racing in this country are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how the Minister may phrase it, I hold, with my colleagues, that any further tampering with this national industry, so far as taxation is concerned, will be detrimental.  It is easy enough to talk about non-essential spending.  If we were to take that kind of talk literally, if everybody cut down drastically on spending and walked instead of taking the bus or left his car at home and used a bicycle rather than buy petrol and gave up drinking and smoking and all other non-essential spending one could go so far west that he might go east and round about, and maybe north and south.  All this non-essential spending can be brought too far.  We have heard so much about it recently that it could <Col N="600" /> easily damage the economy of the country, if it were brought too far.</P>
    <P>I fear that this is interfering in a detrimental way with our national industry. We introduced a Bill into this House to protect it because we felt it was falling by the wayside.  We are concerned with the well-being of all sections of the community.  In his reply, the Minister made the very best case for us and the worst case possible for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which authorises or legalises the raid on the Road Fund which the Minister announced in his Budget statement.  It seems to be an extraordinary procedure in present circumstances, when employment is going up, when emigration is increasing, when the number of workers employed on road works and other constructional activities is less by 6,000 than the number employed at this time last year, that the Minister should decide to take from the Road Fund, from the money paid by motor users for road improvements, the amount of £500,000 for Exchequer purposes this year.</P>
      <P>The proposal of the Government in that regard is all the more noteworthy by reason of the fact that every member of the Government opposed most vehemently the proposals brought in here in 1953 by the previous Government, to increase the road tax on motor vehicles in order to expand the revenue, so that by reason of that expansion of revenue the volume of road works would be maintained. If there had been no increase in revenue, the rising costs of materials and labour would have involved very considerable contraction of the volume of that work and very considerable diminution in the employment it affords.</P>
      <P>There was not a member of the Parties supporting the Government who did not pledge himself most specifically to repeal these additional taxes when they got the opportunity. We know they did not repeal the taxes, and surely it is treating the public who elected them with something more than contempt to deprive them even of the benefits of the revenue to which these higher taxes yield.  If the Government think it is possible to maintain the roads of the country, notwithstanding the increasing volume of traffic upon them, with less money the obvious course for them is to reduce the charge upon the owners of motor vehicles which is the source of the Road Fund revenue.  There is apparently, judging by some remarks of the Minister, an idea in the mind of the Government that road works expenditure is in some way undesirable and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> I expressed the view here on another debate that the trunk roads of the country are, generally speaking, good enough for the traffic which is now passing over them.  I said there were exceptions to that general statement, particularly in relation to the trunk roads in the immediate vicinity of Dublin.  By and large, however, the expenditure required upon the trunk roads is maintenance expenditure only. There is not a Deputy in this House who does not know that the minor roads of the country are in an appalling state of disrepair.  These roads may have been good enough for the farmers living off the main roads at a time when the farmers were using horse traffic entirely.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, however, even the farmer has become mechanised.  His means of transport now is the motor car, his method of operation is with the tractor rather than the horse.  Consequently, there is a growing demand from all the rural areas for some scheme for remaking and maintaining these minor roads.  I have personal experience of the bad condition of many of them.  I was brought by indignant owners of farms and dwelling-houses to see the type of roads they were required to use.</P>
    <P>If the Government thought there was in the Road Fund this year a sum of £500,000 more than is needed for main road maintenance and reconstruction, surely the best use to make of it is to put it to the reconstruction of the minor roads concerning which there is such a tremendous volume of justifiable complaint, if indeed there is this surplus revenue available.  The cost of main road maintenance is going up and it is doubtful if the volume of the maintenance work that could be done with this year's Road Fund revenue would be any greater than what could be done with the Road Fund revenue yielded by a lower rate of tax four or five years ago.</P>
    <P>If so, it may be that some deterioration in maintenance standards will result.  But if the Government think otherwise and believe there is this surplus, there is an obvious place in which to use it&mdash;the reconstruction and maintenance of the minor roads.  The <Col N="604" /> Road Fund revenue comes entirely from the taxes motor users pay for the maintenance and reconstruction of roads.  That being so, that is where it should be used and not raided and absorbed into the Exchequer by a decision of the Minister for Finance. If the Government want to use motor transport as a means of revenue for the Exchequer, I have no doubt the normal procedure should be to operate the petrol tax to that end.</P>
    <P>This year, however, not merely has the petrol tax been very substantially increased, not merely is the road tax being maintained at the level that Deputies opposite thought was too high, but the revenue derived from that tax is not being allowed to go into the purpose for which it was intended. This is a completely unjustifiable decision and I do not think there are any Deputies outside those supporting the Government who would stand up and attempt to defend it.  I do not know what argument the Minister will put forward in defence of this proposal, but I feel sure those who vote with him will be interested to hear it because they have been racking their minds for some arguments to use in their constituencies in defence of it.  They have not found any yet and I doubt if the Minister will.  We on this side are completely opposed to the section and will divide the Dáil on it.</P>

      <P>Do chuir mé ceist indiu chuig an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil faoi an méid mílte bóthar atá faoi'n dtuaidh, agus tá a fhreagra agam anseo.  His reply says that there were 9,648.85 miles of main roads in the country and 39,501.37 miles of county roads.  Of the main roads, 8,276.28 are dust-free roads and of the 39,501 miles of county roads, 8,276.28 miles were dust-free, leaving a balance, approximately, of 31,000 miles of county roads to be done.  The Party opposite came into my constituency, as they did into every other constituency, and emphasised the necessity of doing the county roads.  They got many votes by that device.  They referred to the mechanisation of farms and to the fact that most of the farmers living along county roads were using motor vehicles, that motorcycles <Col N="605" /> were coming into use, that those going into industry in towns like Athlone, Clara and elsewhere, needed good roads.  They blamed Fianna Fáil for devoting money to main roads and claimed that not only would the inter-Party Government maintain the main roads but that they would increase expenditure on county roads.</P>
      <P>In the same table of figures which I received to-day, we got these facts for 1954.  There were 217 miles of road made dust free in the year 1954.  Last year there were 132 miles of main road made dust free.  In the year 1954 there were 891.17 of county road made dust free.  In 1955 there were only 825.98 made dust free; and the figures for the year ending 31st March, 1956, are not yet available.  Since then wages have gone up and through this Bill the Party opposite who were to make more and more miles of county roads dust free eliminated all possibility of improving the position.  We have a duty to our constituents to charge the Government here with a breach of faith on every platform in the country two years ago when they said they had a better programme and one which would give quicker results. At the rate of progress which is indicated by the robbing of the Road Fund by £500,000, this century will go out and the county roads of Ireland will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If ever there was justification for amortising a fund it would be the Road Fund.  As Deputy Lemass has pointed out the roads represent one of the best sources of employment. There is not a rural area where there are no other industries in which the men do not look forward to the road grants and to the employment which it entails.  In my constituency, both in the counties of Longford and Westmeath employment on the roads has decreased and when the representatives of the inter-Party groups have been challenged on local boards about this they have stated that it was Government policy to let the men work in Bord na Móna at this period of the year.  I can categorically state and prove beyond doubt that people have gone to Bord na Móna for work in <Col N="606" /> County Westmeath and they have been told the employment lists are full and they cannot be given work.  Consequently, as compared with this time 12 months, there is a rise in the number of unemployed at the labour exchange. I do not know what will face these men when it comes to the latter part of the year when they look forward to work on the roads.  For January, February and March the same amount of money is being allocated as was provided last year but the wages have gone up since last year and we certainly will not be able to do the same amount of work in these counties as we did in the last financial year.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own county&mdash;and I would point out that the Department of Finance gets a substantial amount of revenue in respect of cars from that county and it is not the biggest county &mdash;there are 821.60 miles of country roads and according to this statement, of that 821 miles 95.4 miles are steam-rolled. The extent of road that has been made dust free is 13.10 miles, and at that rate for county roads, when will that 800 miles be done?  It will not be done in the foreseeable future. The people who pay tax on their motor cars and go to Mass and meeting every Sunday are entitled to consideration. Whether you are in Connemara, Westmeath or Donegal, motor cars are the main type of transport.  The person with the hackney car brings in the older people who pay so much a seat. That is the picture at every country chapel.  The people who were looking forward to the yield from the Road Fund being committed to this work on the roads will be gravely disappointed. This is the most serious blow that this Government could give to rural improvement.  It is a grave injury to the rural community who, as Deputy Lemass says, are mechanised in farming and in every other way.</P>
    <P>We were criticised for our huge expenditure on what were called autobahns. I do not intend to enter upon an argument at this stage of the Bill on that question, but I will say that as an individual I stand by the Department in their policy of constructing <Col N="607" /> good roads.  In smaller countries than this I have seen better roads than there are here and if merchandise of every description from our farms is to be conveyed on the roads, the roads would want to be a certain width to ensure safety.  As regards the roads leading from Dublin, all of them, with the exception of one or two, are unsafe.  Going out from Dublin along the Navan road you have to go into County Meath before you are safe because it winds like a serpent and is too narrow.  If we want to be progressive we must construct good roads, roads that can stand up to the amount of traffic put on them.</P>
    <P>The main point I stood up to make in this debate is that the Government have broken faith with the people in dealing with this Road Fund.  They are not honouring their word and they have gravely disappointed the people. They are creating unemployment in County Westmeath and other counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The pilfering of £500,000 from the Road Fund can mean only one or other of two things.  It can mean that the present Government are satisfied with the rate of progress that can be carried out by spending £500,000 less on our main, county and other types of roads or that the present Government, due to their blundering of one kind and another, have decided that the financial position is such that they are prepared to let the roads of this country go hang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the former is the consideration which has given rise to this raiding of the Road Fund, I should like to point out a few facts to the Minister and to the Government.  First of all, there is the question of roads leading into food producing and fuel producing areas. The Government know, the people of <Col N="608" /> the country know, everybody knows that this country is facing a fuel crisis of the first magnitude.  Month after month there are steep increases in the price of imported fuel coupled with a steady decrease in the quality of that fuel.  Any Government that would look ahead even for a couple of years would see that a fuel crisis is developing.  If the Government did look ahead and saw that such a crisis was developing at a very rapid rate, instead of pilfering £500,000 from the Road Fund, they should make that sum available for the reconstruction of existing bog roads. They should go further and make some of that £500,000 available for the construction of new roads into virgin bogs to enable those bogs to be opened, developed and to become a source of production for the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be employed usefully and the £500,000 could be expended very usefully to take these men off the unemployed register and put them into useful work of the type I have mentioned, work which would provide employment and which would produce wealth for the country and which would also prevent <Col N="609" /> the fuel crisis to which I have referred. It would also have the effect of preventing the Minister coming in next year, as he did last year, with import levies, purchase taxes and so on. There would be a healthier position in regard to our balance of payments if there were a reduction in the importation of fuel of a type that has deteriorated to the extent that hardly justifies the cost of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>My second point is that more money should be expended on the development of roads leading into food producing areas.  As the other two speakers have mentioned, farmers who have changed over to modern transport and modern methods of farming find that they cannot make-do with the roads which were in existence years ago and upon which very little, and in some cases nothing at all, has been expended in the interim.  Over the past 12 months, the public mind was being conditioned for such a move as has taken place.  There was a great deal of talk about the construction of autobahns and it was made clear that autobahns would not be constructed. The main roads will suffer.  Even with the £500,000 the same amount of work as was carried out last year could not be carried out this year because of increases in the price of road materials, the cost of labour and so on.  Admittedly, the Road Fund is greater this year than it was last year.  Notwithstanding that, even if the Road Fund had not been raided to the extent of £500,000, the amount of road construction and reconstruction that would be possible would not be greater than last year.  As a matter of fact, it would be less.  How much less will it be when the figure is reduced by £500,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that there are many useful roads leading into fuel producing areas and food producing areas that require a great deal of expenditure.  If this raiding of the Road Fund is to become a practice and if £500,000 or a greater sum is taken <Col N="610" /> out of the Road Fund next year, we can only conclude that the second alternative that I mentioned in opening is the policy of the Government, that is, to let the roads, county roads, roads into food producing areas and roads into fuel producing areas, go hang.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Deputies are dealing with this question from the standpoint of the employment content. I should like to say a few words about this question in relation to the problem which the Minister is facing of finding it difficult to raise capital for projects of State.  I believe that for a great number of years we have had an entirely escapist attitude towards the whole problem of communications in this country.  I do not think that any Government has ever investigated fully facilitating communications, reducing the time spent by the whole community in getting from one place to another and transporting goods from one place to another and I do not believe that the present Minister for Local Government has worried his head about consulting some of the very valuable sources of information in the Federation of Road Research Laboratories in Great Britain in regard to the wear and tear resulting from poor communications.</P>
      <P>I remember reading some information, that is accepted by most road authorities as accurate, about what happens when in a period of increasing transportation the amount spent on main, or any other class of roads, is reduced.  The Minister wants to avoid imports; he wants to avoid capital expenditure on non-essentials.  I would not be in the least surprised if the cut of £500,000 in the Road Fund did not have a net adverse effect from the standpoint of imports and the standpoint of unnecessary replacement of capital assets in the form of transport and from the standpoint of the cost of producing food for export in this country.</P>
      <P>I cannot remember all of these figures but I remember a very interesting memorandum presented by the Federation of Road Research Laboratories some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> It was clearly demonstrated that to reduce expenditure on road maintenance and improvement, when traffic was increasing, would result in a net increase in capital expenditure for the replacement of vehicles and a net increase in maintenance expenditure.  It is more than likely that the Minister will not succeed in reducing capital commitments for less essential purposes and non-productive purposes.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of what has already been said about the effect of poor communications on agricultural production. We suggested to the Minister for Local Government that he should make a survey of the whole country in respect of non-public roads. We pointed out that there were some 50,000 miles of public roads and an estimate of between 15,000 and 20,000 miles of private roads.</P>
    <P>This is a matter about which there is far too little discussion in this House.  The entire social structure of the countryside is changing, due to the poor character of non-public roads. There is a reduction in the sale value of tens of thousands of farms at the end of boreens, because of the inability to till or cultivate the land.  There are thousands of acres of land upon which no limestone can be applied, because of the poor approach down the boreens. Yet there has been no genuine study of the problem and no Government since the war has yet attempted to find the net beneficial result from seeing what could be done to bring up to date these non-public roads and trying to make it possible to carry out modern agricultural processes at the end of these roads, instead of the position, as it is to-day, of cultivation beginning to decrease at the end of these boreens.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that funds are spent every year&mdash;funds initiated by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;some based on unemployment in the area and some of them contributory grants towards the repair of these roads.  The problem has never been properly tackled, has never been properly examined and has never even been, in the surveys, so far as I know, of a number of counties by the Minister for Local Government, so that the whole problem could be examined with the object <Col N="612" /> of seeing whether capital expenditure on road improvement would be genuinely beneficial to agricultural production and not related to giving employment, but related definitely to quick transportation of agricultural produce and increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this matter, one related to employment and the other related absolutely to the pure question of agricultural production. It, I admit, is quite an elaborate and technical study and there are a great many papers which, for the ordinary person like myself, it is quite impossible to understand.  They involve technicalities as to the relationship of wear and tear of vehicles, usage of vehicles and the type which will pass along various roads and the expenditure on them.  But work of this kind has been done.  There are estimates which can be made; they have never been made in this country.</P>
    <P>Here we have £500,000 in the Road Fund and yet we know that the social structure, the pattern of farm life, is changing very rapidly in many areas as a result of the fact that the improvements in roads are not related to the improvement in general living standards and the number of tractors and mechanical appliances now passing along the roads.</P>
    <P>I think it is a serious problem and I am putting it up to the Minister to consider in that light whether a transfer of capital such as this from one purpose to another is of genuine advantage to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal of the Minister for Finance to raid the Road Fund by £500,000 is, to say the least of it, very bad news for rural communities and local authorities all over the country.  We well remember only a few short years ago when the previous Minister for Local Government, in the Fianna Fáil Government, brought in a proposal to increase the Road Fund with the definite object of providing funds to enable local authorities to improve their road services all over the country and to give more rural employment. We also remember that the then Opposition, and the Leader of <Col N="613" /> the Opposition, asked for a specific promise from the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, that the full revenue from the increased Road Fund would be spent on roads.</P>
      <P>He gave the assurance, as long as he was Minister and as long as Fianna Fáil were in office, that no portion of that fund would be used for anything but the improvement of roads and that it would be all allocated to local authorities for that purpose.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that there are tens of thousands of miles of roadways used by ratepayers and taxpayers which are impassable.  Instead of robbing the fund most rural Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the time is opportune for some additional capital to be provided from the Exchequer towards helping local authorities to bring up their roads to a decent standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers has adverted to the non-public roads.  There are thousands of miles of them and tens of thousands of our best citizens living on impassable boreens.  Local authorities have never a hope of directly taxing land and the primary production of the country to bring those boreens up to any kind of decent standard.  No wonder we have the flight from the land and a reduction in rural population because the man at the end of a boreen is not satisfied to try to exist by the use of the spade and the &ldquo;loy&rdquo; as did his great-grandfather. He is entitled to modern implements just as the man living on a main road is.  No case has been made for this.</P>
      <P>We have not heard a single voice from behind the Government or the Minister justifying the proposed act of raiding the fund to the extent of £500,000.  The Labour Party are completely silent.  They are dumb whether of malice or otherwise.</P>

I am sure Deputy O'Leary will tour the crossroads in Wexford and explain that in full, and a lot of other things too, perhaps, that need to be explained as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>His stock-in-trade is that he voted for an increase in wages. When the Minister comes to rob the Road Fund and deprive these men of full-time employment on road works, Deputy O'Leary plays another tune. <Col N="616" /> The Minister, in his statement, so far as he explained the position at all, said that he proposes to use this money for capital development.  God bless the mark!  We have travelled a long way in a few years.  The Minister for Finance in the last Coalition Government was always very optimistic in his announcements.  He came in here in the last Coalition Government and explained about the two Budgets &mdash;the capital Budget and the ordinary day-to-day expenditure Budget, the under-and over-the-line-Budget.  We remember the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, sitting over there, thumping the desk in front of him and saying that this was the type of Budget that should have been in operation for many years. It was the Coalition's idea, conceived by the brilliant Minister for Finance at that time&mdash;a two-way Budget, an under-and over-the-line-Budget.  Then we heard about the capital investment and the repatriation of external assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of external assets does not arise on this section.  The Deputy cannot relate everything to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no need to rob the Road Fund of £500,000 or something else of £5,000 if any of the £225,000,000 of external assets that were to be repatriated had been re-repatriated. But they were not repatriated and invested in order to improve the resources of the country and get greater output.  That was the boast of the present Taoiseach and the present Attorney-General, Deputy McGilligan.  They were to do everything under the two-way Budget, the under- and over-the-line Budget.  And now the Minister for Finance has to raid the Road Fund in order, I suppose, to secure more credit.  That is all he can do.  I think the Deputies sitting behind him, particularly the Deputies of the Labour Party, should give us some reason for this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Road Fund has increased since 1953 as a result of Deputy Smith's proposals is no justification for robbing it to-day.  Those proposals at the time were opposed by the then Opposition, tooth and nail.  The Government <Col N="617" /> had only a slender majority in this House and organised groups were set up to try to bring the Government down and wean the slender support they had from them.  The galleries of Leinster House, Leinster lawn and Kildare Street were filled with taxi-men from all over the country who, it was alleged, would find themselves on the bread-line as a result of Deputy Smith's proposals.  We all remember that.  It happened only three or four years ago.  But there is not even a salt tear being shed now by Deputy O'Leary and his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen is doing all the crying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of their petrol has increased.  Prices of motor car accessories have gone up.  The road tax has gone up.  Nevertheless that increased taxation will not go towards improving road surfaces to save tyres and springs.  Some consideration should be shown to the people.  We were wrong three years ago, according to the then Opposition, when we proposed to increase the tax on the huge lorries drawing petrol and oil.  Some of them are to-day paying not £40 but £400, and the Minister has the advantage of that increase.  There has been no suggestion that taxation in that regard will be reduced although that was one of the promises made by the present Government two years ago.  I am sure they got many votes on that promise alone, that Road Fund taxation would be brought back to the level at which it was under the previous Coalition. That was another of the promises made.  I am sure Deputy O'Leary promised the people many a time at the crossroads in County Wexford that, if he had any say in government, he would use his influence to reduce the road tax.  The road tax has brought in another £4,000,000 or £5,000,000.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of vehicles using the roads and a considerable increase in tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all fairness, the Minister should have continued the policy of the predecessor to the Minister for Local Government and made that money available to the county councils and local authorities all over the country. No matter how much we can raise from <Col N="618" /> the ratepayers, it will be another hundred years, at least, before all the roads in this country are brought up to a decent standard.  Many millions of pounds must be spent before that is done.  The Minister ought to be quite satisfied with what he is getting from the vehicle duties and the petrol duties.  It is held by very many people that the petrol duties should be spent on improving the roads and in thus giving much needed rural employment. The big proportion of money spent on road making is spent on the labour content of making a road.  Most of the raw materials are cheap and that type of work has a large labour content.</P>
    <P>If something is not done, we will find ourselves without any rural employment at all taking into account the increased wages.  I do not know how the Minister is going to justify the provision of sums from another fund&mdash;I forget the name of it&mdash;next winter.  The usual amount is £1,500,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell the country and the local authorities whether they are to get a grant from the National Development Fund in the coming winter to continue employment in the slack period of the year.  I think he has already announced that they will not.  That means that, in addition to this £500,000, there will be £1,500,000 less for road employment in the coming year, and the last three months of this financial year will be lean ones for the local authorities.  Usually all the money is spent by October or November, and if we are to have a further cut under this benevolent <Col N="619" /> Government, things will be very blue, indeed.</P>
      <P>I am sure that we will hear the Labour Party defending this before the debate is over and that they will justify the robbing of that fund and the taking of it over so that the Minister for Finance can spend it on goodness knows what.</P>

Deputy Allen opened his speech by stating that there was now a larger amount of rural unemployment than there has been for the past 30 years.

To get back to the figures&mdash;the number of people unemployed in relation to road work at the moment is 200 less than it was this time 12 months ago and it is 1,500 less than it was a couple of months ago.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that everybody is trying to defend this.  It does not require any defence.  It is right to secure that the burden of taxation should be borne equally throughout the community. This represents 10 per cent. of the old Road Fund.  It is £500,000 out of £5,500,000.  The case was made by Deputy Lemass that the trunk roads are good enough.  That is a discovery <Col N="620" /> made by Fianna Fáil Deputies since they went to that side of the House. We have been preaching that for years.  There is no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Deputy Lemass said that the minor roads are in an appalling state.  They are not too good, to put it bluntly.  Which Government did anything in relation to these roads?  In the present year, more money will be spent on the county roads than on the main roads.</P>

      <P>Of course the main roads are done.  Deputy Lemass said that the trunk roads are good enough. The trunk roads and the main roads are the same.  There are no such separate categories as main roads and trunk roads.  I recollect a proposal, when the other Party was in office, to spend £1,500,000 on the road from Newlands Cross to Naas&mdash;15 miles of road at £100,000 a mile.  The county roads cost about £15,000 a mile and for that sum of £1,500,000 1,000 miles of county roads could be done.  A large part of that sum was spent before the present Government came into office and there were various other schemes, some of which had to be finished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy spoke of the number of miles of county roads done in County Westmeath, one of the worst counties in the country.  The Midland counties are the counties in which the county roads were worst.</P>

The figure for 1954 is 891 miles, and in 1955, 825 miles&mdash;much the same amount of road&mdash;but I take it in 1953 it was something like 600 or 650 miles.  There is no use in the Party opposite maintaining that the only method of providing rural employment in this country is on the roads.  There are other methods of providing rural employment in this country than on the roads.  If there are not, both sides of the House might as well pack up and go home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputy Childers talked about the process of farming at the ends of <Col N="622" /> boreens, the quick transportation of agricultural produce and used a large number of other expressions of that sort.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Lemass that, on the whole, the main roads in this country are in fairly good order.  Personally, I would suggest that the Minister for Local Government would transfer more of the funds according as the main road schemes are completed.  I see no reason for these big schemes, which are costing immense sums of money and are taking in agricultural land.  I would far rather see the county roads&mdash;the roads you meet when you come off the main roads&mdash;put into a proper state of repair. That is being progressively done and I hope it will continue to be done to a greater extent by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I withdraw.  He is defending the action of the Minister for Finance in taking £500,000 from the Road Fund.  I was very interested listening to the Minister for Finance making his statement on the Budget, and on the Resolutions that followed his Budget statement, concerning the precarious position of the country.  I thought it was an advance warning of the bad state in which we might find ourselves and that perhaps the present position was really not as bad as that altogether, but when I found that £500,000 was being taken from the Road Fund and that that was permitted <Col N="623" /> by the Minister for Local Government, I came to the conclusion&mdash;as thousands of people in this country have come to the conclusion&mdash;that this country is apt to find itself in bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>I could not understand why the Minister for Local Government, who comes from the congested areas of Donegal, should permit £500,000 to be taken away, thus creating unemployment and fostering emigration in a county which, according to the recent census, was the highest on the graph as far as emigration figures are concerned.  It is all very well to smile and to have jokes about this, but after all it is not an insignificant matter to keep 2,000 people in employment for 52 weeks of the year at the modest sum of £5 per week.  Yet that is the position.</P>
      <P>What is to happen now?  After all, if you are to throw a further 2,000 people on the unemployment register, what alternative employment is to be offered to them?  Where are they to be absorbed?  What about the small uneconomic holders and the people in the congested areas and the Gaeltacht districts to whom so much lip sympathy has been paid and to help whom a new Ministry has been created?  Is this the first instalment of the manner in which they are to be helped&mdash;by putting at least 1,000 of them on the unemployment register and taking the work away from them?</P>
      <P>It is all very well to talk of £500,000. What about the National Development Fund, a considerable slice of which was made available to local authorities for expending on the improvement of roads?  It is immaterial&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to debate it on this section, and I will accept your ruling.  Nevertheless, £500,000 is being taken away, and it is immaterial to the person depending on employment on the roads, and for whom this £500,000 has been provided, whether we spend five minutes or five hours debating whether it is on the main roads or county roads or cul-de-sac roads that the money is to be expended. All they are anxious to secure is the employment to enable themselves and their families to live in very frugal comfort indeed.</P>
      <P>It is all right to say that the main roads are good enough.  The main roads are pretty good, and no one need be thanked for having brought them to the standard to which they have been brought save Fianna Fáil.  But when we see this year the amount of traffic being diverted from the railways to the main roads, when we see the huge amount of traffic on them and when we also realise the number of accidents occurring, I do not think there was anything wrong in improving the main roads in this country.</P>

    <P>NOTES:&mdash;1.  Figures for 31st March 1956 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>2.  The above figures are based on returns furnished by the county councils.  It will be noted that &ldquo;nil&rdquo; returns are shown in the last column in some cases; in fact, considerable work on county road improvement was undertaken in the counties concerned in the years in question.</P>
