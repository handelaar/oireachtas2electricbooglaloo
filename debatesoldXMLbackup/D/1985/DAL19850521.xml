      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. J. Walsh</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will make funds available to the Maritime Institute of Ireland in the form of grant-aid to assist in preserving the National Maritime Museum in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>State funding is already being made available for this purpose.  The total public expenditure on the project to date amounts to £142,000.  Due in large measure to the assistance provided by AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency, I understand that the museum is now in good structural order.  The work done involved the renovation of the basement area to provide storerooms and workrooms, the re-slating of the roof, the reconstruction of the balcony area to give additional floor space for exhibitions and the refurbishment of the museum's ancillary rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the only source of finance available <Col N="1460" /> is members' subscriptions?  In view of the fact that the museum is the only repository of our seafaring and maritime traditions, would he consider making an annual grant-in-aid available for the upkeep of the museum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Local museums are normally funded by local authorities who are very good, or by private sponsorship. There is an extraordinary number of worthy causes in this respect; indeed I have had a number of telephone calls already this morning from constituents following the finding of the artefacts from Armada shipwrecks at Streedagh, making a similar appeal to the Deputy's. Unfortunately, there are inadequate funds to handle all the matters for which we are already responsible and at the moment there are no funds available.  I have the greatest sympathy, particularly for a maritime museum and, indeed, the local museums which are springing up all over the country.  There has been a greatly increased interest in such museums. The National Museum are giving the maximum co-operation and I am hoping to establish travelling exhibitions. This is something which I have already set in train and I hope to have in full flourish next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that this is not a local museum.  It is the National Maritime Museum.  Has the Minister anything more to offer them than sympathy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, all I have to offer is sympathy.  In so far as funds may become available from any new sources or from the Exchequer, this museum deserves priority.  It is doing a unique job here.  In addition to funds, we have been very helpful to it as far as the <Col N="1461" /> National Museum is concerned and one of the main artefacts in the Maritime Museum is the Bantry Bay boat from the Deputy's own territory.</P>

Naturally, this is something in which I have great interest.  I would be very keen to see these artefacts on display near the location in which they have been found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together and to circulate a statement showing the information made available to me.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>(1)  The number of persons who were citizens of the EC countries other than the United Kingdom and of Spain and Portugal and who were registered under the aliens legislation on 31 December 1984 were as follows: Belgium, 179; Denmark, 172; France, 1,209; Germany (FRG), 2,027; Greece, 37; Italy, 1,187; Luxembourg, 5; Netherlands, 1,166; Portugal, 72; Spain, 1,323.</P>
      <P>Note: Under the aliens legislation, aliens who are resident in the State for three months or more are required to register with the Garda Síochána. Alien in this context does not include persons born in Great Britain or Northern Ireland and in addition certain categories of alien, e.g. children under 16, are exempt from the requirement to register.</P>
      <P>Source: Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>(2)  On the basis of the replies in the 1983 sample Labour Force Survey the estimated number of United Kingdom nationals usually resident in the State in May 1983 was 56,800.</P>
      <P>Note: As it is based on a sample inquiry the estimate is prepared to the nearest hundred persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the charge for visits in connection with the farm modernisation scheme was introduced on 1 March 1983, £687,600 was collected up to 31 March 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the enormous amount that has been collected under the heading of inspection fees and the fact that that money has come directly out of the pockets of farmers, thus leaving that much less to invest in holdings that were in the process of development, will the Minister of State not agree it is time that the collection of such fees was reviewed with a view to eliminating them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a budgetary matter in the year in question.  The number of visits and the obvious activity in that section proves that there were many farmers interested in the scheme in the period under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the number would be in excess of two or three per grant application.  This would mean a total of at least £60 per application to be collected in respect of inspection fees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to my reply of 13 December, 1984 which sets out the position regarding the western drainage scheme.  At 30 April 1985, 23,912 schemes had been completed relating to 135,372 hectares.  A sum of £9 million is provided in the 1985 Estimates for field drainage.  Applications under the drainage scheme have not been accepted since 1 February 1984.  An examination is proceeding of the options available for dealing with the outstanding applications which cannot be catered for within the extension of the scheme made possible by additional funds provided under the national plan.  At this stage it is not possible to anticipate the outcome of the examination and to indicate when further applications can be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify again what he said about applications not being accepted after 1 February 1984?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that people who applied between 1 January 1982 and 1 February 1984 will be considered for western drainage grants in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is an in-depth review taking place &mdash; almost reaching conclusion &mdash; about the whole question of drainage, as such.  I am more than hopeful that in the very near future the people involved in that limbo situation will be looked after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the initial projected aim of the western drainage scheme was to drain 150,000 hectares.  That was a number of years ago when our party were in power. <Col N="1469" /> Can the Minister give any commitment to this House, to farmers in the west, and particularly to those in his own county that the figure of 150,000 hectares targeted will be completed at least in 1985? Furthermore, can he confirm that any applications outstanding from January 1982 &mdash; at least for some part of 1982 &mdash; will be considered this year for immediate action and commencement of works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, we were talking about the plan as first envisaged, which was for 100,000 hectares, which was increased a year or two later by another 50,000 hectares.  Because we have almost reached that ceiling it is true that there will be a certain number of applications in the FDS offices dating back to early 1982 that are being looked after at this stage under the old western drainage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has said it is clear that almost sufficient schemes have been approved up to January 1982, that very few since will be entertained under the limit of 150,000 hectares.  Would the Minister confirm that?  Secondly, has any scheme been formulated by his Department for submission to Brussels for an extension of the limit of 150,000 hectares and, if so, how many thousand hectares are they seeking?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first part of the Deputy's question it is not true to say that the entire ceiling has now been arrived at with regard to the 150,000 hectares.  For obvious reasons, particularly because of extra funding from the Exchequer under the national plan, what has happened is that the FDS offices have been instructed to issue approvals up to that level.  While it is very difficult to anticipate exactly the number of people who have applied and now wish to go ahead it would appear that applications for the first three or four months of 1982 will be accepted under the old scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> In answer to the second part of the Deputy's question, there are at present moves afoot in my Department to initiate a new drainage scheme.  For obvious reasons I am not at liberty to announce it.  It will mean that there will be adequate funding available for a fairly large amount of drainage and land improvement in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason sheep headage rates for 1985 have been reduced by £1 per ewe is to provide funds to enable the off-farm income limit under the disadvantaged areas scheme to be raised from £3,500 <Col N="1473" /> to £6,400 per annum.  Many small and progressive farmers in the west who supplement their farm income with seasonal earnings from forestry, county council work etc., and were previously excluded from the schemes, will now benefit.  The Exchequer funds available would not otherwise enable this desirable improvement to be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the reason for this was combined pressure from small farmers everywhere and from the Opposition in this House on several occasions last year <i>vis-à-vis</i> off-farm income.  The subject was on the Order Paper on several occasions.  At that stage I believe it was open to a certain type of farmer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC allows us to make advance payments under the 1984-85 ewe premium scheme but only to applicants in the disadvantaged areas. As advance payments had to be made before ewe numbers could be verified at inspections and as the definition of eligible animals had been changed under the 1984-85 scheme, it was necessary to guard against the danger of overpaying applicants who exaggerated their ewe numbers.  The ewe numbers claimed this year, therefore, were checked against the estimated numbers of similar ewes on which premium was paid in 1983-84 and advance payments were made on the lower figure.</P>
      <P>A large number of this year's applicants had no ewes in 1983-84 and the ewe numbers quoted in these cases could only be verified by inspection of flocks.  By the time all these inspections would be completed, the current marketing year would have elapsed and the balance of premium would have become due for payment.  In the circumstances, my Department have decided to exercise the option to pay the full premium in these cases instead of advance payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of advance was fixed in February by the EC and most payments were made here by the end of March.  Some £3.9 million in advance payments to over 18,000 applicants in the disadvantaged areas has been paid so far out of EC funds.  The balance of the premium will be paid in these cases and the full premium in another 15,000 cases when the <Col N="1475" /> EC determine the precise amount of the full premium for the 1984-85 marketing year now ending.</P>

Will he confirm that only applicants who were on the master file in 1984 were considered for payment, that any new applicant in 1985 was not considered unless he was on that file in 1984?  Will he further confirm that in respect of people who were on the file in 1984 and applied again in 1985, 50 per cent of the lower number were taken, irrespective of whether that number was lowest in 1984 or 1985?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with the representations made to me that some prior payment should be issued in the winter period or very early spring to pay sheep farmers for peak feeding.  To my knowledge this is the first time the Department have paid without prior inspection.  I stand open to contradiction but I am not aware of schemes where money has been paid without prior inspection.  Obviously we had to establish some type of criteria.  Because of the increasing numbers of farmers who are keeping sheep for the first time, it has not been possible to take them on board on this occasion.  It is reasonable to assume, given the implications of the scheme, that they will be paid in full at the end of August or early September.</P>

Could he give an indication of the cost of administering this advance payment? Will he admit to the House that farmers received no sheep payment whatever in 1984?  A scheme for 1984 was paid in 1985.  Can he accept that this was a contribution to meeting the costs of sheep farmers over the winter period?</P>

      <P>An option was given by the Commission to member states as to whether or not to pay the first instalment.  I am not aware whether other EC countries have followed our lead but I believe it was the proper thing to do due to cases of hardship.  Sheep farmers were given a first instalment to allow them to overcome costs at a hungry time of the year.  Most sheep farmers have accepted that it was a reasonable thing to do.  Because there were no pre-inspections, I am sure the cost was very small. However, it is a separate question and I have not the precise answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the House to get the impression that they will not be paid.  Of course they will be paid. When we negotiated the scheme last year there was extreme pressure by some <Col N="1477" /> countries on the whole system and structure of this payment.  We were pressed very hard to accept payment on the basis of a lambing percentage and the Minister and I went to extreme lengths not to accept this system.  In the lowlands most ewes would have one lamb each but on the hills the lambing percentage might be only 60 per cent.  For that reason we had to establish different criteria and the delay to which the Deputy refers was in the best interests of the sheep industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules governing payment of grants under the disadvantaged areas schemes have not been changed in relation to the points raised by the Deputy.  The schemes are designed to maintain the farmer population in those areas instead of directing payments to absentee landowners and, in fact, the principal requirement of the schemes, namely, that applicants must farm and occupy at least three hectares &mdash; seven and a half acres &mdash; has remained unchanged since 1975.</P>
      <P>Where, however, applicants do not farm and occupy their holdings full-time for the reasons cited by the Deputy or for any other reason, each case is treated on its merits.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Will the Minister agree that it is most unfair where <Col N="1478" /> a farmer has to supplement his income by seeking work elsewhere that he should be debarred from the scheme?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the reasons the ewe premium grant was not paid in many parts of County Galway because of alleged poor quality ewes; and if limestone in the area is a contributory factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no parts of County Galway excluded from participation in the ewe premium scheme because of poor quality ewes in those areas.  Under the 1983-84 scheme, the rejection rate for County Galway, at 2.7 per cent was, in fact, lower than the national average of 3.4 per cent.  Comparable figures for the 1984-85 ewe premium scheme are not available as inspections are still in progress.</P>
      <P>While it is commonly believed that grazing on limestone land can contribute to wear in ewe's teeth, conclusive evidence is lacking.  In any event, age, conformation, poor udders and foot defects are the main factors in the rejection of ewes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers in County Galway, and other areas, have been told by inspectors from the Department that premiums will not be paid because of what is known as &ldquo;broken mouth&rdquo; problem in ewes?  Is the Minister aware that the head of the EC Commission, and the Minister for Agriculture, told the IFA sheep committee delegation that premiums would be paid for <Col N="1479" /> all ewes provided they were pregnant or had lambs at foot?  I am sure the Minister is aware that that was referred to in an article in last week's issue of <i>The Farmers Journal.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give the House the factual position about the criteria laid down for the payment of the ewe premium which in my view are very sensible.  The House is aware that the EC are footing the bill and it is their view that ewes must be of a standard that are likely to have lambs and stand up to winter conditions.  It is only reasonable in sheep husbandry that any farmer who wants to get the optimum return from his flock should want his ewes to have reasonable teeth, good udders and so on. Those things have been part and parcel of good sheep husbandry for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

The Minister has ruled that out and I accept his view.  Will the Minister tell the House who gave the instructions? Was it the Department or the EC who gave the instructions that rejection should be the order of the day for farmers seeking a premium for their ewes or was it because, as was reported in <i>The Farmers Journal,</i> that the ewes had &ldquo;broken mouth&rdquo; that they were turned down?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to disadvantaged areas, and to the drawing of boundaries between the more and less severely handicapped parts of those areas, cannot be dealt with on a county-by-county basis because the relevant physical characteristics do not respect county boundaries. The position must be considered in terms of broad regions possessing by and large the characteristics laid down in the basic Directive 75/268/EC and not in terms of the situation on individual farms.  The characteristics concerned are: adverse physical handicaps, low economic returns and low or dwindling population depending mainly on agriculture, all three of which must be simultaneously present and proven to the satisfaction of the Community authorities.  The adjustments recently proposed by the Commission to the boundaries of our disadvantaged areas represent the maximum possible area meeting these requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received notice from the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1588" /> that he proposes to make a statement under Standing Order 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the House of the outcome of the recent negotiations in the Council of Agriculture Minister on farm prices and related matters for 1985-86.</P>
      <P>This year the price negotiations were particularly long and difficult, but eventually agreement was reached on 16 May. I would, of course, have preferred an earlier result but no one will deny that a good result in May is better than a poor one in March.  The outcome represents a gain of some £50 million to the Irish farm sector arising from improvements over the 1984-85 situation or a gain of about £70 million if we include improvements in the Council decisions as compared with what the Commission had originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the milk sector the Council agreed to allocate 58,000 tonnes to Ireland for super-levy purposes in 1984-85 and 1985-86 so that our total quantity for each of those years is based on the final figure for our milk deliveries in the year 1983 instead of the provisional figure used in March 1984.  While this represents an acceptance of the justice of our case, it is also a recognition of the special position of milk production in our economy.  It removes the uncertainty that has been affecting our milk producers and processors, and establishes an important and compelling precedent for the three remaining years of the super-levy system. In the case of other member states there will be a reduction of one million tonnes, or about 1 per cent, in their allocation for 1985-86, as was provided for in the Council agreement of March 1984.  I might add that this extra one million tonnes of a reduction is in addition to the 6 per cent, 7 per cent, 8 per cent or 9 per cent reduction which various countries had to endure in the last marketing year whereas we got an increase of 4.6 per cent.  As regards the years beyond 1985-86, I made it clear in a statement to the Council that Ireland's rights concerning the arrangements made last year remain <Col N="1589" /> intact.  The overall effect of the super-levy is now being felt throughout the EC as a whole and the reduction in milk deliveries should help to strengthen the market.  The stocks of skim milk powder in intervention have in fact already been reduced significantly and a similar reduction in the large quantity of butter in intervention would help greatly to improve the overall situation for the future.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the Council agreement in connection with the super-levy in that the option of making transfers within a region and from one region to another is to be continued for the 1985-86 marketing year.  In addition, any super-levy due will henceforth be payable annually instead of quarterly.  Both of these provisions are quite useful to us. Later in the year the Commission is to make proposals for a Community premium for the cessation of milk production but it is intended that any quotas bought up should not be reallocated.</P>
    <P>The milk equivalent of the intervention support has been increased by 1.5 per cent while the co-responsibility levy has been reduced from 3 per cent to 2 per cent with effect from 1 April, the rate in disadvantaged areas continuing to be ½ per cent lower.  These changes together with a reduction from 120 days to 90 days in the period for payment for intervention purchases of butter are equivalent to a milk price increase of about 3p per gallon. The increase in the support for milk is composed of an increase in the intervention price of skim milk powder offset by a reduction in the intervention price of butter.  Because of this latter reduction, the abolition of the FEOGA element of the consumer subsidy on butter represents an increase of only just over 2p per lb in the retail price of butter.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the beef sector, the calf premium has been extended for a further year at a rate of about £6.75 per head as compared with £9.75 last year. I would, of course, have preferred an unchanged rate but, as the Commission had not proposed the retention of the premium and as several member states were opposed to it, the eventual outcome <Col N="1590" /> was quite satisfactory and represents a benefit of about £12 million to farmers. The council also agreed to continue the United Kingdom variable premium for a further year.  Irish cattle and beef exported to the UK qualify for this premium and, in fact, the benefit to our meat exporters last year was some £11 million. The alignment of beef intervention prices for the various qualities in the Community classification grid is to continue, and this means an increase of approximately 1 per cent in our intervention support prices.</P>
    <P>In the case of sheepmeat, the Commission has committed itself to dealing before 1 October with the problem caused on the French market by supplies of ewemeat from Britain.  The supplies have been upsetting the market for some considerable time and the Commission's commitment to deal with the distortion is welcome.  The marketing year for sheepmeat will in future be on a calendar year basis, and a 1 per cent price increase is to apply from next January.</P>
    <P>The cereals sector gave rise to particularly acute problems during these negotiations. The Commission proposal to reduce prices by 3.6 per cent was opposed strongly by Germany and this opposition was supported by me and some other Ministers.  During the negotiations the Commission showed some willingness to modify its original proposal and there was also a generally favourable attitude towards reviewing the operation of the guarantee threshold so as to avoid undue disadvantages to producers in future years.  Although there was some progress towards a solution, Germany found it necessary to insist on further discussion in accordance with one of the options in the Luxembourg Compromise.  The matter will, therefore, be taken up again by the Council before mid-June and I am confident that the final outcome will be much more favourable to producers than the original proposal from the Commission.</P>
    <P>Among the other decisions taken by the Council were some reductions in the support for a number of products in the fruit and vegetable sector, and some <Col N="1591" /> green rate changes for member states which have negative MCAs at present.</P>
    <P>Overall, the package contains sizeable benefits for our farm sector, and must be considered a satisfactory one when viewed against the background of the Community's financial constraints and the Commission's efforts to observe budgetary neutrality as well as the difficult market conditions currently prevailing for most of our main products.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that in future, increases in farm incomes will have to be achieved mainly through our own efforts in improving production, processing and marketing rather than through relying heavily on the Common Agricultural Policy support mechanisms, especially intervention.  While we still have some way to go to match the best of our competitors within the Community, I am confident that we can close the gap and establish real and lasting prosperity in our agricultural industry.</P>

The Minister failed to do anything about the importation of New Zealand butter.  The future for the grain and cereal prices is disastrous.

      <P>The schoolboy tactics being displayed here indicate a lack of interest in the agriculture industry. We have not had serious statements on agriculture though the statements may have been serious in regard to what happened in Brussels because it is the type of haggling that went on but which really had no connection with the agriculture industry as distinct from the individual prosperity of farmers.  There have been some small gains for some sections of the farming community but there has been a loss to consumers in terms of the increased prices that will result from the deal.  Each year there has been similar haggling about prices, similar complaints when more was not achieved and satisfaction on the part of some in respect of what they achieved in other areas.  What has happened will not make any serious impact on our policy in the area of the farming and food industries.  There is a common agricultural food prices policy in the EC but the Community do not have a common pay policy, so not everyone can afford to buy the food.  The crucial problem of the cereal prices was deferred because of the German willingness to use the veto.  It should be remembered that people who are prepared to lecture Ireland about our responsibility as Europeans in various other fields are not shy about using the veto when their interests are involved.  Our Ministers <Col N="1598" /> should be more prepared to protect our interests in the same manner.</P>
      <P>The CAP has functioned up to now as a mechanism to save farmers from market forces but the practical result has been to create unsaleable surpluses of agricultural produce, to maintain high prices for consumers and to obstruct the rational development of production on the land, leading to an enormous increase in the import of food and so on.  The Workers' Party are not calling for the abolition of CAP but for a drastic reform of the policy, which should have the effect of guaranteeing a standard of living for people on the land comparable to that of industrial workers while at the same time organising the production of food on a rational basis which would guarantee cheaper food to the European consumer. We have always maintained that farm incomes should be based on increased and efficient production rather than on increased food prices.</P>
      <P>It is time we faced up to the fact that when we entered the EC and became full members in 1973 the number employed in the food industry was 58,900.  Ten years later the number of people employed in the food industry was 42,300, a drop of 16,600.  The December 1983 herd enumeration showed that numbers of incalf heifers and young female cattle were at their lowest levels since our entry to the EC.  Despite the massive investment in agriculture over the last decade the total cattle herd in 1983 was smaller than that in 1973.  The spectacle of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture fighting in Brussels over the past year or so for our right to produce more, while at the same time presiding over the decline of our production base, shows the depths of unreality to which our agricultural policy, if we have any, has descended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that hundreds of millions of pounds have been poured into the industry from both Government sources and the CAP we have a dismal level of productivity, a declining number of jobs and a smaller return to the community in general from this sector in taxes, rates or <Col N="1599" /> investment.  The big farmers of the IFA and the cattle exporters are only interested in lubricating the wheels of the Brussels gravy train and getting what they can in profits for themselves from the public purse.  Many of them have not shown the slightest interest in achieving the maximum use of our valuable land resource.  Those employed in the food industry whether in meat plants, co-ops or other agricultural based industries should call for a coherent, planned policy for agriculture.  This is vital if the potential of the food industry is to be realised, if we are to create jobs in the industry and if we are to maintain any credibility either at home or in the EC.  What is needed is a serious policy for the planned development of agriculture and the food industry.  It should include any measures necessary to ensure the fullest use of our land, to produce the raw material required in terms of quality and quantity and to promote the production of value-added goods through co-ordinated State marketing.</P>
    <P>In that connection I welcome the new emphasis by the IDA on the food processing industry.  Where does the Minister and the Department stand on this?  The Minister will probably be seen to have done a reasonably good job in the EC in the haggling that went on over the six days and nights, but this yearly haggling has nothing to do with the planned development of agriculture or the food industry.  What has the Minister done in the EC or elsewhere with regard to the planned development of new products? From my understanding of replies to questions last week it is obvious that there is no new thinking in the Department by the Minister or by the civil servants in regard to the need for new products or new developments in the agricultural area to compensate for the enormous problems facing CAP and the beef, dairy and cereal industries over the next few years.  It has become obvious that in the Department they are merely picking up whatever crumbs of policy or ideas that fall from the EC table.  The Minister should produce a White Paper on land <Col N="1600" /> policy, land structure, agricultural production, agricultural policy, the future of the EC and so on in the coming year so that we could have a major debate.</P>
    <P>This party has been portrayed by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael propagandists as being anti-farmer simply because we have consistently called for tax equity and for farmers who are within the tax bracket to pay their taxes.  The supposedly pro-farmer parties have in the life of the State driven 200,000 farmers off the land and out of the country.  From 380,000 holdings at the foundation of the State we are down to 150,000.  The Workers' Party policy would see increased production of saleable products and an increased income to farmers as well as an increase in the number of jobs in the food industry.  We would welcome some new policy from the Minister over the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was in possession the last day I referred to the fact that our canals are the most under-used waterways in Europe.  It is obvious that we are not a water sports people.  I welcomed the Minister's decision, and praised him for his imagination, to transfer the canals from CIE ownership to that of the Board of Works.  I was saying that I hoped it would fairly quickly be established where the responsibility lies for the maintenance of the canals. Limerick Corporation found itself in difficulties there.  When they tried to improve the environmental aspect of the canals they were not sure whether the Board of Works, the ESB or somebody else owned the banks and some other body were responsible for the waterways.  Due to the development of the hydro-electric scheme in Limerick in the late twenties and early thirties, the Shannon silted up below the junction of the Mulcaire with the Shannon.  I can remember swimming <Col N="1601" /> and camping there as a boy, just beside Annacotty where there was then only one sand island.  Now the rivers are completely blocked with sand.  In conjunction with what the Board of Works propose doing with regard to the canal, they should examine the silting up, because it slowed down the flow and the water coming into the canal from the Shannon became stagnant.</P>
      <P>Also, that beautiful canal was ruined by public authority vandalism.  I do not know who was responsible for taking the decision, but something was built under Mike Madden's bridge which was taller than the Berlin Wall.  What would have been a centrepiece of a beautiful marina, if we had the imagination or capacity to develop it, was ruined.  I ask the Minister, and through him the Board of Works, to look very closely at the whole policy of bringing our waterways into line with those of the rest of Europe.  We often lament the dearth of tourists but seem criminally neglectful of areas which could be an obvious goldmine for tourism, especially European tourists and Germans in particular.  A whole new industry is waiting to be developed and exploited if the work is undertaken with the proper imagination and sensitivity.</P>
      <P>I welcome those aspects of the Bill which say that the Board of Works will co-operate with local groups, voluntary organisations and so on to beautify the canals.  The policy should be to retain, in so far as is possible, their original character. Many voluntary groups are doing this.  In particular, in Limerick the Canal Restoration Committee have availed of youth employment schemes to make tremendous improvements in clearing the banks and brushweeds putting the canal in a much better shape.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister concerned to make as much use as possible of the social employment schemes for those over 25 and the youth employment schemes and to encourage voluntary organisations to become involved in developing local community pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some canals have a very under-utilised amenity.  I am familiar with the proposal which has been sent to the Board of <Col N="1602" /> Works by a company called Agways.  It is an acronym used by an international company responsible for the generation of small local hydro-electric schemes.  I understand that there is a provision in EC legislation that where any company or organisation within any of the EC countries can generate their own energy or electricity without relying on imports of coal or oil from outside the Community, the authority in the country responsible for the generation of the electricity &mdash; in this case the ESB &mdash; must buy that electricity so generated.  This company have already put forward a very attractive scheme to the Board of Works in respect of the Eglinton canal in Galway, which is not in my constituency. The same company are developing a project for the canal at Limerick.  By merely clearing the head of the canal there would be a headrace and a drop of about eight feet; and by putting pipes underneath and developing a small hydro-electric generating scheme there would be no interference whatever with the environment. That can create an outturn of £50,000 per year.  If some local organisations were interested enough, they should be encouraged &mdash; or indeed commercial companies, but ideally voluntary organisations where the money can be raised to start these schemes.  Some are already in existence generating electricity, doing very well and making money.  That money could be ploughed back into the development of the canals and their amenities.</P>
    <P>Limerick city is particularly fortunate in that it has some of the finest stretches of waterway anywhere in Europe.  People from Hamburg, in particular, have commented that they find it impossible to believe that there are areas in western Europe with clear flowing water.  Limerick city has, by a preservation order, made all the Shannon surrounding the city and the canals and waterways a wild bird sanctuary, for the preservation of game.  This is working very successfully in my own area.  Within a short distance of where I live there is a profusion of wild duck, mallard and swans.  Side by side with this development of the canals I <Col N="1603" /> would ask the Office of Public Works to develop that aspect of our heritage, as part of the national trust given to us.</P>
    <P>In many ways we are scandalously neglectful of some of the most scenic parkland and waterways in the whole of Europe.  I recognise the Minister's appeal for patience from those who may be anxious to get everything done yesterday. It has been said that the best is often the enemy of the good.  We want the best immediately and overstep the good.  If we gradually turn the ship of public opinion around, even at the rate of a couple of degrees per annum, we can restore a magnificent amenity, not alone for the benefit of the tourists but also for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 which provides for the handing over of the documents relating to the original construction of the canals and the various Acts of Parliament which were introduced for their construction. Some of those documents have been written up extensively by Charles Murphy, a noted Limerick historian and archaeologist.  They are absolutely intriguing in their revelation of the social conditions prevailing at the time of the construction of the canals.  I give an example of when potatoes were being transported above Clanlara at O'Brien's Bridge that the potatoes fell off the barges and when the starving people picked them up they were forced to hand them back.  I urge that that documentation be very carefully preserved.  There are in that documentation many a cap and gown for scholars yet unborn.  These records should be put on micro film and not retained in one central archive.  I know the tremendous and very welcome interest of the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, in things cultural and archival and I urge him to do this.  It would be a tremendous boon for local historians and scholars.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most imaginative Bills and is very welcome.  I congratulate the Minister of State and the Government.</P>

If that fund of goodwill is translated into action the work undertaken can only succeed.</P>
      <P>I like the approach of the Minister of State in introducing the Bill.  On this side of the House we offer our complete co-operation with the commissioners in their work to maintain the canals for public amenity purposes.  This can embrace travelling or boating on the canals, fishing, swimming, various water sports and even walking along the banks.  However, I hope that this transfer is not merely a paper transfer, a legal document that will lie mouldering somewhere on a dusty shelf.  I want to see the interest aroused by this discussion leading to a reawakening of the extraordinary interest and ambition that saw these canals started well over 200 years ago.  The main line was completed in 1805.  I want to see the Office of Public Works show the same commitment and will to succeed.  I trust that, in 20 years time in 2005 when we celebrate the 200th anniversary of the completion of the canal, we, too, will be able to celebrate 20 years of progress and investment.</P>
      <P>I stress that investment will be needed. In 1805 the State and the shareholders spent well over £1 million on the completion of the Grand Canal mainline.  We, too, should be prepared to invest a comparable sum in today's money so that the full amenity potential of the canals may be realised.  I live in a county with close ties with both canals.  My home is quite close to the Grand Canal.  All the locals swim at Digby Bridge or fish in the fine stretches of the canal that abound in coarse fish.  Many of them go boating in the Robertstown-Allenwood area.  Probably we take these amenities for granted. Other people who are not so fortunate to live in such an area are the people who alert us to the treasures we have on our doorstep.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> Unfortunately, CIE with their many responsibilities, growing headaches with public transport, cutbacks and increasing debts must have looked on the placing under their wing of the Royal Canal in 1944 and the Grand Canal in 1950 as somewhat of a mixed blessing.  The interim period has been merely a holding operation.  To give CIE their due, in the main the canals are still navigable.  However, some desperate suggestions were made from time to time regarding the future of the canals.  In my early days as a public representative I remember attending a meeting where there was a suggestion that the canal in Dublin should be filled in, that it should be used for a roadway or that a watermain or a sewer should be run along the bed of the canal from Islandbridge to the sea.  I remember attending one meeting where the mechanics of hoisting boats from the sea with huge cranes, transporting them to Islandbridge and dropping them gently into the water was explained to us by well-meaning economists who were anxious to cut corners.  Thankfully, at that time we had vocal visionaries too, such as the late Stephen Rynne and others whose objections were listened to.  It was because of their objections to that proposal that the Dublin link with the sea and the Grand Canal has been retained.</P>
    <P>During that time acts of official vandalism were perpetrated.  The huge wooden beams used to lever open the lock gates were cut with a chainsaw on the Naas branch of the canal, reputedly because the gates were dangerous.  That happened sometime in the early seventies.  The Naas line to Sallins started 199 years ago. It was brought the two and a half miles to Naas and eventually a further five miles away to Corbally harbour at a cost of £30,768.  It is nice to know that the stretch from Sallins to Naas is now being restored by a local committee and the county council and the new gates that are completed with Irish labour will soon be in position.  It will be nice that the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Naas part of the canal can be celebrated properly in 1985-86.  I want to see a continuation and acceleration of community co-operation <Col N="1606" /> with the Office of Public Works with regard to the canals.</P>
    <P>On one matter I have to be very critical of the attitude of CIE.  This concerns the infamous by-law 51 which was always a thorn in the side of unfortunates who lived beside the canal and who were served by roadways that were under the jurisdiction of the people in charge of the canal and who were affected by this by-law 51.  In many cases the by-roads near the canal were black-topped and taken in charge by Kildare County Council under the very good local improvements scheme.  Everyone deserves to have a decent roadway to their door.  In some cases, however, the CIE engineering staff were most unco-operative.  They spoke of the danger of black-topping a roadway on or near the canal banks, thereby generating heavier traffic that might damage the banks.  I remember I participated in one deputation to the head office of CIE and despite the expert opinions advanced by the council engineers who knew about road making and who had much more experience of it than the chief engineer of CIE, the attitude of that organisation was that they still denied people the right to have a good road to their homes.  They quoted this infernal by-law 51 as something that was sacrosanct and could not be ignored.</P>
    <P>When I asked the chief engineer on that occasion &mdash; the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, was with me &mdash; what would be his attitude if we got support in this House to introduce legislation to revoke that by-law his answer was that he would look for another by-law.  I want an assurance that that kind of closed mind and tyrannical approach will have no place in the new set-up in the Office of Public Works when canals are being discussed.  I hope that, if possible, something will be written into the Bill to ensure that where co-operation is needed the Office of Public Works and the local authorities will co-operate to provide people with a decent roadway to their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there can be <Col N="1607" /> some difficulty with regard to the overuse of roadways along the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the area involved was in the Ballyteague-Robertstown area which is the highest part of the canal fed by the Milltown feeder.  It was pointed out to us &mdash; and I appreciate this &mdash; that a break in the bank there could cause large problems.  I know that a breakdown in the Daingean area did cause problems later on.  But where there is a will there is a way.  Apparently as far as CIE were concerned there was no will and no way.  I know there will be difficultues but one can surmount them if one tries.  In some areas also the canal or the canal culvert has impeded drainage, maintaining a high water level in some areas that has inhibited housebuilding and rendered the provision of sanitary services impossible.  I am thinking of areas like Allenwood.  I trust that the wellbeing of local people will have high preference in the thinking of the new body, that the idea that people are important will get a high priority and rating.</P>
      <P>Section 3 refers to the transfer of staff. I have been in touch with the Minister of State.  He tells me that a person shall, on vesting day, enjoy conditions of service not less beneficial in aggregate than the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before vesting day, having regard to (i) any adjustment in the scale of pay and (ii) any compensation given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that present employees of CIE on the canal enjoy subsidised travel arrangements for themselves and their immediate families.  I realise that CIE could so facilitate them, being involved in public transport.  It is a privilege that is much appreciated.  I trust that this will be continued or, if it cannot, that employees will be adequately compensated. Other minor matters arise such as protective clothing.  I trust that these matters will be sorted out with the employees and unions involved when this is being discussed.  It is vital that goodwill <Col N="1608" /> be maintained in a period of transition such as this.</P>
    <P>The amenity value of our canals is tremendous. While it calls for a high level of commitment and expenditure to realise its full potential, I hope such will be forthcoming.  I believe that the Office of Public Works are the correct people to undertake this work.  I say that because of the wonderful work that has been done on the restoration of The Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  I consider that to be a worthy showpiece for any visitors to our capital city, a delightful example of restoration and preservation of which any city could be proud.</P>
    <P>Our canals could play the same role in a different context.  For those who wish to experience the quiet and peace of pastoral Ireland, away from the hurly-burly of the city, living life at a leisurely, languid pace, the canal is the place to be. A Kildare poet, William A. Byrne, who was born in the canal village of Rathangan and was Professor of English in Galway University described it much better than I could when he said: and I quote:</P>
    <P>The purple heather is the cloak</P>
    <P>God gave the bogland brown</P>
    <P>But man has made a pall of smoke</P>
    <P>To hide the distant town.</P>
    <P>The late Father P.J. Murphy of Robertstown gave us a taste of what our canals could be.  His canal festa attracted tourists from many countries and visitors from all over Ireland; there were there presidents and ambassadors.  I remember at one time that the festival was opened by Barbara Castle who had been involved in communications and transport in England. The horse-drawn barge there helped to re-enact the lost life of yesteryear and the banquets held in the restored hotel completed the illusion.  However, Father Murphy's tragic death and the most recent recession put paid to our plans for Robertstown.  Perhaps, with the help of the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte, the community and other interested bodies those plans can be put into action again.</P>
    <P>At one stage there was a plan to flood <Col N="1609" /> an area near the canal to provide boating facilities.  We are rather conscious of the fact that one can only go up the canal or down the canal.  In one instance, in Ballinteague and Allenwood, one can take a circular trip.  If there were boating facilities, if an area of cutaway bog in the Lullymore area was flooded, it would lead to endless possibilities for boating, sailing, fishing and all sorts of water sports and leisure activities.  I firmly believe that a canal cruise must be one of the most restful types of holidays in which one could engage.  Fishing on the canal has enormous possibilities that have only been touched on here and there around Ireland.</P>
    <P>The village of Prosperous in my parish is probably the best example one could give of the effects of fishing and of a little foresight and work on the part of committed people.  About 20 years ago a Longford man made the first move to stock the canal with coarse fish and to promote fishing competitions; gradually the bait was taken.  Foreign fishermen in the beginning mostly those from Britain &mdash; came and kept returning.  The annual fishing competition attracted sponsorship. In recent times the sponsorship has been to the tune of £1,100, with special efforts being made to encourage disabled anglers to the area.  The result is that most years now see approximately 250 foreign anglers in Prosperous for a fishing competition at this time of year. The promoters and those involved in the catering end make a special effort to attract them back in September and they have been reasonably successful.</P>
    <P>Because of this influx of visitors bed and breakfasts have grown in the village. Prosperous now is the only area in Kildare &mdash; and I am sure also for many miles around &mdash; capable of providing 300 beds per night.  This is because of the fishing activity.  There are also three fine restaurants there to which one could bring anybody one wished to impress, ensuring that they got a very nice meal.  Because the canal has brought visitors for fishing this has generated other business as well in the area.  For example, local lounges have been extended to cater for the trade. <Col N="1610" /> Also Comhaltas groups have begun to play and find there a very appreciative and cosmopolitan audience.  Some of our leading musicians and singers of today will remark, on the sleeves of the records they make, that they gave their first public performances in Prosperous.  In this connection I might mention Liam Óg Flynn, Christie Moore and Donal Lunny.</P>
    <P>We must continue to promote our canals in this way.  In a Foreword to <i>Canaliana</i>&mdash; I think it was the 1973 edition &mdash; Stephen Rynne having referred to the fact that the canals were jokingly regarded as the repositories of old bikes, beds and dead dogs, said:</P>
    <P>All has changed.  Nowadays hundreds of thousands are interested in canals in a general way, tens of thousands use them and there are at least a thousand canal monomaniacs.  The number in each category increases rapidly.</P>
    <P>There is a three-fold attraction: the canals have a fascinating past, a pleasant present and an exciting future. Canal history is easy on the mind; after all the heyday of water transport was in great-great grandfather's time and his removal from the scene is not by any means epoch-size.</P>
    <P>Short of the <i>de luxe</i> form of canal enjoyment, cruising, there are hundreds of ways one can become part of the canal's pleasant present.  If we were not typewriter tethered just now, we could be fishing on the Landenstown stretch, leaning over humpy bridges, bird or dragonfly watching, listening to the rustling of the weeds or popping over to Robertstown to see what's cooking.</P>
    <P>There is a development plan for the Robertstown Canal on which much work has been done.  It was the late Ted Barrett who died this year who wrote a programme, <i>Towards an Irish Broadlands,</i> where he likened the work done in East Anglia with what could be done in the Robertstown area.  Other people such as Father Murphy and Andy Cole added to that work and pointed out what could be achieved with the co-operation <Col N="1611" /> and efforts of everybody concerned.  This list might not be complete but there is an input from Eastern Region Tourism, Bord Fáilte, Kildare County Council, the Office of Public Works, Bord na Móna, CIE, ESB, the Department of Transport, the Agricultural Institute, Inland Waterways, Inland Fisheries, Federation of Marine Industries, the Joint Committee of Bord Fáilte and the Forest and Wildlife Section of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, local landowners and local representatives, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and various fishing clubs, gun clubs and community councils in the area.  They could be brought together to embark on a programme to ensure the maintenance of navigable waterways and the renovation of branches closed but not derelict, and undertake new enterprises aimed at creating a broadlands.  All this could be achieved by such a programme.</P>
    <P>Recently at a committee meeting of the Council of Europe regarding environmental conservation I was made aware of grants available at European level for special works of conservation.  If we have any area worthy of international recognition we should look for international support to enable us to preserve and conserve that area.  The present resolution deals only with certain funds available for natural habitats for endangered wildlife but this could be extended to include other flora and fauna as well.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I spent a lovely holiday in The Netherlands as a guest of the Dutch Government and we saw their canals and waterways.  We travelled on the mighty Rhine and also on the tiny canals in the university city of Delft.  I was struck by the cleanliness of this very populous land and also by how much they made of the tiny amenities they had.  I became friendly with a Dutchman from Scheveningen near The Hague who was interested in shooting and fishing.  When he came to our country he could not believe that we had so much water and so few people to avail of the fishing and shooting.  He must have felt he was in paradise.  I have seen English fishermen <Col N="1612" /> get up early in the morning and go down to the canal to book their place on the bank at the crack of dawn in the hope that they would be able to retain that place for the day, not knowing that they had miles of canal available to them and uncluttered waterways from which to choose.  They catch coarse fish and if a competition is being held they put the fish in a little net, have them weighed and return them to the water.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year the weeds grow in the canals.  It was the policy of CIE to spray them with weedkiller to inhibit their growth.  Unfortunately it had a bad effect on fish life and the fact that this problem always occurred just before the annual fishing competition was a very poor example of the approach of CIE. One would have expected a more sympathetic approach.  I became very much aware of this malpractice during my time as Minister for Fisheries and I am pleased to see that in section 6 provision is made to cater for such eventualities.  The commissioners must consult with the Minister for Fisheries when improvement or development works are to be undertaken which would be likely seriously to affect fish stocks in the canal.  I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>I want to see the Office of Public Works taking an active part in the future of the canals, co-operating with local bodies in order to maximise amenity values.  I hope they will institute schemes and encourage local people to become involved.  Not many years ago the Wicklow Way was opened in order to facilitate people who wished to undertake a long walk in the hills.  A route was laid out and provision was made for stiles where it went through private property.  This scheme is very effective.  I have discussed it with our county planners in Kildare and they see the canal banks as the ideal place to introduce a Kildare canter or a midland marathon. This would entail only the cutting of bushes, the provision of stiles and the restoration of the right of way.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers suggested up-grading traditional swimming areas in the canals. That would be a help.  Eventually we <Col N="1613" /> might have a museum in the Roberstown area when the restoration of the hotel is complete.  We might open up the navigation of the Milltown feeder which leads into the Pollardstown fen.  This is a fenland which we have already paid for.  It is now reverting to its former state and flora and fauna are available for inspection by students and botanists.  We might also encourage the preservation of various types of bog and peatland for educational tours.  Possibly we could have a display centre and a folk park with camping and caravan facilities.  Not only would we be catering for foreign visitors but these facilities would be available to the one million people living within an hour's drive in the greater Dublin area. It would not be an expensive holiday but would provide value for money.  Even without spending any money people could enjoy a trip in this area.  People do not expect Intercontinental or grade A hotels.  They want to see us as we are and if we have wholesome food, clean air and water it will go all one way towards satisfying them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to quote what Ruth Delany wrote in her <i>magnum opus, The Grand Canal of Ireland:</i></P>
    <P>Legislation is being prepared to transfer the Grand Canal system, including the Barrow Navigation, from CIE to the Board of Works.  The latter already administers the Shannon Navigation and it should then be possible to develop all the waterways under a single authority.</P>
    <P>The long history of the Grand Canal Company is at an end but the Grand Canal is just about to enter a new phase.</P>
    <P>I trust that her words are prophetic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State who will be responsible for the canals after their transfer from CIE, I welcome this Bill.  Indeed, I can say that I have been pressing for a number of years to have this legislation passed <Col N="1614" /> and I am delighted that the end is now in sight.</P>
      <P>In order to expedite the legislation processes in this instance, the Bill was introduced in the Seanad first and it has now come to this House.  Much valuable work has been done by our colleagues in the Seanad already and this has resulted in two amendments being made to the Bill as originally introduced there.  These were in respect of the provision for the staff to be transferred and the protection of the fishery of the canals, both mentioned by Deputy Power.  I am gratified that the Bill has aroused such interest and has received such attention in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>One of the matters which received great airing in the Seanad was the question as to what my office's future role in respect of the canals will be.  Firstly, it will be obliged to carry out the statutory obligation imposed on it by the Oireachtas and over and beyond that it must act in accordance with the Government decision in this matter.</P>
      <P>At this stage it might be useful to recall that decision.  The Government decided that the Grand Canal system is to be developed for navigation and general amenity purposes and that the Royal Canal is to be developed, according as resources permit by carrying out improvement works on selected stretches.  The decision differentiates between the roles of the two canals and, quite obviously, the canals' development will follow different patterns and require different treatment.  It will be a matter for my office to ensure that each canal is treated so as to achieve the maximum benefits.</P>
      <P>It is most appropriate that the canals should be transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works which is a body with wide experience in the amenity field. Anyone who looks at their works in national parks and national monuments and, of particular relevance in this instance, their works on the Shannon Navigation, will have confidence in their ability to do a good job on the Grand and Royal Canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are, of course, no newcomers to inland <Col N="1615" /> navigation.  They have been involved with it for over 150 years and they have managed the Shannon Navigation continuously since 1846, which is nearly 140 years.  During that time there have been many changes in the types of traffic using the Shannon and the Grand Canal.  Initially, passenger traffic as well as cargo traffic was important.  This was mainly between Dublin and Limerick, via the Grand Canal to Shannon Harbour and then along the Shannon to Limerick.  Passenger traffic succumbed to competition from the railways in 1859 and was not revived until 1897 when the Shannon Development Company, under the aegis of the Commissioners of Public Works, began to operate passenger traffic between Killaloe and Carrick-on-Shannon. These services continued to operate until the First World War.</P>
    <P>After 1930 cargo traffic on the Shannon and on the Grand Canal showed a marked decline as road transport began to be more firmly established.  The Grand Canal Company, and later CIE, continued to operate a fleet of barges which were particularly useful during the war years when road and rail traffic was curtailed. But, with the return to normal conditions, the use of the waterways declined rapidly and all commercial traffic ceased in 1960.</P>
    <P>In the same year, however, commercial cruisers appeared on the Shannon and there has been a dramatic increase in the growth of leisure traffic in the intervening years.  The number of passages through locks increased almost ninefold in the 20 years between 1963 and 1983.  While there has been a levelling off in recent years there are signs that a further increase in traffic is on the way. The figures for 1984 are up over 6 per cent on those for 1982.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have proved equal to the task of catering for the different traffic demands as they arose.  An extensive programme of improvements has been carried out on the Shannon to develop the great potential of the waterway for recreational use.  The buoyage system has been improved and augmented, <Col N="1616" /> disused habours have been dredged, new harbours constructed and others enlarged.  The Lecarrow Canal, linking the village of Lecarrow with Lough Ree, has been re-opened to traffic and the Lough Allen Canal has been re-opened as far as Acres Lough.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt but that the commissioners are well capable of developing the canals to meet the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal as it stands is fully navigable, apart from some spur lines and provides a through navigation from the east coast to the Shannon and via the Barrow Navigation to the south coast.  In the past this canal served a vital role as a commerical artery for the areas it served. While one cannot rule out the possibility that the future may bring a return to some extent to this role, this does not look likely at present.  Existing traffic on this canal is confined to pleasure cruising and recreational boating and I would dearly like to see this develop in the same way as the Shannon.  As well as navigation there is scope for the development of other recreational activities such as fishing and walking and the commissioners are prepared &mdash; I stress that in response to Deputy Power's point &mdash; to co-operate with all interests in the provision of facilities for such pastimes. However, the prime role of this canal will be as a navigable waterway and the commissioner's stewardship of this canal will take full cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>Many areas were mentioned by Deputy Power.  He covered the Grand Canal in the Kildare area but I should like to add the Barrow extension.  Coming from the town of Athy and having learned to swim in the canal, I appreciate the points Deputy power made in regard to that area.  Fishing has been developed on that stretch of canal and the principle people involved in that work are the people of Prosperous.  There has been a big influx of visitors in recent years to fish on that stretch of canal, particularly from Britain.  There is no doubt that hotels, and other establishments, have benefited from that business.  In Rathangan massive development has taken place with <Col N="1617" /> the help of AnCO.  I am interested in development work in those areas and, as Minister responsible for the canals in the future, I am anxious to ensure that there will be full co-operation between the Office of Public Works and other interests. I am aware that since the provisions of the Bill were announced people have expressed an interest in developing fishing, boat hiring and boat building in areas along the canal.  That could be a great help to the areas.</P>
    <P>I mentioned spur lines.  One such spur formerly served the town of Naas in my constituency and quite a lot of work has been done by Naas Urban District Council in re-instating it.  The council have cleaned the upper reaches and, with the aid of sponsorship and the co-operation of the Inland Waterways Association and AnCo, have provided new gates to four locks.  One further reach remains to be done to finish the job.  CIE dredged the section of the spur line from the last lock to the main line at Soldier's Island which is now navigable.  When the job is finished the canal will provide a valuable amenity for the town of Naas, and I must say that the council are to be commended for their initiative in taking on this project.  They have shown what can be done at local level to make the best use of this valuable resource and I hope that other authorities and voluntary bodies will follow their example.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal, unfortunately, is not in the same condition.  It is not of course necessary as a navigation route from Dublin to the Shannon as the Grand Canal is adequate for the purpose.  While I would not discount its restoration to navigation at some time in the future this is not likely to happen in my time in the House.  I am well aware that it is the objective of many to see the full restoration of this and, both myself and the Commissioners of Public Works, would also like this, but for the present the focus for the development of the Royal Canal will have to be on the local amenity aspect.  I find it hard to see any major extension of the navigable waterway in the short term.  I assure interested people that my policy will be to ensure that no <Col N="1618" /> decisions are taken which would add to the obstacles already in the way of restoring the canal.</P>
    <P>Some mention has to be made of the valuable work already undertaken on the canals by voluntary groups and the local authorities.  Without these the task in hand would be much greater and I hope that this co-operative spirit will continue after the canals have passed into direct State care.  Many may feel that their voluntary roles have been fulfilled with this step but I hope that this will not be the case.  My office will welcome all help and co-operation it receives in this regard and will co-operate with all parties to further the interests of the canals.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland, the Royal Canal Amenity Group, and other voluntary groups as well as Bord Fáilte, the fishery boards, the relevant local authorities who have undertaken works on the canals all deserve the highest praise and I hope to be able to count on the continuation of their help.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have mentioned the necessity for the commissioners to consult with interested parties.  I assure Deputies that the commissioners will always be available for consultation and will fully consider all proposals made to them in respect of the canals.  The blending and mixing of the many uses which can be made of the canals will be a particularly onerous task.  It is essential that the commissioners have sufficient control to ensure that conflicts are prevented and that the canals are used for and to the maximum benefit of the people.  For this reason the commissioners are acutely aware of the necessity for consultation. Insofar as it will be possible, the commissioners will facilitate all proposals for the advancement of the canals, be they from individuals, voluntary groups, local authorities or other interests.</P>
    <P>No formal planning for the future of the canals has, as I indicated earlier, yet been undertaken within my office.  The existing levels of both engineering and administrative staff have made it impossible to allocate personnel to this important task.  However, officials of my office and the Department of the Public Service <Col N="1619" /> have had consultations in this regard and I am pressing to have this aspect resolved at the earliest date.  Pre-planning for the development of the canals is of the utmost importance and, while the canals' current levels of operation should not be affected by this, I am anxious to move onto a more active development of the canals as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The first step will be to survey the canals from the property and engineering aspects.  On the basis of the results of these surveys development and maintenance plans and programmes will be prepared in consultation where necessary with interested parties.  I could not at this stage say when such plans might be finalised as this will depend on the resources to be allocated to the commissioners for the canals.  I will be urging that these will be the most generous possible so that my hopes and, indeed, those also of the many Deputies who have contributed to this debate can be fully realised.  I regret that I cannot be more definite in this regard but I will not give commitments now that I may not be able to keep as to do so would only be storing up future troubles.</P>
    <P>The combination of the Grand and Royal Canals with the Shannon Navigation will give the commissioners responsibility for one of the finest inland navigation systems in these islands.  This will be no small task, but I am confident that the commissioners, in their stewardship of the canals, will be as successful as they have been with the Shannon Navigation.</P>
    <P>In the last century the canals brought prosperity to the areas they serviced by the commercial nature of their operation. While this is no longer the case the canals can still contribute to the prosperity of the communities they serve by attracting visitors from at home and abroad to their waters, be it for boating, fishing, hiking or any of the many other recreational pastimes that can be pursued on or beside them.  I have great hopes that the various towns along the canals will enjoy increased economic benefits and that many jobs <Col N="1620" /> will be created in the provision of services, the improvement of facilities and in manufacture of boats and accessories.</P>
    <P>A lot of attention was given in the Seanad to the questions of fishing and the protection of the fish stocks.  As I already mentioned, the Bill was amended as a result of this discussion.  The amendment will give legal effect to an administrative arrangement already agreed by which the commissioners will consult with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry on matters relating to fishing.  The commissioners will at all times be conscious of the amenity value of canal fishing and will bear this in mind in the operation and development of the canals.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Government are also well aware of this and have decided that a liaison committee should be set up between representatives of my office and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to consider all matters relating to fishing in the canals.  Consultations have already taken place with the Department with a view to setting up the committee.</P>
    <P>The other amendment introduced to the Bill was in respect of the staff to be transferred from CIE to the commissioners. Again this was an amendment which I welcomed as it copperfastens the guarantee that the workers should not suffer any aggregate loss as a result of the transfer.  I am delighted that in recent discussions between representatives of my office, CIE and the unions involved that the union representatives welcomed the proposal.  The detailed provisions for the transfer of the staff will be the subject of full discussions with the staff's representatives and initial indications are that these will be undertaken in an amicable atmosphere and that there will be no insurmountable difficulties involved in this regard.  However, there are so many considerations which will have to be covered, I realise that these will take time to complete.  It is important that the negotiators have adequate time to examine proposals, consult those involved and reach mutually acceptable conclusions. However, it is important also that no time be lost and I would ask the staff representatives to bear this in mind <Col N="1621" /> in approaching their task.  I will be urging my officials to ensure that there will be no avoidable delay on their part in bringing the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>At this stage it would not be remiss to mention the sterling work of the CIE staff who maintained and operated the canals in difficult times.  They deserve the highest praise and I hope that their devotion to their duties will continue when the canals are finally transferred.  The management of CIE also merit praise in this regard.  As the national transport authority the management of the canals could not have been high in their priorities but nevertheless they have taken good care of the canals in recent years having regard to the limited resources available to them, and for this they must be congratulated.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wilson and Reynolds mentioned the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal which connects the Shannon and the Erne Navigation systems.  It would be inappropriate to provide for this canal or indeed any other navigation in this Bill which is a legislative vehicle simply for the transfer of the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.  However, this does not mean that the potential of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is being ignored. Indeed it is not.  This is quite a complicated problem as we have to see how the conflicting requirements of drainage and navigation can best be reconciled. It should be remembered too, that this canal never functioned satisfactorily. However, I am glad to say that the engineering study is now well advanced and I hope to place the report before the Government for consideration in mid-1986. Pending this I am afraid I could not give any commitment in respect of the future of this canal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast mentioned the position of a former lock house in Limerick which has been vandalised.  My office are negotiating with Limerick Corporation who are interested in acquiring this property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> I am gratified at the welcome the proposed transfer of the canals to the Commissioners of Public Works received and I must say that, like the Deputies who welcomed this, I find the logic of such a move undeniable.  However, I noted the guarded criticism of some in this respect. Deputy Wilson referred to my office as multi-faceted and this is indeed true. Involved as it is with the many organs of State it has many calls on its services.  To say that these demands grossly outweigh the resources and facilities available to meet them would be an understatement. The commisioners' resources are not unlimited.  I only wish their resources were such that everybody's demands on them could be immediately satisfied, but in a tight situation the commissioners endeavour to meet their obligations in the most efficient, competent, proper and fair manner.  I hope that this will be borne in mind when the canals are actually transferred and that people's expectations are set at realistic levels.</P>
    <P>The canals are national assets which we must cherish.  They are an important part of our heritage.  They provide examples of the craftsmanship and engineering skills possessed by our ancestors.  The Commissioners of Public Works are doing marvellous work in the conservation of our heritage and with the resources available to them in engineering, architecture and the natural sciences, I am certain that they will take good care of the canals.</P>
    <P>I was born near the Barrow and, indeed, I still live close to it and to the Grand Canal-Barrow extension as it is known which links Dublin and Shannon with the south coast through the midlands. I have seen the Grand Canal in operation when there was commercial traffic on it and I witnessed the decline in this traffic.  This Bill heralds a new era for the canals and I hope that the expectations of the many people who have pressed for this will be fulfilled.  Let me say in passing that there is in my county a culture of the canals.  The canals have a culture of their own and there is a bond between the people who work on the canals right along the full stretch and <Col N="1623" /> these people are dedicated to the preservation and the revival, if I might call it that, of the canals in the sense of reviving them as an amenity and as amenity navigation. That desire is not alone in people working on the canals but in people living all along them.  The canals are an asset which we must cherish and they are an important part of our heritage.  I hope that the development of the canals as outlined by the Government will bring greater prosperity to the country as a whole and in particular to the regions that they serve.  I look forward to accepting my new responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should mention the points made by Deputy Power concerning the roads along the canal which have served people living on them and which CIE felt should not be transferred to the county council for fear of heavy traffic and that the banks would be damaged.  I assure Deputy Power and everyone else that I am very familiar with this problem in my constituency. As Deputy Power said, when people need a decent roadway to their homes co-operation can and will be provided and we will do everything possible in that regard.  The Deputy suggested that this should be written into the Bill.  That is not necessary because we have power under the Bill to transfer any property on the canal, and if the commissioners agree that it is safe to transfer any road to a county council that can be done without any addition to the Bill as I read it.</P>
    <P>We will be prepared to meet all the people interested in the canals and to co-operate with them as far as is humanly possible, keeping in context the overall welfare of the canal system which we hope to develop in a way similar to the Shannon Navigation.  Having said that, I agree with Deputy Power that we should try to incorporate into our total plan for the canal the plans already drawn up by the late Father Murphy who did wonderful work in my constituency on developing the canal and its amenities and in reviving the old Canal Hotel at Robertstown. I appreciate the work done by all such as he.  If we can develop the lake <Col N="1624" /> which is envisaged in the county plan for Kildare around Robertstown then that will be ideal.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill wholeheartedly to the House.  I will be prepared at any time to meet any groups on this matter.  Before I finish let me mention how the Department of Labour have co-operated with various amenity groups for the Royal and Grand Canals in developing the amenities of their area.  I hold up as two of the best examples of how a local community can co-operate with us under this Bill the Kilcock people on the Royal Canal and the Rathangan people on the Grand Canal.  I know of other examples the effect of which I do not wish to minimise, but these are two examples of how local people can help in restoring this wonderful heritage and enabling us to have one of the most wonderful waterways not alone in these islands but in Europe.  If we do that we will be doing a great deal for the advancement of prosperity in the area and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I commend this Bill to the House.  In doing so, I am echoing the statement in the second annual report of the Commissioners of Public Works of 1833 &mdash; quite a while ago &mdash; that &ldquo;the subject of Inland Navigation is one worthy of much consideration and deeply interesting for every well-wisher of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In common with previous speakers I welcome the provision in this Bill to transfer the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  I come from an area far removed from these two canals. We also have our canals.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is very important in our area as is the Ulster Canal.  They are important for two different reasons. I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works is here.  There were proposals for the development of the canals and the Erne catchment in various reports over the past number of years.  We hoped CIE funding would have been provided but it has not been provided so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in close proximity to the Ulster <Col N="1625" /> Canal.  The canal went out of operation during the first world war.  There were many stories about barrels of whiskey in the sheds and how they were pilfered.  I visited the old lockkeeper on many occasions. The story was that he had whiskey in teapots, kettles and other utensils not normally used to store drink.  At the time whiskey was fairly cheap and scarce. When the Ulster Canal went out of existence the company owed a fairly substantial amount of rates to Monaghan County Council.  The council took over the canal and let the land and the lock houses to try to recoup as much as possible of the rates owing.  The houses went into disrepair and I do not think anyone is living in them now.  The land along the canal has been the subject of litigation and very vicious court cases about ownership.</P>
    <P>A family lived in one of these houses on the verge of Monaghan town.  When the son wanted to get married he erected a bungalow adjacent to the lock house on canal company property.  That was about 12 years ago.  Since then I have been trying unsuccessfully to get the Office of Public Works to agree to hand over to Monaghan County Council that portion of the land.  That young man is paying a bridging loan.  He could be in the Guinness Book of Records for paying the longest bridging loan ever.  A Mr. Walsh was an officer in the Office of Public Works. He died before he got the land transferred. I have a letter in my possession from the late George Colley saying that the Department were willing to release the land to Monaghan County Council.  This is 1985 and it still has not been released and that young man is still paying a bridging loan.  A law case is pending which will involve a large number of neighbours. The case concerns a couple of acres of canal bank property.  I understand the mortgage does not constitute a fee simple.  The Office of Public Works are seeking legal opinion on something they were prepared to transfer years ago to Monaghan County Council.  I ask the Minister of State to have this attended to.</P>
    <P>Two hundred years ago there was not <Col N="1626" /> much talk about leisure or boating or water sports.  People worked all the daylight hours for very little reward.  This canal development would provide a great asset.  Our waterways, our lakes, rivers and canals have a tremendous potential for development as amenities.  With these amenities we could inveigle tourists to come to these areas.  The Government seem to be intent on abolishing midland lakeland tourism organisations.  The counties which make up the lakeland tourism areas in the midlands include Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath, Roscommon, Offaly and Laois.  There is a proposal, which is not acceptable, that Cavan-Monaghan should be put into the Donegal-Leitrim region.  They have nothing in common.  We would be going into the area of commercial hotels and seaside resorts.  We have around 50 lakes in County Monaghan and about 24 of them are developed.  Many of our rivers are badly polluted and not suitable for coarse or trout fishing.  Therefore we depend on the lakes.  With development they would provide a really valuable asset.  The Government and Bord Fáilte should not attempt to split up the lakeland tourism regions at a time when the potential is being realised.</P>
    <P>Much work was done to develop the lakes in the late sixties.  When the late Erskine Childers was Minister for Transport and Power he took a special interest in that development.  At that time the Border troubles started and we did not have the same number of people coming across the Border.  Over the past year or so some groups provided small tanks to deal with pollution in areas where there is a problem.  They provided these facilities out of their own resources now that there is no grant aid for this work.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the history of the canals, it is amazing to find that the development and building of the canals signalled the era of the commencement of railway building.  Undoubtedly there was more money earned and work created in respect of those two developments than was ever made from the usage made of them subsequently.  At that time the <Col N="1627" /> Ulster Canal was developed so as to connect Lough Neagh with the River Erne from the Blackwater at Charlemont village in Armagh to the River Finn.  It was to provide navigable waterways from Belfast to Lough Neagh and to the Blackwater and from North Monaghan to the east of that county.  A total of between of 35 and 40 miles of canal was involved. William Dargan, the engineer who was in charge of the development, was reputed to be one of the best engineers of the time either in England or here in respect of road construction or of the development of waterways or of railways. In 1918 the figure he arrived at for the development of the waterway I have described was £223,000 but the highest reputed income from the canal after its opening was about £500 per annum net. The development involved some of the landed gentry and local merchants who had requested parliament to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dargan at that time was taking on hopeless cases.  He was doing the sort of work that Fóir Teoranta are doing now. If he were around today he would probably be called a liquidator.  There would be plenty of work for him to do.  It is said that the church in which I worship was being erected at that time by way of direct labour, with people giving of their time voluntarily to do the work.  The local tradesmen were of a poor quality but Dargan's team were said to be superb. Bridges built by them stand as monuments to the quality of their work.  They excelled in stonework.  It is reputed that they were so much annoyed by the incompetence of the local builders that they demolished that church and then proceeded to rebuild it in the evenings in their spare time and after they had finished building bridges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson has referred to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  If this canal linkage between the Erne and the Shannon were developed we would have one of the greatest assets in Europe in so far as a waterway is concerned.  We had looked to the cross-Border development in this respect.  Much good work has been <Col N="1628" /> done as a result of the availability of the Border fund.  The Hope Castle development in Castleblayney is an example of this work.  I went through the grounds at the weekend.  That fund is very useful to the Office of Public Works and to anybody else involved in this development. The Minister of State who is present comes from a county which, though not having much association with the Border, has got some benefit from the Border fund.  Sometimes questions are asked in my constituency as to how that county succeeded in this way.</P>

      <P>If the cake is big enough we do not mind someone else getting a little of it.  There have been a number of studies related to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I am glad to hear that the hydrological survey being conducted will be completed in 1986 but I trust it will not be subjected to the same fate as the many other studies in relation to this area.  We have had, for example, the Erne catchment study, the Mourne-Newry stuady, the study conducted by the EC Social and Economic Committee which concerned the complete Border region and, also in conjunction with the EC, a study conducted by the NorthEastern Regional Development Organisation. If all the money spent on those studies could be spent now on the development of the canal at least a few of the sluices would be in operation.  Studies are fine but they must be followed up in terms of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment schemes and various other schemes could be used to great advantage in the development of our waterways.  For instance, they could be availed of to have scrub and other growth removed from the canals.  Local authorities in whose areas the canals are located should avail of the opportunity of these schemes to employ young people to carry out such work.  I welcome the changeover but I trust that the development of the canals will go ahead.  I trust, too that the Government and Bord Fáilte will not <Col N="1629" /> demolish the Midland Regional Tourism Organisation and divide up the lakeland area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming the Bill.  I commend the Government on their initiative in bringing the Bill first to the other House.  This illustrates their anxiety to have the Bill passed through both Houses as quickly as possible and thereby to pass on to the Office of Public works responsibility for the management of the Royal and Grand Canals.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill particularly in the sense that it provides an opportunity for the development of a greater link between Dublin and the area east of the Shannon.  I am not very familiar with the midland areas but I have seen the canal through Kildare and Offaly and I have noticed that outside the urban areas our waterways have been fairly well preserved. Work can be got under way quickly to provide suitable amenities for the type of leisure cruisers which are found in large numbers on the continent. However, I would be concerned in regard to any question of an Office of Public Works engineering study because the work could be undertaken in conjunction with such notable bodies as the engineering school in UCD or in some of the other universities.  There is a need to expedite both survey and study.  The involvement of students and staff in the development of this type of transport system for the late eighties is most desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Shannon waterway, from time to time Clare County Council have had complaints about pollution of Lough Derg.  Some of this has been attributed to unlimited dumping of waste from pleasure cruisers on the lake.  It was horrifying to hear that pollution and weeds had spread from Portumna past Mountshannon.  The Office of Public Works should draw up a memorandum of controls and have the areas policed. There has been a great growth in traffic on the Shannon and continentals are most interested in this kind of activity.  The developments on the Shannon at <Col N="1630" /> Mountshannon, Whitegate and Dromineer have shown that they really appreciate the pleasure of sailing and cruising on the lakes and waterways.  In former days tourists spent many a night at halting places along the canals and many villages grew up around them.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work will have to be done to get all the interested bodies together and it will take more than just a survey carried out by OPW or an engineering study carried out by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  As members of local authorities we are all aware of the way in which OPW rate different surveys.  They have a system of examination and I would not be confident that this would enhance the promotion of the canals unless it is given top priority.  I take it from the way in which the Bill was introduced that it is intended to accord it such priority.  Many jobs could be created through using the canals for boating, fishing and so on.  I hope the canals will be brought back to their former glory.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with controls of fish stocks.  I understand this matter was fully debated in the Seanad.  We should be able to keep our waterways clean.  We should provide for the commercial development of the canals.  It would be advantageous if heavy goods such as coal could be transported on the waterways.  For example, it would be possible to bring coal from Moneypoint by barge to the midlands.  It would also save money which is currently used to maintain county and national roads.  The roads are in a bad state of repair as a result of heavily laden lorries transporting goods from one county to another.  The New Ross boatyard which concentrated on building barges might be given a new lease of life.  The receiver there sold five or six barges and they could be used on the waterways.  If the canals are fully utilised there will be a new awareness of their value which will be of long term benefit to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to <Col N="1631" /> thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I do so genuinely and sincerely and not for the routine reason. This has been an exceptional debate in many respects.  I have long experience of listening to Dáil debates as a reporter and not as a participant.  I recall very few debates which had the same type of character as this one.  I am not seeking to elevate its importance although it is important in that a great national asset is being handed over from one section to another where we hope it will grow in prosperity.</P>
      <P>The character of the debate stemmed from the deep personal interest all the speakers had in the subject and their love of the canals and waterways.  We had several examples today and in the earlier debate where the speakers were moved to flights of poetry in addition to many Deputies introducing very apt quotations. It has been a great experience.  I recall a previous debate on the canals. The contribution I always treasure as one of the most beautiful I heard was by Deputy James Dillon perhaps from here as Minister for Agriculture or on the other side as Leader of the Opposition. He gave a wonderfully graphic description of the British angler catching a fish along the canal here, having his photograph taken, patting the fish on the head and throwing it back, only to return the following week and do the same thing until they reached first name acquaintanceship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has been a great pleasure for me in my official capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Communications, but also in my other capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Arts, Culture and Heritage.  It is rather unusual that the sponsoring Department, if you like, are handing over the authority for the canals which are the subject of this debate.  I am very pleased, therefore, at the contribution made by my colleague, Deputy Joe Bermingham, who will be taking responsibility.  The Commissioners of Public Works and the Minister will carefully consider all the very useful suggestions made by the Deputies for <Col N="1632" /> the improvement and protection of the Grand and Royal Canals as public amenities.</P>
    <P>Another very significant thing about the debate was the number of very substantial and imaginative suggestions made as to what might be done in the future administration of the canals by the Office of Public Works.  The Minister has given a great personal commitment, in addition to committing the Office of Public Works to the future development of the canals.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, this Bill heralds a new and exciting era for the Grand and Royal Canals.  They have been with us now for about 200 years and the sooner this era begins the better.  Therefore, early enactment of the Bill would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputies Wilson, O'Rourke, Manning and Prendergast which does not deal directly with the canals but with the records, in which all the speakers expressed considerable interest.  I agree wholeheartedly with their preservation.  We have had unbroken continuity of ownership of the canals for 200 years.  This has resulted in very extensive volumes of records relating to the canals and the surrounding areas. These could be classified, to a certain extent, as a national asset, giving a major insight into social and commercial life of the time.  In my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Arts and Culture I have responsibility for these and for the National Archives Bill at present before Seanad Éireann.  This provides for the transfer to a new National Archives of departmental and other records not normally required for administrative purposes and for the making available of such records for public inspection. Already, we have got to work as far as the canals are concerned.  A preliminary survey by the Keeper of the State Papers of the canal records in the care of CIE has confirmed their enormous value.  A more detailed survey is now in progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Where are these records?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in a variety of locations.  We do not want just to collect <Col N="1633" /> them, deposit them somewhere and have to take them back and deposit them in the National Archives or whatever is the arrangement made for them.  That is one of the reasons for making the present study.  The complete minutes of both canal companies are in existence and title documents, maps, plans of the canals and files relating to their management.  Some of these documents will continue to be used on an on-going basis for administrative purposes.  As I indicated previously, I propose to discuss with CIE and the Commissioners of Public Works in due course how best the canal records can be preserved for the nation.  The results of the study has revealed how valuable these records are.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan spoke about the poor condition of certain by-roads adjoining the Grand Canal in County Kildare.  He urged that they be maintained.  Deputy Power also mentioned this matter.  However, it is important to point out, as did the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, that such roads should not be used or developed in any way which would endanger the canal bank.  That is the key consideration.  The public amenity value of the canal must be safeguarded.  Notwithstanding that, it is up to the relevant local authority to get together with the Office of Public Works to see what needs to be done in particular areas and to arrange for action which is mutually beneficial.  Obviously, the Office of Public Works should not encroach on matters within the responsibility of the relevant local authority. What are needed here are co-operation and goodwill.  We heard from the Minister, Deputy Bermingham, a guarantee that co-operation and goodwill will be available from the Office of Public Works.  Therefore, with the local authorities and the local communities, we shall have no great difficulty in solving problems which will arise.  Obviously, the residents need to have proper road facilities leading to their accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Wilson, O'Rourke, McEllistrim and, later on, Deputy Power &mdash; and, indeed, most Deputies &mdash; referred to the question of the canal staff and their <Col N="1634" /> transfer.  I have no reason to believe that the canal staff are unhappy with section 3(2) inserted by Seanad Éireann.  Deputy Bermingham, the Minister with responsibility in that area, said that considerable progress has already been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are going on day and night.  It was mentioned, perhaps by the Deputy and certainly by Deputy Power about the compensation provision in the Bill for such things as free travel facilities which were available when the employees worked for CIE.  It is recognised that CIE benefits could not be availed of out of CIE employment.  That has been recognised by the staff themselves and their representatives suggested a compensation provision.  There will be no difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>All the various pluses and minuses will be taken into account.  No-one will be worse off arising from the transfer.  It will be impossible to offer free travel facilities to people working outside CIE.  One would not know where it would end if that attitude were taken.  There is a provision for compensation, not continuance of the facility that existed previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Skelly urged that stiff penalties be imposed on persons throwing rubbish into the canals.  Such penalties already exist under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and the Litter Act, 1982.  Enforcement of these Acts is hardly adequate, given the obvious amount of pollution abounding.  The Canals Bill provides similar penalites for breaches of the by-laws which the Commissioner of Public Works will be making under section 7 of the Bill which regulates boating on the canals and to protect them from damage by pollution and so on. Maximum penalties imposed in the Bill <Col N="1635" /> are £1,000 and/or six months' imprisonment on summary conviction, or £5,000 plus £500 a day for the continuing of the infringement and/or two years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Commissioners of Public Works will take appropriate action against polluters and others who threaten the public amenity value of the canals.  There must, of course, be a clear response from all the local communities in areas through which the canals flow, in order to safeguard them as a public amentiy.  No-one should pollute or in any other way damage the canals.  That is the key to it.  If the local communities through whose areas the canals flow have pride in their canals, as they have already demonstrated they have, then we will not have pollution.  If they have not that pride, then, irrespective of the penalties, it will be extraordinarly difficult to get rid of pollution.  A lot depends on the communities who live near the banks of the canals.  However, what we have heard in this debate of what has been done in local communities argurs extremely well for the care they will take when an effort is made by the Office of Public Works to beautify the canals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning asked about the possibility of using the canals for the transport of goods.  I realise one can never rule out that possibility. Deputy Carey mentioned earlier the possibility of using the Shannon Navigation for the transport of coal from Moneypoint.  This is an intriguing idea.  Although one cannot rule it out, I think the days of canals as major transport arteries are over.  It is very labour intensive, requiring the opening and closing of locks and the loading and unloading of goods to the various businesses and warehouses.  Transport by lorries has proved much more cost effective. The Grand Canal Company tried to make up their own loss of traffic on the Grand Canal by having a lorry service but it was too late to compensate for the loss and they never really got into that business.</P>
    <P>So far as the use of the canals is concerned, <Col N="1636" /> we must look elsewhere.  There are many uses such as pleasure boating, fishing, swimming and so on.  The only limitation is that of our own imagination as to what can be done.  Very good suggestions were put forward today and I have no doubt they will be examined by the Office of Public Works.  Many could be revenue-generating rather than costing a lot of money.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to secure the future of the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal as an amenity for the benefit of the public.  Someone in the debate spoke of the danger of this Bill becoming merely a paper transaction that would not be worked on once the hand-over had taken place.  On this occasion it is somewhat different.  We are transferring responsibility from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  The canals will be in good hands. It is no good in saying the whole canal system will be tackled immediately.  That kind of money is not readily available at this moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It will not all happen at once.  The fact that basically it is a good cause in which everyone is interested guarantees that in due course money will be made available.  The first obligation of the Office of Public Works will be to inspect the canals to see what repair and preservation work has to be done.  It is my view that the canals are being handed over to very caring hands.  The commissioners will have imposed on them the obligation to maintain the canals for the enjoyment and recreation of the public, whether it be for navigation, fishing or other leisure pursuits.  The Bill has been welcomed in this House, in the Seanad and by the public and I look forward to <Col N="1637" /> the support of the House in securing the early enactment of this measure.</P>
      <P>It is all a question of co-operation.  We will get the full benefit of this major asset if there is co-operation on the part of all. Deputy Wilson earlier spoke about the Ballyconnell Canal and he spoke of the great merit in linking the Barrow Navigation with Lough Erne.  That would also have the other, not inconsequential, benefit of linking Deputy Wilson's constituency with my constituency.  Like the Deputy, I was very pleased to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, say that by mid-1986 we will have the definitive engineering report on this project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Valuation Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to clarify and reinforce some provisions in rating valuation law and to prevent the erosion of the valuation base with the consequent loss of revenue by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The principal provision arises from section 7 of the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860, which stipulates that, in valuing any mill, factory or other industrial building, the Commissioner of Valuation shall not take account of the value of any machinery, except such as is used for the production of motive power.  In recent times, particularly with the increasing automation of manufacturing, there have been more and more frequent attempts to have many items of fixed plant associated with a manufacturing process treated as machinery.  Examples of plant which have been called into question are industrial silos, brewery vats and bakery ovens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner of Valuation has consistently valued such plant, but in a number of important cases the courts have found in favour of the appellants, that is, to the effect that the items in question were machinery.  It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 7 in order to remove any doubts and to confirm the <Col N="1639" /> traditional practice.  The new section 7 provides that plant in the nature of a permanent fixture shall be valued and the categories are listed at section 8.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a similar provision relating to certain types of fixed property other than plant which hitherto have been valued in accordance with the Valuation Acts, though not specifically referred to in that legislation.  Some of these types of property did not exist or were not of practical significance when the code was established in the last century.  Car parks are a good example.  The categories of fixed property involved are listed in the schedule to section 3.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in addition, provides statutory authority for the long established practice of fixing valuations of rateable hereditaments by reference to the valuation of similar hereditaments already valued.  This practice is necessary because the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, prescribes that the valuation of buildings shall be based upon an estimate of the net annual letting value.  Letting values have undergone radical changes in the course of time due to inflation and to other factors, but in the absence of a general revaluation the changes have not been reflected in property valuations generally.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, to prevent distortions and inequities arising as between old and new valuations and to preserve relativities, the practice has been to determine the rateable valuation by reducing the estimated current letting value to a figure consistent with the valuation of comparable properties already rated.  This is referred to as &ldquo;maintaining the tone of the valuation list&rdquo;, that is, it preserves a reasonable relationship between valuations within and between rating areas.  I have decided to avail of the present Bill to put the practice on a formal legal basis.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the Bill does not represent any change in valuation or rating policy.  It does not seek to extend the type of properties to be valued and rated.  On the contrary, it will merely help to preserve the traditional <Col N="1640" /> valuation base and remove doubts about the interpretation of some existing provisions.</P>
    <P>By way of some further background explanation it might be useful if I said a brief word about some recent court rulings in the matter.  Difficulties in the interpretation of section 7 of the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860 &mdash; to which I have referred &mdash; have arisen because the word &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; is not defined in the Act, nor is it defined anywhere else in the valuation code.  The variety of types of machinery one may now expect to find in a factory as well as variations in their adaptation, situation or use may render definition almost impossible.  In the late fifties legal challenges to the rateability of certain plant began to emerge on the basis of the ambiguity of the meaning of the word &ldquo;machinery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion of the courts in cases heard to date is that any plant, tank or vessel to which or in which force is applied in any way in the process of manufacture is a machine and accordingly not rateable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Plant, tank or what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or vessel.  The conclusion is, in some cases, that not only mechanical movement, as in, for example, a rotary kiln but also the pumping of air or gas, or the addition of chemicals, can turn tanks or vessels, even where they are linked into a building, into machinery thus resulting in a situation in which they are regarded as not being rateable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following earlier court decisions the number of appeals in matters of this kind has increased very substantially in recent years.  There are quite a number of cases now under appeal.  The interpretation adopted by the courts has begun to create a substantial loss of rates income to local authorities and, in some cases, local authorities have been required to refund rates already collected.  All local authorities are potentially affected.  A continuation of that situation would result in a further erosion of their financial base, entailing, in some cases, considerable <Col N="1641" /> losses of revenue.  The corrective measures proposed in this Bill are urgently required in order to prevent this deterioration in local authority finances.</P>
    <P>I might make a brief reference to land used for sporting purposes.  The Bill maintains the <i>status quo</i> as far as sports grounds are concerned, that is that land used for such purposes as football, golf, horse racing and so on &mdash; because it has always been valued as agricultural land &mdash; is not subject to the payment of rates. Therefore the Bill specifically provides for the exclusion of land developed for sport from the categories of property to which the provisions of the Valuation Acts will now apply.  In this way the <i>status quo</i> with regard to the payment of rates by sports clubs will be maintained.  Of course most sports fields were not subject to rates because their valuations were low enough to qualify for relief of rates through the agricultural grant.  The rateability of sports buildings, for example, dressing rooms, club houses and so on, will not be affected by the provisions of this Bill since such buildings will continue to be, as they always have been, liable to rates.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that an Act passed in 1860 and which used a word with such wide connotations as &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; might need amending in 1985.  I take the Minister's point when he says that there has been such development in technology over the last 20 years or so that such definition is needed more and more.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned basic objects like industrial silos, brewery vats and bakery ovens being called into question, as to whether they should be included for valuation purposes.  I accept that there is a need for this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has a similar provision relating to certain types of fixed property other than plant which hitherto have been valued in accordance with the <Col N="1642" /> Valuation Acts though not specifically referred to in that legislation.</P>
    <P>He cites car parks as a good example.  I have not got a copy of the Schedule here. I want to ask the Minister if car parks are included in the Schedule for valuation purposes in the future.  He might tell me when replying.</P>
    <P>The Minister then says:</P>
    <P>Letting values have undergone radical changes in the course of time due to inflation and to other factors but, in the absence of a general revaluation the changes have not been reflected in property valuations generally.</P>
    <P>Which is self-evident.  Throughout the 19th and so far in the 20th century we can see the seesaw of inflation.  If one looked at the period between the two World Wars, the 1914-18 and the 1939-45, one would have seen that there was very little inflation, but then there was also very little employment, very little of anything else at that time.  I always think that the people who push the idea that a cure for inflation constitutes a cure for an ill economy are barking up the wrong tree.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the preservation of old and new valuations and the preservation of relativities.  I recall having a conversation with the late Mr. Sean McEntee, Minister for Local Government in the thirties, when he set about a revaluation in the city of Dublin. It was his theory &mdash; and he proved it to my satisfaction anyway &mdash; that streets such as O'Connell Street which was then, and I suppose still is, the commercial powerhouse of the city, were valued at a very low rate and he was convinced that the valuation should be much higher. Compared with the valuation of businesses on the perimeter of the city as it was at that time &mdash; of course a much smaller area covered than the city covers now &mdash; he regarded the relativities as being out of kilter and, while he remained in that Department, he pushed very much for a revision.</P>
    <P>I may be mistaken in the portfolio but he was succeeded by Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly <Col N="1643" /> who did not go ahead with the revaluation which he had intended to do.  I can understand how business concerns would look at every loophole in order to escape high rates.  Therefore I can understand that there may have been many court cases with the intention of excluding what is of substantial valuation and relieving the burden of rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a sketch of court rulings necessitated by the vagueness of the use of the word &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; in section 7 of the 1860 Act.  The word &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; is an interesting one and is derived from the Greek word for a device &mdash;<i>mechane</i>.  I should like to see someone as a <i>deus ex machina</i> rather than myself who did not expect to be taking this Bill. The Minister referred to a plant, tank or vessel which was subjected to force.  Did the Minister use the word &ldquo;force&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To which or in which force was applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered that was equal to machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it shows the danger of leaving to the courts a precise definition of what is imprecisely defined in an Act.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said that land used for sports and so on which was formerly valued as agricultural land is being excluded from rating obligations.  This will be applauded and approved by the House.  The Minister used the beautiful, subtle phrase &ldquo;maintaining the tone of the valuation list&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the context here.  I <Col N="1644" /> mentioned that certain people had made studies of the relativities as between centre city areas of Dublin, very rich commercial centres, and less rich areas in the same city.  I do not think one could refer in that context to the maintenance of the tone of a valuation list.  I should like a little expansion on that point.  Does it refer in any way to what I have been talking about?  The definition is that it preserves a reasonable relationship between valuations within and between rating areas.  If one is assessing valuation with reference to potential for making profit for its owners in trading rather than leasing or letting, that would require a great deal of commercial and legal knowledge and a long and painstaking study of valuations in any area.  As far as I remember, in the Six Counties of northeast Ireland there was a full scale revaluation some time ago which brought about major changes in the valuation system there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that this Bill does not make any major changes in the valuation system since that whole system could do with a major reappraisal and revamp.  The system as we inherited it and continued it is tired and worn out and has been operating in an entirely artificial way.  This Bill is designed to prop it up for a litle longer.  The system is riddled with inconsistencies and artificialities. After all this time we should really devise a more consistent and better system of raising local taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion that valuation is referable to the letting value of the property concerned is a complete fiction and nonsense. The figures that apply bear no relationship to the letting value.  They are done on a comparison basis &ldquo;maintaining the tone of the valuation list&rdquo;.  I also noted that phrase with interest.  Some notional basis is taken and then the tone is maintained by making a comparison of one with another.  More often than not years, if not decades, elapse between revaluations when the figures are revised and updated.  If there is to be any sense in the system they have to be revised on a regular basis, possibly every year or two <Col N="1645" /> years, but the Valuation Office do not have the staff for that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>There are many glaring examples of modern property which is given a high valuation whereas a comparable building erected years ago has a lower valuation, even though the building might be finer and have a higher letting value.  If the system is to be retained, at least the fictional element ought to be dispensed with.  There should be a revaluation based on the letting value, if that is what the Act specifies, rather than this nonsense of taking a range of figures below the letting value and maintaining the tone of the valuation list.  I understand that in some parts of the UK where they did a revamp at some stage they used this system.  The valuation figures they use now accord with the letting values.  At least that makes more sense.  Obviously, when one does that one has to adjust the rating figure to take account of that increased figure and, instead of having rates of £10 in the pound or £14 in the pound, such as we have, the rate might be 50p in the pound or 90p in the pound. At least that would bring some sense and reason into this rather than maintaining this artificiality with great laboriousnes and to very little purpose at all.</P>
    <P>One would have to wonder whether the whole concept of raising local taxation through this method is not really past it.  The time has come for a more radical alteration in the approach to the question of raising finance for local authorities rather than through this method.  The present system was a carry on of the old poor law system.  I believe that originally the valuations were called poor law valuations.  They had their role to play over the years but now more modern thinking in the western democracy tends to go away from the idea of a fixed notional value attached to each piece of property.  I understand that in the United States local authorities raise their finances by means of some form of local income tax or VAT.  I have not carried out a detailed study of how well that works &mdash; I do not have the resources to do that &mdash; but it sounds to me like a more modern approach to the concept of <Col N="1646" /> raising finances by local authorities.  I do not deny that that system might present some difficulties.  Certainly, it would require great care in its organisation.</P>
    <P>I note that the most recent report of the Commission on Taxation which landed on my desk today gave the idea of a local taxation the thumbs down.  I have not studied that report in great detail but I have some reservations about that finding because I am aware that a local income tax or VAT system operates widely in the US and, I believe, in some European countries.  There must be a great deal of merit in it.  It has one decided advantage in that at least it is referable to the ability of the concern or undertaking to pay.  If they have set up in a factory or premises and are doing well they will pay more and if they are keeping a workforce going but are doing poorly they will have less, or nothing, to pay under this system.  One will balance out the other.</P>
    <P>To put a fixed rate, irrespective of the product of the premises concerned, can operate as a hardship on some businesses, and, in some cases, may cause job losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the tax on farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will talk about that another day in another context.  It is fairer if a business that is doing well pays a higher contribution while one that is not doing so well but yet is performing a very useful role in the community by providing useful employment pays less so as to be able to continue.  That might not be possible under the present regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the question of car parks is dealt with in the Bill.  It is very appropriate that taxation should be raised from that source.  It is a very remunerative business and one that is acquiring increased importance.  I must express some disappointment at the fact that there seems to be a tendency in Dublin to farm out the car parks to foreign investors and leave them to be run by companies from the UK or elsewhere.  I fail to see why Dublin Corporation, a big culprit in this regard, should be so quick and eager to farm out the many car parks they have. Surely it would not stretch the imagination <Col N="1647" /> for them to be able to run those parks.  At least the Bill has a provision that some contribution will be forthcoming from that source towards corporation and local authority funds.</P>
    <P>My main criticism is that the old valuation system is tired.  I have held that view for some time.  The system is artificial and has outlived its usefulness.  The time has come for us to revamp the system and devise a new method, possibly through a local income tax or VAT system.  The sooner we get rid of the fictionalised, inconsistent and unfair system that operates at present the better.  The Bill refers to maintaining the tone of the valuation system.  I interjected when Deputy Wilson was contributing to say that it was a discordant tone.  The point I was trying to make was that there is no consistency there.  It is completely inconsistent and one would be hard put to find any kind of sensible tone running through it.  In fact, that was the whole basis of the unconstitutional finding as far as farm valuations were concerned.  The same inconsistency that was found by the courts in that instance would apply, if it was examined, to industrial premises.  I am not inviting anyone to take a constitutional action but that finding highlights the very unwieldy nature of the whole system.  It illustrates the fact that we will have to look &mdash; I hope it will not be too long &mdash; at some new arrangement for a more consistent system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Taylor, in that simplification has not been achieved. If there could be any comparison drawn between it and the property laws we have, it is that we seem to believe that one should not interfere with a tradition that has been build up over the centuries in spite of the fact that it may be cumbersome, outdated, complicated, costly, and totally musunderstood by all, except by experts.  We do not seem to be able to reform the areas that need to be changed. I have no qualms about taking what the Minister has said at face value but the <Col N="1648" /> Bill fails in that we have not taken advantage of the opportunity presented to us by introducing new legislation that deals with an outdated area.  It would be fine if we could unravel this legislation and lay it out for the 20th century, or the eighties at least.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that it is a good idea to put this in statutory form considering that it seems to be very theoretical in certain areas.  It would be far better to simplify it and to make sure that it works before putting it into statute form.  We are dealing here mainly with industrial rateable valuations which are unfamiliar to the ordinary member of the public and the implications of which are something many people do not worry about.  Nonetheless I would like to see some figures, on Committee Stage, to see what kind of revenue is obtained from industrial rateable valuations and what service is provided to manufacturers for the rates paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand sections 3 and 8. The definitions between the two areas are left suitably vague so that it is entirely up to the Minister as in section 8 (2) where by order he may &ldquo;add to that Schedule a category of plant specified in the order&rdquo;. Section 8 tries to define the schedules but it does not really do so.  It refers to &ldquo;constructions affixed to the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building&rdquo;. It is not right for a local authority to stick a rate on to everything put up inside a business premises.  Specific reference is made to ponds and reservoirs. Twice during the last ten years I have witnessed the dismantling of premises with both of those items included, one being the dismantling of Killeen Paper Mills which had been in existence since 1775 and which employed 750 workers when it finally closed down ten years ago. When a paper mill is built it includes excavating the ground and laying down the base for a pond.  I do not see why a manufacturer has to be penalised while providing machinery which will help to produce jobs.  Both Killeen Paper Mills and Clondalkin Paper Mills, soon to be reopened, had ponds attached to them. The pond in Clondalkin was a great <Col N="1649" /> amenity, an amenity which was not being provided by the local authority.  It was ridiculous to strike a rate on that pond. The pond was stocked and the locals could fish in it.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum does not seem to explain the Bill which follows. It is not a good idea to introduce legislation which is not easily understood and about which there is a feeling of disagreement.  This Bill is archaic and it does not work very well.  During Committee Stage, if people were to give the time to it, it could be easily demonstrated that it does not work very well but I am certain that people will not bother going through it because it is cumbersome and uninteresting.  As Members of Parliament we should feel it incumbent on us to make abundantly clear what we are doing because at the end of the day we will have to vote on it.  Would we vote on something that we do not understand, that does not really fit the legislation which we are trying to update and which has been on the books for the last 100 years or so?  We should have some definitive account of the workings of this proposed legislation brought to the attention of Members of the House so that we could get the gist of it and check it out against whatever is available to us in the Library or in other countries.  In a new country like Australia they have no such complications in their property law or valuations.  They have not the huge body of land law that we have.  One can go into a real estate agent's office and buy a property and get it registered without complication.  We seem to be stuck with this outdated legislation.</P>
    <P>The IDA, the Department of Finance and the Government generally have a policy over the last 20 years of trying to encourage business and industry and we have deliberately sacrificed revenue to get employment, in the long term hope of building up our own technology and expertise so that we can set up our own businesses.  It is not satisfactory that local authorities can add indeterminate amounts of rates to premises or appendages to premises or things like ponds, silos and fixed machinery in order to gain revenue. <Col N="1650" /> What do the local authorities give in return for these rates?  For water rates one gets a service but for industrial rates, firms get nothing in return for money they pay out for something they build and maintain themselves.  Why they have to get rates for the containment of a substance, for the transmission of a substance or of electric current, I fail to see.  I am concerned about some Acts which have come through the House recently and the bureaucratising of what has been up to now a freedom where human contact usually sorts out problems &mdash; for example, the Bill that was slipped through the House recently in ten minutes enabling the ESB to put pylons and poles on people's lands without having formally to seek permission and so that there would be no objections.  This is not the right way to go about it.</P>
    <P>I see no mention in the Bill of a method of appeal or of what happens.  Nothing happens, of course, if the Minister makes an order.  While it is often necessary for the Minister to be able to make orders, sometimes he can be given a power of which we will not know the effect until later on.  I do not intend disrespect when I say that Departments sometimes decide that something should certainly be rated. Business people sometimes suffer the frustration of having a very high rate struck on a building, part of a building or on their land and often there is very little they can do about it except appeal.  A facility should be available for a person to appeal such a rate to some body who will at least have an understanding of the difficulty the appellant is in.  That does not seem to be available in a great deal of legislation and, when we bring in legislation, that should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>This Bill is like many other Bills which seem to contain standard criteria.  These seem to be a format in practically every Bill.  That kind of format has not changed since I came into this House, and I am three years here this week.  Someone should have a look again at a procedure of drafting legislation such as this.  It is very tempting always to go to the Library or to precedents for the format and to put it in.  As Deputy Taylor said, we <Col N="1651" /> have been doing this for so long and so regularly that it is automatic.  The windows need to be opened and the cobwebs swept away.  Perhaps during the summer officials from different Departments should take a trip to other countries and examine the attitudes around the world which might help to untie us from the procedure which has been adopted traditionally in Britain over the years.  We seem to copy everything from them.</P>

      <P>When I was a student here I thought that I would apply to the corporation, because they were putting in the first of these car parks, to run the car parks and I would have been able to do it in my spare time with some other students.  But we must go abroad to get a British company to run a lot that has been demolished a few months previously and which will lie flat for a couple of years and they will put up a chicken house with an Irishman in it from 8 a.m. to midnight and collect money from him and stamp a ticket.  We cannot do that.  We cannot even give so much out to ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion put down by our spokesman for the environment, Deputy Molloy.  It is evidence of the Government's lack of understanding and the lack of rapport between the Government and the rural community that their amendment to our motion has nothing whatsoever to do with the topic.  The Government's amendment is as follows:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the commitment of the Government to roads as demonstrated by the publication of the new Road Plan which contains a realistic development programme, the provision of substantially increased State funding and the announcement of the first ever medium term financial commitment for improvement and maintenance covering the period 1985 to 1987&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister for the Environment, that amendment has nothing to do with the terms of our motion. Therefore, in the strict sense of the word, it is not an amendment.  It deals with funding for national primary, national secondary and regional roads.  Nowhere in the national plan, or in any statement by the Minister, can I locate any direct reference to county road funding.  When our spokesman winds up this debate tomorrow evening, he will be suggesting that the condition of our county roads has deteriorated to such an extent that special funding will have to be allocated for their maintenance and repair.</P>
      <P>This problem has become especially evident in the past two and a half to three years during which funding to local authorities has decreased dramatically. The allocation of funding under the various sub-heads has also fallen and the county roads, being the bottom line, are the main area where sub-standard funding has shown up dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is in the light of the main developmental <Col N="1655" /> work and the many fine undertakings of ring roads, by-pass roads and bridges.  All of this work is very worthy. Every Government should have a national road plan.  In County Westmeath under the previous Government we had the commencement of the by-pass road around Athlone and the bridge over the Shannon.  This work is well on its way with CPOs and various other undertakings. That is fine until you consider that, within a few yards of any primary road or secondary road, conditions can be deplorable and practically like the trenches in World War One.</P>
    <P>The roads are in a state of disrepair and there are potholes.  It may seem to some people that it is not important to talk about potholes, but there are roads on which you cannot drive a car or a creamery truck.  In some areas of our country the CIE school buses will not collect children at pick up points because of the serious deterioration in the physical structure of the county roads.  The increase in vehicular traffic is evidence of what might be called affluence.  Most farmers and householders have a car.  A son or a daughter goes into the nearest town or centre of employment daily in the car.  These are welcome signs of life going on and of growing affluence.</P>
    <P>For some years past the county roads have been subjected to a volume of traffic which was never anticipated when they were being built.  It was never anticipated that they would have to carry heavy vehicular traffic.  People dealing in sand pits use the county roads to get to their main areas of employment.  Roads are being used for purposes which were never anticipated.  We all welcome and applaud a national road plan and the funding it brings in its wake from the EC.  When we travel the highways and see signs saying that the road work is being funded by such and such an EC fund, we are glad and we say: &ldquo;So much for development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In many instances that funding cannot be taken up by the county council for that year.  They have a particular span of 12 months in which to spend the money and the CPOs take much longer to work out <Col N="1656" /> than was originally anticipated.  In our county there is an example of one recalcitrant land owner holding up progress. That means the funding for the road cannot be allocated.  I know the Minister will say that is one compartment for funding for the national primary routes and it cannot be touched for the county roads. We accept that it is one particular funding. We cannot accept that there is no national allocation of funding for the county roads.  The position has become serious over the past two and half to three years.  The Minister has many meetings in his own constituency and many county roads too.  If he goes to a political meeting, or a community meeting, or a meeting dealing with a group water scheme, or a parents' meeting, the first topic which will come up after the main item has been discussed is the state of the county roads.</P>
    <P>It is easy to point to the huge amount of work being carried out, but that does not satisfy the people who live on the county roads.  Why should it?  They welcome the development of the national roads.  They are living within sight and sound of gigantic road works but the conditions of their county roads are more appropriate to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century.  They find increasingly difficult to drive on these roads.  I hesitate to bring in a rural-urban slant but, because of their lack of regard for this very important matter, the Government are showing disrespect for and neglect of the mainly rural population whom these roads serve.</P>
    <P>The problem has become very acute and I am sure Deputies from both sides of the House will tell the Minister what their engineering staffs have told them about the state of their county roads.  In County Westmeath which I represent the maintenance cycle for the county roads is the worst in Ireland.  We should be running in a ten to 12 year cycle, but I have been informed reliably that we are on a 35 year cycle of funding for maintenance. When we think of that and the amount of traffic on the roads, and the number of people using them, we wonder why it has been allowed to continue to <Col N="1657" /> such an extent.  No Government who say they have a national road plan can really be seen to have one if they have not got a plan for the funding of the county roads. This is a very serious example of the way in which the powers of the local councillors have been diminished over the past few years.  Local councillors are accountable to the electorate.  We will be going about knocking on doors and seeking votes shortly, we will be asked questions about activity into which we we have had no input and for which we have had very little responsibility in regard to funding.</P>
    <P>A good deal of work and research needs to be undertaken in the matter of the reform of the structure and the developed powers of local councillors. One way in which a councillor could be accountable to the electorate would be by his being able to say that the local authority would be spending X amount on certain roads in 1986 or 1987 or in whatever would be the appropriate year. We would visualise the funding being allocated from central funds but being divided in accordance with the wishes and directions of locally elected members with the help of the expertise of the engineering and administrative staffs of the local authorities.  Only in this way could the actions of councillors be seen to have effect.  The electorate are infuriated because the roads have been allowed to deteriorate so much.  It is small comfort to them to say that by way of EC and national funding £28 million will be spent on roads in County Westmeath in the coming five years.  A sum of that order is to be spent on a national by-pass route for Athlone and also for Mullingar and for a bridge across the Shannon but that will not have any off-spin so far as the county roads are concerned.  I am not asking that the fund be touched.  In reality it cannot be, but we are asking that there be a total review in each county.  Our aim would be that the engineering staff of every county council would undertake a complete review of the state of each county road within their area of responsibility. They would note when a road had last been repaired and would prepare a <Col N="1658" /> programme of work for the following few years outlining when each county road should be repaired.  The very fabric of life is involved here.  The plain people of Ireland live along the county roads.  We must not allow our rural areas to become depopulated.  In this connection it is worth quoting a couple of lines from Goldsmith's, <i>The Deserted Village.</i></P>
    <P>They are:</P>
    <P>Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.</P>
    <P>The rush to the urban centres is fine.  So also is the rush to find work, to avail of social services and so on, but at the end of the day one must travel the roads.  We are doing very badly so far as the rural population is concerned by reason of the way in which we have neglected our roads.  However, by way of this motion we are taking steps to remedy that situation. We are asking that the Government commit themselves to maintaining our roads and we are saying that in the event of their failure in this area, we intend to ensure that when we return to office, and before then when we hope to have a majority representation in the county councils, one of the main matters of debate within council chambers will be the repair and maintenance of the roads. Funding for this work must be considered urgently and realistically.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that more powers will be bestowed on elected members but to date neither the outgoing members nor the potential members have seen any evidence of what the Minister intends doing in terms of these devolved powers.  Outgoing members who will be re-elected will be returning to office on the same terms as those applying when they leave office and new members will be full of hope in regard to making a real input into their communities; but the present position is that local authority members have very little input into the community. In 1983, for instance, responsibility for water service charges and other charges was removed from the elected members and passed to non-elected people in the <Col N="1659" /> form of management and staff of urban councils.</P>
    <P>By putting down this motion we are giving practical exposition to two very real areas.  First, we are offering proposals in respect of funding and, secondly, we are proposing the involvement of local authority members and the restoring to them of real power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion and I am pleased that the Minister is present in the Chamber to listen to our arguments.  I am sure he is well aware of the feelings of his own party and of local representatives in regard to the matter to which the motion relates.  I understand that these feelings were made very clear to him at the recent Labour Party conference.</P>
      <P>Ireland depends on a road system to a far greater extent than is the case of most of our European neighbours.  Because of our relatively small and widely dispersed population we are unable to maintain an economically viable rail network.  Therefore, we cannot be compared in that respect with our European neighbours.  We are very dependent on a proper road structure.  While funding is being provided for national and secondary roads, funding for main and county roads has been virtually cut off.  That is the main reason for our tabling this motion.</P>
      <P>When replying the Minister may state that the Government have provided money for national roads.  That is so but our point is that the life and soul of rural Ireland is dependent on our main and county roads and this is the area in which funding has been short.  Any county councillor or county engineer will confirm that the past three years have been a nightmare for them.  They are trying to maintain a road structure on a skeleton budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that 87,000 of the 92,000 kilometres of road in the country are main and county roads. National primary and national secondary roads amount to 5,200 kilometres.  Therefore, 94 per cent of our roads is comprised <Col N="1660" /> of main and county roads and these roads are used by 65 per cent of total traffic. Despite these figures there is not a corresponding allocation in finances from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>In 1982, for example, Carlow County Council spent £750,000 on main and county roads.  The block grant was £96,000.  The council had to try &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;try&rdquo;&mdash; to make up the balance, but they were unable to do so.  In 1983 the total expenditure on main and county roads in Carlow was £865,000 and the grant was £131,000.  There was no increase in the block grant for 1984 but there has been a £15,000 increase in 1985.  The increase between the years 1982 and 1985 has totalled £60,000; but considering that the inflation levels respectively for the years 1982 to 1984 were, 17.1 per cent, 10.4 per cent and 8.6 per cent and that the projected figure for 1985 is 5.6 per cent, it is obvious that the funding coming from the Department is not keeping pace with inflation.  Consequently, something must go by the board.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, there is an obvious urban rural divide in this matter.  While money is provided for national primary and secondary roads the small farmer and business man is being made to suffer. With our entry to the EC farmers regained some kind of prosperity.  With larger tractors, combine harvesters and cattle being transported to marts by lorry, farmers are using bigger and better machinery. However, for the past four years the condition of some of the county roads and smaller roads taken over by county councils have not kept pace with this development and consequently many farmers have had to go to great expense in order to maintain their roadways in some condition.  In one part of Carlow, on the Carlow-Kilkenny border, farmers had to come together and repair a two and a half mile stretch of road themselves.</P>
    <P>The repeated shortfall of funds for the maintenance of engineering services during the past three years has resulted in the inevitable deterioration of our regional and county road system.  Serious structural damage has been caused to <Col N="1661" /> many roads particularly in the weak subgrade areas.  There has been a notable increase in the potholing of road surfaces in many areas.  This is a recognised factor indicating the potential failure of the whole road structure.  One does not have to travel far outside of Dublin to come across the pothole syndrome.</P>
    <P>Engineering staff in county councils are seriously concerned that unless adequate financing is provided for next year whole sections of roads will have to be cordoned off.  Many county councils have had to change the cycle of bitumen dressing of road surfaces from the accepted ten years, which is the norm, to an 18 years cycle in the case of Carlow and to a 35 year cycle, as my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, stated.  The effect on our road surfaces of chemicals and sprays used by farmers will make the problem worse.  Repairs to frost damaged regional roads in many counties has ground to a halt.  Hedge cutting, trimming, footpath and drainage improvements works are a thing of the past in most counties.</P>
    <P>The steady growth of traffic on the one hand and the lack of sufficient funding by central Government has resulted in our having one of the poorest road network systems in the EC, if not the poorest. There was a time when Bord Fáilte took pleasure in advertising in English magazines and newspapers about the quiet Irish roads.  They encouraged tourists to come and see how quiet they were for themselves.  If there is not an improvement in the standard of our roads they may well be advertising the quiet Irish roads again with photographs.  However, with all the potholes they could well be for fishermen.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board concluded that foreign borrowing was an appropriate means of financing productive investment by the public sector. This type of expenditure has the double effect of improving the quality of our infrastructure and employing workers in projects which have a high labour content. Any such activity has the crucial merit of immediate and direct employment creation.</P>
    <P>Priority was given recently to the <Col N="1662" /> national primary and secondary roads due mainly to the fact that most of the funding for these roads was provided by the European Regional Fund.  The destruction and disintegration of our roadways is a matter of serious concern to all our elected representatives.  I am sure that in the run up to the local elections on 20 June those who put their names forward for election will hear more about this.  It is very unfair for those contesting elections to have to take the brunt of the public's distaste for the fact that this Government are not providing sufficient funding.  It is all very well to say that major projects are about to be undertaken in most counties, but how does one explain building a bypass for £2,500 million while two miles down the road there are five or six potholes?  It is difficult to explain that such money is provided by Europe when a road a half a mile away is allowed to deteriorate.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the question of funding for local authorities.</P>
    <P>We depend on our road system to a far greater extent than most of our European neighbours.  The road network accounts for 96 per cent of all passenger traffic and 88 per cent of freight traffic.  Consequently its development forms an important part of our overall inland transport policy.  I do not have to mention how expensive transport is in Ireland.  If we do not provide proper roads for businesses more and more of them, regrettably, will find their way towards the larger urban areas such as Dublin.  That would be a mistake.  If we do not decentralise, more and more people will graduate towards the bigger cities; and Exchequer funding will be provided for those cities which, in turn, will add to the problem of the urban-rural divide.</P>
    <P>Reports state that the cost of resurfacing country roads is between £20,000 and £40,000 a mile.  To give a county council £90,000 or £100,000 in a block grant knowing the amount of road surfaces in each county is an insult to their and the county engineers' intelligence.  As we have stated, the Minister must, as a matter of urgency, provide proper financing <Col N="1663" /> for our county roads.  If not, not only will our tourist industry be at stake but also our economy.  It is no joy for elected members in Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Wexford and other major tourist counties to put up with the ridicule of those who visit these areas on holiday.  Our national tourist board have repeatedly called on Ministers for the Environment to upgrade our road system to some kind of international standard.  While it is fine to say that the national primary and secondary roads are improving in international terms, the same cannot be said of county roads.  I ask the Minister to look seriously at what Fianna Fáil are proposing in this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have been given an opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  The effect of the Government's cutback on financial support for local authorities is more evident in the county roads system than in any other area.  The results are to be seen throughout rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Government inherited a county road system that was developed over the decades at the expense of ratepayers and taxpayers.  However, some roads are now almost impassable and that is a national scandal.  We all know that if the pathways leading to our houses are allowed to fall into a bad state of disrepair it costs ten times as much to repair them than if they had been repaired when they first showed signs of falling into disrepair.  County roads account for 80 per cent of the road network and I cannot for the life of me understand how any Minister could allow his officials to dictate to him that most of the funds should be ploughed into main roads, building bypasses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps some Department officials spend too much time in Brussels and feel that when their counterparts come over here they would like to see fancy roundabouts, bypasses and so on.  We owe the freedom we now enjoy to the people who live on boreens and we probably would not be here this evening but for the humble people of rural areas.  However, the Government seem to regard those <Col N="1664" /> people as second class citizens and do not worry about their safety or need to have a proper road to do their business.</P>
    <P>It is time to take a hard look at the whole system of financing local authorities, especially in connection with county roads, and common sense is all that is needed.  The Minister is from a rural constituency and he must be well aware of the state of county roads, particularly over the last two years.  They are a nightmare, even for careful drivers.  Even if you are not travelling fast, the suspension of a car can be damaged by going into a pothole.  Although there are millions of tonnes of concrete being poured into roads, very little employment is created. The Department of the Environment can trot out figures about money being ploughed into our roads but it is not going to county roads.  We are creating speed tracks for people in trucks who drive at 80 miles per hour in a 45 miles per hour zone.  Those driving stolen cars also drive very recklessly on long straight roads.  We must have more planning in the area of county roads or they will all be closed eventually and this point has been made by county engineers.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have no money to trim hedges and cut weeds.  This is only done on main roads where there is no need to do it as many of those roads are as wide as this Chamber.  Department officials should drive around the country in May when the weeds are six feet high which means that drivers of school buses carrying 60 children have great difficulty in negotiating bends.  They are responsible for the safety of these children.  If these hedges were cut it would provide employment as our dole queues are getting longer every day and our potholes are getting bigger.  There are highly qualified engineering and outdoor staff in local authorities but there is no money to provide employment for them.  It is like the health boards, red tape, officialdom and regulations but nothing happening. People in rural areas pay their rates and taxes and they are entitled to the same consideration as the people speeding from Cork to Dublin in high powered cars.  When we get money from Brussels <Col N="1665" /> we should spend it where it is most needed.  I know the Minister has plenty of common sense and I urge him to forget about the officials in his Department &mdash; he is the boss and he should get on with the job.  People in rural areas are living in misery and the shoneens in the Department do not care.  It is a shame and a scandal that local authority workers are unemployed because there is no money available.  I do not care whether the money comes form Brussels or from the taxpayer we must get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage in the financial year, to divert 50 per cent of the money allocated for main roads to county roads and give some hope to the people in rural areas.  I would not drive a school bus for all the tea in China as it must be a nightmare.  Who cares?  There have been many near misses and some day there will be a calamity. When that happens, of course the local councils will be blamed but it is the officials in the Department who are really to blame.  They do not care how many lives are lost as long as a nice impression is created for officials coming from Brussels to inspect the results of the few miserable millions they gave us over the last few years.  A good county road system is necessary especially to accommodate our basic industry, argriculture, which has been sold down the river by the Government. Modern day machinery necessary for agriculture is highly dangerous and good roads are needed to transport it.</P>
    <P>Signposts are covered in weeds and cannot be seen.  I saw a man painting a sign one day and he had to push briars out of the way to do so.  It is a pity that Frank Hall was not around to see it.  It is a sick joke and not good enough in this day and age.  Even at this late hour, I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of justice and fairness, to do something.  If we had the will, we could create employment in local authorities.  I do not believe in the system in operation in many local authorities whereby too much machinery is in operation and the man with a wife and family is forgotten.</P>

      <P>In May 1979 the Fianna Fáil Administration published the road development plan for the eighties. There was great publicity and it was described as the first major plan of its type since the foundation of the State. They claimed that it was unprecedented in time span and format and that it charted the course for bringing the road network up to the standard to meet then prevailing and projected trafic demands. However, it did contain the important qualification that its implementation depended on available financial resources. Despite this qualification the then Minister in his introduction to the plan wrote &ldquo;The programme promulgated in this Road Development Plan is one which I believe to be reasonably capable of achievement&rdquo; and later &ldquo;The programme has been kept to a realisable and realistic level&rdquo;.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister when he wrote those words, although one could be uncharitable and <Col N="1669" /> suggest that publication of the plan was not unconnected with the local and European elections in the following month of that year.</P>

      <P>Whatever happened in <Col N="1670" /> the few short months from the publication of the plan in May 1985 to the presentation of the Estimates in early 1980 I do not know.  The Fianna Fáil Government only provided £54 million of the promised £94 million, in other words, there was a shortfall in 43 per cent in real terms.  That is like somebody promising a child £1 and then only giving him less than 60p.  That is not forgotten very quickly.  The failure to provide the promised funds undermined the confidence of local authorities, contractors and suppliers in its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the point in planning projects to take up funds which Fianna Fáil knew in their hearts could not be provided?  To be fair to Fianna Fáil they did a bit better in 1981 and provided 75 per cent of the promised funding for that year.  We should, I suppose, be thankful for small blessings.  To put the figures another way, in the first two years of this heralded realistic and realisable plan, they provided only £2 out of every £3 promised.  One might even say that given Fianna Fáil's record on promises, that was not one of the worst cases of default.</P>
      <P>Despite the severe financial problems we inherited, this Government provided substantially increased funds for road improvements in 1983 and 1984.  Despite our improved record, I was conscious that it still was not good enough and for this reason I carried out a review of the road development plan.  My conclusions were that the needs identified in the 1979 plan but not met through underinvestment were still real and urgent and that a considerable additional financial commitment was required.  The review was considered by the Government and formed the basis for their decision, announced in <i>Building on Reality,</i> to provide the first ever firm multi-annual financial commitment for road improvements.</P>

Expenditure for the period 1980 to 1987 will be 9 per cent short of the original projections, compared with 34 per cent at the end of 1981, two years <Col N="1673" /> into the Fianna Fáil plan, and 21 per cent at the end of 1984 after two years of the present Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go on to refer specifically to county roads, I want to speak for a few moments about the new road plan policy Policy and Planning Framework for Roads.  Apart from giving a firm commitment to provide £½ billion for road development, the plan sets out a clear policy framework for the expenditure of those funds and, in addition, contains a programme of major improvement projects to be undertaken in the period 1985 to 1987.</P>
      <P>The main aims of our road development policy are five in number: Firstly, to provide an adequate inter-urban road network linking the major towns, ports and airports; next, to eliminate traffic bottlenecks by providing by-passes for towns on national routes; third, to reduce urban congestion by providing new bridges, ring roads and relief roads, fourth, the preservation through proper maintenance of existing and planned road investment, and, last but not least, the improvement of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme of major improvement work for the period 1985 to 1987 is <Col N="1674" /> detailed in the new road plan and contains 54 projects.  Important projects include the Mallow Street bridge in Limerick, the Opera House bridge and ring roads in Cork and the Waterford bridge.  Bypasses will be provided at various locations including Dunleer, Collooney, Newbridge, Roscrea, Newtown-mountkennedy, Wexford, Midleton, Dungarvan, Slieverue and Askeaton.</P>

      <P>There will be major route improvements between Cork and Mallow, Patrickswell and Reens in County Limerick, Ballycarthy and Tralee and Drumsna and Jamestown in Leitrim. The plan also includes a forward programme for the period from 1988 until about the mid-nineties which will provide a planning base.  This programme will be reviewed by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's motion calls for Government funding of a special programme for the maintenance and improvement of the county road system. The new road plan clearly sets out Government policy on the funding of road works, including county roads, and I can do no better than quote the relevant paragraph, numbered 3.8:</P>
      <P>State financing of road development will comprise two main elements:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;100 per cent grants to local authorities for approved maintenance and improvement works on national and <Col N="1675" /> major urban roads.  This takes account of the Minister for the Environment's co-ordination and direction of the development of the national route network.</P>
    <P>&mdash;grants to supplement the provision made from local authorities' own resources (including the rate support grants) for the discharge of their responsibilities in relation to the improvement, maintenance and management of other public roads. These grants will be:</P>
    <P>a general &ldquo;block&rdquo; grant for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures; and</P>
    <P>grants for special improvement works (for example, bridge works on non-national roads and major strengthening of roads).</P>

      <P>This Government are therfore pursuing the policy adopted by their predecessors, including Fianna Fáil administrations, over a long number of years.  However, our position on county roads is not a slavish pursuit of the policy of past Governments.  County road improvements may in part be funded from the block grants.  Taking account of concerns expressed by local authorities and Deputies on both sides of the House about the level of the block grant, I increased the allocation by 10 per cent this year, substantially ahead of the rate of inflation.  I also reviewed the system of allocation, with a view to a more equitable distribution of available funds among local authorities.  On 7 May, in a speech to the annual Spring Show conference for local authority engineers, I announced that I intended to pay 75 per cent grants towards the cost of approved improvements works on the more important county road bridges and asked local authorities initially to submit proposals outlining their priorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to explain to the House and the public the rational basis for the policy adopted by the Government in relation to county roads.  As was illustrated in the new road plan, Ireland <Col N="1678" /> has a very considerable length of roads per head of population.  We have 26 kilometres of road per 1,000 population, compared with 6 kilometres in the United Kingdom, 15 in France, eight in West Germany and 14 in Denmark.  The nearest European country is Norway, with 20 kilometres per 1,000 population. Our high road mileage arises because of the dispersed and rural nature of our population.  Heretofore we lived on the land rather than in towns or villages. However, the urban-rural proportion of our population is changing.  For example, the 1936 census indicated that 37 per cent of our population was in urban areas.  In 1951 it was still only 41 per cent.  By 1966 it had reached 49 per cent and in 1981 it was 56 per cent.  That trend is likely to continue.  This change means that county roads will carry less and less traffic while the inter-urban roads will carry an ever-increasing proportion.  At present, national roads, which account for 5.6 per cent of all roads, carry 35 per cent of all traffic.  County roads account for four-fifths of total road mileage, yet only carry just over a quarter of all traffic.  We also have a very high proportion of black-topped, or tarmacadamed, roads by international standards.  About 97 per cent of our roads are paved.  This compares with 97 per cent in Britain which has one-quarter our mileage of road per head of population, 85 per cent for local roads in France&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All done when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;62 per cent for Norway which has a mileage <i>per capita</i> approaching our own, 67 per cent for Sweden, one of the world's richest economies, and 86 per cent for The Netherlands. In view of the very substantial under-investment in our major roads in the sixties and seventies, one could ask whether the resources devoted to the provision of dust-free surfaces on county roads in that period were spent to the best possible effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the myth that spending on the maintenance of county roads is <Col N="1679" /> low.  This is true in absolute terms but not when one makes comparisons on the basis of road usage.  In 1983 maintenance expenditure per mile of county road was estimated at £880 compared with £6,070 for national primaries and £1,059 for all roads.  However, when one looks at expenditure per 1,000 vehicles miles of travel, that is the measure of road usage, one finds the exact opposite.  Spending on county roads is £12.16, almost four times that on national primaries, £3.36, or one and a half times the average for all roads, £7.36 per 1,000 vehicle miles of travel.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I feel bound to follow the policy pursued by successive Governments, including Fianna Fáil, which is that funds for county roads maintenance must be provided from local authorities' own resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite have to take a lot of the blame for that, if that is the case.  Of course, I will be the first to acknowledge that this policy is not without its problems.  The new road plan said as much when it frankly pointed out that local authority expenditure from own resources, including rate support grants, on road improvement and maintenance decreased in real terms by 11.5 per cent between 1975 and 1983.  This Government have already acted to assist local authorities financially.  In 1983 we ended the limitation on rate increases and provided an additional £30 million over and above the original provision for the rate support grants.  The national plan announced the introduction of a farm tax that will accrue to local authorities from 1986.  The Government are also committed to the pursuit of a more balanced system of local financing and in this I will be carefully considering the reports of the National Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that there is only a limited amount of money for roads.  Increased funds for county roads can be found only by increasing taxes, which I doubt Deputy Molloy or his colleagues are advocating, or by diverting funds from the major national and urban road projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of political expediency he seems now to favour the county roads against the national network, with all the adverse consequences for the country's economic and industrial development.  Despite their supposed commitment to the west, successive Fianna Fáil Ministers let proposals for the by-pass at Chapelizod lie dormant for years despite its location on the vital artery to the west.  The compulsory purchase order for that scheme was made in 1975 and one might wonder what happened to it between 1977 and 1981 when Fianna Fáil were in office.  It took this Government to bring that project to construction. A number of other projects in the pipeline will benefit the west, including a by-pass at Lucan, the provision of a new route from Lucan to Kilcock bypassing Leixlip, Maynooth and Kilcock and the construction of a new gateway to the west and a new road and bridge over the Shannon at Athlone.</P>

      <P>I hope the delegates who attended the Labour Party conference in Cork have listened to the Minister and his praise of the programme <i>Building on Reality</i> in view of the way many of his supporters spoke about that so-called plan.  The number of people anxious to speak on this important motion is an indication of the frustration and anger felt throughout the country at the appalling state of main roads, and particularly county roads, and the apparent paralysis of the Government in failing to come to grips with the problem or even to appreciate that it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Mayo approximately only 88 per cent of our roads are tarred even though our county is one of the largest in the country.  One can readily understand that people have doubts regarding the relevance of the whole political system and they query if it is of any use to them in their daily lives.  They try to carry on their normal business on roads that are somewhat akin to the wandering minstrel <Col N="1683" /> in Gilbert and Sullivan's &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo;, &ldquo;a thing of shreds and patches&rdquo;&mdash; in this case more patches and shreds than actual tar.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister has put down the amendment.  While he represents an urban area there are many county roads also in his constituency.  The amendment totally avoids dealing with the motion tabled by Deputy Molloy on behalf of Fianna Fáil and which represents the views of quite a number of people on the opposite side who say privately that our county roads are disintegrating. This amendment is an example of the ostrich-like attitude of the Government, their lack of reality and utter insensitivity to the needs of ordinary people. The Minister's remarks only reinforce my view that this Government are Dublin-orientated and are nothing more than as has been described in a number of papers a Donnybrook set.  Deputy O'Rourke said quite categorically that there had never been special central Government funding for the maintenance of county roads.

      <P>Throughout the country the cry of despair is ringing out: &ldquo;Mike Murphy, where are you in our hour of need?  Why have you deserted us at a time when we are overrun by potholes?&rdquo;. Potholes have now come into their own, thanks to this Government.  They have triumphed over the power of the airways and have even beaten that great explorer of the pothole world.  The new specimen is a far cry from his cousin of old &mdash; tougher, wider, deeper and sharper, worthy of being included in Mr. Murphy's catalogue.  Indeed, there should be room found for him in the new record just completed.  From north to south, east to west, this new breed of pothole has flourished amid the stagnation and neglect of this Coalition Government. The silence of a long time champion of <Col N="1684" /> the pothole, Deputy L'Estrange, must disappoint the present collection, prime examples of all that makes a pothole great.  Many of us remember the same Deputy L'Estrange shaking the Fianna Fáil 1977 manifesto asking what measures were contained therein for the then potholes.  I could ask the same question with regard to the document <i>Building on Reality</i> in which there is not a mention of potholes or of county road maintenance. Garage owners throughout the country are offering a silent prayer of thanks to this Government who, unknown to themselves, are helping the motor industry at present exceptionally hard pressed.</P>
      <P>There is a strong rumour that the Irish county road is about to be used as a testing ground by car manufacturers worldwide because of their toughness and present state.  If that is so perhaps the Government might request the IDA to negotiate first of all so that if somebody does come in they will be allowed and not as happened very recently.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has returned from his overseas travels.  I can tell him that his journey was much smoother than those of people in rural areas who daily must encounter the hard realities of this Government's policies, not the myth of the fairytale <i>Building on Reality</i> about which the Minister spoke.  The reality of this Government's policy is that many people are being condemned to negotiate roads which have now reverted to their pre-tarred state.  That is because of the neglect and failure of this Government to allocate sufficient finances to local authorities for their provision and maintenance at a reasonable level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the block grant.  I might remind him that in 1983 the block grant for Mayo County Council amounted to £916 out of which allocation that local authority had to tar and maintain certain roads.  There were also allocated £200,000 for regional roads.  In 1984 the block grant was £916 also, despite inflation, and the allocation for regional roads was reduced to £50,000 with an extra amount being provided for bridges of £70,000.  During that time Mayo County Council had to fund out of rates <Col N="1685" /> a considerable amount of the finance necessary for their seven year plan.  Originally it was to be a five year plan, it is now a seven year one, but the reality is that it will be a ten year plan, the result being that many people now unable to travel on roads will never see tar on the roads in front of their residences.  Indeed, they may never see even a decent gravel road.  They know that this Government are not at all sensitive to the needs of people all along the western seaboard where the bulk of this problem obtains. They know that until after the next general election there is no hope.  However, thereafter they do know that a Fianna Fáil Government will again hold out some hope, satisfaction, a chance to travel on reasonable roads free of the plague of potholes at present afflicting the whole of our county roads system.</P>
    <P>The harsh reality is that the shortfall in recent years has led to a build-up of neglect of county roads, resulting in the present calamitous state of many of them. One talks to members of all parties but one discovers that the story is the same all over, particularly from those who represent the greater rural areas.  At recent meetings all over my constituency the main complaint was about the totally disastrous state of our county roads at present.  Things are now so bad in parts of County Mayo that people have had serious accidents.  For example, one lady broke both legs in potholes on county roads.  The Minister holds out no hope to people like that.  People are becoming increasingly militant about this problem. The Minister should now implement an emergency programme to alleviate the problem.  It is not confined to rural areas only.  From talking to some of my Dublin colleagues I believe the same conditions obtain also close to this city and to the other larger towns.  Some moneys from other road programmes surely could be diverted in order to help.  I advance that as a serious alternative.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to approve our motion, to reject the Government amendment, which does not meet the case at all but <Col N="1686" /> rather sidesteps it, portraying the ostrich-like view of the Government in relation to the condition of our county roads.</P>

      <P>I am not in any way satisfied with the Government amendment. We do not know how long our local authorities must await the necessary finance to maintain and repair our county roads.  This amendment is another whitewash job before the local elections, to give the people the impression that the Government are serious about doing something to assist local authorities in bringing county roads to a reasonable standard so that local people in rural areas can travel in comfort to conduct their business in the nearby towns and villages.</P>
      <P>When the Minister visited County Meath not long ago he met a deputation from Meath County Council.  I regret that the outcome was zero.  He had every sympathy with the case put forward by Meath County Council.  Sympathy was all we got.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that the roads in County Meath are in a scandalous condition.  In many cases the road foundations are crumbling away and a lot more taxpayer's money will be needed unless the Government decide quickly to put a plan into action.  Many of the Meath county roads are among the worst in the country and we have made a special case to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago the large estates in Meath were divided and roads were provided through the farms for the transport then available.  These roads have not suitable foundations to cope with milk lorries, oil lorries and heavy farm machinery.  The Minister should consider this matter seriously.  The roads are simply disappearing and this is affecting <Col N="1687" /> trade and commerce.  Milk must be brought quickly to creameries and many other products must also be moved rapidly along the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of extra traffic travels along our county roads to and from Dublin and the port of Drogheda.  In Meath 78 per cent of our roads are county roads and 22 per cent are national, national secondary and regional roads.  I welcome the 38 per cent increase in the road block grant which we in Meath received but that 38 per cent increase went entirely into the 22 per cent area and nothing went into the 78 per cent area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Meath County Council have repeatedly called on the Minister for extra finance for our county roads but we are still in the same position.  The county managers have been given authority by the Minister to collect tax from the people but this money should be provided in the budget at national level. Refuse charges are being imposed but they are really road charges.  In County Meath less than 10 per cent of the refuse charges were collected so there is no money to repair the roads.  The Minister knows that the Meath county manager has not the money to repair the roads.  I appeal to him to ask the Government to change their policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county engineers and their staff are to be complimented on the way they are handling the limited resources available to them.  We have a ten-year road plan in County Meath but on the basis of the finance currently being made available it will take 30 years to implement that plan.  The Minister should take note of these facts.  I get the impression that many of the documents submitted by deputations are filed away and never heard of again.  The Minister says there <Col N="1688" /> is a national plan.  Are we going to stick by the national plan?  The large majority of our peoplle use the county roads and they are entitled to more than just sympathy from the Government.  Our engineers know what is needed and they present their plans to the Government, yet there is no change in Government policy. There is no money.</P>
    <P>People who want to work are joining the queues of the unemployed.  There is work available if the Minister would only change the policy of road financing.  In County Meath the amount provided in 1985 for the maintenance of county roads is £783,108, a 2.75 per cent increase on the figure for 1984.  That is a smaller amount in real terms.  There is also provision for £1.622 million in 1985, the same amount as in 1984 but it will do less work. The county manager will be letting road workers go in Meath because the money is not there.  It is ridiculous that people are drawing money on the dole who want to work.</P>
    <P>There will be 21 per cent less surface dressing on our county roads in 1985 as compared with 1984 and 10 per cent less surface dressing on our main roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the roads which are already in bad condition will get worse.  I do not know whether the Minister is taking all these factors into account.  We asked him to upgrade some of our roads so that we might have a little extra finance but I assume the answer will be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We asked for the upgrading of the R156, the road from Dunboyne to Summerhill and Ballivor. We asked for the upgrading of the R161 and the R159, the Navan-Trim-Enfield road.  We asked for the upgrading of the R157, the Dunboyne-Maynooth road.  I assume that the answer will be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to set up a special fund immediately by <Col N="1689" /> transferring funds to the county roads from the national, national secondary and regional road fund.  He should take a little from the regional roads and give it to the county road areas.  Even if this were done in 1986 there would be a big improvement.  It is obvious that the Coalition Government have put down this amendment to delay matters and to give the impression to the public at large that they will do something soon to improve the situation.  I am sure the people will give their answer to the Minister and his Government on 20 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for providing me with an opportunity for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I would have been more grateful had I got the Chair's permission earlier when I raised it and before this became a matter of public comment in the Press.  My main reason for raising the matter last week, hoping to be given permission to raise it on the Adjournment, is that for some considerable time I have been getting strong representations &mdash; one could say it amounted to pressure &mdash; as a result of what was happening.  The House will be familiar with the background to this story and will remember that Loughan House was chosen as a place of detention for young people originally.  The House will recall that it attracted an amount of ignorant criticism at that time.  I had occasion then to point out that that house was a fine building and that its location was one of great beauty, beside Lough Macnean on the Cavan-Fermanagh border.  It is an amenity area and a famous place.  In fact when John Behan the sculptor was asked to execute a piece of sculpture to commemorate Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Gunna he fell in love with the area and purchased a small house there.  Obviously, he was taken, as many people are, by the beauty of an area which contains Lough Macnean, <Col N="1690" /> the Glangevlin Gap, the Shannon Pot and so on.</P>
      <P>The whole prison experience was in an area of great beauty which up to then was practically crime free.  The local people, when Loughan House was first used as a place of detention, set about making it as successful and humane as possible. People whom I know, including a priest who is now in Africa, did their level best to welcome the young people.  They organised sports and football matches between groups from outside and those in Loughan House.  Generally, they tried by developing a community spirit to help and educate them and make them useful members of society afterwards.</P>
      <P>The people feel a bit aggrieved that, despite this effort at togetherness which was the order of the day when the young offenders were in Loughan House, the area is being subjected to very severe pressure from escapees from Loughan House.  In all instances I shall mention I do not suppose a definite connection between escapees and the crimes committed can be established in a strictly legal sense but in some instances the connection has been very obviously established.</P>
      <P>The presbytery and the church have been broken into.  The safe in the church was burst open.  There was no money in the safe and the sacred vessels were not touched.  The person who entered the church on that occasion did so via a small window and left by the main door.  That door was left open.  For the most part Blacklion, the nearest village to Loughan House, comes safe.  The presbytery is not in the village and, I suppose, those involved understand that there is a large force of gardaí stationed there, a Border area.  Those people head in a different direction, further south west towards the villages of Glangevlin and Dowra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inmates of Loughan House, and their visitors, are the subject of great concern to the people.  I have been asked to stress that particular vigilence must be exercised as far as the visitors to Loughan House are concerned.  On the night the church was broken into a car was stolen. The vehicle was later found 120 miles <Col N="1691" /> away from Blacklion in the Phoenix Park. Glangevlin dispensary was broken into. On 25 March the presbytery was ransacked and some old coins and a torch taken.  The coins were not of any value and some of them were afterwards found in Loughan House.  The presbytery was broken into on 21 April and a radio stolen and a cheque book was missing.  The radio was later found in Loughan House. On 24 April a window was broken in the church.  No entry was made and no further damage was done.  However, at that time escapees were at large.</P>
    <P>A car was stolen at Swanlinbar which is some distance away.  It is difficult to prove these things in a court of law but I am talking about an area which was practically &mdash; I could even leave out the adverb &mdash; free from crime hitherto.  A car stolen in Glangevlin was found damaged near the Phoenix Park.  Two bicycles were stolen and one was later found near Swanlinbar.  The postman's car was stolen.  In Doobally a car was pushed from the owner's premises but was abandoned by the thieves when it was discovered there was no engine in it.  The idea was to push the vehicle way from the house so that they would not be heard starting it up.  Those involved made a mistake in that instance.</P>
    <P>Children have been met by some of the escapees and responsible people in the area are worried about these people being able to converse with children.  I must stress that there is a heavy force of gardaí and soldiers in Blacklion.  In Dowra, a village on the Leitrim border, a car was stolen and was found in Galway with Loughan House people in it.  Again, they seemed to fancy cheque books because together with the car they stole a cheque book from a house.  Apparently, they broke into the house, got the key of the car and stole the cheque book.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that the people in the area are frightened for their property. Old people are frightened for their safety.  This fear is enhanced by the stories about attacks on old people in the west.  Old people in that area must climb the Cuilcagh Mountains to count sheep <Col N="1692" /> and they have seen escapees on the mountain.  One of the most ridiculous complaints I got &mdash; were it not for the fact that escapees were seen in the area nobody would suspect the link &mdash; was that an old shelter used by sheep when lambing was vandalised and destroyed. That was a completely mindless and senseless operation.</P>
    <P>I believe I have said enough to give the House an idea of what is exercising the minds of the people in that area and what inspired me to ask the Chair to allow me to raise the matter on the Adjournment. I should like to know how many of those escapes were reported to the Minister. What knowledge has the Minister of the escapes?  I am sure it will be particularly difficult to trace escapes which enable people to steal objects and bring them back into the prison.  It seems to me that until the stolen object was found that was the kind of escape that was hardly recorded.  The prison was being made a kind of <i>pied-à-terre</i> for the rogues.  Is the Minister fully informed about these matters and will he list in his reply all the escapes that have been notified to him?</P>
    <P>The substantive question is what plans has the Minister to deal with security in Loughan House?  Is the Minister satisfied with the action he has taken?  I saw a report in the paper since I tried to raise the matter in the House, that the Minister had sent for officers from Loughan House.  I would like to get the story and I would like the Minister to say what steps have been taken to stop this depredation in a peaceful, quiet and beautiful part of the country.  The Minister has an obligation to see to it that there is absolute security in the area, that people are not afraid, whether they are young or old, to go about their business, to sleep peacefully and securely at night, to be confident if they have a motor car that they will be able to continue to use it and that when they go to use it they will not have to fetch it in the Phoenix Park.  Until comparatively recently in this part of the country motor cars were seldom locked. Recently I heard the first complaints about two bicycles being stolen from a bicycle shed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I want an assurance from the Minister on behalf of the people in the area that he is fully aware of what is happening and that he has had consultations with the people who understand security in prisons and that he is seeing to it that security will be maintained and that there is proper liaison between the Loughan House authorities and the Garda so that the Garda will be apprised of the fact that people have escaped as soon as it has happened and that responsible members of the community may also be alerted as to what is happening.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter in the House and I look forward to the Minister's answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Wilson for putting down this question.  It gives me an opportunity to explain to the House some of the issues which can arise in relation to our open places of custody. The House is aware that we have high security prisons such as Portlaoise and Limerick mainly used to house subversive-type prisoners.  We have other prisons like Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution, which has been designated a prison, which are very secure.  We also have prisons such as Shelton Abbey which is an open shelter, where the gate is open and people have to obey a certain regime and they are not kept in by walls, gates or bolts.  The same is true of Shanganagh Castle, near Bray.  The Deputy knows that Loughan House was an institution for people under 16 until recently. When we took it over as a prison it could be categorised as a semi-open prison system.  It has not the open gate system of Shanganagh or Shelton Abbey but it is not as secure as Mountjoy or St. Patrick's and it has not the kind of security one would find in Portlaoise or Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Open institutions, as a penological concept, were first introduced into the Irish penal system in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  The introduction of open institutions was one of a number of measures introduced or developed during that period.  At the same time measures such as probation and &ldquo;conditional release&rdquo;<Col N="1694" /> were encouraged as alternatives to custodial sentences and, within the prisons, work-training, education, personal development programmes were also encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that in 1967 &mdash; the year before our first open centre was acquired &mdash; there were only three prisons and one detention centre operating in the country.  The daily average prison population then was 600, less than one-third of the number in custody today and there was no pressure on prison accommodation although the numbers being committed to custody began to rise towards the end of that decade.  Furthermore, the type of offender being sent to prison was different.  By and large persons in custody conformed and served their sentences without much disruption or the threat of it.  Also the regimes in the prisons reflected the social norms which obtained in the community generally: there was greater discipline, conditions were more spartan and administration stricter all round.  In those circumstances one can readily understand why prisoners in those days welcomed a transfer to one of the new open institutions which had more liberal regimes.  When they were sent to one of those institutions they stayed there and, generally speaking, they behaved themselves in the knowledge that if they absconded they would be found and sent back to one of the more secure institutions where the measures were more spartan.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the origin and background of the open institutions mainly to illustrate the change that has taken place over the years and the different nature of the issues which confront the open centres at the present time.  Today, to be specific, there are 1,914 prisoners in custody and they are contained in eleven different institutions.  A high proportion of our prisoners have been convicted of serious offences and, to put it in prison terms, the number of prisoners who could be described as &ldquo;trustys&rdquo; is getting smaller.  All of this means that, as time goes on, it is proving more difficult to find the type of prisoner who traditionally was considered suitable for open centres. <Col N="1695" /> But the important fact remains that prisoners, whatever their crimes, must sooner or later be released.  The question which must be answered is whether it is better to release a prisoner on the last day of his sentence or to ease him back into the community before that, in a controlled situation.  I think the latter option is preferable.  If I am right in that, and I believe I am, then the open centres must continue to play their role in providing pre-release facilities for prisoners, even if the prisoners of today are more difficult than prisoners in the past.</P>
    <P>Loughan House is, of course, an open centre.  From a security point of view it has certain advantages over some of the other open centres.  It has a double wire fence around it which, although it is not intended that it should provide total security, does provide for a level of control. The location of Loughan House is itself a factor which influences the security of the place.  Also, and this is an important point, the staff-offender ratio at Loughan House is one of the highest in the prison system.  This is because of the high staff ratios that were there when it served a different purpose and there was an unwillingness to disturb the life patterns of those who had build their lives there.  Now, there is an argument that has been put forward that too high a staff-offender ratio can itself cause problems &mdash; not least of which is lack of interest on the part of staff which, in turn, can adversely affect security.  This is a matter which I will examine shortly in relation to Loughan House and, indeed, in the context of the need to deploy staff more effectively elsewhere in the prison system.</P>
    <P>Recently officials of my Department have had discussions with the governor of Loughan House and reviewed the security arrangements at the house.  Following those discussions the governor was authorised to take certain steps which he considered would strengthen security at the centre.  This involves, <i>inter alia,</i> improving the perimeter fence and changes in the deployment of staff.</P>
    <P>Where there is an institution of this <Col N="1696" /> kind in an area, there is a temptation to attribute all unsolved crimes committed in the area to the inmates detained in the institution.  I know that the area where Loughan House is situated has a relatively low crime level.  Apart from a very small number of incidents, I am not aware that the inmates in Loughan House have, since the house opened as an open centre in 1972, contributed to any great extent to crime in the area.  However, I have information that at least two of the incidents to which the Deputy referred are attributable to inmates of Loughan House.  There are others where it is an open question as to whether they are so attributable.</P>
    <P>Any problem that arises will be dealt with and I will take whatever steps are necessary to cope with the situation.  The Deputy asked &mdash; I know in the interest of the local community and to allay any fears &mdash; what steps are being taken to make the place more secure.  A number of steps have been taken.  I would like to pay tribute to the local community who accepted the situation over the years. The parish priest and members of the community have been very supportive.</P>
    <P>From examination of the situation, it seems that escapes invariably occur between 10 p.m. and midnight and offenders have always scaled a fence in the secluded area which is surrounded by trees.  Preliminary steps were taken by the governor.  An additional officer is being allocated to duty between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. and he will be patrolling the suspected area.  An additional officer will be on duty in the same area from 11 p.m. right through the night with effect from next week.  Additional coils of bladed wire have been added to the top to the suspected area perimeter fence and this area of the fence is currently being raised by four feet and this will be completed within a week.  I say that in the context of an institution where one can do a certain amount of perimeter fencing but it will never be a Portlaoise, a Mountjoy or a St. Patrick's.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the staff levels. There are 80 staff at the centre, which is far higher in terms of ratio than operates <Col N="1697" /> at Shelton Abbey in Wicklow.  As I have said, I am going to have a look at that. Certainly the rostering system needs to be changed and I propose to get that changed in consultation with the governor. Day posts can be converted into night posts where a greater presence is needed.  I know that at a meeting of the Blacklion Community Association concern was expressed about a number of items and I am having those examined to see what improvements we can make in the situation.</P>
    <P>Abscondence from prison has always been a problem to some extent.  Going as far back as 1976, 85 offenders are unlawfully at large up to 31 March 1985 but they go back to 1976, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1982 and so on.  Seventy-two of those breached temporary release conditions, seven absconded from hospital while receiving inpatient treatment, three escaped from court and two absconded from Coolmine drug treatment clinic.  There has been a rise in the abscondences from Loughan House, especially in April, and after that we took the steps that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  We have the difficulty that the courts now are giving longer sentences.  The people we have in prison are serving longer sentences and the kind of stable population of all our our institutions are people who must be held on to for a very long time. Therefore, the number of trustee prisoners who are available for places like Shelton Abbey, Shanganagh, Loughan House or Spike Island in its present state of security is limited and all the time we must evaluate the suitability of candidates from a decreasingly eligible group for institutions such as this.  The Deputy knows that that was one reason why I was forced into getting extra secure prison accommodation recently rather than extra open accommodation, and that was why I had to take over the classroom space in Arbour Hill and in Cork.  Those classrooms were built to hold prisoners and they are also inside the walls.  They were of great benefit because they provided extra secure places, whereas the large open house in the middle of 100 <Col N="1698" /> acres is another open centre, and the number of candidates that one can safely put into those open centres is declining. As Spike Island is being made more secure daily, as the bars and meshes are put on the windows, as the concrete walls go in and so on, we will have more secure open spaces.  I hope that when we get over the patch we are going through at present the pressure on places like Loughan House will decrease.</P>
    <P>In the last three weeks alone we are accommodating 123 extra prisoners in the prison system and the pressure can be seen if you get that huge increase in a very short time.  It is difficult, but with the acquisition of Spike Island and the education units I hope that the situation will plateau out.  I think I still have some options for extra prison accommodation and when these come into effect the pressure on places like Loughan House will decrease.  In the meantime I will do everything in my power to increase the meanning levels at night and to raise that fence that I have been talking about.  I hope that I can allay the fears that are arising in the community, that we can make a secure institution and that the very good relationship which the Deputy has described between the residents of Blacklion and surrounding areas, those who work in the institution and those committed to it, will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that there is a very high staff ratio, that visitors are locked at each stage of entry to Loughan House and that all this obtained up to now, will the Minister give the House an assurance that this is sufficient to keep people in and keep people from re-entering once they go out?  That is the nub of the problem as far as local people are concerned, who were shocked when stuff stolen outside was found inside the prison.  Will the Minister say that the Garda, another branch for whom the Department are responsible, will be informed about visiting days and about <Col N="1699" /> escapes immediately they occur etc. so that there is a proper liaison?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I did not have that but I accept it if the Deputy says so.  The Garda will be informed. They are very aware of this.  I note what the Deputy is getting at about the visitors, but another side to the question is the location of Loughan House.  The fact that it is so far away from Dublin, from where many of the prisoners come, now means that they get very infrequent visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1700" /> Because they get very infrequent visits this adds to the tendency to abscond. That is one of the problems we have.  On the other side of the visiting, yes, I can give the assurance that the Garda will be informed about visiting days and so on, but I have had no indication at all that those who visit prisoners in Loughan House have led in any way to any increase in crime in the area.  Obviously, it is very suitable for serving counties such as County Cavan and adjacent counties, but the crime rates there are pretty low.  It is not all that suitable for prisoners coming from Dublin because if they do not get visits people tend to become depressed and move out.  However, regarding the other commitments that the Deputy has sought I can certainly give them.</P>

      <P>A new house grant cannot be paid until an inspection establishes that the house is complete and occupied and complies with all the other conditions of the grant scheme.  When the final inspection was carried out the house was not occupied.  However, arrangements have been made to have a further inspection carried out within the next two weeks.</P>

While I have no direct function in the matter, I will take any action I can to help groups in this regard.  I should point out that groups who cannot obtain public liability insurance can contact my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who will take up the matter with the Federation of Insurers of Ireland.</P>

Having examined the proposal my Department's inspector considered that the interests of the town and the prospective tenants would be better served by proceeding with a housing development on another site recently acquired by the urban district council.  This matter is being pursued with the local authority.</P>

Expenditure on the improvement of county roads falls to be financed by local authorities from their own resources (including the rate support grants) and is supplemented by a block grant paid annually by my Department.  The overall block grant allocation this year has been increased by 10 per cent.  The selection of improvement works to be carried out with these funds is entirely at the discretion of each <Col N="1501" /> local authority.  I am not in a position to provide any additional funds in the current year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established practice under successive Governments, it is not proposed to make State grants available for county road maintenance.  Expenditure under this heading will continue to be financed by local authorities from their own resources (including the rate support grants).</P>

      <P>In the new road plan, the following major road improvement projects are scheduled to commence in 1985: N4 Chapelizod By-Pass (Dublin); N4 Lucan By-Pass (Dublin); N6 Oranmore By-Pass (Galway); N11 Newtownmountkennedy By-Pass (Wicklow); N11 Brownswood/Edermine (Wexford); N13 Port Road/Manorcunningham (Donegal); Southern Ring Road (Cork); Blackrock By-Pass (Dublin); Inner Relief Road (Kilkenny).</P>

      <P>No projects to be funded by private capital will commence in 1985. As has been announced previously, a proposal for private sector investment in the Navan road/Lucan road section of the Dublin Ring road was found to be generally acceptable by the Government, without prejudice to the statutory procedures involved.  However, before this project can proceed it will be necessary for Dublin County Council to make and submit for my approval a motorway order, toll scheme and toll agreement. I cannot anticipate the outcome of this procedure.</P>
      <P>In February last, I circulated details of five potential toll roads to private interests and the response has been encouraging. None of the projects listed in that document is, however, scheduled to commence construction in 1985.</P>

Following receipt of a completed return of income from the taxpayer the inspector has dealt with the claim and a refund of tax, which has been calculated by reference to his entitlement to allowances and reliefs, will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.  The inspector will communicate directly with the taxpayer with a view to establishing whether additional relief in respect of interest paid may be due.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the reason for the increased tax deduction in the taxpayer's April salary was due to the withdrawal of interest relief for the current year, 1985-86, pending clarification of her entitlement to that relief.  The inspector of taxes will now communicate directly with the taxpayer in the matter and will also request certain information which is necessary for the purpose of determining her correct tax liabilities for the years 1983-84 and 1984-85.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes, the taxpayer's total income for the current year is not likely to exceed the appropriate age exemption threshold of £7,000. Accordingly, he is not liable to income tax for 1985-86.  An amended certificate granting tax exemption for that year will be issued to him as soon as possible. When this certificate is put into operation by the former employer, the tax which has been deducted from his retirement pension since 6 April last will be refunded to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>The person has informed the Department that she will be going to Australia for approximately five months and asked if she could collect her old age contributory pension for that period at her local post office when she returns home.  Since pension orders are valid for a maximum of three months after the due date she has been informed that she can only cash orders at the local post office bearing a payment date not earlier than three months prior to the date on which she presents them for payment.  A cheque to the value of any out-of-date orders will be issued to her if she returns her pension book to the Department.

      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of a widow's non-contributory pension at the maximum weekly rate of £40.50.  She has also qualified for a widow's benefit payment from the Department of Health and Social <Col N="1543" /> Security in Great Britain and is currently in receipt of £1.76 sterling per week.</P>
      <P>Her position with regard to a widow's contributory pension has also been examined. However, one of the conditions for award of such pension under Irish legislation is that there must be a yearly average of at least 24 contributions paid or credited on the late husband's or the widow's own insurance record.  This condition was not satisfied on either record in this case.</P>
      <P>Her late husband was also insurably employed in the United Kingdom and her possible entitlement to a widow's contributory pension from here under the provisions of EC Regulations was investigated. On the basis of his combined Irish and British insurance she would qualify for an Irish <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension at the weekly rate of £35.04 from 7 September 1983, increased to £37.50 from 6 July 1984.</P>
      <P>The effective commencement date of the non-contributory pension in payment at present was 6 March 1984.  It was not payable before that in view of the payment to her of the special rate of United Kingdom widow's allowance for the first 26 weeks of widowhood up to 5 March 1984.  Arrangements are now being made to award her the contributory <i>pro rata</i> pension also in respect of that period and the arrears will be issued to her shortly.</P>
      <P>In relation to the period from 6 March 1984, she has been given the option of accepting either the non-contributory pension or the <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension. The advantage of the latter is that it is not subject to a means test.  If, therefore, she were to take up employment or otherwise come into possession of additional means, it could be in her interest to change to the <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension.  Her optional entitlement to this pension will continue, however, so that she could retain the non-contributory pension at present and exercise the option for the contributory <i>pro rata</i> pension at any time in the future depending on her then circumstances.  This has been explained to her by letter.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the legislation governing the <Col N="1556" /> unemployment assistance scheme the value of the benefit derived by an applicant from board and lodgings in the home of a parent must be taken into account in the assessment of means.</P>
      <P>The son of the person concerned was assessed with means of £15.50 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parent's home.  He is accordingly in receipt of unemployment assistance at £17.30 weekly being the maximum rate £32.80 less £15.50 means. The daughter of the parent was previously assessed with means at £18.95 weekly but following a recent review of her case her means were also assessed at £15.50 weekly derived from the same source and she is also entitled to unemployment assistance at £17.30 weekly.  In her case, arrangements have been made to pay adjusting arrears this week and further payments at £17.30 will be made as these become due.</P>
      <P>Each assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and Regulations. The method of assessment of means is designed to ensure that the amount of means assessed is related to the circumstances of each applicant and the standard of living which he enjoys.  In the case of an applicant for unemployment assistance who lives away from his family home the determination as to whether a supplement in respect of rent under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme should be paid would be for the health board having regard to all the circumstances including the availability or otherwise of alternative accommodation in the particular case.</P>

      <P>The husband of the person concerned is in receipt of a qualifying payment in this case.  For him to qualify for the allowance, his wife would have to be permanently incapacitated as required by the scheme.  From the medical evidence furnished this is not the case.  His application was therefore rejected and he was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 30 April 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned owes £706.52 arrears of wet-time contributions. An instalment order for payment of the amount due at the rate of £10 per week was made in the District Court on 13 February 1985.  A variation of this order was sought and this application was <Col N="1560" /> due for hearing on 24 May 1985 but was adjourned on the application of the person's solicitor.  It would not be proper to interfere with the arrangements made by the court in this case.  Any proposals which the person wishes to make regarding instalment arrangements will be for consideration at the adjourned hearing.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy has in mind the leaflet &ldquo;Pensioners and Savings&rdquo; which was issued jointly by the Department and An Post. This leaflet shows, in the case of persons who have no other means, the amount of capital which may be held to qualify for full and minimum non-contributory pensions. If there are means in addition to capital, these must also be assessed in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.</P>

      <P>The grant to which the Deputy refers is payable by my Department to the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society Ltd. Payment is made by instalments, and funding is from the proceeds of the EC coresponsibility levy.  Before my Department can pay the final instalment they are obliged by Community law to carry out a detailed examination of the specific project concerned.  In the present case this examination is now under way and it may be expected that if the results are satisfactory the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society will receive the moneys necessary to pay the applicant in question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if, in view of the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 24 who is married with four children and is unemployed cannot afford to pay a fine of £28 which was reduced to that amount as a result of a petition, he will now withdraw the demand entirely; and if he is aware that the person concerned was driving his employer's vehicle at the time <Col N="1577" /> and was not responsible for tax or insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It would be contrary to long-established practice and, I am satisfied, inappropriate for me as Minister for Justice to deal at Question Time with individual petitions for the remission or mitigation of penalties.  I would not, therefore, feel able either to treat a parliamentary question as a petition for such remission or to offer comments on why I did or did not accede to a petition that had already been made in the normal way.</P>
      <P>As the terms of the question indicate, there has already in this case been a petition and because of all the circumstances I agreed to a migitation, which in fact was substantial.  If, however, because of very exceptional circumstances a case exists for a further review, that case may be made in the normal way, preferably in writing, by the petitioner or somebody acting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>In view of the suggestion in the last part of the question, which might perhaps lead to misunderstanding, I think it necessary to make it clear that I could not accept that an employee is not to be held responsible for driving an uninsured vehicle owned by his employer.  That, however, is not to be taken as a comment on the particular case to which the question relates and in fact I understand that insurance was in force in that case.</P>

Not more than two extra teachers, sufficient for any intake of 70 junior infants, were to be appointed in any one school year.  The board has already been informed that two extra teachers may be appointed in September, but as the extra third teacher it seeks to appoint would be in addition to these two teachers, the post cannot be sanctioned.</P>

      <P>I am conscious that there is still a lot of work to do in extending suitable forms of worker participation to organisations throughout the country.  For this reason I recently set up an advisory committee on worker participation with the following terms of reference: advise the Minister for Labour on the scope for the development of employee participation at sub-board level in different types of work organisation; promote interest in practical experimentation in workplace participation; identify research need and make recommendations.</P>
      <P>The committee is composed of people nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers, a number of other experts and an independent chairman.  I have asked them to let me have their recommendations early in 1986.  It is my hope that the committee will provide me with practical and workable recommendations on the next steps to be taken in the evolution of worker participation below board level.</P>
      <P>I intend to introduce legislation this year to extend the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, to a further six State enterprises (i.e. Aer Rianta, Board Gais Éireann, An Foras Forbartha, Irish Steel Limited, National Rehabilitation Board and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board) thus bringing to 13 the number of State enterprises which may elect worker directors to fill one third of the positions on their boards.  The original seven are: Bord na Móna, CIE, ESB, Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, Siúicre Éireann and Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta.  I understand that An Post and An Bord Telecom also intend to elect worker directors to their board later this year under their establishing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my proposed extension of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, will enable a majority of employees in a State enterprise to request the establishment of appropriate <Col N="1585" /> sub-board participative structures at relevant levels within the enterprise.  I would hope that the proposed new initiatives in the public sector will act as further models which private sector organisations can adapt to their own particular circumstances.</P>
