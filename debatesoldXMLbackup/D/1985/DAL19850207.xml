      <P>Arising out of the budget, there are two matters which are engaging public attention at the moment. One is the situation regarding building societies and the increase in mortgage interest.  The other is the situation of the <Col N="1924" /> building industry following the imposition of an extra 5 per cent tax on houses and construction generally.  As these matters have significant impact on the budget, its figures and its general strategy, could I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance if it is proposed to make an additional statement governing these matters to the House soon, or at an early stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I was dealing with the impact of the increase in the price of petrol on the tourist industry.  I was saying that I considered that this industry would be our largest by the end of the century. <Col N="1926" /> Its importance to the economy, its possibilities for job creation and the fact that it is a labour intensive industry should have meant that it would have got special attention from the Minister in this budget and that measures introduced would reflect a policy of paving the way to expedition of its development for the good of the country and for employment creation generally.  While some of the measures introduced may be a help, others will be a severe hindrance to this development. I ask the Minister for Finance when the Finance Bill comes before the Dáil if he will look at this additional taxation which has been imposed on petrol and redress the serious situation obtaining.</P>
      <P>Another matter of vital importance to the Louth constituency is the footwear industry.  On budget day here it was announced that 370 jobs were to be lost in Clarks footwear manufactury in Dundalk, a town with a long and proud tradition in this industry.  There were generations of the same families employed in that industry which is rapidly coming to a halt.  Ninety per cent of our footwear needs are now being imported with just 10 per cent being manufactured at home, a most undesirable situation in view of the fact that this industry is labour-intensive and the possibilities it offers for job creation in a real, positive and lasting sense.  This constitutes one area of our economy to which the Government should be looking with a view to the development and expansion of job creation.  Footwear constitutes an essential commodity because young and old alike have an on going need.</P>
      <P>We export anything up to 90 per cent of raw material, the hides that should be cured and developed for the industry leaving the country on a weekly or monthly basis.  The Government cannot allow this practice to continue without establishing a task force to examine the possibilities obtaining at home.  We cannot allow the indefinite export of our raw materials for the creation of jobs elsewhere.  The skills obtaining in places like Dundalk, developed over many years of involvement in the industry, cannot be allowed to go for nought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> In Dundalk there is a very serious unemployment problem at present, 4,000 people being on the live register with a total of over 8,000 unemployed in the whole county of Louth.  Louth must be one of the worst off counties so far as this problem is concerned.  Deputy Faulkner and I put down a Private Notice Question to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism asking him to set up a special unit in his Department to embrace the different State agencies with responsibility in this area to tackle the unemployment problem obtaining in Dundalk, where the decrease in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry makes sorry reading.  For example, in November 1982 there were a total of 4,510 employed in manufacturing industry and, in November 1984, that figure had dropped to 3,836 which figure will probably sink to something in the region of 3,000 before the end of the year.  That is an indication of how things are going in what was once one of the most prosperous towns in the country, being a centre of gravity across into counties like Monaghan and Cavan where many people set up home and found useful employment with excellent education facilities for their families.  Dundalk has been devastated by unemployment, a town where traditional industries are going to the wall with staff being laid off in their hundreds.  We cannot allow that practice to continue.  Surely the areas where jobs can be retained can be identified and the footwear industry constitutes a prime example.  We cannot allow the export of our raw materials for the creation of jobs elsewhere while the industry at home grinds to a halt.  That does not constitute good industrial policy.  I would ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to our suggestion that a special unit be established in his Department to tackle the unemployment problem in the whole of the county of Louth.  If this trend were to continue it would lead to serious social unrest.</P>
    <P>Another area of grave concern as a result of this budget is the housebuilding industry in respect of which the Minister <Col N="1928" /> for Finance announced that there was to be an increase in the rate of value-added tax from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, a very serious imposition.  It should be remembered that the cost of housebuilding is placing it beyond the capabilities of more and more people which means effectively that local authorities will have to shoulder greater responsibility with regard to the provision of housing.  Given the allocations they are receiving from the Department of the Environment their task will not be an easy one.  All of us subscribe to the view that as many people as possible should be encouraged to provide their own homes.  An increase of the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will act as a positive disincentive to anybody contemplating taking on such responsibility.</P>
    <P>In recent days there was the announcement that mortgage repayments will be increased, another serious development. More and more people making repayments on mortgages to local authorities, building societies and other lending institutions are finding themselves in grave financial difficulty.  It can truly be said that they constitute the new poor, those who must meet repayments of perhaps £50, £60 or £70 per week.  It would be impossible for such a family, without a husband and wife working, to meet those repayments.  In many instances it is not a question of choice; husband and wife must continue to work to meet those commitments.  I do not believe we can continue this practice indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in this House I asked the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment &mdash; under the provisions of the new house purchase scheme being introduced by his Department &mdash; if he would allow local authorities to buy houses from people who found themselves unable to meet repayments over a long period, so that those people could remain as tenants under the differential rents scheme, but he said he did not think such was feasible.  I would ask the Taoiseach, now present, to consider the possibilities obtaining in this area.  It is pointless having people bogged down continuously by mortgage repayments, bearing in mind the family upheaval, the <Col N="1929" /> social difficulties and the pressures it imposes on children in education.  This house purchase scheme should allow the Government to effect that change.  There are hundreds of people throughout the country who would be most appreciative if that were done.</P>
    <P>The free fuel scheme has been very useful to pensioners, people living alone and people who are not in a good financial position.  We have the urban fuel scheme and the national fuel scheme.  There are serious anomalies in the operation of the scheme in the rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of detail are more appropriate to the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to dwell on this for very long.  People in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in rural areas are not eligible for the free fuel vouchers.  I ask the Minister for Social Welfare to remove the anomalies in the two schemes.</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of diesel oil will have an impact on farming costs, on the horticultural industry and on transport costs of industries and services. Farm production costs have gone through the roof.  They are pushing more and more people over the precipice.  People borrowed money some years ago when there was a farming boom and a price boom for agricultural produce.  The margin has now tightened to such an extent that they are being pushed out of business.  Costs have escalated for the running of tractors and farm machinery generally.  A huge investment is involved in tractors and machinery.  In some cases given the size of the farms these costs may not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing increases in the price of diesel oil are creating untold problems. In the horticultural industry they depend on diesel oil to heat glasshouses and so on.  The growing season particularly for tomatoes and cucumbers has been very restricted because early crops are not economic due to the price of heating oil. The impact on an already devastated industry of the increased cost of diesel oil will be even greater.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1930" /> for Finance will look at this problem when he is introducing the Finance Bill and consider the damage which is being done in an area where the possibilities for job creation are considerable.  This is one of the primary producing areas in our economy and the possibilities for imports substitution are very real.  If we continue to pile on costs in this way we will stymie any attempt to develop and expand our produce in this area.</P>
    <P>Transport costs for industry are very high.  Firms who are some distance from the ports and the other outlets find that the increase in the price of diesel oil is imposing further burdens.  It can mean anything up to £25,000 or £30,000 a year for an individual company in additional costs.  That is not acceptable.  Firms removed from the centre of economic activity are being pushed out of business. Because of these costs the remoter parts of the country will not be attractive locations for the setting up of industries.  To introduce measures without considering their impact is very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>In Dundalk the firm of P.J. Carroll has given very valuable employment to many people.  They now find that their market for cigarettes is contracting. Every hike in the price of cigarettes means that more and more jobs are being threatened.  There is a very serious unemployment position in Dundalk.  The Minister should consider removing the increased 10p imposition from the price of 20 cigarettes to try to maintain the jobs that are already there.  If any further pressure comes on industries like P.J. Carroll more and more people will be let go.  Having regard to the serious reduction in the numbers employed in manufacturing industries in Dundalk that would be very serious.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the extension of natural gas to County Louth and its availability for the horticultural industry.  This must be a top priority.  Since the breakdown in the agreement between the Department of Energy and their counterpart in the North, people have been waiting with bated breath for an extension of the natural gas pipeline to Belfast.  In towns like Drogheda and Dundalk, and <Col N="1931" /> in the horticultural belt in north County Dublin, people were looking forward to the availability of natural gas.  So far there is no indication that the pipeline will be extended into County Louth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to expedite the extension of the natural gas pipeline into County Louth. If natural gas were available to the IDA and the other agencies involved in industrial promotion, this would be an added attraction to people who wish to set up new industries.  It would be part and parcel of the infrastructural development of the area.  Given the serious decline in industrial production, and the very serious decline in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry, surely this must be given top priority by the Government. One industry in Drogheda is holding on in anticipation of natural gas being made available very quickly.  The quicker a decision is made the better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Road tax is always likely to be increased in the budget, and this budget was no exception.  Motor vehicles are carrying a very heavy burden of taxation. We have an increase of 50p per horse power up to eight horse power and £1 from nine horse power to 15 horse power. Taken in conjunction with the increase in the price of petrol, that means that more and more taxation is being taken out of the pockets of those who depend on their cars to get to work.  More and more people will have to look at the many hidden costs involved in keeping a motor vehicle for work and for pleasure.  The costs involved have become prohibitive, and this latest imposition is intolerable for those who need a car to go about their daily business.</P>
    <P>We have had the long running saga of the super-levy.  The impact of the super-levy on agriculture is very real and lasting.  While there has been an over production of milk in the Community, it cannot be said that the farmers of Ireland have been responsible for that over production.  Our dairying industry is underdeveloped when compared with other EC countries. <Col N="1932" /> The importation of substitute cereals into the Community has been a contributing factor to the over production of dairy products, yet we have had to take the rap. We have to curtail production because of the super-levy.  This is creating very severe problems for many farmers who have no alternative but to expand their dairy production and to intensify.  It is very wrong to penalise the man with a 35, 40 or 50 acre farm.  There are no alternatives for this type of farmer.  To tell him he should move into tillage, cereals or beef production is simply a nonstarter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the impact of the super-levy has been underestimated.  In a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach the other day we heard that the number of cows slaughtered in this country was greater in 1983 than 1984.  This shows that when the farmers sat down and considered their position they found it impossible to cut back.  D-Day will be coming up very soon for many people, because this 96p per gallon will have to be met by the creameries and the dairies.  We are living in a state of uncertainty, and many people involved in the processing and distribution ends do not know what is going to happen.  The sooner we get rid of this uncertainty the better, and then farmers can plan for the future.</P>
    <P>The impact of the super-levy will be with us for a very long time.  Come the end of March if people get a bill for this super-levy they must examine their position and many of them will be forced to cut back on the number of cows.  This will result in a cut back in the number of cows in the country, and this will have implication for the beef industry. Without a cow there cannot be a calf to grow into the bullock which is needed for the meat factories and for export.  This industry has been the backbone of our economy and has kept the economy ticking over.</P>
    <P>Many people who invested heavily in machinery for tillage and cereal growing now find that production in this area may also be curtailed.  This is a very bleak picture for the agricultural industry, and unless we get some leadership at this time <Col N="1933" /> our primary producers will go into a decline.  This means more people will come on to the labour market because they will not be able to make a living on their small farms, and this will also have an effect on employment in the spin-off industries.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the development of our agricultural land is at the medium stage and there is still a great deal of work to be done.  Yet the farm modernisation scheme is being curtailed. This is an admission that the Government are not as committed to the development of the agricultural industry as they should be.  Any curtailment of this scheme must depress the industry further and lower the morale of those involved in the industry, because if the Minister for Agriculture and the Government do not have the necessary commitment to this industry, we cannot expect the man working on the land to have confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>Some changes in the Farm Modernisation Scheme, crucial to the horticultural industry, were announced recently.  Horticulture has been a tremendous growth area.  In Monaghan, Wexford and other areas the growth in exports has been phenomenal. There is a projected 20 per cent increase in mushroom production for 1985.  This is a real money spinner, because ready markets and cheap methods of production have been found and up to date processing facilities have been developed.  Very valuable employment has been generated in areas which heretofore had low employment prospects.  To curtail the farm modernisation scheme or the grant aid to this industry in any way would have very serious effects, because all the indications are that there is considerable room for expansion and for job creation in this area.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to look at the impact of the curtailment of the farm modernisation scheme on the mushroom industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the installation of thermal screens in glasshouses.  There is a considerable saving in heat loss to be made by the installation of these screens, but if a sufficiently high grant is not made available for fuel conversion it will mean <Col N="1934" /> that those deeply committed in the horticultural industry will find themselves in a very serious position.  The growing season for tomatoes has been severely curtailed in recent times because of very high energy costs.  People in this industry were very glad to hear the Minister for Agriculture say some time ago that he intended to make grant aid available for conversion to solid fuel.  So far as I am aware, no announcement has been made of the percentage grants which would be available, and I appeal to the Minister to make that announcement as quickly as possible so that the horticulture and glasshouse industries can plan for the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the position as regards research and development work in the areas of alternative sources of energy &mdash; biomass, methane gas, wind power and wave power.  All have been identified as areas with some potential, but there is a feeling abroad that the commitment needed to research, develop and pursue this task is not there.  Anybody who looks at our annual oil bill will realise that research and development work in this area is essential.  The more alternative sources of energy we have the better to complement natural gas.  Our energy costs have strangled the economy since the early seventies.  We have no control over our oil prices because they are fixed outside this country, and that had an impact on our electricity charges, which are outrageous.  Our electricity charges to industry can be anything from 20 per cent to 40 per cent higher than those paid by our competitors in the Community.  That position cannot continue. There is no hope of developing or expanding our industrial base unless we can come to terms with electricity costs to industry and also to consumers.  For those who borrow for investment of expansion, interest rates have been a major deterrent to the development of industry and agriculture.  Money is being soaked up by the State which, in turn, pushes up interest rates.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of other points but other Members wish to speak so I will yield gracefully to them.</P>
    <Col N="1935" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear at the outset that my absence during the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was due to the fact that I was unaware that his speech had been brought forward and, as I explained afterwards, as soon as my attention was drawn to the fact that he was speaking I left a party meeting to come here but, unfortunately, I was too late to hear his remarks. As he is aware, no discourtesy was intended by me.</P>
      <P>In this debate the Opposition obviously have something of a task in that the budget has been well received by the public in general because of a recognition that because of the constrained circumstances in which we will find ourselves, it represents an imaginative attempt to do the maximum possible with limited resources.  That poses a problem for the Opposition who have been floundering in their speeches since then.  With all due respect to the Deputy who has just sat down, their speeches have been marked by a tendency to suggest other ways of spending money where it is required or thought to be required.  With respect it is very easy to make speeches of that kind and I am not being unduly critical of the Opposition in that regard.  When we were in Opposition, we also tended to place the emphasis on that but, at a time when constraints are so obvious and have been emphasised by the Leader of the Opposition in his speech in which he has been critical of the extent to which we have been borrowing, the current deficit and taxation, it is very difficult to understand the logic of proposing a whole range of additional forms of expenditure.  The temptation to indulge in that inconsistency is always strong in opposition but, in this debate, it has been carried somewhat beyond the bounds of credibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget itself represents a watershed. It marks the end of the period of rising taxation and falling living standards forced on our people by the need to pay belatedly for the vast increase in public spending that occured between 1977 and 1981 and which has now been brought to a halt.  It marks the end of the period when public service pay and numbers <Col N="1936" /> were allowed to rise without control.  In the first year of office of the Leader of the Opposition as Taoiseach, the public service pay bill which had been kept within reasonable bounds by his predecessor was allowed to rise by 34 per cent in 1980.</P>
    <P>Over the period from 1977 to 1982, the numbers in the public service were allowed by the two Fianna Fáil Taoisigh in question to increase by almost one-sixth. This year, the public service pay bill, including provision for increments and some special claims as well as the general pay increase provided for in the budget, will rise by a mere 5 per cent, that is one-seventh of the figure that existed when the Leader of the Opposition was in office.  The numbers in the Civil Service which were allowed, even encouraged, to rise in an uncontrolled manner by no less than 14 per cent between 1977 and 1981 have been reduced by 7 per cent in the past 3½ years in a painful and difficult exercise.  It is very easy to employ people and to add to the labour force in the public sector but reductions are always extremely difficult to achieve.  It created problems in different Departments because of the fact that they had to be achieved by the operation of an embargo which is somewhat crude in its effects. The co-operation of the public service in this operation has been one of the striking features of this period and the Government and the public should be grateful for the willingness of the public service to accept that although there is no diminution in the volume of work to be done &mdash; in some areas the volume of work has steadily risen, especially in education and schemes for the unemployed &mdash; it has been possible to achieve this reduction in numbers.  This is unique in the history of the State.  I do not have statistics going back to 1922 but I cannot recall a period during which a sustained reduction in Civil Service numbers was achieved.  This has made a major contribution to the control of public spending generally.</P>
    <P>In the past eight years, paying for the Fianna Fáil spending spree has pushed the burden of taxation up by over one-third. When the National Coalition left <Col N="1937" /> office in 1977, taxation took 26.8 per cent of GNP.  Last year, when we had restabilised the situation, painfully and with difficulty, the level of taxation reached 36.7 per cent.  This enormous increase was necessary in order to pay for part of although by no means all of the increase in spending that took place under Fianna Fáil.  Even this increase in taxation is insufficient to pay for their spending spree and this is evidenced by the fact that, even with that increase in taxation, we are still left with a current deficit of the order of £1,200 million which is about double what the deficit was in 1977.  Even though we have been forced to increase taxation, partly under Fianna Fáil and partly under this Government, to pay for the bills they left behind, it is still not sufficient to cover the increase in spending for which Fianna Fáil were responsible during the period they were in office when they allowed Civil Service numbers to increase by leaps and bounds, 14 per cent in four years, and also allowed the public service pay bill to increase by as much as 34 per cent in a single year and expenditure under every heading to rise in a totally uncontrolled manner.</P>
    <P>The result of those policies was a level of inflation which had only been reached once previously in the history of the State, in the immediate aftermath of the first oil crisis when inflation rose to unprecedented heights world wide.  In mid-1982, when Fianna Fáil were briefly back in office, prices were rising by 21 per cent per annum.  This year inflation is projected at 5¾ per cent, the lowest figure in almost 20 years.  That means that inflation will have been reduced by three quarters in three years.  That is a remarkable achievement and I am not sure that you can find an easy parallel for it in any other country.  Of course inflation has been falling generally in recent years in other countries but there are very few industrialised countries in which it was allowed to reach a level of 21 per cent during the early eighties.  It was from that level that we had to bring it down to a level in the current year which is around the average for EC countries as a whole. <Col N="1938" /> Our former figure was enormously higher than the EC average.  That achievement alone identifies the Government as one which has the capacity to tackle the problems created and left behind by its predecessors.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's earlier period in office was marked by the start of a fall in employment that has taken us several years to halt.  Between 1980 and 1984 the number at work fell by 41,000 on the best estimates we have and with some 15,000 young people a year seeking new jobs, over and above retirements, this has meant that unemployment has risen by over 100,000.  Let us be clear why this has happened.  An increase in the labour force of 15,000 each year would require an increase of something of the order of 1½ per cent or 2 per cent in non-agricultural employment to cater for that.  Far from such an increase the numbers at work fell.  That fall started under Fianna Fáil.  It has been halted at present under this Government.</P>
    <P>In fairness, part of the problem was related to the general world situation. Other countries have experienced similar difficulties but no economist would doubt that the results could have been significantly different if, instead of increasing spending by 40 per cent as a share of GNP over the period during which they were in, Government spending had been controlled and resources had been available to hold the level of employment and stave off some of the reductions that occurred.  By using up the resources at a time when the economy was developing rapidly and when increased expenditure was neither necessary nor desirable, the resources that might have been used to reduce the fall in employment were not available for Fianna Fáil when in Government.  They were not able to halt it during their period in office and it has taken four years for it to be brought under control to the point where we can look forward in the year ahead to some increase in the level of employment and a further reduction in the rise in unemployment to the point where with the special schemes introduced by the <Col N="1939" /> Government the level of unemployment will begin to fall.  This will take some time.</P>
    <P>The Government's special employment measures are already achieving significant results.  The enterprise allowance scheme in its first year in operation provided self-employment for 5,000 people on the live register.  It was an imaginative project introduced by this Government which has had a response of the most heartening kind.  The response is continuing at such a rate that we can, with confidence, look forward to another 5,000 people being taken off the live register and becoming self-employed in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme will add to the reduction in the numbers on the live register.  The type of response the Government have had from local authorities and community organisations to this scheme suggests that the assessment that it could provide employment for 10,000 people this year is realistic.  It is obviously too soon to give firm figures.  The scheme is only beginning to get under way.  A further announcement of the provisions of the scheme will be made in the weeks ahead.  Indications from the bodies who will be involved in taking these people into employment are encouraging and suggest our target can be achieved this year.  That together with the other measures being taken and the reversal of the trend in the months ahead in unemployment will mean that employment will start to climb again.</P>
    <P>We can take some heart from the fact that with certain fluctuations, including a bad patch in the past three months, unemployment is now rising at only half the rate when Fianna Fáil left office.  We can also take heart from the fact that the number of school leavers who got jobs within a year of leaving school was higher for those who left in 1983 than for those who left in 1982 and that the proportion will clearly be higher again this year given the improved situation.  Two out of three of those leaving who complete their education are now getting jobs within a year and the numbers emigrating after completing  <Col N="1940" /> their education, contrary to some Opposition statements, remain low &mdash; an estimated 2,300 out of 62,200 in the case of those who left school in 1983, including a number who went for further education and training abroad.  Those figures derive from the Department of Labour survey of school leavers which was recently published. These facts need to be emphasised to counter the gloom being spread by Opposition speakers, whose exaggerations of what is certainly still an unhappy employment situation is spreading despondency among our people on a scale not warranted by the facts.</P>
    <P>From the speeches on the Opposition benches many people could derive the impression that there are no jobs for young people.  There are not enough jobs for young people but two out of three young people get employment within a year.  Our task is to resolve the problems of the remaining one-third and ensure that they too are employed.  While that process is under way we must ensure that through the activities of the youth employment agency, work experience programmes and other agencies young people are not left in a position where they could lose the hope of or the will to work.  I must emphasise the connection between education and employment. The figures available from the survey are significant.  It is important that the message should be got across to young people: the level of education attained is very closely connected with the chances of getting a job.  Of those who left school at primary level in 1983, no less than half were still jobless a year later.  For those who left at Inter Cert/Group Cert level the proportion was about one third.  For those who carried on to complete their secondary studies it was less than one fifth and over nine out of ten of those with higher education got jobs within a year of completing their studies.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates the vital importance of education and of encouraging young people to continue with their education to the fullest extent possible.  Ireland has a clear advantage here over its neighbour Britain.  We are very bad at recognising our strengths and tend to pore over our <Col N="1941" /> weaknesses rather than note where we have achievements to our credit.  Very few people realise that our educational system caters for a larger proportion of young people than that in Britain.  In Britain GNP is much higher than here and the resources available for education are much greater.  Yet in our system a 50 per cent higher proportion of boys and girls aged 16 are in secondary education than the same age group in Britain.  That is a massive difference and few people appreciate this fact.  The proportion of 19 and 20 years olds attending third level institutions here is over 25 per cent higher than in Britain.  This is in a country with much lower resources.  The provision of education by successive Governments has been on such a scale and the desire for education on the part of parents and young people is so strong that we have this extraordinary performance at second and third level and such a high proportion of young people in the educational system.</P>
    <P>The cost of this is very high as a result of the fact that young people comprise 50 per cent of our population and that very many of them are in the educational system.  This is not the case in Britain or other European countries.  It is an area of spending on which we should be willing to concentrate resources.  For this Government it has been and is a priority area, I would say even the priority area. This is evident from the policies in the national plan, from the financial provisions made for every level of education, both capital and current, and from the provision made to assist young people to remain at school.  The Minister for Education has also made financial provision to enable young people to prepare for work and this has been done with the help of the EC.  We have also improved student grants.  That is a diversion from my main theme but it is one I do not regret.  It is important that we be aware of our strengths and our achievements rather than ignore them or denigrate them.</P>
    <P>The point I want to revert to is that this Government have brought our country successfully through the crisis we inherited in 1981 &mdash; not, of course, that this <Col N="1942" /> crisis has been resolved but that it has been brought under control.  No longer do people have to fear that every budget will bring a further increase in an intolerable burden of taxation, as has been the situation since Fianna Fáil initiated their spending spree in 1977.  No longer do they have to watch employment falling, as it began to do under Fianna Fáil, and unemployment accelerating out of control as it was at a rate of a 40,000 a year increase when Fianna Fáil left office.  No longer do they have to face inflation rates of Latin American proportions that threatened to undermine our capacity to compete in world markets, as they did under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We have stabilised public spending and taxation.  We have reduced, with their loyal co-operation, the size of the Civil Service and we have brought inflation down to the level of our EC partners. The restoration of control is evidenced most clearly by our success in bringing the current budget deficit into line with budget projections.  Fianna Fáil budgets understated the current budget deficit by over £1 billion between 1979 and 1982.  In those years, over and above the excessive provisions made in budgets, there was over-expenditure on top of the budgets at a scale of £1 billion in a situation where there was no control whatever over public spending.  The outturn overshot the budget projection by 60 per cent on average in those years.  This is an extraordinary margin of error that would not be tolerated in any other country.  Last year we brought the budget deficit in under target.  It is in this way that we have restored and maintained our creditworthiness which, when we came into office, was under serious threat as a result of the policies of our predecessors.</P>
    <P>It is even more than that.  We have been able to move from the negative task of stopping the rift to the positive challenge of starting to reform the tax system.  Beyond the expectations of the media, of public opinion, or &mdash; very visibly &mdash; those of the Opposition, we have at a stroke rationalised and simplified the tax system in respect of income tax and VAT.  We have brought the people on <Col N="1943" /> higher tax rates down by one-sixth to the basic 35 per cent income tax rate.  This was after a period during which the numbers on the higher tax rates had moved steadily upwards from a fractional figure to 40 per cent.  We have reduced the top income tax rate which was hitting single people earning as little as £12,700 a year. We have eliminated the top 35 per cent VAT rate, where the most that had been expected was some selective reduction of individual items to 23 per cent.  We have cut the excise duty on TV sets as we had already done on spirits, thus delivering a staggering blow to the drain of cross-Border trade, legal and illegal.</P>
    <P>At the same time, social welfare benefits, which under this Government have already been raised up to one-third more in the period July 1983 to July 1985 than the expected price increase rate for this period, are being raised once again by amounts that will be slightly higher than the inflation rate.  Thus, we are fully maintaining the enhanced purchasing power of this group and this is in contrast to what has happened in most of the rest of Europe.  For instance, in Germany cuts of between 2 per cent and 5 per cent were imposed on unemployment benefit in 1984.  In Denmark the half yearly cost of living adjustments were suspended during 1984 and in the Netherlands a 3 per cent cut in all social security benefits was imposed with effect from 1 January 1984.  By contrast, our social welfare benefit increases have been one-third higher than price increases and the improved level of real purchasing power of social welfare benefits will be more than maintained in the period July 1985 to July 1986.</P>
    <P>This progress in improving the conditions of the unemployed, retired people, widows, single mothers and other similar groups has been accompanied by the introduction of a family income supplement scheme designed to help for the first time those at work on low incomes who can secure no benefit from tax reforms because their levels of income leave them outside the tax net.  This group have always been neglected by Fianna Fáil who <Col N="1944" /> never made any attempt to cope with the problem.  The income of these people from work is so low that the incentive not to work and to live on unemployment benefit must be very high and it is a measure of the strength of character of many of them that they have continued to work when in many cases they might have been better off financially not to work.  We have sought to reverse that by the introduction of the family income supplement scheme, the benefits of which will be strengthened further with the transformation of the child benefit scheme in 1986.</P>
    <P>The social benefits, apart from the economic benefits, of removing that disincentive to work are clear.  People on low incomes do not pay income tax and, thus, they cannot benefit from income tax remission.  Up to now successive Governments have done their best to look after two groups &mdash; those who pay taxes for whom there are allowances for a range of items, such as mortgage interest relief, health and insurance provisions and so on.  These have benefited people disproportionately if they are better off because of the way our tax allowances operate.  Successive Governments have also looked after people in the social welfare categories but the people in between, those whose incomes are not liable to tax, who get no benefit from tax reform and who, if they continue to work get no benefit from social welfare, had been neglected until we came to office. For the first time they are being looked after.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the hitherto intractable problem of devising a system of farmer taxation that will be simple and fair in application will yield from that community an equitable contribution to the total burden of taxation.  This represents striking progress in a period in which the Government are still struggling with the task of restoring the economy that had been effectively wrecked by their predecessors in office.</P>
    <P>This budget contains many other provisions which reflect the sensitivity of the Government to the many and varied needs of our society, needs which must <Col N="1945" /> be recognised and catered for even in a period of economic difficulty.  The practice of making provision to provide once-off assistance to voluntary organisations who do invaluable work in the social services, a practice introduced by this Government, has not merely been maintained but the scale of that provision has been significantly increased in this budget by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Aid to Irish welfare centres in Britain has also been increased substantially by this Government &mdash; we have trebled this aid since we came to office &mdash; and special provision has been made to enable us to celebrate both International Youth Year and European Music Year as well as to provide for the Special Olympics and to start preparing our athletes for the next Olympic Games in South Korea in 1988, something that has never been done previously, which previous Government have neglected.  These measures together with the provisions for other sporting bodies: a grant to save the Dublin Zoo from insolvency; the provision for a new park development in Cork to mark the eighth centenary of that city; the provision for a new combat poverty organisation after Fianna Fáil's action to wreck the one we had established; action to deal with the injustice suffered by overseas volunteers who at present get no social welfare credit for their previous service; a new incentive for land leasing; extension of tax saving relief for old people; the exemption of theatres and live performances from VAT; the increase in the tax allowance for rent; the elimination of capital taxation on inheritances of spouses from each other; the abolition of the tax on oil used by sea fishermen &mdash; all in their different ways represent responses to real needs perceived by the parties in Government.  Many of them arise indeed from suggestions made by Deputies from both parties to the Ministers constituting this Government. Within the back benches of these parties are the eyes and ears of the governmental system, enabling us to be sensitive to these different requirements in a way which has never previously been a feature of previous Governments who have not <Col N="1946" /> set out in the same way to tackle this type of individual problems consistently.</P>
    <P>The tax reforms in the budget, involving such drastic simplification of the income tax and VAT systems, necessarily involve some disadvantages as well as some advantages.  But in the case of income tax the simplification has been devised in such a way that everybody's income tax bill is being reduced and it also has the effect of reducing the marginal rate of tax for a much greater number than will find their marginal tax rate raised while still having their actual tax bill reduced.  For those whose marginal tax rate has risen, the average rise is only one-third of the average fall in the marginal tax rate experienced by the 220,000 people whose marginal tax has been reduced, including the 15,000 who have been altogether relieved from income tax.</P>
    <P>Similarly with the VAT system, although it was inevitable that the simplification of the system would involve increases in VAT for some categories, steps have been taken to alleviate significantly the impact of these increases.  Clearly, we could not reduce the number of VAT rates from six to three, including the zero rate, without increasing the previous low 5 per cent rate which affects such items as construction and fuel.  It was inevitable that simplification would require that rate to be touched.</P>
    <P>However, deflation in the construction industry that might have resulted from that has been more than offset by other measures taken by the Government.  The increase of over £100 million in the Exchequer provision for construction activity, much of it on roads and higher level education buildings, involves an increase of over 13 per cent on the 1984 outturn, which means that in real terms, even allowing fully for the impact of the increase in the VAT rate, the volume of construction activity to be financed by the Exchequer this year will be increased significantly.  Moreover, in the case of private housing, the effect has been largely mitigated by the 75 per cent increase in the housing grant which will benefit about 60 per cent of house purchasers, <Col N="1947" /> halving the average price increase in these cases to 2 per cent.  Whatever marginal effect this may have on demand for housing will be more than offset by the other innovative provision in the national plan &mdash; the introduction of the £5,000 grant for those living in local authority dwellings for three years or more who wish to buy private accommodation.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's belief when this provision was proposed in the plan that it could in the first year induce some 800 local authority tenants to purchase private dwellings and the response to date through local authorities suggests that this forecast was well founded.  This positive reaction together with the increased housing grant will ensure a strong demand for private housing this year, thus helping the construction industry, which will also be assisted by the new tax incentives for apartment blocks.  The recent demand of 800 from that source alone is an increase of 4 per cent in the demand for private housing apart from anything else, which will be a very significant factor in maintaining private housing activity in the current year.</P>
    <P>In response to genuine and severe transitional difficulties, implementation of the VAT increase for new houses sold to private individuals is being deferred to 1 May.</P>
    <P>Similar measures have been taken to offset the adverse effect of the increase in VAT on fuel upon less well-off families. A 25 per cent increase in the value of fuel vouchers from £4 to £5 a week will far more than offset the increase in fuel prices resulting from the new VAT rate. Very simply, the scale of this social provision may be judged from the fact that five million such vouchers are issued every winter.</P>
    <P>Finally, mitigation of the effects of the increase in the 5 per cent rate in vehicle repairs has been achieved by reducing the duty on motor vehicle parts from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that a budget containing so many radical and innovative measures has been generally well received by public opinion.  The reactions <Col N="1948" /> from the Opposition benches have by contrast demonstrated the futility of Fianna Fáil's approach to the task in Opposition in this Dáil, a task they have never come to grips with.  It is now perfectly clear to everyone that they have no alternative policy to offer.  For the past two years they have sought to survive and to gain some public credibility by attacking the measures that this Government have been forced to take in order to undo the damage done by Fianna Fáil in Government during those disastrous years from 1977 to 1981.  Because we had to increase taxes in order to bridge the gap left by Fianna Fáil's free-spending policies, they found an easy way out by attacking these tax increases.  Because during their first two years the Government had little or no leeway, they criticised us for what they alleged to be a lack of imagination, and an unwillingness to undertake radical actions that would remove disincentives and stimulate growth and employment.</P>
    <P>Now that this Government, having broken the back of the problem left to them by their predecessors, have been able in the national plan and in this budget to launch the process of recovery, Fianna Fáil have been floundering in their own ineptitude.  The two years during which they might &mdash; and should &mdash; have reviewed their role as a political party and sought to prepare some rational policy stance that they might put to the people at the next election, have been wasted. The two years of constructive work by this Government have been paralleled by two years of futile negativism on the part of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>That party have never adapted themselves easily to opposition.  They have always tended to rely on a swing of the political pendulum to bring them back into Government regardless of how little they may have to offer when they put themselves once again before the electorate. The days when that kind of ploy would succeed with the Irish people are rapidly drawing to a close.  When the next election comes, the voters will want to know what Fianna Fáil have to offer to match the record of achievement of the <Col N="1949" /> present Government in resolving the problems which Fianna Fáil had created for our people during their disastrous term of office from 1977 to 1981.  If, as on present form seems likely to be the case, the people are offered nothing but a barren slogan of &ldquo;put them out&rdquo; or &ldquo;give us another chance&rdquo;, the electorate will have ready a conclusive answer to give them.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition in his speech here yesterday made a halfhearted attempt for the first time to suggest policy measures.  Welcome though such suggestions are, it is apparent that he has only just awoken to the need for policy as opposed to idle complaints, for he suggests as if they were new, policies which are already in place in a similar or preferable form.  For instance, his proposal for building better links between higher education and industry and for more work in product identification has already been anticipated, as he ought to know, by the joint IDA/NBST programme for this announced last July in the White Paper on Industrial Policy and the special funding, included in this year's Estimates, of additional research and development by third level institutions, to mention only two specific initiatives. His suggestions for alleged new policies in Bord Fáilte mirror that body's existing policy, as he ought to know if he is in touch with reality.</P>
    <P>On the co-ordination of hiring persons now on the live register, we have gone much further than the Deputy suggest by introducing the large-scale employment scheme, which will provide funding as well as institutional support for the hiring of 10,000 long term unemployed.  This scheme will also be in a position to fund suitable local projects such as community social facilities to which he has referred.</P>
    <P>One feature of his speech was an attack on the veracity of the figures in our budget.  I do not need to dwell on that unduly because I do not think anybody has any doubts about the probability of this Government and the figures they put forward, whatever the Opposition may say, nor have they much doubt about the <Col N="1950" /> lack of probity of the Opposition when they were in Government.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have asked for details about the cuts in non-capital expenditure which were effected by the Government several weeks before the budget was produced. They have been circulated and, as Deputies will see, the majority of the cuts arise out of the fact that in one or other area during the last year the level of demand turned out to be lower than anticipated when the Estimates were drawn up, as they have to be some time before the end of the year.  A majority of the total of £23.6 million relates to revisions in the Estimates arising from the pattern of expenditure in 1984.  The £5 million reduction arises from the fact that the Government's successful reduction of inflation has been greater even than anticipated when the national plan was produced.  Projections of inflation now given to us by our experts are 0.5 per cent lower than at the time the plan was produced, therefore the cost of purchasing of goods and services by the Government provided from the Estimates can be reduced by 0.5 per cent.  The details are set out in the document which has been circulated and people can see what is involved.  As I said, these decisions were made several weeks before the budget was produced, contrary to the allegations of the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>Whatever figure emerges is given as being the actual amount outstanding from the accounts as known at that time, and that figure is included in the budget.  Deputy Haughey, as a former Minister for Finance, knows that well, and any attempt to suggest otherwise is not to his credit.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition called for an additional £200 million by way of capital spending.  This is an old chestnut that he has produced at the time of each budget and also frequently in between budgets.  Obviously it is something to which the Deputy is deeply attached, but I am surprised that he could expect anyone to agree simultaneously with this and with his other view that borrowing is too high.  He criticises the level of borrowing and the level of a deficit but yet he wants us to borrow another £200 million. May I inform him that policies of that kind have gone?  It no longer cuts any ice. The Deputy should begin to realise that he is living in the Ireland of the eighties where people will not be fooled by that kind of codology.  However, if he wishes to continue in Opposition for the next three years he should continue on that line.  It will make us very happy.  It suits us very well for him to pretend that we can spend more while taking less tax and borrowing less simultaneously.  Our people are not so simple minded as to believe that.  He is wasting his time in attempting to carry them along that path of irresponsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At our end of December calculation <Col N="1953" /> the figure being called for by the people on the other side of the House was £570 million.  I am not sure whether the £200 million is in addition to that £570 million. Perhaps somebody opposite will clarify that.  Are we talking about a demand for an extra £570 million or for an extra £770 million to be achieved without extra taxation and without extra borrowing?  Are we merely to print money?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach questions the public credibility of Fianna Fáil I would remind the Taoiseach that where the people had an opportunity to judge Fianna Fáil in the by-elections which we won and in the European elections where we won a majority and in the public opinion polls, their response reflected acceptance of Fianna Fáil and rejection of the Government.  The Taoiseach's speech is incredible where he says that no longer have we to watch employment falling and unemployment accelerating out of control despite the fact that only two days after the budget the official figure for unemployment stood at 234,000.  The Taoiseach says that we have stabilised public spending and taxation.  The situation is that the current budget deficit stands at £1,234 million and our national debt rose from £12.7 billion to £18.5 billion in two years and this year will come to £21 billion.  Our foreign debt two years ago was £5.2 billion and it is now practically <Col N="1955" /> £8 billion.  The Taoiseach lives in a world of his own.  This Government will eventually be dragged kicking before the electorate and, like their predecessors in Coalition governments, will be cast into political oblivion.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach dealt with education in the earlier part of his speech and spent the time contrasting our educational system with that of the British.  The Taoiseach seems to be hypnotised with all things British even to the extent of comparing our economy with theirs although theirs is a bankrupt economy. If their economy was better it would help our export trade.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election Fine Gael spokemen waxed lyrical about their intention to introduce each September the Estimates for the following year so that they could be fully debated and if necessary special committees of the House were to examine each expenditure proposal in detail to ensure that they passed the closest scrutiny.  In the Programme for Government they again talked about this close examination of the figures in the autumn.  Like so many other promises this was not fulfilled.  Looking at this year's figures perhaps that is just as well, as it would have been a total waste of Dail time.  The arithmetic used in this budget would do justice to some gin soaked half qualified bookkeeper from some sleazy back street in a tin town in the Cayman Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to accept a budget for the Department of Social Welfare based on a figure of 217,000 unemployed, but two days later the CSO published unemployment statistics giving a figure of 234,000 unemployed.  We are asked to accept a figure conveniently listed as £58 million for buoyancy when the economy is grinding to a halt.  Yesterday we were presented with a list which purports to itemise the £28.6 million cuts announced on budget day.  This list smacks of arbitrary alterations in the estimates bearing no relationship to the cuts in services. One of the few examples given relates to old age pension cuts.  One of three things <Col N="1956" /> has happened all of which call for the resignation of the Minister for Social Welfare.  The original estimate published was purposely untrue and has now been corrected, the original estimate was correct and is now being arbitrarily doctored for political bookkeeping purposes, or there has been a Government decision to reduce payments to non-contributory old age pensioners.  The ghost of Ernest Blythe stalks the corridors of Leinster House.  It is no coincidence that this Taoiseach who a week ago tried to besmirch the honoured name of Sean Lemass in this House would interfere with the old age pension just as the Government in which his father served with Ernest Blythe was the originator of the cuts in the old age pension.  For interfering with the old age pension figures this Minister for Social Welfare should resign.  I make that call for his resignation in hope rather than in expectation.  The Minister who has gone about axing the health services with the crazed enthusiasm of the villain of the Texas chain gang massacre with blood dripping from his axe, will eventually be dragged before the electorate and will be cast into political oblivion.  To treat the old age pensioners in this way is sick when it comes from a Government that carries its purported liberal concerned heart on its sleeve.</P>
    <P>In normal years with normal Governments, the Minister for Finance received deputations from representative groups who made their cases for consideration in the budget.  This year we have an innovation.  We had the budget and then we had the farce of the Minister rushing from one deputation to another trying to correct the mistakes in the budget.  Due to the calls from Fianna Fáil and from the building industry who are crippled with the increase in VAT the Minister has made a minor alteration up to 1 May next, though still the 10 per cent stays. We had the farce of the Minister introducing a crippling tax on the building society movement in relation to his borrowing strategy, and he is rushing from one meeting to another talking to the heads of the building societies.  The Minister has also to meet the people in <Col N="1957" /> the theatre world because of his ham fisted handling of their VAT problem. This budget could have been produced by Alan Ackbourne rather than by Alan Dukes.</P>
    <P>Where are the old nationalists in Fine Gael?  Have they been completely swamped by the opportunist PR types who are more interested in holding on to their lucrative Government contracts than in the general national interest?  In Liam Cosgrave's time no such dishonest exercise such as we have seen regarding the funding of the public service pay award would have been contemplated.  None of the other twists and turns with regard to the budget figures would have been contemplated in Liam Cosgrave's time or in the old Fine Gael times.  The public sector pay bill was to cost £108 million. On Monday of budget week the Minister for the Public Service met the unions and there was no money available for the public sector pay.  On Tuesday the pressure was built up on the Labour Ministers from the trade union movement, who told them that this was the end of the road and that they would have to settle for the £108 million.  The Government had only £20 million for this pay award, but on Wednesday the Minister came into the House having conveniently found £88 million to bring the figure up to £108 million.  The Taoiseach said that the £88 million was found, by pure coincidence, by savings of £30 million and £58 million buoyancy, at a time when the country is grinding to a halt.  That is the type of Government which we are asked to accept today.</P>
    <P>What is really disconcerting and disturbing is that I must ask these questions. Where are the old reliable, strong Fine Gael Ministers and where are the old reliable, strong, Fine Gael backbenchers that were the heart of the Fine Gael Party of old?  Over the years I have disagreed vehemently with the methods of Fine Gael, but I would never have questioned their basic national beliefs.  I would never have believed that Fine Gael as a party would sink to the PR opportunists that we have in this Government.  This is not the Fine Gael Party of old that people <Col N="1958" /> supported down through the years.  They were then a party who put the nation first.  Now they have sunk to the level, from Monday to Wednesday, of talking to the tune of £88 million, with no account as to where this is to be found.  Where are the Paddy Cooneys of this world and what was he saying at that budget table? I ask this in sorrow and sadness, rather then in criticism.  I am not talking about the John Wayne types of that Government. I am talking about the Paddy Cooneys and, as far as the national interest is concerned, the Peter Barrys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Minister Paddy Cooney, Minister Peter Barry and others from whom I would have expected more. What have we seen in the last two years of this Government?  We have seen the foreign debt go from £5.29 billion to £8 billion and the national debt from £12.7 billion to £18.5 billion and it will go to £21 billion by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Unemployment figures stand at 234,000.  These are persons, not numbers and Fine Gael Ministers lend their support to this charade.  Where are the John Kellys, who lectured Fianna Fáil about funny money, in relation to this budget and the farce which we have seen last week of running from one interest group to another?  If these were in business, the Minister and this budget could be charged under the Trade Descriptions Act and the Sale of Goods Act, for attempting to sell a wrongly advertised product.</P>
      <P>The well paid PR experts and consultants in Government, the national handlers with their PR contracts in the various Departments are the types which have hyped up this budget above and beyond anything that it deserves.  This PR exercise has fallen flat on its face because every day since the budget there has been one dreadful headline after another with regard to unemployment, mortgage rates, crisis in the building industry and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of this hype from the PR people, on Friday we had an incredible <Col N="1959" /> piece from the Minister for the Public Service, reported in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> He had the decency to say that he hoped he did not sound unctuous.  In the last paragraph he said &ldquo;Ireland, you are looking good&rdquo;.  It might be looking good from the ministerial office in Kildare Street, but it does not look good from the homes of the 234,000 unemployed today.  It does not look good from the point of view of the social welfare recipients, the old age pensioners, the children who are facing examinations this year and have no hope of getting a job.  Their only worry is if they will get a visa to enter the United States to do some work and if they go in illegally and get injured if they will have to be flown home, because there will be no insurance.  That sort of nonsense from that Minister does no justice to this Government, or to the country.  If it were not so serious it would be laughable.</P>
    <P>This budget, with some very minor exceptions such as the relief for the hotel industry and the change in excise rates on televisions, does nothing to solve the real problem facing the country, which is unemployment.  The correcting of the mistake regarding VAT, which was increased from this Government to 35 per cent, bringing it down to 23 per cent, is called a radical reform.  There is still an underlying disincentive to industry because of the VAT rates and VAT strategy of this Government.  To talk about radical reform and a reduction of the number of VAT rates when the same Minister increased the number of VAT rates in previous budgets is bad enough.  To say that he is saving VAT is worse.  The actual figure on current revenue of VAT take in 1984 was £1,361.6 million.  In 1985 after his budget proposals, by his figures, the VAT take will be £1,483.9 million &mdash; an increase of £122.3 million.  That increase will be paid this year, and we are expected to accept that as a radical and dramatic reform of VAT rates.</P>
    <P>What has this budget done to the building industry, for example?  What it has done to that industry borders on the criminal.  What would you expect from a <Col N="1960" /> Government led by a Taoiseach who in his last Ard Fheis speech talked about dusting off JCBs?  I should like to give the Taoiseach a little lesson in the work of a JCB and what it stands for.  These machines do not have lace curtains and do not have satin cushions.  You do not dust them off like some livingroom in Dublin 4.  You get a JCB dirty.  That is the whole object of the exercise &mdash; to give it work to do, not dust it off.  A Taoiseach who is so incredibly out of touch with the real world and the construction industry presided over this Cabinet which increased VAT on the building industry from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  He came in here this morning and told us about the great progress made in the construction industry.  The reality is that since his Government came to office in December 1982, that industry has suffered over 25 per cent decline in activity.  There are over 50,000 building workers on the unemployment register. As a result of this budget, the industry faces a further decline in activity in 1985. The Government introduced proposals in the budget to increase the VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent from 1 March.  We immediately asked that the stupidity of that be realised and the decision changed.</P>
    <P>Where contracts had been signed or deposits paid on houses the VAT rate &mdash; which was at 5 per cent at that time &mdash; would have been increased to 10 per cent and would have had to be carried by the construction industry, amounting to millions of pounds.  We discovered the amount today when the CIF statement was issued &mdash; £6 million &mdash; as a result of the change decided by the Minister.  The Minister should have realised this before last Wednesday when he made that announcement.  It had not been thought out sufficiently, because this Government do not understand, and never have, the problems of the construction industry.  My father served in this House for 29 years.  One phrase more than any other was associated with him <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Coalition Government of the 1957 period, that phrase being that there was not a bob left for a bag of cement when <Col N="1961" /> they left office.  If that was true in 1957 how much truer is it today?</P>
    <P>The Construction Industry Federation at a meeting last evening decided to cancel all advertisements in the press for house sales until further notice.  Because of the action of this Government they have decided to close all their showhouses until further notice, to march on Dáil Éireann from their headquarters next Wednesday and ahold a further meeting thereafter.  Is this the action of a responsible group of men, if we are to take the Taoiseach's words as being correct? The Taoiseach says that the construction industry and housebuilding are thriving.  Does the Taoiseach really think that this group of responsible builders in the construction industry, involved in house sales, would take this type of action unless they realised and could foresee the dangers to their industry and those employed in it?  They would not.  But this Taoiseach, in his lace-curtained Dublin 4, would not see it because his idea of a JCB is something with lace curtains and satin seats.</P>
    <P>In addition to the damage this VAT increase is doing the housebuilding area of the construction industry it will dramatically reduce the moneys available for work to be undertaken under the public capital programme, such projects as roads, sanitary services, all of the local authority capital works and all of the other capital works to be undertaken in the health and other areas.  The Government themselves are cutting back on their public capital programme, reducing employment in the construction industry because of this crazy decision to increase the rate of VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  Already they have changed many of their decisions contained in their budget of last week.  I call on the Minister to reexamine this decision because the construction industry has the greatest potential for job creation, more than any other sector of our economy and this Government are damaging that potential.  I call on the Minister to reduce the level of VAT, at least to restore it to the 5 per cent and, if possible, to reduce it further because of the damage it will do.  It is a <Col N="1962" /> cliché to say that the construction industry and its health is a barometer of the health of the whole economy.</P>
    <P>The construction industry today is on its knees as a result of this Government's decisions.  We must ask: do this Government and Minister realise that a shot in the arm can be given to this industry which would immediately employ many on the live register?  Because of the nature of this industry here and their loyalty to Irish-produced materials, up to 80 per cent of the materials used are home-based, with a spin-off effect. Therefore any impetus given it has effects not merely directly on that industry but on ancillary ones also.  I plead with the Minister to give that type of boost to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government and Minister also to give the private sector encouragement and incentive to involve themselves in joint venture products with the Government on road and bridge construction and other projects which should be open to private financing.  We have seen already the construction of the Tom Roche Bridge over the Liffey, a fine example of the private sector becoming involved in work normally undertaken by the Government from funds out of the public purse.  I ask the Government and Minister for the Environment to encourage the private sector, private finance, to become involved in this type of road and bridge building project.</P>
    <P>This budget attacked the building industry, families, young people who want to buy houses and those people already in houses when they interfered with the building society movement. Increasing the composite rate of tax on building societies &mdash; with the considered insult the Minister then included in his speech to the building society movement, the sort of snide remark one would expect from the Coalition in regard to the financial institutions: well, if the building societies were not happy with the composite rate they could open their books to the Revenue Commissioners for examination &mdash; does nothing to encourage investment or initiative.  The same Minister by that decision and his borrowing strategy <Col N="1963" /> over the past 12 months &mdash; through some ideological hang-up when he was borrowing at home, soaking up available funds from the private sector, driving interest rates up to the tune of at least 1½ per cent in December &mdash; has brought about an inevitable increase in building societies' interest rates.  Since that announcement on Wednesday last the Minister has been scurrying from meeting to meeting with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, endeavouring to persuade the building society movement not to increase their rates by 2 per cent.  The Minister did not recognise that the building society movement has been suffering unfair competition <i>vis-à-vis</i> the single premium bonds in the insurance world &mdash; moneys taken from available funds for investment that would normally go to the building society movement having been siphoned off in this financial manoeuvre, called a single premium bond &mdash; and has further antagonised the building society movement.</P>
    <P>What will be the effect of all these decisions of the Minister on the building society movement?  Because of the lack of funds in building societies &mdash; funds siphoned off into the insurance world &mdash; the Minister has rendered it more difficult for young couples to obtain loans.  He also renders it more difficult for them, when they get a loan, to repay it because, on a £20,000 mortgage &mdash; if the rates are increased by the 2 per cent being talked about &mdash; that will amount to a £28 per month increase in mortgage repayments. For those with existing loans that £28 per month is an impossible burden.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are totally out of touch with the people.  The real problem they face is this.  Many people with mortgages took them out in good faith when they had what they thought was secure employment in the State sector or in industry.  Like the employees of Irish Shipping, or like the employees of any private companies, many of them have lost their jobs.  They are trying to pay their mortgages to keep a roof over the heads of their wives and children.  They are trying to struggle on <Col N="1964" /> and repay their mortgages rather than have their homes repossessed.  The Minister and the Government do not seem to be aware of these problems.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the building societies who have been very understanding and very lenient about the question of repossession.  Because of the decline in the economy dragging on and on they have now started to repossess homes.  I do not want to be an alarmist, but, if this increase in the mortgage goes through, many more homes will be repossessed and those people will have to be rehoused in local authority housing, throwing a further burden onto the State purse.  The whole vicious circle is ludicrous.  It is appalling that the Minister and the Government cannot see what they are doing.  It is incredible that they are so out of touch with the real world.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday on behalf of the Government and supported by his back benchers in Fine Gael and Labour, a Minister introduced an increased VAT rate on footwear on the same day that one of our oldest footwear companies went to the wall, that is Clark's.  I am reluctant to single out a back bencher. There is one Labour back bencher who is a very nice man and works hard for his constituents in his own way.  Deputy Bell, wearing his other hat, is secretary of the branches dealing with the footwear industry on behalf of the Irish Transport and General Worker's Union.  With the other Labour members he traipsed up that central aisle and voted for a VAT increase on footwear and clothing.  We have the spectacle of one Government back bencher after another making statements decrying some Government decision and saying the Government should not have done this or that.  When it comes to voting in this House they would do anything to avoid facing the people in a general election.  Like mice they follow the whip and vote it through no matter how obnoxious the proposal is.  They are like pet mice.</P>
    <P>What about this Government and their attack on the old?  On budget day we had a budget that morning before the Minister got to his feet in this House. <Col N="1965" /> That was the increase in the price of coal, which is being further increased by the decision of the Minister to increase VAT on fuel.  VAT has been increased on fuel for the horticultural industry.  Admittedly they get it back after about a two month period, but the cash flow problems which are so horrendous in that industry are further exacerbated by the decision to increase VAT on fuel, that at a time when we hear various Ministers spouting about doing something about food imports.</P>
    <P>We have the further increase of 10p on the price of a gallon of petrol which more than negatives any benefit achieved by the TV price reductions and the VAT alterations.  Everybody who knows anything about the cross-Border trade knows that the first incentive is the differential in the price of a gallon of petrol.  There is a difference of 75p in the price of petrol on one side of the Border as against the other.  That is enough to make people cross the Border, and when they are there they do their shopping.  The Government live in a totally unreal world and are not aware of that.</P>
    <P>We have the damage caused to the motor industry with the increase of VAT on repairs.  We also have the problem of car tax increases.  All of these are chipping away at any benefits which there might have been in the budget.  They are depressing employment further in an already strained motor industry.  I call on the Government to take remedial action as they have done for some other interest groups over the past few days since the budget was introduced.  They should think again about the damage they are doing to the motor industry.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of the damage being done to the motor trade.  It goes right across the board in industry in Ireland generally.  In 1982, 80 per cent of all car batteries sold in Ireland were manufactured in the State.  By 1984 that figure had been reduced to 2 per cent to 3 per cent.  In 1982 there were seven major manufacturers of batteries in Ireland. Now two independent operators are sharing that 2 per cent to 3 per cent between them.  The companies who were operating <Col N="1966" /> here have pulled back into England and are now supplying the Irish market from their English factories and from the spare capacity within their English factories. This is the course of our industrial base today.  The Government are doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The income tax changes have been hyped up as being radical changes and major changes.  In a previous budget the Minister introduced a tax rate of 65 per cent.  There were cries from every sensible person in the country, including the Opposition, to the Minister to reconsider the stupid decision he had made.  The Minister reduced it to 60 per cent, which does not go half far enough to undo his own damage, and then described that as a radical change in the taxation structure. The actual turn out of income tax changes will be that the Minister will gain another £164.7 million this year.  His outturn for 1984 was £1.966 billion.  The outturn for 1985 &mdash; and these are his own figures &mdash; will be £2.131 billion, an increase of £164.7 million, and that is supposed to be a radical reform.</P>
    <P>As I asked the Taoiseach earlier, do the members of this Government live in the same world as the rest of us?  What is needed is a real radical reform, based on the proposals of the Commission on Taxation, which would come to grips with the income tax burden being carried by the PAYE sector and which would give a real incentive to employment and to those in employment to do overtime and shift work, because there is no incentive there today.  To try to sell this as a radical reform, which is merely tinkering with the existing system, is not sufficient and has been seen for what it really is over the last few days.</P>
    <P>Other speakers will deal with the other measures in this budget, but I want to come to what I call the &ldquo;altar list of the dead&rdquo; which was handed out yesterday and which purported to contain the cuts of £28.6 million.  There can be only three reasons why the budget figures should be changed.  First, the original figures were wrong and are now being corrected; second they were correct but there has been a political book-keeping exercise, <Col N="1967" /> or third actual cuts have taken place.  This list does not specify any of those reasons except I notice old age pensioners will suffer.</P>
    <P>For example, the Central Statistics Office show a reduction in non-capital expenditure of £620,000.  I do not want to be too critical of the Central Statistics Office, but they are the same people who lost £500 million, together with their Government, last year.  In my view this country can do without that £620,000 mentioned here.  The Revenue Commissioners are being cut by £1.874 million. It is not specified where these cuts will be made but we do not get any explanation of how this figure of £1.847 was reached. This is the Government who talk about catching tax evaders and putting extra customs men on the Border, but they are taking £1.847 million from this Vote.  This is another political book-keeping exercise. They are cutting public works and buildings by £1.68 million, again no explanation.  There are many jobs in the Office of Public Works because they have many contracts to fulfil.  One would not have expected that Vote to be touched. A cut of £500,000 will be made in the Vote for the Stationery Office.  We will all be writing on smaller paper.  This smacks of political book-keeping with no touch of reality about it.</P>
    <P>At a time when law and order is on the tongue of every person, when insurance companies are increasing premiums on household insurance because of the number of burglaries, when more and more old people are being attacked, the Garda Síochána are taking a cut of £847,000.  If there is one area in the country which should not be touched it is the Garda Síochána budget.  This is the Government which introduced one stage of the Criminal Justice Bill last year and since then have introduced the Animal Bill and others which put extra work on the Garda.  Yet they are cutting the force by £847,000.  They do not specify where these cuts will be made.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment will be cut by £3,084,000.  Again we are not told where the cuts will be made.  This <Col N="1968" /> Department has been short of funds for the last two years.  The potholes on our roads are a national joke.  Every local authority is in debt.  County managers do not know which way to turn to keep their operations going and this Government decided to cut the Department of the Environment by £3,084,000.  They do not say which services will be cut.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is being cut by £2.194 million. We are swamped with food imports. Our farmers have been faced with the problem of the super-levy because of the mishandling of this project by the Minister for Agriculture.  Instead of helping agriculture the Vote is being cut by £2.194 million.  The Department of Labour is nothing short of a scandal. Here £7 million is being raided from the levy designed for youth employment projects and handed over to the Department of Education.  This from a Government who set up the Youth Employment Agency and who now unscrupulously raid the fund to the tune of £7 million.  This Government are anti those in need and have reduced social welfare by £7.368 million.  They have done that at a time when social welfare payments failed to keep pace with inflation, and the damage this will do to families is incredible.</P>
    <P>This budget is a farce; it is a comedy of errors produced by a theatre of comics. This budget is to provide the funds for the operation of the Government on a yearly basis.  They have underestimated their figures, but that will come out later in the year when we have the August budget and the members of the Government have gone to Spain, France and other places, but they will probably leave a sucker of a Labour Minister behind to try to sell it, if they are still in power, which I doubt.  When one looks at this Government one wonders why they want to stay together.  Everybody I meet asks me when are we going to get them out.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this Government.  Take the Taoiseach with his lace-curtained JCBs.  He is hypnotised by all things British, from its education to its other system.  In two years during the operation of our Anglo-Irish relations, he had attempted to cosy-up to the British Prime <Col N="1969" /> Minister and has been rejected even from that questionable source on the pre-Christmas summit.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party heads a rabble who, like mice, follow their Fine Gael masters into the lobbies of the House no matter what anti-social or anti-family legislation is introduced. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is so incompetent that, even at a time when we held the Presidency of the EC, he delayed the only country who ever wanted to leave the EC from leaving for another month because he could not organise his business in this House efficiently. He also seems to spend most of his time making speeches which are aimed at securing the leadership of Fine Gael from the Taoiseach and, as was seen in the debate last night and the vote which followed, has shown a total disregard of the position of the Irish in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism presided over the single largest rise in unemployment in the history of the State.  The Minister for Defence thinks we should abandon our neutral status and join NATO.  The Minister for the Environment has left local authorities broke and is in the process of crippling the building industry to such an extent that they will march next week in protest.  The Minister for the Public Service laughingly calls on the people to work a day for Ireland and then, through his rose-tinted glasses, tells us on the same day as the announcement that there were 234,000 people unemployed &mdash;&ldquo;Ireland, you are looking good&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture must get the award as mathematician of the year in the EC for his carry on in regard to the super-levy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am entitled to relate my remarks to the budget which purports to give effect to the Estimates of the various Departments and I am entitled to talk about the office holders in the <Col N="1970" /> Departments concerned.  The Minister for Justice has flattered to deceive.  His halo has slipped and his influence in Cabinet is demonstrated by the fact that we have a cut in the Vote for the Garda Síochána at a time when law and order are falling apart.  We have a Minister for Social Welfare who has gone like a mad butcher at the Department of Health.  The Texas chain saw massacre has nothing on him.  The Minister for Communications, described in the House the other day as John Wayne, interfered in a vital area with a comment which was totally inappropriate on a recent tragedy in Ballyfermot.  I leave our youth to judge the Minister for Education.  The Minister for Labour allowed his levy fund to be raided and also allowed one man pickets to practically close down industries. There is no action or reform, and his only aim seems to be to take the leadership of the Labour Party from the present incumbent.</P>
      <P>We have a national fishing fleet of 400 boats but last year 12 of those were repossessed and BIM have taken a decision to repossess 40 more this year.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry does not seem to care, and he has not protected our fleet from the Spanish invasion.  Of course, by the time the Spaniards arrive there will not be a fleet left to keep them out.  Lastly we come to the Minister for Finance, &ldquo;the Duke of Hazard,&rdquo; who has produced a budget a day since last Wednesday.  It is time to call a halt to the charade that we have seen over the last two years of a Government clinging by their fingernails to power, ready to twist and turn, to duck and weave, to avoid facing the people. There are 234,000 people unemployed and the Government are doing nothing about them.  It is unfortunate that they did not have an opportunity to read the full rambling text of the speech which the Taoiseach made today because it would show them how out of touch he and the Government are with the real problems facing us.  It is time they got out to give the people an opportunity to elect a single party, Fianna Fáil Government to take the problems in hand and to solve them, showing concern for our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome some of the items in the budget.  Many problems face us in relation to business and unemployment which, unfortunately, has grown.  However, the Government recognise the problems which we face and are taking steps to correct them. The Government also recognise that the income tax structure must be changed and are doing this as well as reorganising the VAT system.  There are also improvements in social welfare.  I have called for certain action and changes as a result of representations from constituents who are going through difficult times and seek a boost and stimulant in order to generate more business.  It is very easy for Opposition speakers to make glib speeches about the economy.  We have made changes which they called for and which they did not implement when they had the power to do so.  The Government recognise that they cannot give in to easy pressure to borrow more money or to raise further taxation in order to pay for certain items. When we campaigned in 1982 we said that these practices would have to stop. The people gave us a mandate then and we are now well set on a course of recovery. It is a difficult task and will continue to be so, but the Government are committed to seeking reform and to gradually bringing about an improvement in the situation.  What have the Opposition proposed? They have criticised most items in the budget, but where do they think the money should come from for some of their proposals.  Do they want to borrow more money or go back to the catch all policies of 1977 when every voter was bombarded by the giveaway attitude which is largely the cause of most of our present problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must ensure that the facile solutions and easy options which Fianna Fáil are all too familiar with and which they will put to the people are rejected.  This Government made definite innovations in the budget in relation to income tax and went some way towards meeting the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Taxation.  That commission was set up in 1980 following complaints and <Col N="1972" /> dissatisfaction.  It recommended a single rate.  Unfortunately it is not possible to have such a system but we have taken steps in that direction.  We have increased the allowance under the 35 per cent rate and reduced the number of tax bands to three.  The crippling rate of 65 per cent has been reduced to 60 per cent but more must be done in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that many allowances have been increased.  However, the dependent relative allowance of £110 has remained static.  Considering that many people take an elderly relative or parent into their home and look after them perhaps an extra allowance could be given in this area.  If elderly people are put into homes it costs the State extra money.</P>
    <P>The VAT system has been restructured. The reduction in the rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent represents a positive boost for business.  I hope this will go some way towards reducing the large numbers of people who go across the Border to buy goods.  Perhaps the changes introduced in the budget will make such trips less rewarding.  The advantages of the reduction in and restructuring of the rates are immense. We all know that VAT on television sets and other electrical goods was penal.  I hope the changes in relation to point of entry will help traders.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate on newspapers was also reduced.  We have a large number of newspapers, both local and national.  The reduction in the rate for the hotel industry will prove a tremendous boost to tourism. People who come here on holiday spend money here.  We must ensure that they get good value.  They will then spread the word about how good Ireland is for a holiday.  I know that hoteliers are delighted about the change and will respond by giving good value and service. This is what people remember.  However, if, for example, they get good food which is badly served they will remember the country for the wrong reasons.  It was not possible to have a single rate but the changes in the system will go some way towards restructuring it and make for easier administration.</P>
    <P>As regards the construction industry it <Col N="1973" /> must be remembered that while VAT has been increased on certain items, over the next three years £420 million will be invested in roads.  This represents a major injection of public money and will result in work being provided with follow-on benefits for industry and so on.  As regards housing, a further grant of £750 has been allocated to first-time buyers. This brings to nearly £5,000 the money available to first-time purchasers of new houses.  I hope that at some future date the subsidy will be given to people buying secondhand houses.  Many people are prepared to make an effort to buy their own house.  Perhaps some system can be devised to reduce mortgage payments in the early years when people are finding it most difficult to cope.</P>
    <P>A person who surrenders his local authority house after three years will be given a sum of £5,000 to help him purchase a house.  This was an imaginative step and it will reduce the local authority housing lists.  It will also help the construction industry.  A person who is prepared to surrender a local authority house may receive a total sum of £9,750 to purchase another house.  Other groups in industry would be very glad if such encouragement were given to consumers to purchase their goods.  It is very easy for speakers to come into this House and call blandly for the abolition of VAT or a reduction of the rates, but they do not say where the Government will get the money other than further increasing the taxation burden.  In this budget the Government have lived up to their commitment to put more money into people's pockets.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the threshold for inheritance from one spouse to the other has not received as much publicity as it might have received.  What the Government are proposing is a significant move. Up to now many people found themselves faced with a massive tax bill, often at a time of distress to their family, and in many cases they have had to sell businesses or other assets to pay the tax.  What is being proposed will be of particular benefit to people whose spouse dies and who inherit pensions.  When pensions are <Col N="1974" /> capitalised and are taken into consideration with assets such as housing and other property, the total amount may be quite considerable.  What the Government have done in this area is valuable.</P>
    <P>I am glad that pensions have been increased for our senior citizens, and I hope that improvements will continue in future budgets.  While we have made considerable progress in the area of inflation we have to go further.  I welcome the provision to increase the amount of interest that can be earned tax free, and I hope this will be an encouragement to people to lodge money with building societies, banks and the post office.  They may do so now, secure in the knowledge that they can earn £100 interest without any tax being charged.  Perhaps in future the Government may be able to go further and help other investors.  In the recent past there have been attacks on old people in their homes and it appears that those guilty of such attacks knew in many instances that money had been kept in such houses.  I hope that citizens will keep only the minimum amount of money in their homes and will but the remainder in any of our financial institutions.  Apart from the safety factor, they will also earn interest on money lodged.</P>
    <P>A study has been completed on the proposed national lottery, and this will be considered shortly by the Cabinet.  I hope that the lottery will be a success and that it will get off the ground without too much delay.  I am not sure who will run it: probably it will be a combination of groups who will ensure it is run efficiently. A successful lottery could raise large sums of money to benefit sport and to provide recreational facilities.  We must ensure that the country gets the major benefit.  I hope that the people employed in the Hospitals Trust will be considered.  They have the expertise and they have the necessary outlets.  Despite adverse and incorrect comment, hospitals have benefited from the Hospitals Trust.  I am concerned about the 200 people involved, some of whom have approached me and who are anxious about their jobs.  I hope they will be considered <Col N="1975" /> in relation to the introduction of the new lottery.  There is little point in our introducing a national lottery while at the same time put those people in the unemployment queue.  I hope that the combination of interests, including the group I have mentioned, will get the lottery underway and benefit many people, particularly the young, in the matter of providing recreational facilities and so on.</P>
    <P>The racing industry and the related horse industry are major businesses that generate much employment.  I hope that the reduction for 20 per cent to 10 per cent will ensure that fewer people will be betting without paying the tax.  That will probably include a few of my colleagues here who, I am sure, will respond appropriately and pay what is due.  Important also is the reduction from 7.5 per cent to 6 per cent in the tax taken on the race track.  I hope that in the light of the forthcoming Killanin report the Minister will give consideration to where changes can be made in relation to this industry which involves large amounts of money and which might produce an even greater return in the years to come.  The racing board have recently been urging the computerisation of the tote, for example.</P>
    <P>Despite the major tax reform in this budget, we cannot be satisfied with the growing number of people who are unemployed. We must look at all the bodies who are at present involved in getting people to work and back to work.  We must consider our education system and the various bodies who provide courses to see if we can make better use of them. Some school leavers have made up their minds to go to university or to some of our other colleges and are able to get places there, but some are not too clear about what they want to do.  We all know people who have ideas and who would like to get some training or to get a job. We must look at the courses we are providing and at the follow-on to try to ensure that people who have completed courses can gain experience and find jobs. Liaison between AnCO and the IDA and <Col N="1976" /> other bodies must be furthered.  A person should not just be walked through an AnCO course and then told he has done his course and he must go out and find a job.  We must assist people to make contact with firms who can give them employment.  At times people become frustrated when, having attained a certain level of education, they find that there are no jobs for them.</P>
    <P>Just as important are people who have lost their jobs.  Such people have probably a greater commitment than the young school leaver.  They are married, they have young children, and possibly a mortgage is hanging over their heads.  We must look hard at what we are doing to ensure that as far as possible the difficulties in which they find themselves are alleviated.  At all times we must keep watch on what is happening to people who have been let go from their jobs. I have in mind particularly people who worked in Irish Shipping.  The State has a duty to see that if possible they receive alternative employment.  I understand that there is a proposal for some sort of co-operative movement providing a service related to shipping, to marine life and to other matters in which those people would have certain expertise.  I hope that the IDA can assist here.  In some cases pensions have been affected. I hope that as a result of the development of the national pension plan what has happened in relation to Irish Shipping in this regard will not be repeated.  People who have paid over many years into a pension fund found that fund was frittered away overnight.  I hope that despite legal technicalities and a liquidator being in charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope that something can be done in relation to this.  I am glad that the excise duties on most of what are known as the old reliables remain unchanged.  Referring to the innovative decision regarding whiskey I am glad that the Government recognise that the beer drinker had been left worse off <i>vis-á-vis</i> the spirit drinker.  I hope that the reduction in excise duty on whiskey has stopped money from going over the Border and also that it has been implemented without loss of revenue.</P>
      <P>The motorists have been hit in this budget by the increase in the price of petrol and by the road tax.  Many people depend on cars for many things and I hope that the motorist stands to gain the next benefit.  As I have said, it was not possible in this budget to have reductions all round because money must be found for the services the Government provide. It is easy to pick out a few items in the budget which satisfy and to criticise all the other items.  I welcome the provision of money for what I would call special items such as the establishment of the organisation to combat poverty.</P>
      <P>I am not 100 per cent sure what is intended in relation to that.  The proposal is that money be provided for research into the cause of poverty and other related items.  I would prefer to see the bulk of the money going directly to the poor and to the many voluntary organisations. If a group are to be set up I trust that the majority of the members will be practical people, people who will be aware of the problems as opposed to theorists.  We must ensure that any money spent in the area of combating poverty is channelled into those areas where the need is greatest.  Most of us know what the problem is and we must do our best to alleviate it.  We must assist to the greatest extent possible those voluntary organisations working in the area. One thinks especially of the Simon Community and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in that regard as well as the many other groups who bring so much help to the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced some radical reform in the area of taxation, but <Col N="1978" /> that is not as far as we intend going in that direction.  It is a start on the road to progress, to ensuring that people have more money to spend.  We had to devise a budget that would give a generous boost to the economy so that more jobs could be made available especially for our young people.</P>
    <P>All we have had from the Opposition is a negative and hypocritical response, but that is not surprising.  No doubt in the run up to the local elections in June, Fianna Fáil will produce some magical solution to the problems in the area of local government.  Prior to the 1982 election they abolished rates but now they do not agree with people having to pay water rates.  By the time of the next general election in 1987 we can be sure that the Opposition will produce some nice little publication which they might entitle <i>The Way Forward</i> but which we may expect will be the way backward for them, a publication on the lines perhaps of the economic plan announced by their leader yesterday, but in any event we may expect from them nothing more than simple and facile solutions.  We must be on our guard in respect of such soft options, of the easy money or the phoney money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget.  While much more will have to be done, the budget provides a major boost to the economy, but this Government intend doing a lot more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be difficult to analyse every detail of the various asspects of the budget but we can say that it represents many minuses but few pluses.  I regard it as a clinical budget, one arranged by those who have become known as the famous or, depending on one's point of view, the infamous handlers. The budget is designed for the purpose of soothing the electorate.  In recent months the popularity of the Coalition has fallen by between 13 to 16 points below the Fianna Fáil rating in that respect. However, while the budget was framed to soothe the electorate a study of it indicates that instead of giving, it takes away very subtly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> The immediate media reaction to the budget was good, but since then the figures have been checked and the glitter removed with the result that the euphoria has faded in one short week.  The budget will not help anyone and it will not be of any benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the reorganisation of the VAT system.  During the past two years particularly general dissatisfaction was expressed with the VAT system, and it was clear that its impact on the economy was devastating, especially in the terms of the loss of trade. The black economy has been thriving on a scale never witnessed before and the extent of spending by our people outside the State has left in its wake a trail of devastated traders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the 35 per cent rate, but I would remind the House that the higher level was introduced by the Minister in the previous budget.  At that time we emphasised the repercussions that we foresaw that high rate having on the economy, and during the past year we have been proved right.  The abolition of the high rate is an admission on the part of the Minister that it was a mistake in the first place.  However, it is not honest for speakers on the Government side to claim credit for the abolition of something that was imposed by their Minister.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the increase in the 5 per cent VAT rate, bringing that figure to 10 per cent.  This is relevant particularly to the construction industry, which we know is experiencing a disastrous time.  The VAT increase in this respect will have further devastating effects on that sector.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that the Minister did not give more favourable consideration to the various submissions he received from the construction industry.  Not only has the VAT on construction been doubled but in the two years since 1983, the VAT rate has increased from 3 to 10 per cent. That represents a shattering increase. The increase will seriously affect the cost of building schools, hospitals, roads and <Col N="1980" /> general infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a significant fall off in house building activity. This decline has been much more significant in the urban areas.  For example, the Dublin region has been very badly hit as a glance at the figures will show.  Private house building in 1983 in Dublin was at its lowest level since 1971.  There were a number of reasons for that decline, and these include a fall in the level of disposable incomes.  Disposable incomes have been falling considerably since 1981 particularly and there is no indication that this trend will be reversed this year. Indeed there is no indication that it will be reversed in the future, a view put forward by the Government in terms of their national plan.  The fall in the real level of tax benefits and housing subsidies and the decline in the real value of tax relief on mortgage interest are other areas that have contributed greatly to the fall off in private house building.</P>
    <P>Such factors, too, as the widening gap between loans available and house prices, a factor attributable to such items as cost increases as a result of VAT, levies on development, electricity costs, PRSI and so on, have all contributed to the fall off in moneys available and consequently to the fall off in house building.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Government's current policy as outlined in the budget, the future for the building and construction industry is very bleak.</P>
    <P>The NESC have forecast a need for between 26,000 and 32,000 new houses each year between the years 1981 and 1999, but it is forecast now that due to a declining demand and increasing cost factors, the supply of private sector housing is likely to fall further and could be as low as 15,000 per annum in the future. This will create greater problems and a greater demand for local authority housing not only in the urban areas but in the rural areas.  The current level of local government house building would have to be increased by at least 3,500 units a year to accommodate that demand.  This would mean additional public capital expenditure of a sum in the region of over <Col N="1981" /> £100 million on local authority housing alone.</P>
    <P>The building industry is in a deplorable state.  Almost 60,000 workers have lost their jobs in the past few years and the possibility of a levelling off in unemployment in that industry is now remote.  I do not understand why the Minister did not put more capital into that industry rather than imposing further penalties which will result in less activity in that industry with the prospect of greater unemployment. If current policies continue the decline in investment and in employment will continue in 1985 and the prospects of recovery in subsequent years are bleak.</P>
    <P>In looking at this budget we must consider the Government's approach to fiscal policies on which they came into office in 1982.  It will be recalled that the Coalition Government were elected on the basis of fiscal rectitude, a four year plan was introduced and the deficit was to be phased down to £750 million.  We were also told that the Government would provide a climate in which there would be a greater incentive to work, that they would strengthen the value of the pound and at the same time reduce the burden of excess Government spending.  It is relevant to reflect on the present circumstances in the light of those promises made in the autumn of 1982.  When campaigning around the country the Taoiseach was portrayed as the honest broker, the man who would be the saviour of the economy.  We were told that borrowings had been so high that the country was on the brink of financial collapse, that our creditors were seriously concerned and that foreign bankers could not extend further credit to us.  The Coalition Government were elected on that platform. It must not be forgotton that the major plank of that platform has miserably collapsed.</P>
    <P>Since then we were presented with <i>Building on Reality, 1985-87</i>.  That document was presented only a few months ago and already it is totally out of date. The forecast contained in that document has gone totally astray and the financial targets have been abandoned.  It will only be a short time before the average person <Col N="1982" /> realises that he has been conned by this Government.  The so called imaginative reform budget has been bought with increased foreign borrowing.  The current budget deficit will represent 7.9 per cent of national income in the year ahead compared with 7.1 per cent of last year's. That represents almost 11 per cent off target.  That is a serious reflection on the three year strategy announced in the document <i>Building on Reality</i>, which also forecast that the deficit would fall to 5 per cent of GNP by 1987.  It is now clear that the target cannot be achieved despite all the penny pinching, the belt tightening, the sacrifices imposed on the workers, and the massive unemployment. During the past few months there has been an increase of about 9,500 people unemployed.  Foreign borrowing has not been reduced as promised but has increased.</P>
    <P>From this perspective the budget must be regarded as a failure.  A newspaper editorial after the budget last week claimed that the Minister was stretching it too far when he said that this budget had been designed to have the maximum possible beneficial effect on unemployment. Within 24 hours of the budget the latest unemployment figures were released. There was a staggering increase in the numbers unemployed of 9,600 people in one month.  The official unemployment figure is now 234,000.  That is a national disgrace, a scandal.  If the Government were really concerned about unemployment an emergency would be proclaimed and action would be seen to be taken.</P>
    <P>The first and most important priority of any Government is the creation and maintenance of jobs.  This will be a formidable task as we have a very young population and between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs will be required each year during the eighties and to the next decade simply to prevent unemployment rising.  This task must be tackled.  It is a tragedy that this budget has done nothing to tackle it in a serious manner.  The consequences of this budget will create further unemployment in the building and construction industry, the motor industry and in many other firms that are <Col N="1983" /> already on the brink of collapse.</P>
    <P>Many business are being forced into closure by severe tax demands and the unrelenting attitude of the Revenue Commissioners in their pursuit of too many firms in the private sector.  That is continuing to be a major factor in more closures.  What has the Minister offered as compensation to those who are out of work?  In his budget speech in relation to unemployment the Minister said that although it is projected that given moderation in pay developments employment should begin to pick up this year, special Government measures are needed to stop the growth in unemployment.  That was the understatement of the year.</P>
    <P>That is the understatement of the year. We all know that special measures are required and must be introduced if unemployment is to be solved, but what measures were provided in the budget?  There is no reference whatever to plans to create jobs or to assist companies in distress.  Indeed the Minister said that provision had already been made for major new employment and training schemes &ldquo;which will soon be under way&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came to office in 1982 they have been placing all their emphasis on training schemes for employment.  Such schemes are useless unless firm, permanent employment lies ahead on completion of training.  Training schemes have proved to be totally illusory and frustrating to many young people after three to six months in training. Then they find themselves again out in the streets with no jobs or prospects, no hope.</P>
    <P>It would be more beneficial if the Government were to concentrate some of their efforts on providing permanent employment not only for young people but for those who lost their jobs due to redundancies, men with families, with mortgages and other commitments. Now, the man aged 35 years or younger who loses his job has very little chance of obtaining alternative employment.  It is a sad reflection on society but first of all on the Government of the day.  There is <Col N="1984" /> no substitute for work, but the least the unemployed can expect is some financial recognition from the Government if they cannot provide jobs.</P>
    <P>What has the budget done for the unemployed?  An unemployed man with a wife in receipt of £61.40 a week from 11 July next will receive the very princely increase of £3.70, £1,85 per person.  If he has a child he will receive an extra 55p per week.  A man in the same circumstances but on unemployment assistance will receive £1.60 extra per week and an additional 45p per child.  We are told the budget will put money into everybody's pocket, but let us have a look at the increased expenditure for the type of person I have just referred to.</P>
    <P>First of all, we have VAT on footwear for the first time &mdash; an attempt was made in 1981 to do so but the Government collapsed on that issue.  Now they have introduced 10 per cent VAT on footwear and the VAT on clothing has been increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Coal, electricity and gas will all be dearer because of the VAT increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  Indeed, 24 hours before the budget was introduced there was a price increase of 55p on a bag of coal.  If a mother has to buy a pair of shoes for a child, at a probable cost of £15, she will pay an extra £1.50 because of VAT.</P>
    <P>For those lucky enough to have jobs the increased income resulting from the so-called income tax reforms will not mean any saving for lower paid workers. A family man earning less than £140 per week will not gain anything at all because it is more than likely that he is not paying tax because of various allowances.  However, he will have to pay the additional taxation on clothing, footwear, electricity, gas and other fuels.  If he is fortunate enough to be the owner of a car, which is necessary to take him to and from work, he will be caught by the extra 10p per gallon on petrol and the increased road tax.  We must bear in mind that nowadays a car is a necessity, not a luxury.  Therefore, the new taxes on the motorist is a further penalty on employment, on those who are working.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> According to the Minister, he will collect £155 million more from the PAYE sector this year.  Yet we are told that all taxpayers will pay less tax.  If full allowance is made for inflation in the next 12 months fewer people will be better off financially.  If anybody will benefit it will be those with higher incomes.  The lower paid workers are again caught for everything because they end up paying more and more.</P>
    <P>The number of U-turns by the Government increases daily.  In future, supposedly positive statements by the Taoiseach or his Ministers cannot be taken seriously.  It is common knowledge that the Government will do anything to hold on to office, that they will yield to any pressures in order to stay in power for as long as they can.  The policy outlined by the Minister for Finance in his 1983 budget has been buried well and truly. The policy in 1985 is to keep the Government afloat at all costs, irrespective of the cost to the economy or the people.</P>
    <P>The Government promised discipline, firm management, placing special emphasis on State finance, eliminating current budget deficits by 1987.  Two years later we have more than 60,000 extra people unemployed, the national debt has grown to £18.5 billion and we owe foreign banks £2 billion more than two years ago.  The total now owed is about £8 billion.  Arising from a two-year policy of huge tax increases and belt-tightening, the end result is a bigger mess than ever before.  The attempts to camouflage that mess can be seen easily by the public as a PR exercise.  It will not create the environment to increase employment. The only proposed solution to the jobs crisis is the new VAT structure.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the VAT structure because it will make the system less difficult than the old complicated one.  It will be more beneficial to business people in particular.  It will be less expensive to administer.  The reduction in the VAT rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent will help to stem the flow of consumer money across the Border to only a very small extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit to increase the <Col N="1986" /> duty on petrol rather than to decrease it.  This will inevitably give even more encouragement to motorists, especially those living near the Border, to cross the Border and fill their tanks.  They will also be given the opportunity to do their shopping.  Unfortunately, that will continue the present difficulties and problems, with a resultant loss of trade and jobs in the State.  Businesses close to the Border, particularly, are seriously affected.  I must emphasise that anybody in business within a distance of from 20 to 30 miles of the Border is at a distinct disadvantage and has gained no benefits whatever. They are there for the take, as far as the tax collector is concerned, but there is nothing to be gained from the potential shoppers who daily pass them by.  It is deplorable that in the month of December something in the region of £3 million to £4 million per day was spent by shoppers outside this State.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is our greatest problem, and I cannot see any improvement whatever in the prospects of providing jobs for the 234,000 people now unemployed. On the contrary, many thousands more will be joining the job queues later this year, school leavers and those who will lose their jobs between now and then. We must provide jobs in the present climate and on the face of what has been produced by this budget, there is very little hope of this.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday, when the Minister was reading his speech to the House, there was a great demonstration of euphoria on the part of the backbenchers on the far side of the House.  This is very understandable, particularly in view of the deep depression that they had been in for some time now.  The Government backbenchers, as we all know, have been groping for some straw in the wind which would suggest a more favourable response to the Government from the electorate.  That euphoria has dissipated very rapidly, particularly over the weekend, when we had articles written by the various commentators, economic and financial, and also table showing the very minute savings as far as the PAYE sector <Col N="1987" /> were concerned.  It was clearly seen that the tax bands were just juggled about and the savings as far as PAYE workers were concerned were very minimal.  When one takes inflation into consideration there is absolutely no saving whatever.  Indeed, allowing for the anticipated inflation and the additional indirect taxation and so on, the worker will be worse off in 1985 than he or she was in 1984.</P>
    <P>As far as the latest unemployment figures are concerned, the Government must be shocked at the dramatic deterioration there.  The Minister will have to reconsider his whole attitude to the building and construction industry, as this is the area in which can be created the foundation, not only for halting the slide, but for starting to get people back to work again in large numbers.  It is incredible that the Minister should treat so badly the two sectors most seriously affected by rising unemployment &mdash; the construction and the motor industries. Before it is too late, he must move to rectify the irresponsible action of taxing their jobs even further.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the budget has provided for a reduction in the Public Estimate, totalling £28.6 million.  This is shown in a table under the heading &ldquo;Other&rdquo;.  This table was published yesterday, and it is obvious that at the time of the preparation of the budget either it had not been decided where those reductions would come from, or the Minister did not wish to show his hand at that stage as to which Departments the particular cutbacks would apply to.</P>
    <P>Major cutbacks during the last couple of years have caused severe hardship to many, particularly the less well-off, old and sick.  Hospitals all over the country are in dire distress, many now being forced to close down wards.  Essential services are seriously affected because of a shortage of money.  Many hospitals, particularly in the Dublin area, are sending sick patients home for weekends because there are not sufficient funds to pay for heating, lighting, food and medical care.  That is a dreadful situation to find oneself in.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> among a number of different Departments. As far as Social Welfare is concerned, there is provision here for a saving of £7.3 million.  What aspect of social welfare will be affected there? Where will those cutbacks come from? There is a major cutback in the Department of Justice, the Garda Síochána, prisons and the courts.  There is a major cutback on public works and buildings and on labour.  These are all areas which have suffered very seriously during the past two years.  If there are to be further cutbacks which the Minister had indicated in this document, will there be any hope whatever that these Departments can carry on?  We are faced in 1985 with further misery, hardship and unemployment and a state of hopelessness that will not do anybody any good.  This could have dire consequences of a nature which might not be reparable.</P>
    <P>Our health services are facing a major crisis and the taxpayers are at present paying over £950 million for a health service which is much less efficient and caring than it should be.  Health care here is very expensive because our system has inclined to be concentrated on reacting to illness by hospitalisation and drugs. The health service should be based very much on preventive care and the promotion of good health.  The Department should be developing a plan to meet the threats which are causing widespread illness.  We should also be developing our occupational health services, proper child care services and an overall programme to meet the specific needs and requirements of this period, to ensure greater health for everybody.  Particularly we should be educating people to look after their health and safety.</P>
    <P>It is also very significant that the cost of drugs has risen very much in recent years. Some of the contributing factors are the higher prescribing rate by doctors and the introduction by drug companies of new, high priced medicine and drugs.  Since the Minister for Health introduced severe cutbacks in the health services and disqualified the supply of certain drugs and <Col N="1989" /> Will this £28.6 million come out of the Health Estimates?  It has been divided medicines to medical card holders, doctors have been getting around that problem prescribing more expensive drugs for minor illnesses and complaints.  The Minister's policy, as have been most of his policies, is disastrous and very shortsighted. It has resulted in greater cost to his Department.  When one considers also the envisaged further cuts in the various Departments, it is very difficult to visualise how they will be in a position to continue during 1985.  The bigger Departments must be on the verge of collapse, and further cutbacks and further inflation during the year may make it absolutely impossible for them to function to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This budget has dealt a servere blow to education.  As a result, primary schools in particular, which have been on the verge of bankruptcy, in many cases will be unable to continue to maintain their present standards.  Most primary schools are now kept going by voluntary contributions by parents.  Many parents, in financial difficulties themselves, now contribute in greater numbers and amounts than ever before in order to ease the financial strain of primary schools.</P>
    <P>While there have been some good points in this budget there are many negative ones.  From the outset its presentation has amounted to a very large public relations exercise in an effort to regain popularity for this ailing Government. The Government should realise that they have failed the country miserably since coming into office and have not fulfilled any of their promises.  One must ask: how long can this be allowed to continue? One must ask also has the national plan introduced some months ago being buried.  I believe this budget has killed that plan published three months ago only and which set targets for the budget deficit and Exchequer borrowing requirements up to 1987.  The budget deficit was to fall to 5 per cent of GNP in two years time while Exchequer borrowing was scheduled to decline to 9.7 per cent of GNP.  In themselves these targets represented the scrapping of those contained <Col N="1990" /> in the 1982 Programme for Government under which the deficit was to be phased out altogether.  It is now clear that this latest national plan will follow the same path of previous documents and plans. No doubt there will be a new plan presented, that is, if this Government remain in office for a further length of time, which I doubt.  But if they do I anticipate another plan being presented which we will be told will constitute the solution of all our problems, such solution more than likely involving an additional year or two, the Government hoping to win in a general election in the meantime.  Three months only after the publication of their national plan Government figures have drifted from their planned targets.  One does not have to be an economist to ascertain that the figures outlined in that document were totally unrealisable, that there is absolutely no way its targets can be achieved or even nearly achieved.</P>
    <P>It is a short two and a half years since the Fine Gael and Labour Parties expressed horror at the state of the country's foreign debts and borrowings which at that time amounted to only half their present level.  We were assured then that the country was about to be taken over by foreign banks, that as far as credit worthiness was concerned Ireland's name was black in the eyes of international bankers and creditors.  Of course Fianna Fáil were then in office, hence the claims by the parties now in Government.  Borrowings and deficits are now the norm, are perfectly natural and respectable, constituting another of those U-turns by this Government.  The people will not be fooled by this public relations exercise of this Government who take the country from one serious situation into another without bringing about any solutions, leading to crisis after crisis, one piling on top of the other.  As long as the Government can stick together, hold on to the reins of office, they are determined to put the country's interests behind them.</P>
    <P>It will not be too long before the Government face the electorate, when they will have to place their lack of achievement before the people for perusal. When that time comes about it will <Col N="1991" /> be seen that, while this Government have endeavoured to purchase the electorate in this budget, they have reneged on all of their targets and figures.  Figures and targets appear to matter not at all, they are merely figures thrown in from time to time by the Taoiseach and Government in an effort to blind the ordinary person.  I can assure them that exercise will not work.  It has been my experience moving among the people at present that there is a fierce determination on their part, as they say, to get this crowd out.  I am constantly being asked &ldquo;When are you coming back into office?  When will we be given an opportunity to throw this Government out?&rdquo; This is the type of feeling around the country and particularly in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>These budgetary provisions have fooled nobody.  They have merely worsened the overall situation.  Within a very short time people will see, from experience, that they are even worse off than they were before.  Nothing is being done for unemployment, the prospects are bleak, little or nothing being done for the PAYE taxpayer, merely fiddling around with tax bands and allowances.  That will not work because in the final analysis people are gaining nothing, they continue to lose and, when they are given an opportunity, I can assure the Government that the loser on that occasion will be the Labour Party and Fine Gael, probably in that order.  It is sad to see the Labour Party stick so rigidly to the monetarist policies of this Government.  The Labour Party always had a very respectable name, always had the reputation &mdash; perhaps not quite true at times but nevertheless it existed &mdash; as a party who worked in the interests of the working classes.  We must ask: what has happened over the past two years?  Fine Gael monetarist policies have been latched onto by the Labour Party to the detriment of the working classes.  When the next election takes place I have no doubt but that there will be a change of Government, indeed a huge change with numbers sitting on this side of the House very much fewer in <Col N="1992" /> comparison with the situation obtaining.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate that this budget has done nothing whatsoever for the unemployed, for the taxpayer, the business sector and, above all and most seriously, nothing for our economy.  We continue to move backwards, and the sooner we have a change of Government and policies that Fianna Fáil only can introduce the better for the country and its people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy V. Brady I was almost convinced that he believed some of the things he was telling us, especially with regard to the call he claims he has from his constituents that there be a general election shortly, that this Government should be thrown out and that that would constitute the resolution of all the country's problems.  I should hate to disillusion Deputy V. Brady or anybody, but I would hazard a guess that the electorate are hardly convinced themselves that what he tells the House is true.  Past experience will enable the electorate to look back to what happened on previous occasions and come up with a logical answer, that while everything in the garden may not be as rosy as we would all like, while everything might not go as we would want, that times generally are hard, by and large people will be prepared to give recognition to effort and to support a Government attempting to do the best possible job under very difficult circumstances.  I have said before&mdash;and this applies to all Members of this House &mdash; we should set some kind of realistic level of anticipation or expectation in the minds of the electorate. There is no sense in deluding them or ourselves into believing that situations can be changed overnight by spurious suggestions as to how our problems might be solved.  Deputy Brady said the Government were determined to hold on to the reins of office at any cost.  I do not think any Government can hold on to the reins of office at any cost.  I do not think they would be thanked by the electorate for attempting to do that.  It is totally unfair and ridiculous for anybody to suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few months we heard <Col N="1993" /> calls for extra expenditure, lower taxation, selective tax cuts and borrowing for productive purposes.  We heard calls for an extra £200 million to be spent on capital works.  These are all very laudable and they are the kind of things the Government would like to be able to do at any given time.  How many of those targets are attainable?  How many of them are realistic?  We should explain to the electorate in unemotional terms the facts as they are and the difficulties facing the country, the difficulties facing not only the people but also the politicians in getting the message across to the electorate as we see it.  We are not doing justice to ourselves or to the people we represent if we try to misrepresent the case.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a passing reference to some of the passing references which have already been made.  We must not attempt to build up people's expectations. That does nothing for politics and it does nothing for the people to whom we make promises.  We would be doing more for ourselves if, instead of building up expectations, we united to tell the people the true position and let them make up their own minds as to where they think the country is going and where we should be going.</P>
    <P>On the question of charges about national handlers presenting good PR cases and so on, I was a bit alarmed of late to hear sounds coming from the Opposition benches to the effect that we might reconsider our position within the EC.  I sincerely hope that is not about to be trotted out to placate the electors in times of financial stringency.  We would not be doing ourselves any great service by doing that.  Our colleagues in the EC would not thank us for those kind of antics.  It is not sufficient to say other member states successfully or otherwise renegotiated their terms of accession.  I hope we will not be treated to that kind of public debate at election time which might seek to suggest to an unsuspecting public that there were other ways of getting funds apart from taxation, or borrowing, or hard work, or addressing ourselves to the task in hand.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budget.  It is progressive. <Col N="1994" /> It is incentive-based.  It is the kind of budget that is required if we are to pick ourselves up and move along the road to economic recovery.  It is the kind of budget many people on the Opposition benches have been calling for over the past number of months without going to the extremes they were suggesting.  The Government and the Minister for Finance have done a very difficult job, that of balancing the books on the one hand and, on the other hand, giving to the workers and the business sector some recognition for their efforts, and pointing out the road forward.  I did not say the way forward.  The budget gives recognition for effort and it proposes to chart a course which is carefully costed.  That is very important.  We have had too many experiences in the past where courses were charted and were not accurately costed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>When it was found that they were not accurately costed they tried to blame somebody else, to blame the Opposition, to blame changes in Government, to blame the fickleness of public opinion.  The Government had to get the national finances in order and to establish a trend, which I think they did.  This was very difficult to do.  Obviously these are not policies to which the public will respond with wild enthusiasm.  No one would expect them to do that.  The Government persisted in their task and they have now reached a juncture where they can safely say that they are moving forward positively and progressively in an effort to provide for all the people economic and social stability.  Those elements are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is linked directly to the plan <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The next budget and the one after it will also be linked to that plan.  It is very good from the point of view of the country that the Government decided to produce a medium term plan, to produce facts and figures which people can look at and examine over a period of two, three or four years, and make up <Col N="1995" /> their own minds as to whether or not the targets are attainable and the plan is feasible.  In the past plans have been put before the people and the people have looked at them.  At first sight they seemed plausible enough but, under closer scrutiny, they failed miserably.  This is a vast departure from that type of planning.</P>
    <P>We should try to get away from the theme of many speeches emanating from the Opposition side of the House over the past few days and months expounding the theory of continued doom and gloom. It was necessary to impart to the people these stark realities.  That was the Government's responsibility.  It is not necessary to go on endlessly beating our breast and tearing our hair and talking about how bad the situation is and how bad it will be.  We must become a little more positive.  Instead of saying how bad things are, we should ask the question: could they have been much worse?  They would have been much worse had the corrective measures not been taken when they were.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to put forward proposals for changing the course of economic policy.  It is another thing to provide the people for whom we speak with a ray of hope which is necessary if we are to encourage them to support the institutions of the State.  I want to dwell on that for a moment.  This is very important particularly from the point of view of young people.  There is no sense in telling young people: &ldquo;There is nothing in this country for you.  We cannot save you.  We can do nothing whatever for you.&rdquo;  If we tell them that, they will desert us and they will desert the institutions of the State.  They will desert this House and everything we stand for.  We will do ourselves irreparable damage if we pursue that course.  People need hope.  They need to be able to rely on the institutions of the State to provide for them what they regard as being necessary to ensure their future.</P>

      <P>The organisation and training of the Defence Forces are excellent and I am satisfied that the forces are competent to deal with the various tasks entrusted to them.  Within the overall financial resources available, the Defence Forces keep abreast of modern technology and have the necessary resources to enable them to carry out their various roles.</P>
      <P>Information in considerable detail on this matter generally is given to the House on the occasion of the debate on the annual Defence Estimate.  In that connection I would invite attention to my statement of 27 June 1984 on the Defence Estimate 1984, volume 352, columns 910 to 929, inclusive.</P>

      <P>Have the Defence Forces any special training, and if so what is it, to enable them to deal with the eventuality of a nuclear attack either on this country or an adjoining country and the presence of radioactive material in the atmosphere?  What is the position in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally different question.  The State's response to nuclear threat is provided by the Civil Defence force.  That response is based on a certain hypothetical scenario to deal with fallout arising from a nuclear explosion elsewhere. The response to deal with that hypothesis is adequate and in training exercises has shown itself to be entirely satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister made any allowance in the coming year for recruiting into the different arms of the <Col N="1997" /> Defence Forces and to allow for re-enlistment? Has he made any attempt to provide for the extra batallion that might be sent to Lebanon?  If re-enlistment is not allowed, this will cause great difficulties with extra duties at home.  Does the Minister feel that the Navy and the Air Corps have the potential to man fully the fishery protection vessel that will be needed for naval and air surveillance?</P>

      <P>It deals with the development of the armed forces and I hoped that might have engaged the Minister's attention.  Has he given any thought to the idea that many idealistic young people would be prepared to give a year or two to the service of their country if that was possible?  That would be highly desirable in the present unemployment situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the capacity of the Air Corps and the Naval Service to discharge their obligations under the fishery protection laws, I am satisfied they have full capacity and that the new vessel is fully manned.  There was a special recruitment to the Naval Service before Christmas to deal with the extra personnel.  The Air Corps also got recruits before Christmas. It is hoped that enlistment will take place during the year not just to keep pace with wastage but to go slightly ahead.  I agree with Deputy Power that it would be nice to devise a scheme whereby idealistic young men could be given the opportunity to serve for a year in the Defence Forces but I imagine this would give rise to significant financial and administrative complications and the military value of just one year's service might be minimal. However, it is something that could be kept in mind.</P>

      <P>I hope my question comes within the scope of the question. Would the Minister tell us whether in the Army there has been established a special unit for dealing with exceptional cases <Col N="1998" /> like hijacks, kidnappings and outrages of that sort?  The Minister is aware that other armies in Europe and elsewhere have developed special crack units who can be called up to deal with this type of situation.  I do not want the Minister to disclose any confidential information, and I am sure he would not, but perhaps he would be able to give an assurance that in the unfortunate event of one of these incidents happening in our territory we would have special provisions for dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that an NCO who served for 37 years in the Defence Forces and had a 31 years pension has that pension reduced to a 21 years pension on reaching the age of 66 years; and if he condones this reduction of £80 per month in the Army pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes soldiers' pensions consist of three elements: first, basic pension, second a long service increment for each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years and, third, an additional increment in respect of each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
      <P>The basic pension and the long service increment are paid to the pensioner during his lifetime.  However, the additional increment terminates when the ex-soldier reaches the age prescribed for a contributory old age pension or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  The additional increment would, however, continue to be paid if, without his own default, the ex-soldier fails to qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that when this period of service was completed by this soldier he was not under the impression that he got an increment but a pension for services rendered to his country?  He felt this pension should continue for the rest of his life.  Does the Minister agree that a soldier who gave 37 years to the service of his country merits equal treatment with the judge who has given five years service?  One has given 37 years service on the field of battle and the other gave five years on the bench. Does the Minister not think this situation should be changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The analogy is inapplicable and is not accurate.  A retired member of the Defence Forces does not suffer any reduction, it is merely a substitution by the State of one pension for another.  When he reaches 66 years of age he gets the contributory old age pension instead of what has been a long service increment up to then.  There is no reduction in his pension position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>A major extension of the Ombudsman's remit is being effected from 1 April 1985.  This extension includes health boards and local authorities. The Ombudsman has informed me that, in this connection, it is likely that his staff will need to frequently visit regional locations.  He has also told me that, in the light of his experience of the extended remit and in pursuance of his statutory responsibility for deciding appropriate procedures for conducting his investigations, he will keep under very close review the most suitable arrangements to facilitate those making complaints to him.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that the Ombudsman, because of his special role, should operate in close proximity to the people; I know that the Ombudsman, too, shares this view.  The Deputies may be assured, therefore, that, in conjunction with the Ombudsman, I will play my part in ensuring that this objective is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A regional dimension to the Ombudsman's operations could take a number of forms, ranging from that <Col N="2003" /> envisaged by the Deputies to an arrangement, which I have suggested previously to the Ombudsman, whereby he and his staff could visit different locations at regular, well-advertised and designated times.  Experience of his extended remit will help to indicate the best arrangements which should apply in each region including the north east.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister generalised in his reply, I should like to ask him if he accepts that the north-east region requires an office of the Ombudsman in view of the desperate need for jobs in Dundalk, allied to the fact that it is the biggest town in the country?  For those reasons, does the Minister not accept that it would be an ideal location for the provision of such an office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that the north-east is a very important region but the Deputy must realise that the office of Ombudsman has been in existence now for just one year.  In the Dáil debate of 4 December last year and, earlier, on 25 October 1983, I expressed a personal view to the effect that I would like to think that, in time, there might be regional offices for the Ombudsman or perhaps even the appointment of regional Ombudsmen to deal on a regional basis with matters relating to the regions.  The operation of the Ombudsman's office has been very successful.  We have placed upon him now the requirement of a major extension of his remit from next April into local authorities, health boards, Bord Telecom and An Post.  Experience of the operation of that service will dictate the pace at which the regionalised concept can emerge.  There is provision already for the Ombudsman to pay travelling expenses to people who come from rural areas to his office if he feels that there is hardship involved in bearing their own costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that, at present, public representatives are doing much of the work that is relevant to the office of the Ombudsman and <Col N="2004" /> would he agree that the extension of the activities of the Ombudsman to the regions would result in a lot more time being available to TDs to get on with enacting legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I expressed that view in both of the debates to which I referred.  I should like to think that perhaps initially the Ombudsman might consider either himself or his staff going to regional locations on a preadvertised, designated basis.  I hope it will be possible for the Ombudsman, with his extended staff this year, to introduce that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the success of the schemes in the Civil Service, the Government are in favour of extending the career break and job-sharing schemes to the public sector.  A commitment to this effect is given in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Consequently, I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to arrange for the introduction of both schemes in other areas of the public sector.  Schemes of career breaks have already been introduced in the health and local authorities areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister's intention to do that, will he in <Col N="2005" /> general seek a major increase in this type of activity and will he encourage to a more urgent extent, greater mobility between the public and private sectors? Perhaps the Minister can also tell me how many extra people might be interested in this scheme.  Is there any indication as to the amount of interest in the public sector as opposed to the Civil Service itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are making every effort to encourage the concept of mobility between the public and private sectors and any help which Members of the House could give in identifying private sector firms who might be prepared to participate in an exchange of staff would be very welcome.  It is not possible to gauge the level of interest in the public sector beyond representations which are made from individuals or through Members of the House to me. I suspect that interest in both of these schemes will be very high if one bases it on the interest shown in the Civil Service during the period of less than a year since it was first introduced there.  I should like to think that it will be generally successful and that it will make an impact both on career development and employment opportunities for those who replace the persons who opted for a career break or for job sharing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be slight confusion here.  The Deputy seems to be referring more to the staff exchange scheme.  The question relates to people taking a career break for whatever reason.  Some have gone into private sector employment, pursued further education, travelled or assumed domestic responsibilities.  Job sharing allows people to work within the Civil Service <Col N="2006" /> and, hopefully in the future in the public service, on a half time shared basis.  There is also a separate exchange scheme which the Deputy may be interested in and which we are anxious to encourage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the announcement made and the encouragement the Minister is prepared to give to this very laudable scheme.  It does not appear to be implemented at Civil Service level.  I know of a specific case which arose last week where a nurse in the Army Nursing Service sought a career break to enable her to nurse in North Africa for some years.  She could not be given any guarantee that she could return to her post as soon as her stint of service abroad was over.

      <P>Figures relating to these schemes are compiled on a quarterly <Col N="2007" /> basis.  The most recent figures available show that as at 31 October 1984, 414 staff had been granted career breaks and 86 staff, equating to 43 posts, had begun job-sharing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme provides that when a person opts for a career break their post is filled.  The introduction of the scheme is two fold: to allow people mobility to test out some other aspect of life outside the Civil Service and also to provide employment opportunities.  The overall size of the Civil Service remains unchanged because in the vast majority of cases those who opt for a career break or job sharing would not have done so if they could not if they so desired come back into the Civil Service at some future time.  When they indicate their intention to return, if there is a vacancy they will be taken in at the grade at which they left; but otherwise they will be taken in at the next lowest grade.  They would then wait to fill a post which falls vacant at the appropriate level.  The overall size of the Civil Service will not be increased.</P>

      <P>In so far as the question relates to appointment to the Civil Service, which is my concern, the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, requires that appointments must be effected in <Col N="2009" /> accordance with open competitive examination held by the Civil Service Commissioners. Certain subordinate appointments, such as messengers, are exempt from that requirement and selection in such cases is effected through the National Manpower Service.  Any appointment to the Civil Service would, therefore, have to be made in accordance with these procedures.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with an unusual and different situation where a company owned by the Government was put into liquidation by them.  There must be some Government responsibility towards the staff of the company other than to say that there are normal procedures which must be followed.</P>
      <P>I am making a plea to the Government to be of some assistance to the staff who have lost their jobs in Irish Shipping.  If the proposal in the Deputy's question is unsuitable, perhaps some other way could be found to assist them.  The Government owned this company and were the employers.  Does the Minister agree that the Government have a responsibility to make some effort to find employment for the employees or to make some other arrangement for them?</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy with the former staff of Irish Shipping, which was a public sector rather than a public service company, who are now out of employment as a result of management decisions taken by the company.  We must protect the concept that appointments to the Civil Service are based on merit and all those who apply must believe they have an equal chance of being appointed.  If some special provision is made for one group there would be objections from others who would feel that one group was given preferential treatment at the expense of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that for technical reasons it would not be feasible, not for financial reasons.  The scheme undertaken in 1981 is about to be concluded at a cost of £440,000.  The technicalities involved would not allow for what is proposed by the Deputy because of the nature of the land.  It could also undo some of the good done by the creation of this new pier at a cost of nearly £500,000. The technical advice I have got is that it would cut down on the berthage space.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider the provision of some kind of slipway which is necessary at every small port?  Will he ask his officials to come back with a report on another type of slipway that would fit in with the development work now proceeding?  Because the Office of Public Works are on the site at the moment the cost of providing the <Col N="2012" /> slipway would be much less now than it will be when it is provided in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I agree that the cost would be much less now than if it were to be provided in two or four years time when these people will have left the site. This project was undertaken after long consultation with the fishermen involved and no request for a slipway surfaced until the matter was raised in this House last November.  During consultations regarding this project the fishermen never asked that this facility be provided.</P>

I have said that when consultations were going on regarding the major scheme this matter was not mentioned.  I took Deputy Conaghan's request seriously and had it investigated. The technical advice is it would not be feasible, that it would do harm to the present structure and would cut down on the berthage area available.</P>

      <P>In view of the wholesale dumping of fish and the scarcity of food in other parts of the world, will the Minister tell the House if any serious attempt has been made by the EC to find some better use for this valuable food rather than continuing with this dumping?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of efforts that were made during our Presidency of the EC in relation to the distribution of surplus food to Third World countries, and in particular north-east African countries such as Ethiopia and the Sudan.  There is a problem here in relation to fish in particular.  Because of the perishable nature of the commodity it is very difficult to provide for transportation and the technical problems that arise in relation to freezing and so on.  With the best will in the world it would be difficult unless one went into long term planning to provide for the disposal of the fish through these avenues to this destination.  We are aware of the problem. I accept that it does not sound morally right to dump fish when people in the world are starving but there are serious problems in getting it to the people who need it.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the dumping of herring in the Celtic Sea which reached a high level in early January.  Herring fishing in the Celtic Sea is carried out under licence in accordance with rules laid down by the Celtic Sea Management Committee which is a committee representative of all interested groups in the area.  There was a problem in early January in that the expected marketing outlets did not materialise and hence the fish was withdrawn from the market unsold.  I have been in touch with the committee in regard to the general management of the fishery and have arranged to meet them in the next few weeks to discuss the problems.  I am glad to say that the incidence of dumping of fish in the area is now much reduced.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the fact that the dumping of herring was confined mainly to fishermen fishing out of Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East and that it seemed to be confined to fishermen in the south east rather than around the coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is that the dumping took place in the Celtic Sea because of the level of herring fishing there.  It was because of the volume of herring available, the extent of fishing that took place and the lack of outlets. The position was that trawlers came in. They were expecting Klondykers to arrive but they did not arrive.  That precipitated the dumping to an enormous degree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Celtic Sea fishery is not owned by the south east fishermen. It is an asset owned by fishermen of this country.  I cannot stop outside people <Col N="2015" /> from coming in there and if they upset the market at local level that is a problem that is faced and dealt with by the management committee in the area which is representative of south east fishermen and other interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that in order to keep some kind of equilibrium each trawler around the coast should have equal access to a market to which the trawler owner subscribes? Is the Minister aware that a marketing board was set up under the chairmanship of his ministerial colleague, Deputy D'Arcy?  Is he aware that the Minister, Deputy D'Arcy went to Kilmore Quay shortly before this and promised that the luggers would come in and take the fish from Kilmore but that did not happen.</P>

      <P>I suggest that is a somewhat different question.  It was not the Kilmore Quay lugger that caused the problem but the Klondyker that was to come for other trawlers but that did not arrive in time.  The market is not good at the moment for herring and any upset in the market has serious effects all along the line to the producer.  That is what happened in this case.  I took it upon myself to arrange for a meeting with people in my Department and the management committee and the matter was resolved amicably at that stage.  I have not heard of any problems since then so I must assume that things are going quite well down there at the moment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that for such small quantities of fish &mdash; by national standards a small quantity of fish was involved in Dunmore East at that time &mdash; we should not depend on foreign freezer vessels to take them? Secondly, would he accept that the boats which we are expecting to come, and which I agree caused the dumping, did not come for the benefit of the Irish fishermen?  They came here because no herrings were available elsewhere.  I am asking the Minister if every effort will be made to ensure that these fish can be taken ashore and that we can get to the markets that these other countries are selling to.  Furthermore, let me suggest to the Minister that it is not absolutely necessary to have freezer ships to preserve herrings.  Does the Minister accept that the old, traditional method, the first method of preservation for herrings was salting?  If we are interested and not just paying lip service to helping people in the Third World, this is a golden opportunity. Only three ingredients are necessary &mdash; barrels, salt and the raw material, herring. The Minister might consider this for some time in the future.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot change the market overnight, but he might consider this for the benefit of the Third World during the next 12 months or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the total value of fish imported in 1983 and 1984; the proposals his Department have for the improvement of the marketing of fish within the country; if he will agree that there is far greater scope for marketing of fish in Britain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The total value of fish imported in 1983 was £27.1 million and £24.5 million for the first 11 months of 1984.  The bulk of these imports consists of prepared or preserved fish.</P>
      <P>The promotion of the marketing of fish on both the home and export markets is dealt with by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in association with the fish trade.  The board have recently reviewed their markets promotion strategy with a view to expanding exports of fish and fish products and to increasing home consumption. In order to enable the board to carry out this development programme an additional £350,000 has been allocated to them by the Government for the current year.</P>
      <P>Exports of fish to Britain were valued at £14.3 million in 1984.  Good outlets exist there for white fish and shellfish which are surplus to Irish home market requirements although the home market provides a higher return to fishermen. Landings of pelagic fish account for the vast bulk of all Irish fish landings and these fish are exported mainly to markets in Africa and mainland Europe where market outlets are better than in the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that not sufficient finance is made <Col N="2019" /> available to BIM, the marketing body, to find markets throughout Europe and all parts of the world?  Would he accept that it is not sufficient for an industry such as the fishing industry to have one office based in Paris for all of Europe?  Would he give serious consideration to co-ordinating with the personnel in CTT offices throughout the world?  We have numerous CTT offices and this would be an opportunity to marry in with the various other offices.  There is tremendous potential throughout the world. Despite the fact that we have sufficient fish around our coast to supply these markets, now Europe is telling us that we cannot fish them.  I hope that the Minister will use his power of veto there and ensure that we can increase the quotas. It is sad that we have the fish, we can sell them, but Europe will not allow us to fish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be delighted to hear that I have already taken steps to co-ordinate the marketing effort with CTT.  Secondly, under the national plan an additional £480,000 is being made available for fish market development and exploratory fishing in 1985.  This brings the total expenditure on promotional work to £685,000, the highest in the history of BIM.</P>

      <P>Dealing with the home market, could the Minister tell the House if a grant which was payable to the ICOS for an officer of the ICOS to organise and help co-operatives in organising marketing and matters of that kind is still being paid and if any assessment has been made in relation to the promotional work done by that gentleman regarding the fishing industry?  He is a well known public figure.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate how many co-operatives he has helped to organise and what help he has given to the industry since this grant was made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the information in relation to what the Deputy is asking <i>vis-à-vis</i> this officer.  The development of the home market area will absorb <Col N="2020" /> £260,000 of that £685,000.  We have set specific targets in relation to increasing consumption at home.  They represent an increase of 0.4 pounds <i>per capita</i> per year for the next four years.  The current level of consumption is 12.8 pounds <i>per capita</i> and we have plans to increase that to 13.2 pounds <i>per capita</i>, which is quite low.  So it is a conservative target, but traditionally our fish consumption level has been low.  There are a variety of reasons for that but I shall not go into those now. Irish people consume about one-quarter or one-fifth of the amount that would be consumed by the Japanese, for instance, and about one-third of what would be consumed by the Spanish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that in the past year we have imported fish to the value of £27 million, mainly of the processed variety. As an island nation we should be well able to provide the product ourselves. In view of the unemployment situation, would the Minister consider making a detailed list of the fish imported with a view to interesting co-operatives and other companies in the manufacturing and processing areas to substituting those imports?  Is it not disappointing that we import so much fish and fish products? Surely this is an ideal area for the creation of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is potential in that area but the figure may be somewhat misleading in that parts of <Col N="2021" /> it would refer to landings from Irish registered boats at places such as Derry in the North.  Such landings are transported by road to Killybegs and other processing plants in Donegal, but it is included for the purpose of arriving at figures for imports.  They are landings by Irish trawlers which are used in this country as raw material for Irish processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would those landings constitute a major part of the figure given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They would account for possibly 20 per cent of the total figure, but we are still talking about a fairly substantial sum, which includes figures for salmon, white fish and other species such as prawns and shrimps.  We are exporting somewhat different species. For example, the prawns we export are bigger and more expensive in the world market.  That kind of deal is a net profit for us.  We are using the less popular ones, which are imported.  Likewise, we are exporting salmon, but we are importing tinned salmon because we do not have canning facilities here.  I agree that there is potential.  However, in case anyone should get the idea that we should be processing every pound of fish we land, that would not be a feasible proposition simply because we have fresh fish and whole fish markets which we should supply also.  There is room for expansion. At present I am dealing with various inquiries from potential investors in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the undesirability of giving vent to frustration and publicising an air of doom and gloom, and the effects that this could have on the morale of the people.  The people obviously look to the institutions of the State, the politicians, to show them the way.  That is understandable since the politicians are supposed to know what lies ahead by virtue of their budgetary projections.  We have reached an undesirable stage in the sense that a great number of commentators spend a lot of time telling the people that the country is sunk and that there is no hope.  That attitude can do irreparable damage to the morale particularly of young people. They look to us for an indication as to what the future holds for them and if we <Col N="2052" /> tell them that there is nothing for them they will not follow the legislators.  I strongly urge all commentators to recognise their responsibilities.  We have a platform that allows us to raise or dash the aspirations of our people and we should not resort to extremes.</P>
      <P>The budget is positive and progressive. It charts a course which can be followed and which if followed will bring some degree of financial rectitude, economic and social stability and will lead to the light at the end of the tunnel.  I listened with interest to the submissions from the opposite side of the House and from listening to them one would wonder if the present Government had been able to produce anything positive at all.  The contributions with one or two exceptions were negative.  Nobody bothered to chart the areas where the Government under difficult circumstances had been positive and had given leadership.  In the budget there is a proposal to increase new house grants by 75 per cent.  I would remind the House that over the last couple of months the Government made considerable amounts of money available for housing generally.  There has been a lot of criticism of the Government's attitude to the building industry, some justified and some not.  A few years ago when this Government came into office the only hope there was for the person living in a mobile home, living in unfit and overcrowded conditions sometimes for five or six years was to stay there and wait under intolerable conditions to get a local authority house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government changed that by introducing the Housing Finance Agency scheme which allows practically everybody whether or not on the housing list within certain income limits to qualify for a loan to provide themselves with a house and provided methods for repayment such as were never available before whereby they could repay on a differential basis.  Notwithstanding all the criticism of the Government's attitude to the construction industry, that was the biggest financial impetus given to the building industry in the last five years.  The facts speak for themselves.  On top of that <Col N="2053" /> the Government have increased the new house grant.  A person who qualifies, on giving over a local authority house to the local authority can qualify for a new house grant of £1,750, a special grant of £5,000 and a mortgage subsidy of £3,000 payable over the first five years of the repayment of their mortgage.  That represents a positive effort by the Government to acknowledge the importance of the building industry and at the same time gives recognition to the fact that there were a large number of people who could not be catered for under the ordinary housing allocations through the local authorities.  The Government did a great deal to alleviate the hardships that these people suffered.</P>
    <P>The budget is closely linked to the national plan, <i>Building On Reality</i> and its central theme has been the holding of taxation, not allowing it to rise above existing levels, and in fact reducing it. That was the message we got from the business people as well as the workers, and the Government responded to it. Now it is over to the people and the businessmen to respond to the Government's efforts.  The crucial question now is whether the public response will be as good as one would hope and will be as good as we have anticipated. That is a very crucial element in any proposals for tax reductions.  One will always get support from the people for tax reductions, but the most important factor is to ensure that revenue will not suffer, creating further problems because of the need for further borrowing.</P>
    <P>Inflation has shown a downward trend in the past two years.  It is no accident because it has been Government policy during that time to try to make the country more competitive, to try to create jobs and continued employment.  It can be argued that unemployment is high but can anyone say how much worse it would be if Government measures were not taken?  I am not talking about the numbers unemployed now but those who would be unemployed in three years.  It is easy for critics to point to the existing position, and the Opposition obviously like to say how good things would be if <Col N="2054" /> they were in power.  I have not heard them dwelling too long on how bad things might be today if they were in power.  A different picture would exist now if their policies had been continued.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable improvement in our balance of payments in the past few years, mainly because of careful monitoring of costs at home, which has allowed us to compete effectively with our competitors in manufactured products.  Therefore, our balance of payments has shown consistent improvement.  Of course that would be only a long term solution to unemployment but it is a firm foundation on which to build our economy.  Our efforts to solve unemployment now must be short term.</P>
    <P>In all honesty none of us can be happy with the numbers unemployed.  I do not believe there is what is called an acceptable level of unemployment because I do not regard any level as being acceptable. Therefore, we must try to create the circumstances which will change the position dramatically.  It is easy for Members of the Opposition not in the business of providing the means to resolve that problem to suggest solutions.</P>
    <P>The level of unemployment now is of a nature, considering the size of the country, which cannot be tolerated for long. Before people opposite begin to shout &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;, let me say that they were in the business of trying to resolve this problem for a long time but they failed miserably.  I suggest that it is time to begin to take more imaginative measures. Every day we hear about the increasing crime rate, about the need to introduce more stringent measures to deal with it, the need to provide more finance for the forces of law and order so that decent people can walk our streets day and night without fear of attack.</P>
    <P>If many of the young people now involved in serious crime had jobs or some prospect of jobs they would have a purpose in life that they do not have now and, I suggest, their whole attitude to authority and to State institutions would be changed.  It may seem a simplistic solution to give jobs at any cost and with <Col N="2055" /> consequent increased burdens for the taxpayers. However, one must examine the case of young people living in cities and towns, living on unemployment assistance perhaps for two or three years, in some cases people who have never had jobs or only for a short time.  Their attitude towards the institutions of the State, to authority and to other people's property have diminished.  One of the major contributory factors is that they see no purpose in life.  That is very sad.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the time has come to consider the introduction of a national minimum wage.  Economists would argue that by so doing we would create further burdens for the taxpayers, but is it not worth thinking about?  Young people have the right to unemployment assistance, they are entitled to benefits from the State as things stand.  Would it not be to much better purpose to provide, say, an extension to AnCO and the youth employment scheme?  Would there not be a net gain to the State in this way rather than in the way of extra finance for law enforcement? Would we not be better disposed involving ourselves in prevention rather than trying to cure a problem which has got out of hand?</P>
    <P>These are matters that all politicians will have to face up to soon.  The Government are doing a very good job in difficult circumstances, but a serious look will have to be taken at unemployment and its effects on the economy and on the morale not only of the unemployed but of those at work.  The morale of those unemployed will decline seriously and those at work will be equally affected by a high rate of unemployment.  That is at this juncture the largest single issue facing the country.  It behoves all politicians to try to pool our resources in an attempt to resolve that problem.  If we can resolve it we shall get recognition for that.  If we cannot then there is a grave danger that, to an even greater extent than at present and for some time past, people will become disenchanted with what we in this House represent.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of a national minimum wage to combat the problem may seem <Col N="2056" /> like a revolutionary idea in these difficult times, but I would put it to the House that I have felt for some time that this is a way around the problem.  I have indicated that the problem is already costing us money.  If it is to cost us, why not give those who are unfortunately affected by unemployment a new lease of life and some indication how they might attain a more fulfilling and rewarding life for themselves and their families?</P>
    <P>A number of features of the budget are very welcome &mdash; the changes in the tax bands and the removal of a number of VAT rates, which again has been sought by the business sector and rightly so.  It had become intolerable for business and industry to cope with the vast number of VAT rates with which they have to deal. Many business people rightly indicated that they spent most of their time administering that system.  For every three people they had working they might have to employ somebody to administer the taxation system on behalf of the State. That kind of work was obviously counterproductive. I fully agree with, and support the general thrust of the Minister's proposals in reducing these rates and introducing a number of PAYE tax concessions.</P>
    <P>In that area we would all have preferred to see an even greater amount of PAYE tax relief.  That sector have been heavily burdened for quite a number of years.  They have been feeling the pinch to a very great extent.  It would have been nice to have been able to give them more relief than they have got, but one must have regard to the constraints within which the Minister had to operate.  I know that he has done all that could possibly be done in the time available to him and in the current year, at least.  One would hope that in the future he would see fit to continue along that road and give further relief to that sector.</P>
    <P>One effect of taxation which I had come to notice over the past couple of years applied both to house purchasers and to the business and industry sector. That was the system of borrowing to offset against taxation.  A few years ago it was quite common for a family to change <Col N="2057" /> house for the better three or four times in ten years.  They found themselves moving into different tax bands, paying higher taxes and in order to offset some of the burden of taxation they went for a more expensive house, which was helpful to the building industry.  They got increased tax allowances in respect of their mortgages. However, the difficulty arose when the recession came and they found themselves committed to repayments which they had entered into when times were better and the outlook brighter.  They found themselves with that heavy burden of taxation on the one hand and heavy mortgage repayments on the other. Between the two they were in an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the building industry has restructured to such an extent that now that industry is catering for the market and is producing very efficiently a house that it is possible for the purchaser, without any major sacrifices, to be able to buy and pay for.  That trend should be welcomed.  It lightens the pressure on all other agencies.  For people living in those circumstances and that taxation situation, their only release was to seek higher wages or salaries.  So the vicious circle went on.  The same applies to agriculture and to industry generally.  They borrowed to offset against taxation and high interest rates during the recession plus high inflation caused a complete bind.</P>
    <P>I also welcome that the tax allowance for incapacitated or handicapped children was increased by 20 per cent.  This is something which only families beset by the sadness of having a handicapped person could appreciate.  That was a very progressive measure on the Minister's part and he is to be congratulated on it.</P>
    <P>The other measure which generally got approval was the tax relief in respect of interest from savings.  It become very obvious in the winter just gone by that many elderly people had taken to the practice of hoarding their savings in cash at home and this was very undersirable. For that reason the Minister rightly decided to double relief in that area. <Col N="2058" /> Another positive element of the budget was the introduction of optical and dental benefits for the wives of insured persons during their terms of pregnancy.  Incidentally, this is a question that has been discussed on numerous occasions and it was an area of obvious need for action. It is important that, even in times of severe financial stringency, the Government saw fit to give that relief.  There has been criticism from various quarters as to the feasibility of having dental or optical work done during pregnancy, but modern medicine has been able to overcome many of the difficulties mentioned by the critics.</P>
    <P>There have been general increases in social welfare pensions, benefits and assistance, old age pensions and so forth. That is a recognition of the plight of many of the less well off in our society.  There are those who say that these increases could have been greater.  That may well be, but the Government must have regard to the resources available and the means they have to raise those resources further.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see the increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel and the increase in motor tax.  Those are two things that had to be done in order to provide funds for the more positive proposals of the budget.  One always should be prepared to accept the rough with the smooth.  One cannot merely accept the palatable parts and dismiss the remainder.  If we are to achieve positive developments, we must make some sacrifices.  I was sorry to see the increases proposed there because they could have a knock-on effect, creating problems elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The reduction in excise duty on electrical goods was a direct response to the promptings of the industry, it having become obvious for some time that there was a large scale smuggling operation going on very detrimental to the electrical industry in the Twenty-six Counties.  It had continued for some considerable time.  Despite the best efforts to stymie it, it seemed to prosper.  It is now over to that industry to take up the challenge which I have no doubt they will do, giving <Col N="2059" /> their competitors the kind of race they have been giving for some time.  It constitutes a positive step which will prove at least as lucrative in the long run from the Government's point of view as the situation that prevailed heretofore.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned unemployment already.  I should like to dwell briefly now on the enterprise allowance scheme referred to in the Minister's Budget Statement which has provided a number of jobs.  This scheme ensures that a person finding himself or herself unemployed for a certain period of time receives a specific weekly payment over a year, providing themselves with a job, be it in manufacturing or in the service area, which is a good thing.  On the one hand it allows a person to be productively employed, either alone, or in manufacturing or service industry, teaching them to be self-sufficient, at the same time affording them a basic allowance from the State, thereby ensuring that if things do not go right for them they will have something on which to fall back.  It is a way of allowing people to creep before they walk.  It is a progressive scheme and one I should like to see extended further. I know it is still in its infancy and that it will grow to great proportions in the future.  That is a scheme that could take up a considerable amount of the slack in our unemployed numbers.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the budget was the provision of £9.5 million in respect of pay increases to local authority employees. Having listened to some of the criticism from other quarters over the past few days I could not but think back to a few years when, sitting at local authority estimates meetings, we received a grant in lieu of rates on domestic dwellings from the Department, a specific increase, but received nothing in respect of pay increases.  We were supposed to provide for them from our own resources.  That practice continued for three or four years.  That damage was done over a period of years resulting in local authorities finding themselves now with large borrowings, an inability to carry out the <Col N="2060" /> work they were statutorily appointed to do, with a great deal of criticism emanating from the people for whom they administer the services at their disposal. This provision should be applauded. Despite all the criticism emanating from the opposite side of the House, despite all the holes they have attempted to pick in the budget, that element was carefully costed in the charting of the course of the Government's national plan, forming an integral part of the budget, providing for part of the services rendered by local authorities.  It was easy in times past to maintain that they should provide for such from their own resources, which is what we were told, but it did not work. That is why the Government are correctly providing a sum of money specifically for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which the budget deals is the provision for sporting and recreational facilities, a recognition of their importance by way of giving young people something to do in their spare time, giving them financial recognition for some of the wonderful voluntary efforts made throughout the country over many a long day.  It has a bearing also on the crime rate, unemployment and associated matters in that if there is an investment in sporting and recreational facilities that will mean there will be some kind of occupation for young people in which to engage which in turn will mean that they will not become involved in vandalism or hooliganism once they have something else to do and that they will themselves provide a great deal of services provided they receive some kind of official recognition or financial blessing. The Government have correctly done that and it will yield rich harvests in the future.</P>
    <P>Another matter with which I might deal is the free fuel allowance scheme which has also been increased to compensate for the increase in value-added tax being imposed on fuel, the increase amounting to much more than the VAT increase.  That scheme exists to aid people in our society who are statutorily entitled to that allowance.  I said on one previous occasion that I should prefer to <Col N="2061" /> see the scheme administered on a more universal basis in the sense that various local authorities &mdash; corporations or whatever &mdash; seem to have their own way of interpreting the provisions of the scheme. In many cases I should like to see a more sympathetic appraisal of the circumstances of some of its applicants.  I mention that specifically because, as we are all aware, there is a new group of people now applying for this allowance, people who may have been in good jobs up to a few years ago, who may well now find themselves in rather unfortunate circumstances, perhaps out of their job and committed to high mortgage repayments which may have fallen into arrear.  Such people may find themselves having to apply for this allowance for the first time ever.  Some may have been self-employed in middle and upper management.  They will find it very difficult to go to the various welfare centres to seek their statutory entitlement but they should be made feel they are seeking something to which they are statutorily entitled.  They should not be made to feel that they are in any way seeking something which is not theirs by right.  That scheme is there to serve people who are in need.  Great care should be taken to ensure that the dignity of the individual is not eroded in the processing or administration of those claims.</P>
    <P>This was brought home to me recently by a person who was in middle management and found himself unemployed.  He did not speak to anybody about it for quite some time.  He went to the local health centre and sat watching other people being dealt with.  He attended at the local health centre for some considerable time before he managed to work up sufficient courage to go to the community welfare officer or the nurse and state his case.  Afterwards he mentioned to me the position in which he found himself and his hopelessness and complete inability to come to grips with his own problem. His pride stopped him from explaining the situation at the beginning to the people who were there to help him.  Particular attention must be paid to these people in the current climate because in <Col N="2062" /> many cases they are suffering unknown to us.  Despite the fact that the services are provided to assist them, the trappings of bureaucracy create an atmosphere which scares that category of people and makes it difficult for them to obtain their rights.  This is a very worthwhile scheme and I am glad the Minister saw fit to make the increase in the budget.</P>
    <P>The theme of the budget provides a certain amount of hope and a certain amount of financial relief by way of taxation, changes in tax bands, and the provision of a number of incentives.  That is most desirable because what we need at present is hope and to give recognition to people for their efforts and some indication that, at the end of the road, there is some reward.  When people talk about reward whether for an individual worker, a businessman, or a farmer, they mean profit, I suppose.  Anybody who is in business for any other reason would not be held in very high regard by his local lending institution.</P>
    <P>The budget attempts to create incentives, reliefs and an atmosphere of encouragement which is essential if we are to achieve our potential while working within the tight restrictions within which the Minister had to operate. Despite all the criticisms and the suggestions that the people will cast this Government out at the first opportunity, despite the suggestion that this Government will have to be dragged kicking and screaming before the electorate, I do not think that in a democracy any Government, or any party, or combination of parties, will ever have to be dragged kicking and screaming anywhere.</P>
    <P>In their own good way the people will see fit to give recognition to the Government for effort and for the sacrifice in many cases of political popularity, of electoral popularity, recognition that the Government put the needs of the country first and accepted that difficult decisions had to be made and had the courage to make those decisions, and live with the kind of criticism and, for want of a better word, bad publicity one has to expect in the wake of such decisions.  The Government did all those things with the right <Col N="2063" /> intentions and for the right reasons. When the time comes for the people to make up their minds again, they will have regard to previous experience and past events.  They will then make up their own minds about who is capable of delivering. The time has long since gone when the public would accept from politicians vague promises about what they could do, without telling the public where they proposed to get the money to carry out those promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Hovering over this budget and the economic situation we are in at the moment are two major sets of figures.  One is the unemployment figure of which we are so well aware and which increased yet again within the past week or two.  The other is a set of figures set out at column 1123 of the Official Report of 30 January as a supplement to the Budget Statement.  The figures are contained in Table 3 of the tables attached to the budget.  They are the figures for the Service of Public Debt, Central Fund Services and the interest payable over the past five years.  In 1981 the interest payable was £795 million; in 1982, £1,143 million; in 1983, £1,330 million; in 1984, £1,566 million; and in 1985, £1,841 million. Next year when someone stands up to read out the corresponding figure it will have exceeded £2 billion, most of it gone abroad, wasted and largely useless at a time when inflation world wide is falling.  Whether this country likes it or not it will be affected by that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to talk about interest secondly.  I want to talk about employment first.  It is scarcely touched on in the Budget Statement.  It is scarcely referred to at all.  Listening to the Minister for Finance one would think we did not have an unemployment problem of the most grotesque proportions.  One would not think we have one at all.  What does he do in some of his provisions in this budget which we are told is getting us off the ground?  He takes one of the most sensitive and crucial industries, the construction industry, and doubles the rate of VAT overnight.  I understand that last <Col N="2064" /> night there was a postponement for two months in the increase of VAT on housing which is about half the construction industry.  There is no postponement in relation to the other.  That is immaterial because the postponement for two months in relation to housing is absolutely useless.  All it does is to encourage somebody buying a house at a fixed price to postpone closing the sale for two months because then he will buy at the same price but get an extra £750 by way of grant.  Obviously that is what everybody is going to do, but that is no help to the construction industry.  On the other hand, two months is too short a period to enable builders to dispose of property.</P>
    <P>We should look broadly at the construction industry and what the effects of this extraordinary provision in the budget will be.  Last year An Foras Forbartha estimated that expenditure in the construction industry was £1.85 billion.  The increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent means an increased tax take in 1985 by the Exchequer of £92½ million. Let us take a round figure of £90 million for the sake of argument because there will obviously be a reduction in activity in this year.  That extra £90 million taken out of the construction industry can be roughly broken down fifty-fifty between materials and labour.  Therefore £45 million is taken out in wages.  If we take the average gross cost of employing a man in the industry at £15,000 and divide that into £45 million, we get a figure of 3,000. As a result of that provision by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget we have a direct loss of 3,000 jobs straightaway. It is very hard to believe that there are about 250,000 people unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>In addition to that direct destruction of 3,000 jobs there are the market consequences of the increased cost of VAT on the construction industry.  The market consequences are particularly noticeable in the lower price bracket of the housing market where every £50 or £100 is sensitive, where young people especially have the greatest difficulty trying to scrape enough money together to put down the deposit to buy a house, and where an <Col N="2065" /> increase of even £100 or £200 may mean the difference between whether they can or cannot buy.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of what this Minister did the price of an average house increases by £1,800.  That inevitably has the consequence of reducing demand.  If the demand for houses reduces by only 10 per cent as a result of these increases &mdash; and that is a conservative estimate &mdash; this will cost even more jobs.  You may ask how many more jobs.  On average each builder employs one man per house built per year.  Therefore every house not built this year as a result of this fall in demand means the loss of a job for a man for a year.  On the basis that 20,000 houses might be built in the private sector this year, approximately 2,000 jobs are lost as a result of the market consequences of that step by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves what is the effect on the non-housing side of the construction industry.  On the private side the effect very clearly is that the finely balanced investment yield got from commercial projects is completely distorted by the sudden unexpected additional 5 per cent being added to the cost and because the margins are so tight and the calculations are so fine in trying to decide whether to undertake a particular commercial or industrial project, a whole range of projects which might otherwise have taken place, and that might just marginally have been viable, no longer are and therefore they are deferred or abandoned altogether.  The consequences of that in terms of employment are very obvious and extensive.</P>
    <P>Let us take the public contracts.  What will be the effect on them?  Output will be 5 per cent less, 5 per cent less work will be done because the 5 per cent is simply added and the local authority pay it back to the Exchequer rather than in wages.  It is worth asking ourselves how much is involved.  I will give some of the headings as deduced by An Foras Forbartha last year.  On industrial building the figure was £196 million; on roads it was £192 million; on agricultural building it was £65 million; on commercial <Col N="2066" /> building it was £58 million; on educational building it was £81 million, and on health and all others it was £341 million. Assuming the same amount of money is made available this year, straightaway there is a 5 per cent reduction.  This means 5 per cent less of everything will be built and there will be 5 per cent fewer jobs.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, and in particular the Minister for Finance, to look seriously at that situation in the context of the enormous unemployment figures and the fact that construction is the industry which can most rapidly pick up in terms of employment numbers.  The Minister should ask himself if this was a wise move. The reaction of the builders is one of outrage.  Some people may feel they are outraged because they have a vested interest or because it is their own business, but I do not think that is fair.  What will happen is what many people said would happen, that is, many of them will close down.  Many of them are solvent and can afford to close down.  They do not have to go into compulsory liquidation. They can build in Britain, the United States or the Middle East, as a number of them are doing.  It is probably a matter of regret to many of them that they did not do that before now.  Up to now Irish builders who were building abroad tended to build at home also, but what will happen shortly is that they will only build abroad.  In the light of this sort of provision and the way this industry has been treated over the past few years it would be foolish for them to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the countries where you are penalised in an extraordinary way if you make a profit, and where you are held up as a quasi-delinquent if you try to expand your business or if you try to be a success.  The Minister for Finance and his all-seeing Department unhappily were unable to see the consequences of this foolish provision but now they are probably too politically proud to change it and to divert the enormous damage they are doing.  Whatever about the Department, I have some hope that the Minister might have sense enough to realise that an error was made and that <Col N="2067" /> the consequences of this action were not foreseen but they are now becoming obvious and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury in that respect, happening simultaneously with this is an increase which has been forecast of between 1½ per cent and 2½ per cent in building society rates.  The implications of this on thousands of families are extremely serious and can hardly be exaggerated. This increase is being brought to a head by two factors, both deliberately contrived as a matter of policy by the Minister for Finance.  He has to accept entire responsibility for it because it is not caused by external factors beyond his control.</P>
    <P>The two factors are that in the latter part of last year the Minister for Finance decided that he would do all his borrowing for nearly all the last quarter domestically and he forced up domestic interest rates quite severely.  To give them their due, building societies tried to resist it for a while or to put off the consequences because they hoped, when the Minister for Finance indicated that he would switch back to foreign borrowing in the first quarter of 1985, that the pressure would be taken off.  However, it now seems to have gone too far, or so the building societies tell us, and there is no prospect in the immediate future, so far as they can see, of a reduction.</P>
    <P>Why should the price of money here in the last quarter of 1984 be so dear?  It was not because of private demand because there is none.  The banks cannot lend money to anyone except the Government because there is no demand from anyone else.  Only the Government want to spend or to invest.  The Government may be spending but they are not investing and that is pretty obvious to anyone who looks at the way things are going.  Added to that, we had provision in the budget to slightly increase the composite rate of income tax on building society deposits.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance apparently is not doing that from a revenue raising point of view and he leaves himself open to the suggestion that he may be doing it for other reasons, perhaps to do with <Col N="2068" /> spite, because, curiously, he made it clear when he announced this increase in income tax on building societies that if any society felt that the increase was unwarranted, the Revenue Commissioners would undertake a survey of depositors with a view to determining what the composite rate for that society should be.  In other words, if a society can show that the rate is too high, they can have it reduced to its previous figure and the Minister will get no money.</P>
    <P>It is fair to suggest that it may not be entirely for revenue purposes that he brought in that provision.  However, small as it is &mdash; he is talking about a figure of £10 million which is relatively small in the context of the overall budget &mdash; look at the effect compounded by the effect of what he is doing in relation to VAT.  If there are no changes made in these two provisions, how many more building firms will close between now and 31 December next?  It does not seem to matter.  Does it mean that unemployment figures rise inexorably month after month after month?</P>
    <P>The input of the construction industry is 90 per cent or more Irish.  The spin-off effect through the economy as a whole is widespread and rapid.  Where are the tax concessions in the budget in terms of VAT?  The concessions are in relation to items coming across the Border, white goods, television sets and so on, all of which are manufactured outside Ireland. I am not saying that the VAT rates on these items were not criminally high but they are being forced down simply by the existence of the six-counties of Northern Ireland and not by any other factor.  The more that are purchased the higher our import bill.  Yet the most indigenous of all our industries is savagely discouraged with awful consequences in terms of general economics and employment.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the level of interest payments.  If a company, Ireland Ltd, or Ireland Incorporated was in the kind of situation that Ireland is in at present it would be in liquidation because Ireland is insolvent.  We are not in liquidation because we are a sovereign country and you cannot liquidate a sovereign <Col N="2069" /> country for commercial reasons.  In any event this company is still trading subject to a very qualified certificate from some auditor and it has these enormous borrowings and interest costs.  I have already given the figures in that regard.  The cost will be over £2 billion in interest alone next year because another £2 billion is being borrowed this year almost as if it did not matter.</P>
    <P>If a company were faced with enormous interest costs they would look around to see what their assets were, particularly if they had a large accumulation of long acquired and cheaply acquired assets.  They would ask themselves whether it was wise to continue with these frequently underutilised assets and at the same time pay the enormous borrowing costs that were part and parcel of Government in recent years.  The company would immediately come to the conclusion that they would be very foolish to do that and that the only proper course of action which made commercial sense and which might keep the company in existence and viable would be to replace that borrowing, which is so costly, by moneys that could be obtained by the disposal of their assets.  I am sure many companies would not want to do this, but in the circumstances they would have no option.  Many of us would not wish to adopt this course either but do we have any option if we take a realistic look at how we are going to solve the awful situation in which we are?</P>
    <P>At present the cost of funds to the Government varies between about 14 per cent at the lowest to 17 per cent at the highest, depending on the duration for which they require the money.  How many of our assets have the equivalent of yields of only 4 per cent, 5 per cent or 6 per cent?  Is it not crazy to continue to borrow money and not to realise some our our assets?  One example is the case of an office block built by the Government today at a cost of funds of about 15 per cent but rentable at about 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  Why should the Government own any such assets if the cost of ownership is two or three times the cost of sustaining the borrowing in order to <Col N="2070" /> own them?  It is now much better to rent them rather than to borrow money on that basis.  If you have assets that are saleable on the basis of a yield of 5 per cent, why should you retain those assets if the cost of part of your Exchequer financing is 15 per cent cost on funds?</P>
    <P>Another example is in the area of forestry. We have considerable State forests now but, unhappily, we are not making great use of them.  Apparently there are all sorts of difficulties about their utilisation and they are not looked after properly. They are not thinned or harvested when they should be, but they are still a major capital asset.  They could be sold on the same basis as they are sold in the UK on a yield of about 5 per cent provided the thinnings taken out in the first 20 years were tax free as a repayment of capital.  This has worked extremely well elsewhere.  There are many institutions which would be prepared to purchase them as an investment.  They would still be just as valuable to the country and possibly more so because they would be looked after with greater care by private owners.  Why not contemplate some programme dealing with the sale of part of our forests and use the proceeds of such sale to reduce our borrowing?  That would make good economic sense.  That is becoming increasingly obvious to other countries whose economic position is nearly as serious as ours.</P>
    <P>CIE is the biggest lossmaker of all our enterprises.  Look at the assets it has and at the buildings which are underutilised or not utilised.  There are substantial amounts of property in this and other cities which are capable of being developed but which at present are not utilised. What is the capitalised value of Bord Gáis Éireann at present with its very substantial profits?  Why should it not be realised? It would make a substantial amount of money and at the same time its rate of profit in private hands could be controlled by the price control mechanism.  Why not avail of the assets it represents and as a result make a substantial reduction in our borrowing?</P>
    <P>These are practical suggestions as to what could be done in the short term. <Col N="2071" /> The Minister for Finance has given a somewhat simplistic presentation of the proposition by saying that it is impossible to reduce borrowing while at the same time maintaining necessary current expenditure.  That is not so.  If we look at the matter in a slightly different and more commercial way than has been our wont up to now we may well see other ways out of the dilemma that faces us.</P>
    <P>The issue which faces us is our survival as a viable economy and therefore as a democracy.  It is worth looking at some of our extremely successful companies, both public and private, and seeing what they have in the way of assets.  Some of the biggest of them have hardly anything. This may have contributed to their success. I will not name individual companies but one does not need to know a great deal about the commercial scene here to know that this is true of most of our successful companies.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the budget &mdash; I am sure not many speakers will deal with this aspect of it &mdash; which will do a lot of harm to employment is the manner in which the Minister for Finance and the Government have capitulated on the question of public sector pay.  Despite the national plan's insistence on only a nominal increase in 1985, it now looks as if the public sector pay bill will overshoot its target by £100 million this year.  If this buys industrial harmony in the public service it will only be at the cost of unemployment in the private sector.  That the Government failed to keep their own pay bill under control is hardly surprising given their extraordinary negotiating stance prior to the budget.  They told the public service unions that if pay limits were exceeded the excess would have to be recouped through extra taxation, higher charges for services and more borrowing. These measures spread the cost throughout the community with public sector employees as the main beneficiaries. These are ineffective threats.  Would you accede to my wishes if I threatened to cut off someone's else's nose to spite your face?</P>
    <P>Most private sector workers especially <Col N="2072" /> in the least sheltered industries have come to understand that excessive pay rises cost jobs.  This understanding was born of bitter experience.  Unfortunately the public sector have a less direct mechanism. When its pay rises too quickly jobs are not lost there but in the private sector. It is worth remarking that the excess over what was announced a few months ago as the public sector pay bill for this year, approximately £100 million, is the same amount that has been taken out of the construction industry with the 100 per cent increase in VAT.  I dealt with that earlier and showed what the consequences would be in terms of job losses and the demise of companies.</P>
    <P>There are many bits and pieces of the budget that anyone would agree with.  I welcome the aspect of the budget which deals with tourism and the reduction from 18 per cent or 23 per cent VAT in respect of different services to 10 per cent.  The single exception unfortunately was restaurants which still labour under the penal rate of 22 per cent.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who possibly persuaded him, for what he has done.</P>
    <P>One would like to see their concern for tourism extended to their colleague, the Minister for Communications.  In this morning's newspaper I read that he is going ahead with the Air Transport Bill. Apparently a number of amendments were made to this ill-fated legislation which the Government agreed to &mdash; the emergency loophole plugger of last June &mdash; and it is to be brought in again.  What was the point in the Minister for Finance coming in here at a time of great financial stringency and making these very welcome and substantial cuts in VAT to aid the tourist industry while, after a lapse of eight months, this Bill is to be reintroduced, the main purpose of which is anti-competitive and anti-tourist?  Much of the good that will be done by the VAT reduction in the budget will be undone because of the inability of people to get into this country at a reasonable price in order to avail of what we hope will be somewhat lower prices.  Perhaps the <Col N="2073" /> Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would prevail on their colleague, now that this emergency Bill has been allowed to lie fallow for eight months, to let it lie fallow for eight more months.  It is sad to see unnecessary damage done for all the wrong and most silly of reasons in terms of the introduction of anti-consumer legislation just at the time when our major competitors in Europe are moving in the opposite direction.  It is worth reminding ourselves that as well as having low VAT rates for tourism in countries such as Britain, Holland and Germany, those three countries have entered into bilateral agreements with one another to reduce substantially the cost of flying between their countries.  Even in a matter of months that has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of tourists travelling between Holland and Britain and between Britain and Holland.  In addition, the effect in the coming year on travel between Britain and Germany will be even greater.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry has been doing badly for a number of years, partly as a result of high VAT rates.  That matter has now been rectified in the budget but are we going to see that rectification set at nought because of the foolish policies that apparently are being followed in this part of the island and nowhere else in Europe?  The whole tendency elsewhere is to break down the cartel system of keeping up airfares artificially and keeping out new airlines from routes between various countries.  Unfortunately, we will have the opportunity to speak at length about that matter in the weeks and months to come.  I should prefer not to have to speak about it because, unfortunately, the Bill will undo much of the good that has been done as a result of the budgetary provisions.  It is running entirely counter to what is happening in the rest of Europe and to what was proposed by the EC in their second memorandum on air transport last year.</P>
    <P>The deficit in the budget has been increased still further by the unfortunate failure of the State at the end of 1984 and the beginning of this year to resolve in a <Col N="2074" /> satisfactory way the question of its investments in the Bula company in the Navan ore body.  We saw an announcement &mdash; technically it was a leak rather than an announcement &mdash; in newspapers after Christmas from which it appeared that the Government had turned down a proposal by the Minister for Energy and his Department whereby an independent mine would be set up at a total cost of £95 million to develop separately and independently what has been described as the Bula part of the Navan ore body. Apparently the Government debated the matter for some time and turned down the proposal.  I congratulate them on that because it was a wise decision.  It was a proposal that should never have been put to them by the Minister for Energy. Having done that, they then tried to cause the parties involved to talk to one another and to come to some resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>There was an announcement, or at least an indication, in the newspapers of what the State proposed to do, namely, taking over the existing Bula company in which it already has nominally a 49 per cent share but in effect 24 per cent and selling it, apparently at cost, to Tara Mines Limited, the only company operating there.  After it became apparent at the beginning of January that this was what was in mind, I asked why the State found it necessary, at expense ultimately to the taxpayer, to reimburse the private shareholders of that company in respect of losses sustained during the past eight futile years and not to see that the State was reimbursed in any way.  I asked that question at some length on radio and it was printed in the papers but I have not seen any reply.  It is a question worth repeating because it has no small bearing on the amount of deficit that has to be dealt with in the budget and it has no small bearing on the overall approach to mineral development here and to allied matters.</P>
    <P>One gets the feeling that the almost perverse anxiety of the Government to see that those private shareholders should not be out of pocket in any way as a result of the past eight futile years is <Col N="2075" /> due more to historical ideology and an anxiety to try to cloak up the errors of a previous Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce in the mid-Seventies than having anything to do with commercial reality or sound accounting or economic practice today.  I wonder if the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; I think he has not spoken in this debate &mdash; would indicate to the House why the Government took this extraordinary step, or at least they propose to take it.</P>
    <P>Even though this matter was publicised early in January, I understand agreement has not yet been reached.  I have heard a rumour &mdash; I do not know if it is true &mdash; that when these announcements were being made in late December the Government took it upon themselves, apparently with no publicity, to make a further substantial payment to a number of banks who were owed money by the private shareholders as part of interest due by them.  That is a matter which should be clarified.  Already more than £10 million has been paid to or on behalf of the shareholders concerned.  It would be very disturbing if it were shown to be true that further payments have been made in recent weeks for the same reason.  As far as the State and the taxpayers are concerned, I regret to say it is money down the drain.  Under the arrangements proposed the State will get nothing back although the private shareholders, whom one might reasonably say were perhaps the cause of the present situation because the State was not actively involved in the running or management of the company, will be at no loss as a result of the failure and the consequent insolvency of the company.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has been given permission to raise on <Col N="2076" /> the Adjournment of the House the future of Beaumont Hospital.  He has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to use my 20 minutes.  There has been great concern for a number of reasons about what exactly is happening as regards the future of Beaumont Hospital.  First the Minister reversed a decision of his predecessor's to allow the building of a private hospital on the site.  The only reason the Minister gave was that he would not allow public funds to be used for such a project. Consultants who were anxious to build a private hospital on location were prepared either to buy the site or to lease the site to build a hospital out of their own resources.</P>
      <P>The advantage of having a private hospital on location should be obvious. It would mean that the consultants would be on the hospital campus for a longer period during the day, and that would be in the interests of public patients in the hospital.  If the consultants are not prepared to use private facilities in the public hospital and if they have not their private clinic and patients wish to avail of private medicine, as is their right, if a consultant has a patient in, say, St. Michael's Dún Laoghaire, or in Rathgar, and the consultant has to travel back to an emergency to a public patient in the public hospital, this will cause a problem for that public patient.  For example, if a public patient should have surgery this morning and some emergency should arise this afternoon about 4 o'clock and the consultant happened to be operating in the nursing home in Rathgar, the consultant would have to try to get back through very busy traffic to that patient.  That would not be in the patient's interests.  There is no logical reason why a private hospital should not be allowed there, and certainly it would not cost the Exchequer any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally serious is the decision of the Minister to reverse a decision not alone of his predecessor's but of his own.  He told me in this House in answer to a parliamentary question that the building <Col N="2077" /> of a nurses' home would commence at the end of last year.  Since then the Minister has stated that he does not intend to proceed with the building of a nurses' home.  A very serious view has been taken of this, particularly by the nurses and the matrons of the hospitals that will be moving out to Beaumont, that is Jervis Street and the Richmond.  The Minister was quoted as saying that secretaries in his office have no accommodation provided for them in the city, but that misses the point of the nurses' home.  Nurses going into training, particularly in the first year, work very irregular hours. They work night shifts.  It is a 24-hour job and some of them will be working right through every hour of the day and will have to travel to and from the hospital at irregular hours.  This can pose a difficulty for young nurses.  Much comment has been made recently about the fact that nursing can be a stressful occupation. Teenagers come in to training school, and seeing illness at first hand and persons moribund, dying from serious disease, can be stressful for them.  In the Beaumont area the fact that there will not be a nurses' home will mean that nurses will have to go into digs or flats.  It would be much more in their interests if they were together because of the stressful nature of their occupation and because they have to travel to and from work at such irregular hours.  The Minister has also decided not to proceed with a doctors' residence.  It would be very important that accommodation would be provided for the doctors who would be on duty at any time, particularly night duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister was quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 1 December 1984 as saying that £16 million was wasted for the hospital.  Will the Minister tell us in the House how he sees that money as having been wasted?  It appears that Beaumont is a very necessary hospital.  It will have 730 beds and will be replacing Jervis Street and the Richmond Hospital which in terms of structural building have outlived their usefulness.  Jervis Street has 312 beds and the Richmond has 387 beds.</P>
    <P>There is concern at the delay in the <Col N="2078" /> hospital opening and about the fact that the Minister will not allow the consultants to have their private clinic which would be in the interest of all patients, particularly public patients.  There is concern that there is to be no nurses' home and no doctors' residence.  I would like the Minister to let us know the up-to-date position, when he sees the hospital opening, what facilities he intends to provide for these people and if he is aware of the problems that will be created in terms of no private nursing home and no nurses' home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record in this House that I regard the commissioning of Beaumont Hospital as a vital element in the provision of a modern acute general hospital service for the population of Dublin.  I am determined that I will open the hospital in July 1985.  I am equally determined that in the event of it not being opened I will not be held responsible, and I propose to make that clear to the House.  Beaumont will be one of six major general hospitals in Dublin which together will provide a comprehensive hospital service for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has arisen in relation to the construction of the hospital.  The building is now being completed and I have been prepared to make the necessary resources available in the past two years for the equipping of the hospital to enable it to be opened in July 1985. However, difficulties have arisen with the medical consultant staff in the first instance regarding the provision of facilities for private practice in Beaumont Hospital.  I want to go very briefly into the background of all this.  As far back as July 1984 the chairmen of Beaumont, Jervis Street and St. Laurence's were informed by letter that I was prepared to permit private patients to be treated within the confines of the public hospital ready and available at both inpatient and outpatient level.  As far as inpatient services were concerned I indicated that I would be prepared to consider proposals from the Beaumont Hospital Board regarding the level of allocation of private <Col N="2079" /> and semi-private beds in the hospital.  The letter from the Department approved by me stated further that any designation of any such beds within the hospital for the use of all such facilities would be subject to the approval of the Minister of the day.  Similarly I indicated I would be prepared to consider the board's proposals for the use of consulting rooms in respect of private patients on a refund basis for any administrative costs involved.</P>
    <P>I made those proposals as far back as July 1984 but I am sorry to say that there was virtually no response for several months.  Then the officials of the Department and myself had another meeting with the major medical cogwheel committee on 30 November last.  Following that meeting I confirmed with the committee that I would be prepared to approve of a proposal from the Beaumont Hospital Board to designate as private or semi-private a total of 70 beds within the hospital, together with an appropriate number of beds in the specialised unit.  I indicated also that I was prepared to construct within the design framework of the hospital an out-patient facility of approximately 20 consulting rooms and ancillary accommodation for use as private consulting rooms, subject to agreement for the appropriate payment by the consultants for the facility, the payment to be made to the board of the hospital.  I have not yet received any firm response on that matter but I understand there is a meeting this evening of the consultants concerned.  I hope that my proposals will be accepted and that it will be possible to proceed with arrangements for commissioning the hospital without further delay.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to the question of private hospitals being built on the campus of this hospital and the reply is that for as long as I am Minister for Health, that will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not happen because Beaumont is a public facility paid <Col N="2080" /> for by the taxpayer.  The land was bought by the Exchequer.  The building was paid for out of the Exchequer.  We are talking of £40 million and I have yet to put in another £5 million by way of equipment. The gross cost of the hospital will be £52.7 million of which I have allocated £5,500,000 this year.  I make the point again that if that is not acceptable I will spend the money by accelerating the expenditure at Castlebar hospital.  That can be done easily for a hospital that is in urgent need of upgrading and updating. Private beds can be on a variety of arrangements, for instance, floor by floor or in a separate unit and while I am prepared to spend £500,000 within a hospital of 650 beds by way of new expenditure I am not prepared to provide private consulting rooms.  I am very critical of the hospital design.  The Deputy's leader in his mad rush to have a hospital provided in his constituency chose a design identical with the Cork Regional Hospital which is a 1970 design of late 1960 vintage.  It was built in the mid seventies and opened in 1978.  In my humble view, in terms of cost effectiveness it is now highly expensive.  The Deputy's leader could not act fast enough in respect of Beaumont.  He took only six weeks to begin a £50 million project. However, we are landed with it now but it is a very good hospital and very well equipped.  The money has been spent on it and I have spent a fair proportion of the £52.7 million in the past two years because I decided it would be in the best national interest to finish the hospital as quickly as possible.  The Deputy's leader and former Minister for Health in his mad rush to be well in with everyone and with all sorts of consultants said to a private company, to the Jervis Street-Richmond Company Limited, which was formed by the joint medical staff association of Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals, that he would give them a lease on part of that land.  He did not say he would give them the land for nothing. He was rather careful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally accept that it makes good sense that consultants should treat their private and public patients within the one framework but it does not make good sense to have within the complex of a hospital a separate structure by way of a private hospital and private consulting rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to facilitate the consultants concerned within the hospital but not on a separate basis outside or on a separate basis in which there would be no rational control and which would not be in the general interest either of the consultants or of the patients who would attend the hospital. Therefore, for so long as I am Minister for Health I regard the matter as disposed of.</P>
      <P>When one considers the Richmond Hospital which is owned by the Department of Health and also when one considers Jervis Street hospital which is a public voluntary hospital, one finds both in a dreadful condition with working conditions being appalling.  The conditions for patients going there are equally bad. We are prepared to provide for the staff of those hospitals.  There are private beds within the framework of the Richmond Hospital and there is a private nursing home within the framework of Jervis Street Hospital.  Out of the total number of beds in Beaumont we are prepared to allow 70 private beds.  I will not argue that the number has to be 80 because intensive care beds may have to be taken into account.  In respect of people availing of those private beds and who are VHI subscribers, the money will go to the board of the hospital.  That is how such matters will be dealt with in Cavan.  It is what happens in our other hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> We turn then to the question of residential accommodation.  The internal accommodation for on-call doctors and on-call nurses in Jervis Street is rubbish. The accommodation in the Richmond is dreadful.  In the case of Beaumont we are talking about a hospital that will cost about £25 million to run between mid-1985 and mid-1986 with both the Jervis Street and Richmond budgets being transferred.  All the staff, from the gate staff up to the theatre staff, will be going to Beaumont.  I am prepared to provide within that framework luxury accommodation for on-call junior hospital doctors and for consultancy staff who may have to stay overnight.  Not many stay overnight but those on call would.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to provide accommodation within the framework of the hospital for the nurses on call, but that is not acceptable.  They want another private residence built in the grounds of the hospital for the doctors costing another £2 million or £3 million in public expenditure. I would remind Deputy O'Hanlon that these days are over and done with. There is nothing wrong with a young nurse or a student nurse going to her home in Dublin during the day or having accommodation within the framework of the hospital.  It is not that traumatic. There are thousands of young people in the public sector in stressful employment who have to live outside of the area where they work.  I am not disposed to spending a great deal more money building nurses homes especially when student nurses are paid such substantial salaries and are provided with meals within the framework of the hospital.  A young girl in Dublin on an AnCO training course gets £30 a week and pays for her own accommodation.</P>
    <P>We must have a sense of proportion in these issues.  I have made these points trenchantly to the staff concerned and I have not been thanked.  I am providing all essential on call accommodation given the levels of remuneration applicable to student nurses and other categories of staff and given the fact that around Beaumont there are hundreds of families willing to provide at low cost accommodation <Col N="2083" /> for people working in the hospital.  It is far better for a young woman not to have to spend all her time in the rather artificial atmosphere of the nurses home.  She should work in the hospital and then come back to a normal social environment. That is a more mature approach. I have informed the Beaumont hospital board of my decision on these matters and the board are considering how best to cope with that situation.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the manner in which the hospital project has progressed.  The basic capital cost of the framework of the hospital is £40 million and the equipping and commissioning of the hospital brings it up to £52.7 million. The new hospital in Beaumont is very badly needed and I am disappointed that obstacles are being placed in the way of getting the hospital into operation. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition is hoping that if we delay it long enough he will have his name carved in front of the hospital.  That does not worry me unduly. What worries me is that the physical accommodation provided in Jervis Street and in the Richmond is deplorable despite the fact that the service provided is excellent.  I am awaiting a formal response to the proposals I put to the consultants and, if the response is negative, I do not accept that they have a right to an independent free standing private hospital at Beaumont.  I am not in the business of providing that.</P>

      <P>It is basically wrong to get 100 consultants together and ask them all to put up £5,000 for a building that they can all use.  In terms of the use of a public facility and the use of public land that is not only wrong in principle but extremely wasteful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Any consultant living <Col N="2084" /> in Dún Laoghaire working in Beaumont will have private beds within the hospital into which he can put his patients.  The patient will be paying for the bed, he will not be paying the consultant or into a trust fund, he will be paying the hospital through the VHI.  That is the way it should be.  There is a slight obsession that B. Desmond somehow or another is determined to destroy private practice and to destroy the practice of private outpatient facilities.  I do not propose that.  I have said that they should work together in a public and private framework in the one structure.  I have the considered opinion within my Department that that is the rational thing to do. Putting it at its lowest level of argument if we were now to start off building a private hospital in it and building new residences and so on we would finish up deferring the opening of the hospital for another two or three years and that would be extremely costly and inappropriate.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that I am cutting back in providing the funds for the hospital itself.  The main building was completed in July 1983 and the group has begun accepting delivery of non-perishable items of equipment.  A sum of £2.18 million has been spent on equipment to date and the total equipping of the hospital will cost £10 million.  The most expensive items of equipment will be ordered nearer the commissioning date as the warranty begins to run from the date of delivery.  Immediately I have an absolute understanding in regard to the date of opening I will place orders for the perishable equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are coming up to the wire in terms of the race for the opening of Beaumont. I would ask Deputy O'Hanlon to talk to the consultants concerned.  I feel many of them are anxious to co-operate.  The Irish Medical Association is now involved, and when things become complex and involved everybody takes up positions. Deputy O'Hanlon might be of enormous assistance to myself and his party by assuring the consultants that there is not a perverse desire on my part in this proposal and advocating that the prevailing <Col N="2085" /> uncertainty should end.  If within a matter of a week or two the uncertainty is compounded I would have to abandon the date of July 1985 and, if I do that, the responsibility will not be hung around my neck.  I will put the correspondence formally on the record in the appropriate form and the people of Dublin can judge <Col N="2086" /> for themselves.  Unfortunately, because of limited resources this is the way we run things here.</P>

A form on which to set out the grounds for his appeal against the disallowance of benefit during the period 16 to 30 July 1984 has recently been sent to the claimant.  When this is returned his case will be sent to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give a detailed breakdown of the computation of overpayments to a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath for the period from 5 November 1983, to 22 August 1984, involving the sum of £1,471.46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present overpayment arose in this case from the fact that the person concerned was paid disability benefit at certain rates from 5 November <Col N="2037" /> 1983 to 22 August 1984 and it subsequently transpired that her correct entitlement should have been at a lower rate by reason of the fact that she became entitled to deserted wife's allowance from June 1983.  Where a person is concurrently entitled to deserted wife's allowance at the maximum rate and disability benefit, the latter is payable at half the personal rate.</P>
      <P>The total amount of disability benefit and pay-related benefit issued for the overlapping period of the two payments was £2,403.97, whereas the reduced revised entitlement was £1,177.33, resulting in an excess balance of £1,226.64. (This figure had been given in error earlier as £1,471.46 because an upwards adjustment of pay-related benefit totalling £244.82 which became payable arising from the reduction in the rate of disability benefit payable had not been included in the calculation.)</P>
      <P>Accumulated arrears of £936 of the deserted wife's allowance have been offset against the excess balance of £1,226.64 on the disability benefit side leaving an actual overpayment figure of £290.64.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of an applicant.  The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned was calculated at £121.19 weekly.  He is in receipt of the appropriate rate of flat rate unemployment benefit of £80.15 from 3 December 1984.  Pay-related benefit of £31.59 was paid from 20 December 1984 making the combined weekly payments £111.74 from that date.  He received an income tax rebate of £31.24 weekly from 10 January 1985, accordingly his pay-related benefit was reduced to £9.80 weekly.  However, due to an error in the calculation of his combined weekly payment he was initially paid at £96.19 <Col N="2039" /> weekly instead of £89.95.  This matter was subsequently adjusted and further payments at £89.95 weekly will continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 410 together.  Students already have representation on the boards/governing bodies of higher education institutions. In so far as regional technical colleges are concerned, I have already indicated that provision should be made for student representation on the boards of management of these colleges.  However, RTC boards are in law sub-committees of vocational education committees under section 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930. This section limits the total membership of such sub-committees to 12.  Where a board of management has less than 12 members, the vocational education committee may appoint a student representative. However, as many of the boards &mdash; including that for Galway RTC &mdash; already have the maximum of 12 members, it is necessary to examine how best arrangements may be made to provide for student representation.  This matter is under consideration in the context of the wider review being undertaken in line with the commitment made in paragraph 2.19 of the &ldquo;Programme for Action in Education 1984-1987&rdquo;.</P>

The question of carrying out more extensive work, namely, remodelling the existing school building, was subsequently raised by the school authorities and considered by my Department.

      <P>In January of last year I established a committee, known as the National Committee for International Youth Year, to plan, stimulate, co-ordinate and assist activities for the year.  The committee is representative of youth, Government, employer, trade union and vocational education interests.</P>
      <P>In order to give a wide variety of interests an opportunity to participate in preparations for the year, an advisory council, representative of a large number of voluntary and statutory bodies, was established to support the committee in its work.</P>
      <P>In its preparations for International Youth Year, the committee has endeavoured to secure widespread action for, and by, young people at national and local levels.  The main emphasis for the year is being placed on activities planned and organised at local level, with action at national level being mainly supportive in nature.  The support of the country's vocational education committees was obtained in promoting and assisting activity for International Youth Year throughout the country.</P>
      <P>At the time of the establishment of the National Committee for International Youth Year, the Government agreed to provide total Exchequer assistance up to £140,000 in support of the year.  To date grant allocations have been made by the committee as follows:</P>
      <P>£43,500 allocated to vocational education committees for the promotion of International Youth Year activity at local level throughout the country.</P>
      <P>£37,470 allocated to national governing bodies of youth organisations as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2051" /> The balance of the overall allocation is being expended on costs arising from the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>In view of the level and extent of activity planned for International Youth Year, particularly at local level throughout the country, the Government decided in the recent budget to provide a sum of £150,000 to fund further youth initiatives during International Youth Year.</P>
    <P>The additional funds at the disposal of the committee will be used to assist projects and events intended to enhance the impact of International Youth Year. The specific designation of grant assistance in this case is for the National Committee for International Youth Year to decide.</P>
