      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion on that subject will be arranged between the Whips at a time in advance of the Milan summit.  My view is that the debate will be most useful if it is as near as possible to the Summit, because there are developments being reported from time to time and the House should have the fullest information so that a discussion can take place immediately before the Summit in Milan.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is, when the Whips come to consider it, that it will be best that the discussion in the House should take place after there have been such preliminary contacts which would enable us to give the best indication to the House as to the likely shape of events and the issues that are going to arise that will be relevant to us.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure: Review of Leasing of Public Sector Accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to move the motion on this the fourth report of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  The report, though it is the shortest one we have produced to date, is important in that it identified an area of public expenditure which, in the committee's view, led to considerable sums of taxpayers' money being wasted in the past and unfortunately up to the present time.  We want to ensure that basic control systems are put in place in Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies to ensure that such waste can and will be avoided in future.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3 of the report before the House summarises the object of the committee's concern, namely, that &ldquo;leases have been signed on behalf of client Departments and agencies and rental paid in respect of new premises while the lease for the existing occupied building had not been disposed of or conclusive arrangements made so to dispose&rdquo;.  In other words, decisions have been made for one reason or another to move out of existing offices and to acquire new accommodation.  The result of this meant that double rent was and is being paid and the only beneficiary of such an arrangement is the landlord.  I propose to illustrate with concrete examples what the committee found, and the House will no doubt agree that this practice should be stopped immediately unless the Minister for Finance is satisfied that in a particular case there are compelling reasons for allowing double rents to be paid for limited periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my intention to quote too many statistics during the course of this debate.  However, it is necessary to give some broad indication of the size of the bill for a major part of public sector accommodation.  I would remind the <Col N="10" /> House that this committee are responsible for the review of expenditure of Government Departments and offices and the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  These figures do not cover the commercial State bodies, the local authorities or other agencies which are funded directly or indirectly from Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>In the case of Government Departments and offices the Office of Public Works paid out £17 million for rental of accommodation plus maintenance and service charges in 1984.  I should mention here that £887,000 was paid for unoccupied space, and this aspect was mentioned as a cause for concern in the committee's October 1984, report on rental/leasing and project control by the Office of Public Works.  It is estimated that rental of the order of £2 million was paid in the case of the State bodies falling within the terms of reference of the Committee on Public Expenditure.</P>
    <P>The sum of these two blocks of State expenditure on leasing offices and other accommodation, which comes to almost £19 million yearly, gives some idea of the scale of spending involved and the reason why the committee are concerned to ensure that value for money is assured at each step in the process of renting offices on behalf of the State.  It is quite clear that in almost all cases proper systems are in place to ensure that there is no overlapping of rental payments.  Our concern is related to those cases where we found substantial levels of double payments.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to examples that came to the notice of the committee of double renting and which in our view could have been avoided or reduced substantially. First, as regards Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the committee heard evidence towards the end of last year that BIM had signed a lease for a new headquarters in Crofton Road, Dún Laoghaire in October 1981. I regret to inform the House that the office block in question remained empty for three years at October 1984, at a cost of £867,000.  The reasons given for not taking over the new office were that due <Col N="11" /> to policy changes funds were not available for fitting out the offices and there was also, I understand, some problem about getting staff to move from Hume House, Ballsbridge, due to Dún Laoghaire being inconvenient for most of the staff.  I have been informed that all the staff are now in the Dún Laoghaire office block but that BIM have not yet disposed of their Hume House accommodation. Therefore, there is still a double rent system in operation at an annual cost of £¼ million to the Exchequer. This unhappy situation will continue as long as BIM fail to dispose of their &ldquo;old&rdquo; office accommodation.</P>
    <P>This one example shows clearly the problems that can and do arise when the planning process fails to take account of all the problems that can be encountered, particularly at a time when the property market is depressed and sellers are not in a position to obtain good prices or, indeed, dispose of their property at all in the short term.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority completed the transfer of staff from six separate offices to their new headquarters at Wilton Place in Dublin by mid-April.  The annual rental of this new office block is of the order of £1.2 million a year which, the committee were assured, was a good bargain for the location and the square footage of the accommodation involved.  We fully accepted that the IDA acted responsibly in moving to a new headquarters with a view to operating more efficiently.  We are, however, concerned about the delay in finalising arrangements for the disposal of their former office accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the IDA's case rent became payable from November 1984, though again the existing offices were not expected to be sold before June of this year.  The rental of the former accommodation, excluding the new headquarters was over £¾ million in 1984, with a further £416,000 paid by way of overlapping rent in 1985.  I must say at this point that the committee fully accept that in the property area, as with any other major financial transaction, certain decisions must be taken in an <Col N="12" /> atmosphere of confidentiality and also by reference to the need to avoid weakening a negotiating position.  The reason I say this is that the argument has been advanced that current accommodation cannot be advertised or otherwise put on the market too early, as this would tend to depress the price if potential buyers are alerted to the fact that there was pressure to dispose of a particular property. This view is acceptable up to a point, but it is somewhat of a two edged weapon because, equally, it can be said that agencies trying to sell property after they move to new accommodation can find themselves in a position of attempting to sell at all costs and may be in an even weaker negotiating position than they might have been.</P>
    <P>One final comment I would make on this particular issue: the committee accept fully the autonomous decisions taken by the various State-sponsored bodies, particularly where they are intended to make their operations more efficient and cost-effective.  We do, however, reserve the right to review and examine any areas of expenditure where we feel there may be waste involved.  By any standard, the question of overlapping of rents and other costs on office accommodation cannot generally be justified and the committee are determined to ensure that the practice is reduced or eliminated at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I now turn to premises under the control of the Office of Public Works where examples of double payments of rents occurred.  Unfortunately, I do not have the actual amounts involved to hand, as I understand that OPW regard this information as confidential.  For the Office of Public Works, Furniture Division, rent was paid in respect of a property at Mountshannon Road, Kilmainham, which was being fitted out for use by the division while rent was also being paid in respect of a warehouse at Bonham Street being used by the division for the storage of furniture.  Double payment occured from 1 January 1984 to 30 December 1984.  The area of the warehouse is 60,530 square feet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> For the Council for Status of Women, Merrion Square, rent was paid for space in Lower Mount Street from 1 March 1984.  Former premises in Merrion Square were surrendered on 13 June 1984 following the transfer of staff of the council. The area of the new premises is 1,517 square feet.</P>
    <P>For the Department of Agriculture and Social Welfare, Killarney, rent was paid in respect of a property at Park Road, Killarney, which was being fitted out for use by the two Departments. Rent was also being paid in respect of their existing accommodation at 58 Lower New Street and Town Hall, Killarney, respectively.  Double payment occurred from 1 January 1984 to 31 December 1984.  The area of the new premises is 1,292 square feet.  For the Department of Agriculture, Clonakilty, rent was paid for space in premises at Emmet Square, Clonakilty, from 1 September 1984.  While the premises were being fitted out rent continued to be paid in respect of the existing accommodation at Wolfe Tone Street.  The area of the new premises is 1,264 square feet.</P>
    <P>One distrubing feature in the case of leasing new or additional accommodation is that it is very likely that different public sector bodies may be competing for the same premises, thereby pushing up the cost to the taxpayer.  There may be grounds for considering some form of centralised property agency acting on behalf of the overall public sector &mdash;the Civil Service, State-sponsored bodies, local authorities and so on &mdash; with a view to reducing unnecessary and wasteful competition for space.</P>
    <P>The committee saw the present problem as a possible symptom of what we might call a lack of a hard-nosed businesslike approach to management in the public sector.  It is our view that one of the prime causes of the problem of double renting in the public sector is that of the lack of accountability on the part of individual managers.  We are convinced that if a property manager is given a budget and specific responsibility, with all the rights and duties that imposes, he will be compelled to drive a hard bargain <Col N="14" /> and ensure that his secretary or chief executive is not left holding two separate blocks of accommodation which are a drain on the agency's budget and, by implication, the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I believe that a system of incentives should operate to encourage tighter management of property.  Conversely, managers who fail to meet their objectives in this field should be subject to some disciplinary procedures &mdash; indeed, there should be some mechanism for reducing the overall budgetary allocation of an agency by the excess amount payable in respect of double rent, where this is shown to have been avoidable.  I would hope that this situation would not arise in future and I am confident that if the committee's recommendations are implemented the new system will overcome any such possibility in the case of new leases being negotiated.</P>
    <P>The committee see the example of double leasing and renting as irritating examples of lack of value for money in the public sector.  We want to be constructive in our reviews and examination of public expenditure programmes.  Yet we would much prefer if the initiative for identifying and eliminating such waste of taxpayers' money came from the agencies themselves, rather than from the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General or members of the public who feel obliged to send us submissions because of their concern about visible examples of such waste from time to time.</P>
    <P>The four recommendations set out at paragraph 5 of the committee's report are self-explanatory and need no elaboration on my part.  Essentially, their implementation would ensure that no lease for additional accommodation would be signed unless there is an actual contract to dispose of existing space.  These recommendations will, we believe, assist the agencies involved and the Exchequer to ensure that no double rents will be paid in future and that scarce resources will, therefore, be channelled into more productive uses as a result.</P>
    <P>I recommend the committee's report to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very brief report, but it raises very fundamental issues.  This is the second report that we have debated in the House on the public accommodation which is generally monitored and controlled to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance under the Minister for Finance.  We have had two separate occasions here in the last six months on which to have a major examination by a committee &mdash; which is only a committee of the House, with limited enough resources but with a very good secretariat, it has to be said &mdash; into an area where the Minister for Finance has the fundamental responsibility.  He is the Minister of the day charged, not only with controlling public expenditure but with demonstrating that he is capable of doing that and setting the effective example to all others in the public and private sectors in respect of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>Here, to that extent, while I endorse all that has been said by my colleague, Deputy Joe Doyle, in introducing the report, I want it put clearly on the record that I do not want to see this report as being an occasion to criticise managers at any level in the public service.  Our role here as members of a committee is to bring matters before this House for action at the level where the action should be taken &mdash; namely Government level.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary contradiction that we have the Department and the Minister who are charged specifically with this control presiding, frankly, over such a scandalous example of waste of public money as emerges from this report and, indeed, from the previous report that we introduced in this matter some months ago.  I will give one example, namely, that under the office of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, which is subject to the Minister for Finance, we have noted that a sum of £887,000 has been paid as annual rental for unoccupied office space, close to £1 million paid as rental for unoccupied office space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Tuesday afternoon members of the committee go to Kildare House and <Col N="16" /> spend approximately three hours dealing with various points.  If the committee had not been established and if these facts had not been uncovered, would it be the case that the Minister for Finance, who lectures others regarding public expenditure control would not have had to answer for his failure in respect of this scandalous waste of money?  If the committee had not carried out their job, would these scandals have been brought to public attention?  Would the Minister have taken any effective action to deal with them?</P>
    <P>We talk about standards in the private sector, about the efficient use of money and about accountability.  The same standards should apply in the public sector. The people ultimately responsible in the private sector are the board of management and for that one substitutes the Government of the day in the public sector.  The person immediately responsible for any problem that might arise in a private company is the chief executive and in the public sector one substitutes the Minister for Finance.  It is time we got a clear indication &mdash; I hope we get this from the Minister of State here present, but more particularly from his senior Minister &mdash; that not only have they noted what is being said here but that they will take effective action.  Members of the Committee on Public Expenditure meet once and sometimes twice a week in plenary session or in subcommittee but all of their work will go for nothing if the Minister does not take action.  There is a limit to the amount of time that should be devoted to any matter if we do not get results at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>One point emerges from the report, namely, that the annual leasing costs for public buildings are £19 million.  That is not what we referred to in the last report when we spoke about buildings acquired or developed by the Office of Public Works.  They are in addition to the £19 million we referred to in this report.  The amount of money spent between leasing buildings acquired and so on is of a huge dimension.</P>
    <P>I stress that our two reports should be read together.  In the first report we <Col N="17" /> referred to unoccupied office space on the part of public Departments.  This was space that had been booked by them well in advance but which was left unoccupied for considerable periods.  This was not always the fault of the Office of Public Works.  There is a second dimension, namely, that of a Minister or a Department who booked accommodation according to certain specifications but who then required further developments, extensions, equipment and renovations before going into occupation.  That gave rise to scandalous overruns, delays in taking up occupation and a huge extra cost on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It should be clear that the responsibility rests with the Minister of the day.  He is the person answerable: there is no point in talking about some civil servant or some line manager in one of the Departments. They do as they are instructed, provided the manager is capable of managing. I acknowledge that there has never been the proper degree of control by the Minister for Finance &mdash; I was also Minister for Finance &mdash; and the Minister of State.  However, in the past two or three years this has developed to monumental and scandalous proportions.  It is time that the Minister, the person who is responsible, should bring in his proposals, not ours.  The Minister has resources available to him.  He must take effective action to deal with this problem and he must penalise Departments and other Ministers who are responsible for cost overruns.</P>
    <P>When we find rent being paid for office accommodation while existing buildings were not disposed of, it is time to take action.  Some of these practices would be totally and utterly unacceptable in the private sector.  They would have the company concerned up before their bank manager or even before the Revenue Commissioners to answer for the money not paid to them because of wastefulness. When we find all of this going on as a practice in the Department of Finance it is obvious that we face a serious situation.</P>
    <P>I will make some suggestions as to how one could limit the risks.  Appended to our report is a list of the rentals paid by <Col N="18" /> the Office of Public Works for the year ended 31 December 1984.  It is a fairly lengthy list, including the Department of Agriculture, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of Public Works and so on.  It involves buildings all over the city for every Department.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about rental accommodation only.  That list leads one to the conclusion that it is time the Government reviewed their serious mistake to cancel the decentralisation programme of public offices and buildings the previous Government had already launched and had begun to implement. The Government cancelled it when almost £3 million had been spent in acquiring sites, engaging consultants, making specific arrangements to decentralise the whole physical structure of the Civil Service and, more importantly, to make the Government, in the broadest sense, more accessible to the public.  That programme was cancelled without any serious consideration because it was done immediately the Government came into office, apparently as a demonstration of the determination of this Government and Minister, almost from their first day in office, to prove that they were not going to do anything to engage in what they would say was wasteful public expenditure on the part of their predecessors.</P>
    <P>We now know the consequences of it. It must be remembered that there were the social costs in this city, the congestion in this city, the normal desire of people to go back to their rural base.  There is the need to have a balanced, regional development programme, the need to build up communities throughout the country which is essential &mdash; and I can clearly recall that among the places involved in the planning of that programme which would have benefited and in respect of which money was spent was your own home town of Cavan, a Cheann Comhairle and about 15 other important centres throughout the country, all of which was scrapped without consideration. What happens as a consequence? Over a five years period that total programme would have cost something <Col N="19" /> of the order of £25 million or £30 million and, if developed further, would have cost more, as planned.  What do we find now?  We can now afford to spend £19 million in one year on leasing.  We can afford to spend up to £1 million on rent for accommodation we are not occupying. That is some efficiency in terms of control of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is time we had a clear indication from this Government as to precisely what they propose doing, or are we to spend more time introducing more reports and, at the end of the day, all we do is give rise to public apprehension?  Here I want to pay a special tribute to our chairman, Deputy Keating and my colleagues, including Deputy J. Doyle, in the House at present, who have devoted at least as much time to the committee as I have, because I have been engaged many times in the House here on the Finance Bill and other debates which are very time consuming.  If this and other committees are to spend time of that order, coming up with important conclusions like these, then it is important that the Government of the day take action.  Otherwise our examinations come to nothing.  But it will be noted that public reaction to these reports and to the hearings we have had has been very considerable, one of serious concern, indeed, to such an extent that it is welling up into, I think, a mood of anger towards all of us.  If we are to continue to expose matters of this kind we should be conscious that, unless effective action is taken, the whole exercise could be counter-productive.  When people read in the papers about double occupation, unoccupied space for which huge rents are paid, etc, and they read it time after time from our hearings and ask what is done, finding that nothing has been done, I begin to wonder &mdash; even in an attempt to serve the public interest &mdash; if members of the committee might not be undermining the public interest.  They want action on foot of this and that is what has not been forthcoming as yet.</P>
    <P>I might give another passing example which is the responsibility of the public service.  Looking through the report of <Col N="20" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; and there is a report on this before the House as well &mdash; it will be seen that the Civil Service Commissioners, and the involvement of the Minister for Finance by way of financing as well were gaily carrying on examinations to interview thousands of young people for the sake of filling perhaps five, six or ten jobs at the end of the year.  It would have been done again only for, in this instance, Deputy John Kelly, who drew our attention to this scandal and it was stopped &mdash; a waste of public and private money that would have continued without anybody asking: What is the purpose?</P>
    <P>There are three arms of the Constitution. There is this arm which legislates. We here pass laws &mdash; that is our job &mdash; invariably proposed, though it is meant to be open to any side of the House, by the Executive of the day.  The Executive or Government have the role of managing. I insist that what we are talking about here is a management failure.  Committees of the House can review, examine, criticise, but we have no power to change. Our reports are meant to ensure that change will be brought about by those who have the responsibility to do so, namely, the Minister.  Of course the other arm of the Constitution is the Judiciary, who can review the actions either of ourselves or of the Executive in terms of the constitutionality of what we do.  There is no point in our being confused in our minds that we are now going to establish a new responsibility for individual civil servants; we are not.</P>
    <P>In the course of our examination and discussions with representatives of semi-State bodies or Departments it might appear sometimes that we have been somewhat sharp or critical of individual civil servants or semi-State body officials. If we have, I should say that that is not the way we would want to proceed.  Though it is important that each of them should have the same degree of alertness and awareness &mdash; undoubtedly they have authority and commitment &mdash; they are not the people who can effect change. The only people who can change procedures and decisions are real managers at <Col N="21" /> the top.  I wonder how they discharge their functions.  For instance, I should like to know from the Minister present in the House how often he has met, in a management capacity, with the officials within the Office of Public Works to discuss each of the issues we have talked about.  Is there a system whereby they report to him each day, each week, each month?  How does he discharge his role as assistant chief executive to the chief executive, the Minister for Finance? Does he carry out a regular check on new accommodation being leased?  Does he have a function, which does not just mean that there is a State car available to him and a private office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When replying would the Minister indicate the normal procedures, the accounting controls, the accounting checks he as a Minister conducts? That is a question anyone would ask of a chief executive or an assistant chief executive at a shareholders' meeting. How much time does the Minister spend on this?  That is something we need to know; and if he does not spend time on it he might as well forget it and let a civil servant or a consultant do the job.</P>
      <P>Deputy Doyle says that he was concerned about the lack of accountability on the part of individual managers.  How can one have accountability from them if one does not have accountability from the chief executive?  If the chief executive or the assistant chief executive have accountability then individual managers will respond.  If we do not have accountability at the top we will not get it down the line.  Deputy Doyle suggested that he would prefer the initiative to come from the agencies, the semi-State bodies or the Office of Public Works.  The initiative must come from the Ministers in authority. They have the responsibility.  If the Ministers do not take responsibility we will get a new principle introduced into the Constitution.  Committees operate effectively in the United States because it is the Legislature testing the Executive, and the Secretary of State comes before the committee.  After all the reviews we have had, it is now time that, in addition to civil servants coming before us, Ministers will come before us.  If this procedure is to have any worthwhile meaning we should get clear in our minds who holds the real responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to mislead the House about decentralisation proposals but, as far as I can recall, these proposals were passed in 1980.  A short while ago I mentioned a figure of £19 million or £20 million. The total figure over the five year period may have been closer to £45 million. It has been clearly demonstrated that the implementation of those proposals as distinct from the cancellation of <Col N="23" /> them would have a very major impact.</P>
    <P>The building sector has taken quite a hammering in recent times as have its associated professions &mdash; architects, surveyors and others.  Almost all of the architectural bodies in this town have shed labour at a rate of almost two-thirds the level of three years ago.  In any work that is to be done on behalf of the State by any consultants I hope it will be scrupulously and clearly allocated without any degree of political favour.

      <P>I congratulate the Committee on Public Expenditure on their work.  This committee are proving themselves worthy in the work they have done to date.  They have publicised a number of areas in which the taxpayers money is being wasted by inefficient administration and inefficient and outmoded practices adopted in Government Departments.  This brief but important report is a classic illustration of the difficulties that we have in operating efficiently in the public sector within Government Departments.  I am sorry that Deputy O'Kennedy has left and that there are not other Members of the House available to contribute to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Deputy O'Kennedy has adopted the caricature party political approach that makes people outside of this House so cynical about what <Col N="24" /> we do here.  Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution gave the impression that this problem was created by the current Government and had only existed since they came to office.  Not only is that not true, but it is clearly illustrated to be untrue by the report we are debating. All Governments have some share of the blame for inadequate financial controls on Government Departments to ensure that taxpayers' money is used to the maximum benefit of the taxpayer and the general public and to ensure that money is not squandered unnecessarily either due to inefficiency or incompetence.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  A political black mark can be awarded to all Governments and this is attested to on page 2 of this report when it mentions, in referring to an example of double renting, to the fact that one case into which the committee inquired in relation to BIM, illustrated that between October 1981 and October 1984, £866,545 was paid out in respect of an empty office block.  That significant waste of funds took place during the course of three different Governments being in office and included the period February to November 1982 when the Fianna Fáil Party were in office.  They are no more to blame than are the present Government.  The financial controls exercised were inadequate in these areas.  Proper attention has not been paid by Ministers in the past to the laying down of basic principles of approach and policy in the acquisition of premises for Government Departments and in the sale or offloading of premises that are no longer adequate to meet the needs of the Department, section of the Department or State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report because it highlights the problem, which needs to be tackled on two levels.  Deputy O'Kennedy's approach apparently is simply to blame the Government and the current Minister for everything and that it will take the intervention of a Minister in any Government to resolve the problem.  The function of Government is to lay down basic principles of approach to be adopted in dealing with the acquisition of premises. One of the basic principles <Col N="25" /> outlined here is in effect that generally in no circumstances should a rental liability be incurred until a purchaser is available or can be found for existing premises that are to be vacated, unless there is a very exceptional reason for incurring a new liability earlier.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual in the private sector, when premises are being sought, to arrange one's business affairs in a way whereby the lease for a new premises commences only upon the completion of the transfer of previous premises or of premises in which the business operated prior to acquiring the new premises.  I find no logic in the explanations given by Government Departments for the way they have dealt with this issue, and I find it inexplicable that ten or 15 years ago basic principles of approach were not laid down at a political level.  It is not just a question of Ministers or the Minister or Government of the day.  If a Government Department want to rent an office somewhere, if they need to rent the office and if the managerial structures within the Civil Service are operating correctly, the Minister should not have to examine every individual possible rental arrangement. Strict guidelines should be laid down and strict financial criteria applied, and after that it should be the job of the person or persons in the Department or the OPW who are concerned with the rental of the premises to ensure a degree of co-ordination between the acquisition of new premises and the offloading of old premises.</P>
    <P>Are we going to create a situation where, if some Government Department want to open an information office in Athlone, the Minister must engage directly in the negotiations for the amount of rent to be paid and must examine the <i>minutiae</i> of the contents of the lease?  That would be nonsense.  Basic guidelines to lay down the principles applicable for acquisition of new premises and offloading of old premises are necessary.  Rigid financial control must be exercised and a basic principle should be that you do not acquire new premises unless sensible steps have been taken to offload old premises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Another complaint which arises in this regard I put soundly at the door of the OPW.  There are two problems in this area.  One is the offloading of premises. The other is the fitting out of premises acquired for use by Government Departments. All too frequently premises are rented, leases are signed, public expenditure is being incurred monthly or quarterly, rental payments are being made, and it takes the OPW months to get round to deciding how premises should be fitted out.  When they find that out it takes them months and sometimes years to fit them out properly and, that being done, on a number of occasions they are not fitted out properly.</P>
    <P>One classic example of that with which I am familiar as a practising lawyer is the premises on Ormond Quay, Ormond House, where presumably moneys were spent in providing court facilities and fitting them out.  The facilities are better than existed previously, but for the money spent all that should have been done in a far better way.  An instance which came to mind, which was not the fault of the OPW solely but there were delays in occupying the premises, was the premises in Harcourt Street which had been acquired for the Garda and which as far as I am aware &mdash; I do not wish to misrepresent the position and the Minister might confirm or deny this &mdash; were leased for something like 18 months to two years before they were occupied while they were being fitted out appropriately for occupation by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why when the State acquired premises in the past it has taken so long to offload or before any steps were taken to offload existing premises and, secondly, when we simply acquire premises it takes the OPW so long to fit them out.  It seems that as soon as we sign the lease as the State in acquiring premises we start to pay rent immediately. In the private sector things do not always operate in that way.  In the private sector if a major business takes up a lease in a property and if that major business is regarded by the landlords of that property as a business providing a secure rent <Col N="27" /> for years forward, a business that in a sense is the foundation stone of the lettings of a property, very often in those circumstances in the commercial sector that business concern might sign a lease and not have a rental commitment &mdash; they may not have to pay rent for six months or a year after the lease has been signed.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual in major shopping centres in Dublin, when the developers of such want to lease out shops or premises for them, to try to attract one of the major supermarket chains into providing a base store within that shopping centre both to attract customers to it and to provide a secure rental basis for its operation.  In return for one of the major supermarket chains like Quinnsworth, Dunnes Stores, Williams, Tesco or whatever taking up that type of rental they will be given often a year's grace in the payment of rent following their taking up of that type of lease.  Even the simple businessman occupying a 300 sq. ft. shop in the centre of Dublin and signing a lease will often get two or three months' grace in the payment of rent so that he is afforded an opportunity to fit out his shop and open for business.  On some occasions State-sponsored bodies or Government Departments may have been given that type of facility, but information that has been made available to me, not just through this committee but from elsewhere, indicates that all too often when the lease is signed the obligation to pay rent becomes immediate and premises are left vacant not merely for months but for years while they are being made suitable for the purpose for which they have been acquired.</P>
    <P>The general public regard State inefficiency in this area as outrageous and in a depressed economy in an era of financial stringency, where there is not sufficient money to go round and where many of us would like to see additional funds available for other services and needs, it is indefensible for any public sector organisation, any State-sponsored body, any Government Department to waste £1,000 or £100 of taxpayers' money, <Col N="28" /> never mind something in the region of £800,000, as is referred to in this report.</P>
    <P>Last year £887,000 was paid out by the State for unoccupied space.  That is as near to £1 million as makes no matter. What commercial body could survive or operate if they were basically sitting on premises and throwing away £1 million a year?  The outrage members of the public feel about that type of approach is well justified.  These moneys seem to disappear into a departmental black hole.  Endless payments of rent are made for premises which are unoccupied.  There does not appear to be any sense of urgency to get rid of them.  We cannot afford that type of black hole.</P>
    <P>I wish I had £1 million available to me to spend on basic social needs or to make available to social organisations.  I should like to see that £1 million being made available to the Youth Employment Agency to assist in the creation of jobs. We cannot afford to throw away that type of money.  It is not a question of saying this Minister or that Minister is responsible. There should be a sense of awareness and responsibility within Government Departments and in the Office of Public Works that that is not tolerable, that that type of laxity which possibly we could luxuriate in in the sixties is not to be tolerated.  Within Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies there must be a real sense of accountability for financial wastage of that nature.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for people to throw their hands up in the air and say: &ldquo;We did not think of it.  We did not worry about it.  We were trying to get rid of the premises.  We did not tell anybody that our premises were available for rent because we did not want the new people we would be negotiating with to hike up the rent.&rdquo;  When a Government Department approach developers to acquire property, the developers are aware that the Government Departments would not be approaching them unless they needed the property.  I do not see the logic or any defence in saying: &ldquo;We cannot do anything about putting our own premises on the market until we acquire the other <Col N="29" /> property because, if we do that, it may result in the person from whom we are trying to lease new property upping the rent.&rdquo;  If you have your property on the market, you obviously do not sign contracts to vacate it, or transfer your leasehold interest in it, to someone else until you have got your alternative property.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in the commercial sector in operating a practice whereby you try to find a purchaser for your existing premises and make it known that they are on the market before you sign a lease, or a legal commitment, or a contract to acquire new premises.  The Committee on Public Expenditure were mild in their language in dealing with the rationale given to them for the current approach in dealing with this area.  The current approach, as justified to them, has absolutely no credibility and no justification and would not be tolerated in any circumstances in a commercial organisation of any nature.  Any commercial organisation who tolerated it would be put into liquidation very rapidly.</P>
    <P>Another point is worth making which was not made by the Committee on Public Expenditure &mdash; they might look at it at a later stage &mdash; or by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The appendix to the report lists the annual cost of the rental for various premises.  The point was made in an earlier report that the actual rental terms negotiated were not all that bad.  I would take the view that, when the State rents a premises, it should not necessarily expect to have to rent them at the full commercial rate.  It should expect from the landlord, or the developer of the premises, the lessor of the premises, some discount in view of the fact that, if you are renting to the State or a semi-State body &mdash; let us confine it to the State considering the performance recently of one or two semi-State bodies &mdash; you have a guarantee, secure rent with a reputable tenant in your premises for 20, 25, 30 or 35 years.  You have a degree of security in rental payments that you cannot be guaranteed from anyone in the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>The State is entitled to seek some degree of discount on rents in return for <Col N="30" /> providing the landlord or owner of the building with that level of rental security. The same should apply to bodies in the semi-State sector.  I suppose, considering the fate of one or two bodies recently, one cannot necessarily always say that landlords would have that guaranteed security from them.  When a Government Department are taking over a premises, there is that security and, in return for providing that security of rental, the State is entitled to a discount.  The general public and the taxpayers are entitled to say that should be one of the principles involved when the State is trying to negotiate the acquisition of premises, and more particularly at present when rental payments are depressed and properties are available on the market.</P>
    <P>I was about to make a point in the context of the appendix and the overall amount of rental payments being made. It appears from that appendix and the report from the committee that currently we are spending £19 million a year on rental payments for Government Departments and premises rented by State-sponsored bodies.  That is not chicken feed.  It is a substantial sum.  As it arises in respect of rented premises, it is an ongoing public liability of a nature that will never decrease.  It can only get bigger.  It will get bigger because leases being what they are, rents being what they are, and with inflation increasing albeit by a good deal less at the moment than in past years, rents will increase.  I presume that many of the leases Government Departments have signed provide rent review clauses on a five yearly basis. I will be interested to know that.  What is the basic leasehold arrangement?  How often are rents reviewed under the leases that Departments and State-sponsored bodies have entered into?  Are they three year rental reviews of five years or seven years?  What are the basic criteria?  I hope the Minister will tell us that.</P>
    <P>Because of the approach indicated in this report, I should like to be assured that the basic commercial criteria in relation to office buildings are applied and that the State has not got itself hung up or tied into leases which produce reviews <Col N="31" /> every two or three years in respect of rent.  Perhaps we could have that clarified. The rental commitment is an ongoing public expenditure which can only increase because of rent review clauses which will result in increasing amounts of rents and because, as Government Departments or semi-State bodies move from old fashioned premises to more modern and more usable premises, they will find themselves faced with paying higher rents.</P>
    <P>As someone who has been in this House since 1981 only, I wonder when did we start renting premises for Government Departments in the way we do.  At what stage did this State involve itself in major rental commitments, major financial capital commitments of this nature on an annual basis?  To what extent has it been increasing annually?  In the twenties and thirties was there a major State liability for rental payments for Government Departments, or did we own most of the buildings in which Government Departments operated?  When did we start renting premises?  In recent years have we rented premises at a far greater rate than we did in the past?  The problem with renting premises is that it is an ongoing public liability.  I wonder whether some of the premises rented by Government Departments are in the overall long term interests of the State.  Would it not be better if these Government Departments acquired purpose build buildings?  That would require a major financial investment which presumably in the current financial crisis we could not undertake.  I believe we should not presume that from now to the end of this century, through the next one and the one after that the State should always rent premises this way, that it should keep on accumulating more and more rented premises.  Should we not be looking at the practicalities and the ultimate cost savings of capital investment in building some of the premises which the State is now committed to?</P>
    <P>I presume most of the leases are for 35 years.  The expenditure involved over 35 years in the rental of some of these buildings which are listed is very high.  The <Col N="32" /> rent for Agriculture House at the moment is nearly £200,000 a year; Apollo House is £250,000 a year; Ardee Road and Baggot Street, the Central Statistics Office, Public Service, Revenue Commissioners, £270,000 and £289,000 a year.  On Castle House for the Revenue Commissioners the rent is £300,000 a year.</P>
    <P>How much would it have cost the State to build some of those premises and, if necessary, to raise loans to build them? The money the State would have paid off in respect of loan repayments would not necessarily have been a greater amount than the sum we are currently paying in respect of rent.</P>
    <P>The benefit of the capital investment, if necessary by way of loan, is that it would be finite.  At the end of a particular period of time no loan repayments and no rent payments would have to be made because the State would own the buildings. For Castle House £300,000 per annum is being paid, Earlsfort House nearly £600,000 per annum is being paid for the Revenue Commissioners, D'Olier House £434,000 is being paid and for Harcourt Square, the Department of Justice nearly £900,000 per annum is being paid.  Those premises are now occupied by the Garda.  They are fine premises and I am sure the building of them involved a major capital investment for the developer who undertook it.  It was only undertaken by him because he would make a profit out of it.  Presumably after seven, eight, nine or ten years of rental payments from the State he will have all his money back.  Presumably Irish Life, or whoever owns these premises, will have all their money back and after that it is all profit.  Are we entitled to tie not merely this generation but future of generations of taxpayers into major annual financial outlay in respect of office premises and buildings rented by the State which could probably just as well have been built by the State, by loans if necessary?  I suspect that the loan repayments on the various buildings would not have cost much more than the rental payments and after eight or ten years the State would have owned the premises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> The Committee on Public Expenditure have produced a very valuable report.  I ask them to go back and look at the whole policy consideration of the desirability of the State continuing to rent premises from the private sector and to look at the feasibility of the State in the future providing its own premises, the cost implications of that and the possible long term financial saving which could be incurred.  I presume, in the context of many of these premises and the current liability of £90 million a year, it is too late to do that, because presumably we are stuck with many of these buildings for the next 25 or 30 years.  I am very interested in the committee finding out that information as well.  How long have the leases to run on each of these premises and what are the arrangements in relation to rent reviews?</P>
    <P>The last item I want to mention is one with which I as a Member of this House have little tolerance.  It is the attitude of the Office of Public Works.  It should be stated in this House that the approach taken by them is not merely unacceptable but is intolerable.  Deputy Joe Doyle, in his very able speech introducing this report and illustrating the problems we have in this area, referred to this matter. He referred to premises under the control of the Office of Public Works where double payments of rent are being made. He recorded that his committee do not know the actual amounts involved because the Office of Public Works regarded that information as confidential. The Office of Public Works were directly involved in paying double rents where one premises were vacated by a group or organisation or by the Office of Public Works and another premises acquired &mdash; rent was still being paid for the vacant premises as well as the newly acquired premises.  The Office of Public Works are refusing to make that basic information of how much money is being wasted available to a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas reporting on an issue of this nature.</P>
    <P>That should not be tolerated.  The Minister of State in the Office of Public Works is democratically responsible to <Col N="34" /> this House.  This House is entitled to information about what additional rents are being paid out by the Office of Public Works in the context of premises which have been vacated.  The Committee on Public Expenditure, who have been authorised by this House to investigate matters relating to public expenditure, who have been investigating the wastage of public funds, are denied information by the Office of Public Works on what rent they are paying out because an official in the Office of Public Works, or perhaps it is the Minister of State, says &ldquo;this is confidential.  You are not entitled to the information&rdquo;.  That should not be tolerated, and I want an explanation in relation to it.  I do not want an explanation of why they think it is confidential because I do not believe there could be any justification whatsoever for any Government Department, who have incurred a financial liability they are meeting by using the taxpayers' money, to tell Members of this House &ldquo;We cannot tell you what we are paying out&rdquo;. There cannot be any justification which I would regard as plausible for the suggestion that that information is confidential. That approach should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear what the justification is for it being confidential.  I want it to be stated in the House that the Office of Public Works will not in the future obstruct in any way the work of the Committee on Public Expenditure.  The committee are unduly diplomatic in dealing with that issue.  They are entitled to that information and the House is entitled to that information.  Perhaps only a few hundred pounds is being wasted or maybe £300,000 or £400,000 is being wasted.  As a Member of this House representing my constituents, who are paying their taxes regularly and who are looking at how their money is being used, and as a Member of the national Parliament of this State, I am entitled to know what moneys are involved in the context of double renting on the part of the Office of Public Works.  We are entitled to know the amount of money involved and we are entitled to know what steps are being taken by them to offload premises that <Col N="35" /> are not being used or are no longer required.  I ask for a full disclosure of that information.  I presume in the future work the committee will do they will require the co-operation of the Office of Public Works and I ask that they receive that co-operation in full and not just in part, because I do not believe that Members of the Dáil should tolerate any Government Department denying to a Member of the Dáil or a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas access to basic information in relation to a financial area concerned with public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report of the committee and I hope it will produce the necessary political response in the sense of the laying down of the basic principles to be applied in future in respect of the acquisition of premises.  I trust, too, that the report will produce the necessary managerial response within Government Departments on the part of those who are responsible for the acquisition of premises and that it will lead to taxpayers' money being used more frugally.  I trust also that we will produce a more efficient system of acquiring and fitting out premises that have been acquired.  The committee should go further and examine the more fundamental issue, that is, whether we should continue to acquire premises in this way or whether we should provide premises which ultimately the State will own.</P>
    <P>If I might be political in the context of Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution, it is noteworthy that the Committee on Public Expenditure were established under the aegis of this Government and established to do exactly the job they are doing &mdash; to investigate the manner in which public funds are being spent, to highlight areas where there is wastage so that the necessary governmental decisions may be taken in the future to prevent wastage in this respect.  Clearly the committee are being seen to do their work.  My only regret is that there are not present in the House other Members who would be in a position to contribute to the debate. The committee deserve our praise.  They <Col N="36" /> deserve also the co-operation of Government Departments such as the Office of Public Works.  If, within their terms of reference, the committee cannot require that co-operation by way, if necessary, of subpoenaing civil servants to give the information sought, those terms of reference should be amended to include such powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Invariably it is my misfortune to have to follow Deputy Shatter whom I find very difficult to listen to. Perhaps the House is empty because of the tedious manner in which the Deputy makes his contribution.  Deputy O'Kennedy did not make a political attack on the Government.  Anything I heard him say by way of criticism was by-partisan in relation to the matter we are discussing. The Deputy did raise certain matters in relation to ministerial responsibility but I am convinced that in that respect he was referring to all Governments.  Therefore, it is extremely unfair of Deputy Shatter to come in here and launch that attack without having heard the entire speech, in fact only coming in at the tail end of that speech.  The same applies to his criticising people for not being here when he did not see fit to be present when the main spokesman for this party was making the major part of his contribution.</P>
      <P>People are very concerned about the amounts of money being paid for buildings that are not being taken over.  Last year the figure was £887,000 and I do not know what it may be for this year or whether there are any buildings being rented now by the Office of Public Works and which have not been taken over. It would be interesting to hear how the counterparts of the Office of Public Works in other countries manage their affairs in relation to the renting of accommodation, whether they purchase all their buildings or rent them.  It would be wonderful if we were in a position to purchase all the buildings concerned here but we would be talking about borrowing millions of pounds and that is a prospect that no Government would be prepared to entertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> One of the spin-offs of the kind of difficulties the Office of Public Works find themselves in financially is in relation to the delays experienced by people in receiving payment for work carried out for the board.  This may be part of a chain reaction of moneys being voted to that office not being utilised in the way in which they were intended to be utilised. The Vote would be based on Estimates of whatever expenditure would be incurred during the year, whether in relation to the renting of accommodation or otherwise, but it would envisage the selling of existing accommodation where new accommodation was coming on stream.  It is difficult to understand why the Office of Public Works in particular seem to have to enter into these leases and pay the rents before the buildings are taken over. I do not think anyone in the private sector would be able to do that and since there is no tax rebate for the Government we are talking solely about the expenditure of taxpayers' money and that is a cause of much concern.  But all of this raises the question of how widespread this practice is in the public service.  I regret that we are not having a wider debate during which many aspects of public expenditure, including the expenditure within various Departments, could be debated, when we could debate how the various Ministers and the Ministers of State spend the moneys voted for their Departments.</P>
    <P>On the question of confidentiality relating to some details that the Office of Public Works did not consider themselves entitled to disclose, one would have thought that the committee would have been in a position to pass the matter to the Committee of Public Accounts or to contact the Comptroller and Auditor General who has access to the information and who would be in a position to assure the committee.  If, after examining the matters passed to him, the Comptroller and Auditor General had any reservations, he could advise the Committee of Public Accounts accordingly.  At any time this House can order accounts to be produced even, if necessary, overriding the wishes of an Accounting Officer.  The <Col N="38" /> authority of the Comptroller and Auditor General is paramount, exceeding even the authority of this Parliament.  He is an officer with enormous powers.  There is nothing to prevent Deputy Shatter from tabling any question he wishes in this area.  I do not wish to appear spiky in relation to the Deputy but each time he begins to speak he tells us he will not detain the House very long and then goes on for at least 30 or 35 minutes.</P>
    <P>I made a couple of notes regarding Deputy Doyle's comments in introducing the report.  One of the five points he made was that there should be no renting of public offices until contracts had been signed.  I do not know whether that has been agreed or whether it is something for the future.  Perhaps Deputy Keating will be able to enlighten us on that but if it is a simple matter one must ask why it has not been dealt with in this way before now.  We are not talking about morons when we are talking about top civil servants. They are intelligent, educated men who know their job.  Perhaps they are the ones who are seeking changes that are appropriate to the times we live in.  They have an input in this area and I am sure they would be in a position to outline clearly what has happened.  No doubt, there are many changes that they would advocate.  I am sure there are many things they are not happy about &mdash; for example, shortage of money, trying to pay bills, make ends meet and so on.  It must be awful when an Accounting Officer has to say to a Minister that he needs money to furnish a building.  There could be a union problem and so on which would not be up to the Office of Public Works to sort out.  It may be that the Minister should go to the Minister for Finance and tell him to tell the Government what is happening.</P>
    <P>No one is entirely responsible for this. Ultimately the buck stops here and the people who will read the newspapers this evening and tomorrow will see a figure of £887,000 per annum and wonder what kind of people they have elected.  They will ask what kind of fools are these guys who sit in Dáil Éireann.  We are in the front line.  The Minister can say what <Col N="39" /> he likes behind closed doors; but in the House he must defend civil servants, whether they are right or wrong.  If we have a constructive approach from both sides instead of each side slagging the other we could get something worthwhile from this.  More investigation needs to be carried out in other Departments.  It may well be that the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General has not the expertise to examine the methodology by which decisions are made in relation to public expenditure.  Perhaps it is time that this was examined at all levels of Government. That is very important.</P>
    <P>Every officer in every Department has to make conscious decisions before spending money and because of financial stringency this can lead to great inefficiency. This is one of the side effects of the financial situation in which we find ourselves.  It could end up that at the end of the day we would spend more money rather than less money.  It has been stated that an examination of rents and leases should be carried out.  When the Office of Public Works valuers negotiate with the developers of these properties they impress on them that they are a Government agency and that the rents they should be charged should be that bit lower than a commercial enterprise would be charged.  I am quite sure that developers are very conscious that the best tenant they could have is a Government Department.  The market rate must be offered, but they usually do a little better than that.  When he is replying, the Minister of State may have something to say about that.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State or Deputy Keating, who is chairman of the committee, might have the figure for the total amount of rent.  He listed the various buildings and the rents payable, but what is the total amount of rent payable by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the State?  Have the Office of Public Works property rented out to the private sector?  How much property do they own, or do they occupy all their own property?  Some of it might not be suitable for offices and might have been <Col N="40" /> converted into other types of development. Do they sell off those properties or rent them out to the public?</P>
    <P>I will allow the man who has lived with this for some time to get in and make his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to take this opportunity to address a number of remarks to this discussion on the report. In so doing I thank Deputy Briscoe for his gracious introduction.</P>
      <P>These reports from the committee should be interpreted as being constructive attempts to present a view of the possible systems which should be or could be put in place so that we could get better value for money.  There is a temptation to pore over the entrails of past mistakes and decisions but essentially our work is future orientated.  It is about how to try to ensure that better systems are in place in the future, if that is possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe asked a question which deserves an answer.  It is not clear what the precise figure for total rents for offices is, but it is a big figure.  If we are to house Government Departments and semi-State agencies we must pay the price for so doing.  For Government Departments alone the figure would be approximately £17 million for rent, maintenance and service charges.  The other £2 million of the £19 million which Deputy Doyle referred to is in relation to non-commercial State bodies.  If one wants a global figure one must add to that figures for the commercial State bodies such as the ESB, Aer Lingus, CIE, the Sugar Company and so on.  We are talking about a figure of the order of £30 million.  Further details can be provided if they are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this report is to look at that area which falls directly within the parameters controllable by Government, allowing for the fact that some State and semi-State agencies have autonomy, relatively speaking, and act to some extent on their own initiative in these matters. All the committee suggests in the report is no more than good housekeeping at national level.  It is suggested that people should not enter into legal obligations <Col N="41" /> which cost money unless they have already entered into legal obligations to get rid of existing obligations which cost money.  It is the kind of thing that a Member of this House, or indeed a member of the public, would automatically do in handling their own money.</P>
    <P>It is very important to bear in mind that the committee system is at pains at all times to try to ensure that we get a non-party, non-partisan political approach to our recommendations.  I wish to pay tribute to the members of the three parties represented on the committee for their co-operation in that respect. Despite the occasional provocations of this House, we must resist the temptation to revert to type on occasions in the context of these debates.  This committee are not interested in pillorying a particular Minister or Government; they are trying to ensure that the potential of the public sector is unleashed, as up to now it has not been fulfilled, to give the country the very best value for money.  That is not an unreasonable proposition.  We have had an exemplary non-party political approach at committee level, and I am sure that applies to other committees also.  When the recommendations of these committees come before the House, because they have a modicum of all party support, they should be more open to implementation.  We are desirous that they should be implemented but we do not have executive functions in that regard; that is the job of the duly elected Government and we respect that.</P>
    <P>Part of our function is to review systematically and precisely at regular intervals the numbers and the nature of the recommendations made and exactly what action followed therefrom.  We would not be interested in pursuing our work if it became clear that the major body of our work and recommendations were simply put on a shelf.  There would be no point in continuing with committee work if that was the case.  However, I am pleased to say that there is genuine and significant evidence to show that the Government are taking serious cognisance of our recommendations and have already implemented a number of them.  I am <Col N="42" /> hopeful that a similar, gracious and responsive acceptance of this brief and succinct document will also be forthcoming. It is important, now and again, to pick a precise area which is clearly intelligible to everybody and to make specific recommendations in that regard instead of making general abstruse references to the need for improvement and efficiency in the public sector.  But it is very difficult for a Minister to know where to begin and we are trying to be helpful in this case.</P>
    <P>It became obvious that there was a specific area of concern in regard to the unacceptable waste of taxpayers' money. We maintain that better systems of housekeeping will save money and, without cutbacks, will do the same job. Our committee feel very strongly that the public sector have been under particular scrutiny over the past number of years, and to some extent we have misgivings about the manner in which some of that scrutiny is misinterpreted.  Our desire is to try to ensure that we create an environment where people in the public sector are rewarded for their initiative and innate abilities and, to put it charitably, discouraged if and when they do not give of their best.  It would be quite wrong for the House to take public servants to task when they make occasional mistakes but not to reward or encourage them when they give particular standards of excellence. It is the view of the committee that there is no proper system for motivating and encouraging public servants.  When one speaks to people serving the State one is struck by their quality and calibre and, in many cases, their frustration at the enormous bureaucracy and the plethora of regulations which govern their every action.  Despite their best efforts they are often unable to rise above that and to give a standard of service which would be above the norm and of great help to the public.  That desire exists in the public service and it is our job to lay down the parameters and create the environment which will ensure that it can come to fruition.</P>
    <P>If I have an overriding impression of the last few years of the work of the <Col N="43" /> committee it is that the public sector is the largest underutilised and underdeveloped resource in the State.  We really cannot tolerate that because of the enormous burden of public expenditure and, even more importantly, from the point of view of the waste of human potential, which is probably the most tragic waste of all.  That should be a priority with all Governments.  In this case we can help by providing a system which is not open to ambiguity or ambivalence but which is clear and precise.  Nobody should sign on the dotted line to spend one penny of Government or taxpayers' money on a lease for a building until they can produce a document which proves they have got rid of an existing lease.  Occasionally there may be an exception where, for example, an emergency might arise or where particularly good value might be available to the State.  In such a case it would obviously be in the best interests of the public, the taxpayers and the State that that opportunity should be siezed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have a momentarily attentive audience but, unfortunately, it is all on my own side of the House despite the interests of the Opposition in calling for a quorum.  I was trying to explain that what we are proposing is a very clearcut model which we think, if incorporated into the existing system of operations by Government, will yield better results.  It is also our view that before we automatically get into the business of leasing or renting accommodation the Minister making the decision should have before him a paper which shows that the options have been studied. There may be occasions when, with the existing annual budget of the order of £30 million for rent, the wisdom, and the exact science of hindsight, will show that it might have been better if we built, acquired or purchased our own accommodation. That study dealing with the cost effectiveness of the decision should <Col N="44" /> be undertaken prior to a decision to enter into a lease.  The lease should not be signed until arrangements have been made to dispose of the existing leases. The only exceptions that might arise are those of an extraordinary nature and they should have the expressed and prior approval of the Minister for Finance or his Minister of State.  That seems reasonable if, in the judgment of the Minister, circumstances indicated that better value could be got by the State for the money being expended.</P>
      <P>If the report is implemented we will make immediate savings based on the experiences of recent years.  It is impossible to quantify the extent of them and I do not think it would be particularly fruitful if we did because the implication then would be that that kind of money is leaking or being wasted.  I do not think anybody should feel under a cloud because of the recommendations we produced. All we are saying is that as the years go by we get a little wiser and we handle things, hopefully, a little better.  This modest report, and these proposals, are designed to be seen in that constructive if evolutionary spirit and not in any sense of irate condemnation or any kind of heated disapproval.  We are not in that business; it is a wasteful exercise.  What is important is whether or not these recommendations, having been studied by Government, are feasible, practicable and can be implemented.  If so, they should be implemented.  We are convinced that if they are, all of us will be doing a good day's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe referred in passing to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am aware from my appreciation of the work being done by the Committee of Public Accounts, whose role is essentially retrospective dealing with the audited accounts, that there is a need to consider expanding that office to deal with questions of value for money and public expenditure.  It seems to be very unsatisfactory that the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose job in essence is to evaluate whether or not moneys voted by the House have been spent precisely on that purpose, he cannot go any further <Col N="45" /> than that.  He produces extraordinarily illuminating reports called the Appropriation Accounts, which is deceptive.  In those reports he gives us regular opportunities by pointing to places where it is clear that somebody should be questioning value for money of systems that are in place but it is not his function to do that.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts has been concerned to try to ensure that the set of status that govern his office be expanded to include the potential for that function.  I do not know if that office is adequately staffed but, certainly, he has a large number of staff.  He is a very busy person but I believe he would be desirous of taking that on board.  There would be a yield from it.  Certainly, in a number of cases our committee have been able to find a degree of inspiration in his reports which directed us in our future-oriented work.  In the light of what Deputy Briscoe said I believe their is a fair measure of all-party agreement in that respect.</P>
    <P>Our report does not seek to offer a set of constraints but is a new opportunity for examining again the existing system, to see whether it can be improved and whether we can do for the taxpayers what we regularly say we want to do, spend their money more wisely or, conversely, spend less of their money to do the same job.  The report offers come clear unambivalent precise pointers in that direction. I was very interested to hear the response of the Minister of State to those precise recommendations and I will be interested to hear, in due course, the studied response of Government to what we are saying.  Naturally enough, our committee in due course will come back to these recommendations &mdash; we have agreed to do so in six months time &mdash; to see how far we have got with them and to deliberate on the outcome of work to date.  I should like to thank my colleagues on the committee and to thank Deputy Doyle for so clearly, constructively and comprehensively putting forward the report this morning.</P>
    <P>I commend the report to the House and I would appreciate if it was treated on its merits.  I am not pretending that <Col N="46" /> the report has all the answers but I suggest, with respect, that in the light of recent experience which we believe is intolerable in the medium or long term, it has some solutions to offer.  As an all-party committee we hope that these systems will be in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the chairman of the committee. Deputy Keating, for the report. The House is indebted to the committee and, particularly to Deputy Keating for the work he has put into the report.  I should like to again point out &mdash; for the twentieth time &mdash; that the structure of Dáil committees is not being taken seriously.  The report before us is an excellent one but reports like it will have to be taken more seriously in the House. I am a member of the Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies which carried out an investigation of CIE hotels.  Irish Shipping Limited and a number of other semi-State companies, but despite the fact that I tabled Dáil questions, have written to the Whips on both sides, have written to the Minister and have raised the matter in the House, I have been unable to get the reports of the committee on the floor of the House. I shall be making further attempts to do that.  It is now more than 12 months since we completed our report on CIE hotels and a lot has happened in that area since but the House has not debated our report.</P>
      <P>Either we take the committee system seriously or scrap it altogether.  At the moment we are paying lip service to it.  I must ask if the report before us, which does not appear to be taken seriously because it is being debated on a Thursday, is to be consigned to the shelves and not acted upon.  The public think that we have this marvellous Dáil reform in hand but, in my view, it is not working and it is not serious Dáil reform although it is being portrayed as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestions and proposals in the report are excellent but I criticise the report from this point of view.  It has not taken a broad enough look at the difficulties.  Let me explain what I mean <Col N="47" /> by that.  The committee made some specific suggestions as to how the Office of Public Works might do their job.  I wonder if they considered whether the Office of Public Works should be doing that job, whether they are independent enough of Government to be doing that job, or whether a Civil Service organisation should be carrying out what is essentially a commercial operation.  I propose therefore that some serious consideration be given to the establishment of the Office of Public Works as a semi-State organisation away from Government.</P>
    <P>When it was first suggested that An Bord Telecom would be taken from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs people threw their hands in the air and said we were trying to wreck the Civil Service.  When it was first suggested that An Post should be run by a commercial board instead of directly by the State people also threw their hands in the air. It is no sillier to suggest that the Office of Public Works should be established on the basis of a commercial semi-State company with its own directors, publishing a balance sheet of how they conduct their affairs.  I know of no logical reason why we should not progress in that way. That is not to say they are not doing a reasonable job because the report points out that they have done a good job.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works who for many years have been a very solid institution, but the time has come for change.  The time for change came to An Post and An Bord Telecom as well as to other operations and they changed for the better.  Do we all not agree that An Post seem to be a better operation than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?  Do we not all agree that An Bord Telecom seem to be a better operation than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, because now we can see it, we know who is running it and we can raise queries about it in this House.  Yet, it can benefit from being at commercial arm's length from the Government of the day.  It is that type of independence the Office of Public Works need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> According to the report, in 1981 the Office of Public Works accounted for 43 per cent of the office rental market, and in 1983 that figure was reduced by 2 per cent, which is interesting.  Considering the dominance of the Office of Public Works in that essentially commercial arena where rents are set by market forces, it would not be illogical to say that this is basically a commercial organisation. That is the main proposal I wanted to put forward this morning and ask that it be looked at by the committee.  I see there will be six-monthly reviews and regular Dáil questions, and I welcome that, but they might look at this specific suggestion. That is the only criticism I have of the report.  I compliment the committee. We must ask ourselves if the existing structure can in itself handle the rental&mdash; leasing office accommodation in this very technical, professional and commercial arena which is beginning to emerge.  I see no reason why a semi-State company should not take it on board.</P>
    <P>I support particularly the section which calls for a strategic medium term plan covering the next three to five years.  I know it is difficult for the OPW to do that because they do not know what demands will be or where the space will be, but planning is something which you cannot turn off when times are bad and when times are good.  There was a Minister for Finance who said that planning was something you did not do because Ireland was like a cork popping in the ocean.  I take the opposite view.  The higher the winds the more difficult the oceans, and the more you must try to plan your operation and, if necessary, change and review that plan.</P>
    <P>One of our faults as politicians is that when somebody produces a plan we feel we should not change it one iota, or we must not change it after six months, or point it in a slightly different direction because that is failure.  If all the plans produced in the House were met to the last percentage point it would be a miracle. That is not the way plans work.  I suggest that the Office of Public Works take up this challenge, produce their plans and not worry too much if they do <Col N="49" /> not actually meet those plans because not to plan is a bigger crime than not to meet the plan.  I repeat that I support that recommendation particularly.</P>
    <P>This report talks about 35 year leases. Are the Office of Public Works aware that in the United States there is no such thing as a 35 year lease, or that in England the lease runs for nine years, ten years or 11 years?  On the Continent the longest lease is for 21 years.  The point I am making is that leases are getting shorter. If the Office of Public Works are dominating the market they should insist on shorter leases.  I know that is difficult but if OPW and Irish Life do not decide to lead the market in a certain direction, the market will not go in that direction.  I suggest that this point be considered.  As I said, 35 year leases do not exist in the United States or Britain and there is no logical commercial reasons why you should sign in blood for 35 years at this juncture.</P>
    <P>The banks consider this is necessary because these operations cannot be financed if they are not over a long period, but I take the opposite view.  The people who want the offices should tell the banks that they are prepared to take them for ten years, 15 years or whatever. I will make a bet that if this is done, these conditions will be agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that because it is an excellent decision.  It is very important that we get away as quickly as possible from the 35 year leases mentioned in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason, apart from tradition, why office space should be congregated in expensive areas.  In the Dublin suburbs and throughout the country rental accommodation is a fraction of the price charged in the central city areas.  I suggest that a policy might be pursued by the OPW of getting accommodation in Tallaght or some other suburbs at a more reasonable price.  It is very important that offices be decentralised not just throughout the country but in Dublin itself.  Many suburbs could do with that type of investment <Col N="50" /> and at the same time the Office of Public Works would save themselves a lot of money.  The estimated rental charge in 1984 was £16 million.  This makes the Office of Public Works the dominant force in the rental business.  Because of that they should not be led by market forces but should lead the market because whatever OPW decide, the rest of the market will have to follow.  This is such a small country that OPW can dominate the market.  If they decide there are no more 35 year leases, or go to the suburbs, or that the office should have more commercial independence through a semi-State company, I firmly believe the market will follow and the country will be better off.</P>
    <P>I put forward those proposals in response to Deputy Keating's request that one should look at this report in a constructive way.  I have been trying to do that.  The report is welcome and I would dearly hope that the reports from all the other committees that are doing excellent work in this House can get on to the floor here.  There is a system in the British Parliament whereby a report which comes on the floor of the House must be followed by an official document published by the Government laying out specifically the action the Government propose to take in regard to each report. There is a formal review system whereby this specific report will be reconsidered after some set period and the Minister will have to report to the House on what happened on each specific recommendation.</P>
    <P>There is an appalling difficulty in following up a committee's work.  I share Deputy Keating's frustration in that there is no point in producing reports if they are not followed up.  I particularly call today for Dáil reform, in the sense of these committees which are an essential part of it, being taken seriously by this House or else abolished, ending this charade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the committee's report.  Since the committee have been established they have done some excellent work in highlighting the <Col N="51" /> amount of public money being wasted continually by the <i>ad hoc</i> renting of premises that either are not required or that lead to double renting as in some of the examples given.  The committee are doing a very excellent public service and draw attention to the fact that for far too long we have been very negligent when it comes to operation by the public service and expenditure of the taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The ICI debacle may have decided many that the way forward was in terms of greater involvement of the public sector in the running of the State, but reports of this nature will probably have the opposite effect in convincing people that the less involved the public sector are, perhaps the better for the country.</P>
      <P>The figures given in this report are quite frightening.  No private business or businessman could afford the kind of losses and irresponsible spending which we have seen outlined in some of the examples given.  In 1984, £887,000 was paid by Government Departments for unused space.  That is almost £1 million and excludes the local authorities and many other agencies, including simply the Departments of State and the non-commercial sector of the semi-State bodies.  So many other sectors, many of which have been discussed in the House, are desperately crying out for aid and could do so much with that kind of money.</P>
      <P>The report mentions a number of bodies such, as the IDA, and again I was disappointed to see that £416,000 was paid by the IDA for rented accommodation which was not in use due to overlap. If you add that figure to the amount of unused factory space with regard to advance factories built by the IDA throughout this country, details of which were given in a recent reply in this House, it is staggering to think of the amount of public money which is being wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Brennan, suggested we look in a new way at the rental of offices and accommodation in general for public Departments and agencies of Government, and I agree with him.  We tend to keep these in very expensive areas <Col N="52" /> where rents are very high.  Many are in the centre city.  Perhaps the Government would consider moving into areas where it is found impossible to get any kind of business to locate, such as the inner city of Dublin.  Half of that area has been closed down because people do not want to or cannot trade in these areas for various reasons.  Perhaps it is time that the State sector moved in and took over the various existing buildings at a much lower cost.  Perhaps it is time they came out to the suburbs or to new towns like Clondalkin and Tallaght, where again it would be so much cheaper to rent accommodation. And it might not always be necessary to rent the accommodation. Perhaps accommodation could be provided on a permanent basis for many Departments of State.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we will have to look more seriously at the manner in which the taxpayers' money is being spent.  The public are annoyed when time and time again examples are put before them of wastage of public money and they feel that their politicians are not doing a good job.  I am delighted that this committee are making very excellent recommendations, many of which I agree with, on ways of avoiding this wastage in the future.</P>
    <P>We can all be good at criticising, but it is more beneficial to make positive suggestions. There will have to be greater accountability on the part of public servants for the manner in which they spend public money.  Some disciplinary action will have to be taken against those public servants who irresponsibly spend the taxpayers' money in projects such as were outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>I would like to develop the idea of locating Government Departments in areas less burdened by traffic problems. Problems of high employment are concentrated, along with traffic problems, in particular areas, such as Ballymun, Finglas.  Tallaght and Clondalkin, which would get a lift if we were to locate some Government Departments and agencies in them.  We would do much, not just for the morale of the people but to help to <Col N="53" /> build up strong communities and very viable new towns.</P>
    <P>It is no longer possible to have everything located in the centre of the city.  I know that the central agency of Government must be located in a fairly prominent position in the capital city, that there is need for great co-ordination between Government Departments and that the closer they are together the better.  However, many of the services being provided in the centre of the city could just as usefully be provided in the suburbs, with far more convenience for clients and public servants.  I should like the committee to consider that option in any future report.</P>
    <P>I should also like the committee to look more closely not just at rented office accommodation and premises acquired by Government agencies, but at other expenditure in purchases of one kind or another.  My own constituency contains several portions of land which have been purchased by various Government Departments but are not in use.  The Department of Education acquired many pieces of land on which they intended to build schools.  These are lying idle and are not going to be used because of changes which have taken place in the whole structure and planning of education in schools in that area.  That is one small area.  From time to time we come across disgraceful examples of enormous amounts of public money being wasted, not only in connection with the purchase price or rental of these items but in the time which the public servants have put into negotiating these purchases and drawing up very attractive plans of development which never come to fruition. That is particularly the case with local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is a great need to look more closely at all expenditure on the part of Government agencies, whether the commercial, semi-State, State or non-commercial State sector.  That in 1984 we spent £17 million on rented accommodation would surprise many.  For that money one should be able almost to acquire sufficient accommodation on a <Col N="54" /> permanent basis for the running of this State.  That our public sector is so big, containing so many public servants, explains the large amount paid out in rent.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to some Government offices I have been in which are not being used properly and where there is a lot of wasted space.  For example, in the Setanta building many offices are not being used at all.  I know there are problems with that building&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Given that we have such an accommodation problem in Leinster House, it horrifies me to see in the Setanta building so many spacious and luxurious offices that are not used.  I hope the committee will be able to find some use for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is anxious to speak and I do not want to delay the House unduly.  However, I should like the committee to consider how in future we will avoid the kind of disgraceful decisions that were made in the past.  I agree with the recommendations in Part V of the report.  We have to show the taxpayers and the public that we will not repeat the mistakes of the past.  Without pointing the finger at anyone in particular, there is a need to have one person who would have responsibility for all decisions regarding property involving all Departments and agencies throughout the country. I do not know if there is such a person.  I tend to think that in each Department different people negotiate leases and acquire the accommodation that is necessary.  There is no accountability by one individual who, at the end of the day, must be responsible for the decisions made.  The only way to make sure that mistakes are not repeated is to ensure that accountability is left, fairly and squarely, with one individual who would be able to stand up and justify the decisions made.   Of course that is not to say mistakes will not be made.  All of us know that mistakes will be made, but we should not have the kind of mistakes that <Col N="55" /> were outlined in this and in some of the other reports of this committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat at a disadvantage here because most of what was said was more appropriate to a debate on the Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  All of the criticism here today was levelled at the Office of Public Works.  Last November we debated the previous report of the committee and much of what was said here today referred to that report.</P>
      <P>It could be, of course, that the committee wished to have the opportunity of repeating the statement in their former report which we debated at great length last November to the effect that the rental and lease terms obtained by the Office of Public Works were generally satisfactory. I thank the members of the committee for what they said in that connection and also I should like to pay tribute to those who spent so much time and effort in compiling the report.  I like to see the office for which I am responsible praised &mdash;and it is indeed a rare occurrence to see the Committee on Public Expenditure praising any of the State's activities &mdash; but I wonder if it justifies taking up such a large amount of Dáil time so soon after we covered the same ground before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Office of Public Works are only marginally involved here. The gist of the report is that two State-sponsored bodies were involved in a double leasing situation &mdash; the facts and figures are quoted in paragraph 4.  I want to make it quite clear that these semi-State bodies provide their own accommodation. The Office of Public Works have no hand, act or part in this &mdash; although some newspapers alleged they had, following publication of the report. We had no part in the two cases that were mentioned and I want to make that clear. I repeat that the Office of Public Works have no involvement whatever in the acquisition of accommodation for the semi-State bodies in question or in the payment of the two sums mentioned, namely, £866,545 and £764,000.  I hope I <Col N="56" /> have made that clear to the Press and to the Deputies who implied that the contrary was the case.</P>
    <P>The first recommendation specifies that in each case involving new or additional accommodation a study should be undertaken as to the most cost-effective decision &mdash; whether to rent, purchase or build.  The Office of Public Works, and I as junior Minister, are most anxious to build.  We started to rent in the early sixties when we had all the whizz-kid activities in the area of Government.  Up to that Government, Departments provided their own accommodation.  I agree we should build but sometimes accommodation is needed in a hurry.</P>
    <P>I agree with the first recommendation of the committee, and this is what the Office of Public Works do where there is a choice.  However, you only have a choice of building, buying or leasing when accommodation is not needed urgently.  The time scale involved usually determines which option one takes up. Very often the urgency of the demand and the scale of the requirement means renting space provided by speculative development.  The building programme of the Office of Public Works is concentrated on specialised building for State services or in the replacement of rented space.  The allocation of finance for this programme each year dictates the extent to which the Office of Public Works can build new offices.  Likewise, the allocation they have for the purchase of sites and buildings determine their choice in this area.  It is the amount of money that is available each year for building or for buying sites that determines whether the office build or do not build.  The planning and erection of even a modest size building can take between two to three years and, as a result, building is not a realistic option in many circumstances.  It is an option that would be favoured by the Office of Public Works in certain cases where it would be feasible, but most people would realise it is not feasible in many cases.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation of the report reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> No lease should be signed unless a contract has been signed to dispose of the existing accommodation.</P>
    <P>I regard this as a counsel of perfection &mdash; fine in theory but very difficult, if not impossible, to comply with in practice.  It worries me that later in the report it is stated that there should not be exceptions. I do not agree with that.  One should make every possible effort to get rid of a building as quickly as possible if it is not needed.  I want to tell the House about the strictures there are on the Office of Public Works.  I say this, not in defence of Government but in defence of civil servants who operate the system. The first thing they must do with every vacant space they have is to ask every other Department whether they have use for it.  That is one of the criteria laid down.  These are the kinds of difficulties an office encounters in endeavouring to deal with a practical situation.</P>
    <P>When new space has to be found very often it is an urgent request to provide for an expanded service.  This morning Deputy O'Kennedy criticised the Government because we had vacant space, which was dealt with in the last report and with which I dealt specifically in this House.  Deputy Shatter also mentioned the Harcourt Street Garda premises where a long delay was encountered.  I accept that there was a long delay in equipping the premises and moving the Garda authorities into it. Even though it is political I want to explain again to this House how that arose.  Just before the transition from one Government to another a sudden Government decision was taken by a Minister of Deputy O'Kennedy's party after which the Office of Public Works were instructed to take this building as a matter of urgency.  I do not know what option civil servants would have had not to do so.  They did it.  I think it was news to the Garda authorities as much as it was to the Office of Public Works that they were to take that building urgently. Before a brief could be obtained from the relevant Department as to what was needed much time had elapsed.  Yet the <Col N="58" /> Office of Public Works must take the blame for the fact that it was lying idle. It should be remembered that it was a political decision taken by the Government of which Deputy O'Kennedy was a member.  The Deputy endeavours to attach a political stigma &mdash; over the fact that those offices remained idle &mdash; to the present Minister for Finance who should have known.  I might say that similar things happened when the Deputy was Minister for Finance and, if he wants evidence, I will produce it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked me to state if I had regular meetings with or control over these people.  I have regular meetings with the Commissioner and with the heads of every section of my office.  It should be remembered that the Office of Public Works encompass many areas, including national parks, buildings, inland waterways, a schools section, a post office buildings section which is still operative <i>vis-à-vis</i> the building of offices for post offices.  I have regular meetings with these people.  Together we endeavour to improve the system of expenditure of moneys and we do so daily.</P>
    <P>The priority of the Office of Public Works has to be to find suitable accommodation for the need at the best terms available on the market at any given time. Reaching agreement on the details of the lease and fitting out the relevant space, in the case of a large take and because of the constraints under which the Office of Public Works, as a public body must operate, may involve periods of up to a year or more.  The recommendation in the report is that we should sell before we buy or before we sign an agreement. I agree with that recommendation where it is practicable but I do not think it is in very many cases.  I would be reticent about the further stipulation which says there should be no exception to that. There would have to be exceptions.  With a time scale of a year or more involved it is not always possible to find a purchaser willing to buy a leasehold where vacant possession cannot be given for a year or more.  For example, many problems could arise during the fitting out period to delay completion, such as strikes, hold <Col N="59" /> up of supplies etc.  In difficult times for the property market it is not easy to find people seeking space and the amount of unlet space on offer at present bears this out.</P>
    <P>The committee's third recommendation is that the prior approval of the Minister for Finance should be obtained where it is proposed not to carry out a cost-effective study on whether to buy, build or lease, or where it is proposed to sign a lease for new premises before a contract for the disposal of existing accommodation has been signed.</P>
    <P>I do not know what semi-State bodies do &mdash; which are mentioned in the body of the report &mdash; but in the case of the Office of Public Works that rule already applies and has applied practically from the time I came into this office.  We have already implemented that recommendation and had done so before this report was ever prepared.  Any new office space that the Office of Public Works take at present must have the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  I am glad of that stipulation because it would be a farce had we a small section of the Department of Finance &mdash; which is really what the Office of Public Works is &mdash; going off taking and paying what they liked.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House two examples of the genuine difficulties the Department of Finance or the Office of Public Works would have in regard to taking space.  Less than 12 months ago the Department of Social Welfare wanted new office accommodation for a new service they proposed to provide.  The Office of Public Works had office accommodation just becoming vacant which could be used.  But the Department of Social Welfare could not use that space because they had to have particular accommodation which would make it possible for them to link into their computer system. Because it was necessary to link in the new service to their computer system at head office the relevant office space would have to be adjacent to it.  I accept that but it meant that it left available office space we had at that time not utilised by that Department.  In that case we <Col N="60" /> were forced to take particular office space whether it was economic and regardless of its price.  It must be said that developers of and agents for such office space have a peculiar way of ascertaining that perhaps that is the only space that will be suitable, putting their own price on it.  I do not blame them for that.  But that is another reason we should be building our own offices as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The fourth and final recommendation of this committee, in practice, is merely a reiteration of recommendations two and three which, as I have said already, apply anyway to the Office of Public Works. Therefore I do not propose to comment on them.</P>
    <P>The present rental terms are generally limited to 20 years, with a ten year break point and a seven year review.  In the past they were 35 year leases but none of those exists any longer; the limit would be 20. Generally, the rental of premises took off in the sixties, up to which time most accommodation had been owned by the State.  It was said that there were political implications.  I do not intend going into that here because I do not know whether that is correct but the Deputies know the stories as I do.  It was said that companies went out and built offices and had them let to the Government before they started.  I hope that is not true but I have my doubts.  Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned today that I should ensure that there is fair play in relation to jobs handed out.  I have been assured that there is nothing but fair play in this area and I challenge anyone to contradict me when I say that that was not the case until I came there.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the report says that the Office of Public Works indicated that £887,000 was the annual rental for unoccupied office space.  This related to buildings which were being fitted out.  These buildings are now fully occupied.  At present a rent free period is being demanded but that is only allowed because the demand for office space is not what it was, so it is easier to get that sort of relief.  Deputy Shatter mentioned that we should get a special discount from <Col N="61" /> developers for State involvement.  Developers do not give concessions to the State, they get what they can out of it.  For example, in a country town a dilapidated building was being used as a labour exchange and there was terrible pressure on the Government and on the Board of Works to get alternative accommodation. Eventually one place became available and as the workers were going on strike the developer could get the price for which he asked.  It was necessary to get that building as a social amenity.  That illustrates the kind of concession developers give to the State.</P>
    <P>I accept all of the recommendations as far as they go.  The recommendation that advises the Office of Public Works to make a commitment to sell a place before they buy one, will not work in most cases. It seems that the Office of Public Works is fair game for criticism.  The list of buildings and rentals in the appendix to this report was supplied by the Office of Public Works.  These figures refer to the total cost of servicing and maintaining these offices and that is a different thing from just rent.  The total figure was apparently described as being the rent but it involves much more than that.  Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding.  In substance the report refers to semi-State bodies and its recommendations are already in effect as far as my office are concerned.  In the two examples given most of the criticism redounded on the Office of Public Works.  However the two instances investigated were semi-State bodies with which the Office of Public Works were not involved.</P>
    <P>I thank the people who took part in this debate.  They are doing a public service. My office are prepared to co-operate with this committee in every way possible.  The officials in the Office of Public Works are doing their utmost to get the best possible value for the State in the matter of accommodation.  Their contribution has been recognised in the report of the committee and I thank the committee for that recognition.  When all the angles have been studied the committee acknowledge that we have got good value for money.  We are proud of <Col N="62" /> that mention in the report.  Mistakes will be made and some things will not work out and we are prepared to discuss these errors and improve and any assistance is acceptable.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State and the other Deputies who contributed to this debate.  When this all-party committee meets every Tuesday it is in a non-political atmosphere.  I was disappointed with Deputy O'Kennedy's contribution this morning as I would like the non-political atmosphere within which we worked in Setanta House to permeate this Chamber when we are discussing these all-party recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply said that he likes to see his Department being praised. It is not our job to praise or condemn.  I do not agree that it has been a waste of time to discuss this issue.  What we are discussing is £1½ million of misspent taxpayers' money.  It is clear that the Office of Public Works are not responsible for State bodies' accommodation.  Proper planning by the Office of Public Works will ensure that accommodation is not needed urgently as there are few unexpected demands for Civil Service accommodation. The pressure to lease at any cost should not apply.  The Minister made a point about employment exchanges. Surely growth in population can be estimated well in advance and employment exchanges can be built before a young population come to working age.</P>

      <P>Recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 in the report are contingent on No. 3.  We did not want to move away from that, and it is only reasonable to suggest that.  Deputy Brennan suggested that perhaps the OPW should not be doing the job they are doing at present, but this report is about how they should be doing the job as long as they are doing it, and they should do it as efficiently as possible; but that might be for consideration at a future date by the Committee on Public Expenditure.  Certainly we will examine the role of the OPW at a later <Col N="63" /> date and we will report on it.  Deputy Harney suggested that the Government but derelect buildings for offices, and parcels of land in the county which are not being used.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to add much more to what I have said in my opening statement other than that the committee hope that this short report will be helpful and constructive and that it will be accepted.  Our intention is to follow up this report in a few months with a view to examining to what extent the very reasonable and basic recommendations which we included have been put in place.  Deputy Brennan made an interesting suggestion here this morning that the Government should issue a report, a formal document, spelling out the Government reaction to all of the committee's recommendations.  We do not care whether the Minister or his office are only peripherally involved.  We do not care who responds to our reports, but we cannot debate publicly with semi-State bodies in the Dáil.  Someone is responsible.</P>
      <P>Again I thank the Minister and everyone who contributed to this debate.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an important piece of social legislation which I am pleased to introduce to the House.  It is the first of a series of Bills relating to children to which the Government are committed.  Together they will provide a comprehensive, updated, and extended body of law to protect and promote the welfare and security of all our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For most children childhood is a happy and secure time.  Most of them grow up in a warm, stable environment with caring parents who are committed to their children and to doing what is best for them. However, there is a relatively small, but <Col N="64" /> nonetheless significant, number of children for whom this is not the case.  Some are the victims of family misfortunes and troubles for which no one can be blamed. Some have parents who cannot cope with the pressures of child-rearing and the stresses of modern life.  Others have parents who could not care less about them or, worse still, who neglect or ill-treat them.</P>
    <P>Each year about 3,700 children are placed in the care of health boards to be looked after in foster care or residential care.  Most are reunited with their families after a few months or weeks, but some, unfortunately, remain in care for years.  According to the latest statistics, about 40 per cent of these children are placed in care because they are being looked after by one parent &mdash; unmarried mother, deserted wife, widow or widower &mdash; who is unable to cope.  About 14 per cent of the remainder have been neglected; another 13 per cent are in care because of a short term family crisis, 9 per cent have been abused either physically, sexually or emotionally and a further 9 per cent are in care due to marital disharmony.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of other children, not at risk in any way, whose parents require support and assistance in looking after them.  In most cases the support needed extends only to the provision of, say, childminding facilities while parents are at work.  In other cases, children and their parents require intensive social work support on a continuing basis.  All of these children and their families will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of factors have given rise to the need for this Bill.  The existing law in relation to children is based largely on legislation dating from 1908.  The Children Act of that year was a most enlightened measure at the time, but there have been radical changes in society in the intervening period which have affected our approach towards children in need of care.  For that reason it has become increasingly clear in recent years that there is a need for new legislation in this area.  Many of the existing provisions <Col N="65" /> have become outmoded and various gaps and inadequacies have come to light.</P>
    <P>There is now a deeper understanding of the psychology and needs of children and greater acceptance that they have rights of their own.  They are not insensitive beings, nor are they lesser members of the human race.  In particular, it is now recognised that, where a child must be cared for apart from his family, the most desirable approach is to provide the care he requires in an alternative family rather than an institutional setting.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to take account of other developments that have occurred since the existing provisions were enacted &mdash; for example the development of day care services and the phenomenon of solvent abuse.</P>
    <P>In view of the extensive amending legislation that would be required to give effect to the necessary changes, I propose in this Bill to repeal all the existing legislation in relation to the care and protection of children and to enact new, consolidated legislation.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill has been assisted by the recommendations made by a number of official bodies which have examined the child care services and by suggestions made by groups and individuals working with and for children.  The official bodies included the Committee on Reformatory and Industrial School Systems known as the Kennedy Report, the Task Force on Child Care Services, the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents and the Review Committee on Adoption Services.  I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my thanks to all those involved who gave so freely of their time and energy and who, in doing so, contributed in no small measure to the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was originally the Government's intention to bring forward a single, comprehensive Children Bill which would update and consolidate legislation in relation to children.  It was intended that it would deal with all aspects of the law, including the care and protection of children, adoption and juvenile justice.</P>
    <P>When we got down to working out the <Col N="66" /> details we found that this approach was impracticable due to the enormous range of issues involved, the legal complexities to which they gave rise, and the need to confront various problems for which there are no easy answers.  Rather than adhering to the ideal of a single Bill, which would have meant putting off any improvements in the law until the issues had been resolved, the Government decided to take each major aspect of children's legislation as work on it is completed. While a single Bill would have had certain advantages, I think this approach will help us to concentrate our minds on each of the main areas in turn rather than have to cope at the same time with the whole spectrum of child care issues.</P>
    <P>This is the first of the Bills.  My Department are already working on the scheme of a Bill to amend the Adoption Acts in the light of the report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services.  I hope to introduce that Bill in the House before the end of this year.  The Minister for Justice, for his part, has published the draft text of a Status of Children Bill which aims to eliminate, as far as possible, the differences which now exist between the way in which the law treats children born within marriage and those born outside marriage.  The Government are also committed to reform of the juvenile justice system and this will be the subject of a further Bill.</P>
    <P>Before going into the details of this Bill, I would like to describe to Deputies the considerations and underlying principles upon which the Bill is based.  The first and most important principle upon which the Bill is based is that the best place for a child to grow up is in his family or, where this is not possible, in a substitute family.  In keeping with this principle the Bill grants health boards greatly expanded powers to provide family support services so as to reduce to the greatest extent possible the need to take a child into care.  Where children need to be taken into care the approach will be to provide them with the care they require in a family rather than an institutional setting.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise, however, <Col N="67" /> that there is still an important role for children's homes and their contribution will be crucial in the development of a comprehensive child care services as envisaged in this Bill.  In the past they have provided an excellent service in a quiet and unobtrusive way.  Indeed, it is true to say that until relatively recent times they got little thanks for looking after most of the unwanted and abused children of the nation.  However, I believe that all who work in children's homes would now agree that in most cases it is better for a child to grow up in a family setting.  Equally, social workers accept that not all children in need of care can be successfully fostered or, indeed, that foster care would be the most appropriate form of care for them.</P>
    <P>Residential care will remain an important element in the range of provisions for children.  Children's homes will continue to provide the best answer for some children needing care and will continue to perform a variety of valuable functions in the child care service.  These functions include reception and assessment; emergency short-term care; and longterm care for children, especially older children, who cannot be or do not wish to be fostered.  They are also in a better position, because of the training and expertise of their staffs, to look after children with special problems who require individual attention and expert help.</P>
    <P>The second important principle underlying the Bill is the principle of minimum intervention in the lives of children and their families.  While it is essential that there be effective legal procedures to enable the State to intervene on behalf of children where this is necessary, it is equally vital that the law should protect the child and the family from unwarrented interference.  The Bill has been drafted on the basis that the State and its agencies are justified in intervening only where there are compelling reasons for doing so in the child's interests.  Where intervention is deemed desirable there are various safeguards in the Bill to prevent arbitrary action and to ensure that <Col N="68" /> the rights of parents and guardians are not ignored.</P>
    <P>That the child himself has rights &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;himself&rdquo; in the parliamentary draftsman's terms; it includes male and female children &mdash; is something that has received little emphasis in the past. The third principle upon which the Bill is drafted is that children have natural rights and these rights may, in certain cases, differ from and conflict with the rights of their parents.  These rights arise from the democratic nature of the State and include the right to life itself, the right to preserve and defend, and to have preserved and defended, that life, the right to live at a proper human standard and the right to be reared and educated.  In cases of conflict between the rights of a child and those of his parents, the Bill seeks to ensure that the interests of the child will be treated as paramount.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.  Part I contains short title, commencement, expenses, repeals and other standard provisions.  Section 2 defines the terms used in the Bill.  Pending the enactment of the proposed Status of Children Bill, this Bill has had to be drafted to conform with the existing law and terminology in regard to children born out of wedlock.  The Bill will be amended later to bring it into line with the changes to be made in the law relating to the status of children.</P>
    <P>Part II contains new arrangements for the regulation and supervision of certain child care services, namely, day care services, private foster care and children's homes.  The increase in childminding and playgroup activities in recent years has been accompanied by growing demands for legislation to govern the standards and operation of these services.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory registration of day care services for children, namely day nurseries, creches, playgroups and pre-schools, to be administered by local health boards.  My Department estimate that there are some 1,400-1,500 such services catering for up to 20,000 pre-school children.</P>
    <P>Registration will be dependent on the <Col N="69" /> maintenance of standards in relation to such matters as suitability of premises and facilities, quality of care, staff numbers and qualifications.  The detailed standards will be laid down in regulations which I will make under the Bill.  In anticipation of this legislation a working party of persons with a knowledge of the operation of day care facilities recently completed a report for my Department.  This report contains recommended standards which will be of assistance to me in preparing these regulations.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious to avoid increased costs for parents.  I intend, therefore, to proceed on a phased basis. Initially, the regulations will prescribe the minimum requirements necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children attending day care services.  Standards will be raised gradually through a combination of advice and support from health boards and, only in exceptional cases, through the imposition of sanctions.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to private foster care, or &ldquo;children at nurse&rdquo; is extremely detailed and is complicated by the fact that it is spread across the Children Acts of 1908, 1934 and 1957.  Briefly, the law requires any person undertaking the care and maintenance of a legitimate child for reward or an illegitimate child, whether for reward or not, to notify the local health board.  Health boards are obliged to supervise children in such care and have power to remove children who are not being looked after properly.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady decline in the use of this form of care in recent years. In 1982, there were less than 150 children notified to health boards as being in private foster care.  This decline is due to a number of factors, particularly the growing practice of single mothers rearing their children themselves and the greater availability of day care services.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will enable me to update the legislative controls in this area in the light of changing needs.  Responsibility for the supervision of children in private foster care will be a matter for health boards.  I have also availed of this opportunity to eliminate the differences which now exist <Col N="70" /> between the way private foster care controls affect legitimate and illegitimate children.</P>
    <P>Regarding children's homes section 15 provides for new arrangements for the supervision and the registration of residential facilities for children.  The new system will cover the 24 residential homes, formerly industrial schools, for which I assumed responsibility from the Minister for Education in January, 1984 and 17 homes approved under the Health Acts for the reception of children in need. The 41 homes together provide accommodation for about 1,100 children.</P>
    <P>At present, the residential homes are subject to limited controls under rules made under the Children Act, 1908.  The 17 approved homes are not subject to statutory regulation.  The Bill will enable me to prescribe requirements as to the standard of accommodation and facilities, staff numbers and qualifications, quality of care etc. in all the homes.  In addition, the homes will be subject to inspection by officers of health boards and by officers of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that, in future, a child may not be placed in a children's home unless the placement is made or approved by a health board.  This is in line with my policy of promoting foster care as the first option in caring for children apart from their families and preventing unnecessary or inappropriate use of residential care facilities.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out the procedures to be followed where children are receiving, or are at risk of receiving, inadequate care or protection.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is one of the most important provisions of the Bill.  It imposes a clear obligation on health boards to promote the welfare of children in their area.  It will enable the boards to provide services or facilities to assist parents in the upbringing of their children and prevent children having to be placed in care.  I am confident that even in difficult economic times the imaginative use of this section by health boards and their professional staffs will result in the development of new, community-based projects and <Col N="71" /> initiatives which will be of benefit to children and families generally.  Services which might be provided under this section could include home help and home maker services, child and family guidance, day fostering, remedial care, family resource centres and special projects for deprived or difficult children.</P>
    <P>Day care services are an important source of support for families under pressure and for parents who have to go out to work.  Official policy is to assist and encourage voluntary organisations to provide day care services, with support from health boards where necessary. There is not much point in having laws and policies protecting the right of a mother to work, if she so chooses, if we are not going to help her to do so by facilitating the creation of a system of safe, well-supervised centres to care for her children.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that it is estimated that about 20,000 children are attending pre-school centres of one sort or another. In most instances the service is being paid for by the parents of the children but, in some cases, because of the family home circumstances of the child, the health boards make a contribution.  In fact, health boards are supporting some 230 voluntary day care services catering for over 6,000 children at a cost of over £1 million per year.  While I intend to maintain the emphasis on assisting voluntary initiatives, in providing this much needed family support for the disadvantaged, section 24 will enable health boards themselves to provide day care services where there are no suitable voluntary organisations available to undertake this work.</P>
    <P>Under the present law, a health board may receive children into voluntary care, i.e. without recourse to the courts, only where the children have been abandoned or where their parents are dead or are destitute.  There are many other situations in which children may need to be placed in voluntary care such as while a mother is deciding whether to place her child for adoption, where parents are ill or unable to cope, in cases of marital breakdown or family crises.  In practice, health boards provide care for any child <Col N="72" /> who requires it and at present, about 85 per cent of children in care have been placed there on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Section 25 seeks to regularise the position by extending the powers of health boards to receive children into voluntary care.</P>
    <P>Sections 26 to 32 provide new emergency procedures for the removal to safety of children who are in danger.  Since the Garda are often the first to come across cases of neglect or cruelty, section 27 provides that, in an emergency, a garda would be empowered to remove, without warrant, a child in respect of whom any of the offences mentioned in the Second Schedule had been, or is about to be, committed or whose immediate safety required that he be removed.  At present the Garda can act without warrant only where an offence has been committed. Any child so removed would be placed in the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>A number of improvements are being made in the law in relation to place of safety orders.  This is an order which authorises the removal of a child from a situation of neglect or danger and his placement in the care of a health board pending the bringing of care proceedings. The grounds upon which these orders may be issued are being extended and there are new provisions to ensure that orders can be obtained quickly in cases of emergency.</P>
    <P>Section 33 updates and extends the grounds on which the courts may place a child in the care of, or under the supervision of, a health board.  Some of the existing grounds are outmoded and others are no longer necessary, particularly in the light of the provisions to strengthen the powers of health boards to receive children into care on a voluntary basis.  On the other hand, experience has shown that the existing legislation does not enable health boards to take action in certain cases where children are at risk.</P>
    <P>For example, where a child has been away from his parents for some time, living with a relative or in the voluntary care of a health board there is no provision to enable a health board to seek an order to prohibit his return to his <Col N="73" /> parents if they are unfit or incapable of looking after him.</P>
    <P>Section 33 provides that a health board will be able to take care proceedings where a child has been ill-treated, neglected, assaulted or sexually abused; where he is under the care of a parent or guardian who does not exercise or is not capable of exercising proper guardianship; or where he is receiving inadequate care such as to cause injury to his health, or unreasonable suffering or to impair substantially his proper development.</P>
    <P>A health board will also be able to take care proceedings where any of the offences mentioned in the Second Schedule have been committed in respect of a child or where a child is a member of the same household as a person who has been convicted of an offence mentioned in the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>Finally, in order to protect siblings, care proceedings may be taken where a court has found that any of these conditions is or was satisfied in the case of another child who is or was a member of the household to which the child belongs.</P>
    <P>Where the District Court is satisfied that any of these conditions existed it could make a &ldquo;care order&rdquo; or a &ldquo;supervision order&rdquo; in respect of the child.  Care orders replace the fit person orders provided for in the Children Act, 1908.  A care order would remove the child from his parents and place him in the care of a health board.  It would be a matter for the board to decide how the child should be looked after, for example, by placing him in foster care or in residential care. At present, the law allows the courts to commit deprived children directly into residential care.  I regard this as undesirable. I consider that the health board and their professional staff are in a better position to assess the needs of the child and to decide what the most appropriate form of care should be for any child.  As I have already emphasised, the intention is to care for most of these children in a family setting.</P>
    <P>A supervision order would enable a health board to ensure that a child is <Col N="74" /> receiving adequate care and protection without having to remove him from his family.  This is an entirely new form of order.  It extends the options available to health boards in seeking to protect children who have been neglected or who are at risk.  It is also in line with the overall principle of not removing children from their families save in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Part IV sets out the procedures to be followed and the arrangements which may be made by health boards in seeing to the care of children who have been placed in care, whether on a voluntary basis or by virtue of a court order.  I should like to draw particular attention to section 42 which obliges health boards to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family or where this is not possible to provide him with such care as is most appropriate to his needs.  This section will also require a health board to have regard to the wishes of the child himself in providing for his care.</P>
    <P>For most children, the best and most appropriate form of care apart from their families is to be found in foster care. Section 43 updates the law in relation to foster care.  I have decided to discontinue use of the term &ldquo;boarding-out&rdquo;, which has its origins in the Poor Law.  At present, only children who are orphaned or deserted or whose parents are destitute may be placed in foster care by health boards.  Since foster care is now the first option in caring for a child apart from his family, the new provision will enable a health board to place any child in their care in foster care.</P>
    <P>The existing law requires a health board, before placing a child in foster care, to obtain the consent of his parents if they are available.  There is no such requirement in relation to placement in residential care.  The refusal of parents to give consent results in some children being deprived of family life and of the happiness and security which foster parents can provide.  In 1982, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 70 children in residential care who <Col N="75" /> could have been placed in foster care but for the refusal of the parents to give consent.  I consider that this is an issue on which the rights of the child should take precedence over the rights of his parents.  I propose, therefore, not to reenact the requirement as to parental consent. Under the amended provision, the health board will take the decision.</P>
    <P>Section 45 imposes a duty on health boards to undertake regular reviews of children in care, whether in foster care or residential care.  This is an important safeguard.  It will help to ensure that a child's changing needs are identified and met and that the possibility of his being re-united with this parents is continually assessed.  It will serve as a continuing reminder to all those responsible that, once placed in care, a child should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Section 49 attempts to deal with a serious gap in the law in relation to children who have been neglected or ill-treated and who are placed in care on a voluntary basis by their parents.  At present, a health board have no power to refuse to return such a child to his parents on request, even if there are grounds for believing that the child will be further neglected or ill-treated on his return home.  Section 49 provides a procedure which would enable a health board to delay the removal of a child in such a situation pending the making of an application for a place of safety order.  I would point out, however, that a parent or guardian will have the right of appeal to the courts against such a decision.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for a new procedure which would enable persons who are bringing up a child apart from his parents, (for example, foster parents or relatives) to obtain a custody order which would grant them legal custody of the child.  A custody order differs fundamentally from an adoption order in so far as it would not sever the child's relationship with his natural family and would not interfere with his Succession Act rights.  Before a court could grant a custody order it would have to be satisfied that the natural parent consented to the making of the order or, where he did not consent, that the parent <Col N="76" /> was not capable of providing proper care for the child.</P>
    <P>It would be open to the parents or the person granted custody to apply to have the order varied or discharged if circumstances changed.  The aim of these proposals is to protect the interests of the child by affording legal recognition to the relationship with his foster family and securing it against arbitrary or precipitous interference.</P>
    <P>The need for this custody procedure arises from the fact that, at present, a child who is placed by his parents in foster care, or in the care of a relative, may be removed by them at any time, regardless of how long he has been in care or how attached he has become to his foster parents.  Apart from seeking to have the child made a ward of court, which is a complex and expensive procedure, the only option open to foster parents who wish to retain custody of a child is to refuse to return the child and wait for the parents to take action for his recovery under the Guardianship of Infants Act. There is growing support for the contention that, in exceptional circumstances, it may be in the child's best interests not to be returned to his parents but to remain in the custody of the persons who have cared for him over an extended period.</P>
    <P>I realise that this is a delicate area.  But a step of this sort would be an exceptional measure.  Perusal of the Bill will show that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that the measure is not abused.</P>
    <P>In this connection I might mention that the Review Committee on Adoption Services also identified the need for a procedure, short of adoption, by which persons who are bringing up a child apart from his parents could obtain a legal status in relation to him.  The committee were especially concerned about the practice of in-family adoption, for example, adoption of a child by his grandparents, because of the distorting effect this has on the natural relationship between mother and child.  It considered that the introduction of an arrangement less radical than adoption which would secure the child's <Col N="77" /> relationship with, for example, his grandparents but would leave open the possibility of his natural parent resuming care of him would, in many cases, be more in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The committee considered that such a procedure would also be useful in cases where adoption is impossible, for example, where the proposed adopter is not eligible to adopt, or where adoption might not be appropriate, for instance, in the case of older children who do not wish to be adopted and children who continue to have contact with their parents.  The provisions of Part V are broadly in line with the committee's recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Part VI provides for various technical measures concerned with the conduct of court proceedings involving children, rules of evidence and so on.</P>
    <P>Part VII updates sections of the Children Act, 1908 which provide for offences against children.  It also contains new restrictions on the sale of solvents to children.</P>
    <P>Section 82 increases the penalties for offences relating to the neglect or abuse of, or cruelty to children.  On summary conviction, fines are being increased from £25 to £1,000 with prison sentences of up to 12 months.  The present term is six months.  On conviction on indictment, the maximum fine is being increased from £100 to £3,000 and/or imprisonment for up to three years, compared with two years at present.</P>
    <P>Section 83 seeks to prevent solvent abuse, or &ldquo;glue-sniffing&rdquo; as it is generally known, by controlling the availability of solvents to children.  The variety of household products which may be abused, such as hair lacquers, cigarette lighter fuels, products in aerosol containers, nail varnish removers and petrol renders legal control difficult.  The main aim of this section is to provide for the taking of action against traders and others who sell products, including glue-sniffing kits, to children for &ldquo;sniffing&rdquo; purposes.  Provision is made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment for persons engaging in such activities.  I also propose to take power to ban the sale of certain <Col N="78" /> solvent-based products to children.  This power is a measure of last resort and is likely to be used only to control the sale of very dangerous substances which in general would not include glues.  In addition, the Garda will be given power to seize products which children are abusing.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to accept that this is not a complete answer to this problem. However, I do not think it would be realistic to attempt to enforce more stringent legal controls.  The provisions of this section will be complemented by greater efforts to educate children about the dangers involved in solvent abuse.</P>
    <P>There are two schedules attached to the Bill.  The First Schedule lists the enactments to be repealed.  I am availing of this opportunity to repeal a number of obsolete provisions in relation to children.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule lists serious offences against children to which certain provisions of the Bill will apply.  The commission of a scheduled offence against a child will provide grounds for the issue of a place of safety order under section 29, or for the taking of care proceedings under section 34.  Provision is also made for the Garda to notify the health board whenever such offences are committed so that the board can take any necessary action to protect the child involved.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will have the goodwill and support of all sides of the House. If it is shown to be lacking or requiring amendment in any respect I shall be very happy to consider changes on Committee Stage.  I have already invited the comments of the various statutory and voluntary agencies involved with children and, indeed, I would welcome reactions from anyone who feels he can contribute to the improvement of my proposals.</P>
    <P>So far, the Bill in general has been welcomed.  It has, however, been criticised because it does not give any indication of the additional resources to be made available for the improvement of the services.  The Bill is, of course, concerned only with the updating and extension of the legislation concerned with the care and protection of children.  I do not <Col N="79" /> need to explain to the House that the question of the amount of resources to be committed to these services is not normally one for legislation.  It is one for political, budgetary or administrative decision from time to time in the light of the resources available.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures in this Bill could be implemented without cost but I accept that we need more facilities and personnel to back up some of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, makes it clear that within the health services the aim will be to bring about a redistribution of resources away from institutionalised services towards community services, particularly those for disadvantaged groups.  If we are successful in this aim &mdash; and I am making every effort to ensure that we shall be &mdash; then I would expect to see gradual but worthwhile developments in our family support services over the next few years.  Furthermore, the area of the child and the family will be one of my first priorities in relation to any additional funds that may become available.</P>
    <P>I might mention that I had a small sum this year for new community developments and I have just allocated £375,000 of it to the child care services.  This will permit the health boards to give support to additional day care services; to increase payments to foster parents in some areas; to run some short term courses for personnel working with children and provide funds to help young persons who have been in long term care to make an easier transition to an independent life.  As the opportunity arises I shall continue to complement the proposed legislative changes by further allocations of resources.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to a comprehensive debate on its provisions.  I assure Deputies that I am open to observations and suggestions as to how the Bill should be improved in any way.  I look forward to a detailed Committee Stage and to having an opportunity to reply to the Second Stage debate in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome this improved legislation for children, such as the regulation of child care services for day care, foster care and children's homes and the provision of effective intervention in cases of child neglect or abuse, the new provisions for custody orders and the provisions for control of the sale of volatile substances, at the same time, I am disappointed for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the reason why there are three Bills.  The Minister's explanation for this worries me.  He said that it was impracticable due to the enormous range of issues involved and that there was need to confront various problems for which there were no easy answers.  My concern is that while this Bill will go through the House and we will see a Bill on adoption we will not see a Bill on juvenile justice.  I believe this is why the legislation was divided into three parts.</P>
      <P>In <i>Building on Reality</i> the section on juvenile justice is referred to in a vague way.  I accept that will be contentious but I believe we will not see it and that is the reason why we do not have a comprehensive Bill before us.  The Minister said that he was introducing this Bill and would introduce the Bill on adoption.  He then said that the Minister for Justice has published the draft text of a Status of Children Bill.  What he said about the juvenile justice section was:</P>
      <P>The Government are also committed to the reform of the juvenile justice system and this will be the subject of a further Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no indication of who will introduce that Bill and I am concerned lest that legislation would not be introduced by the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept that the best place for a child to be reared is in its own home or failing that, in a substitute home rather than in a children's home.  We also accept that there should be minimum intervention by the various agencies and we accept the comments made by the Minister about the rights of a child.  The Minister referred to all the various agencies <Col N="81" /> and reports that he had recommendations from, including the Committee on Reformatory and Industrial School Systems, which was the Kennedy Report in 1970, the Task Force on Child Care Services Reports for 1975 and 1980, the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents and the Review Committee on Adoption Services Report for 1984. The Minister may have received recommendations from these bodies but he does not appear to have accepted very many recommendations from the Kennedy Report and particularly from the Task Force on Child Care Services which was a very comprehensive report from that committee which was set up in 1974.</P>
    <P>The Bill is totally inadequate.  It does not emphasise family support, the place of prevention and early intervention.  It deals with policing measures when the harm is done.  The thrust of the Bill seems to be that health board personnel will be involved in bringing children to court proceedings and monitoring children in care and there is nothing to suggest that there will be a proper approach to prevention. Health board resources will be tied up in policing rather than in the provision of proper family support.</P>
    <P>I should like the health board to be obliged legally to be more active in prevention. At present, because of poverty, high unemployment and family breakdown, many children are at risk and it is important that there should be proper support services.  The task force recommended that there should be a proper home help service available to families. How many home help personnel are available who are trained in the care of children in each health board area? Because of the cutbacks introduced by the Minister, these services are not available.</P>
    <P>The task force made quite a number of recommendations on the provision of proper family support services.  In paragraph 424, they said that the range and quality of family support services would determine, to a very significant degree, the number of children who will require child care services.  They reported a high incidence of stress among young mothers <Col N="82" /> in urban areas and the absence of amenities and family support services indicate that action is urgently needed if major problems for parents and children are to be avoided.</P>
    <P>The task force also said that, in considering the future planning of family support services, they had been greatly influenced by the increasing potential of communities to identify their own needs and the sources of their own difficulties and to take action directed towards resolving them.  They felt very strongly that there should be proper support services.</P>
    <P>In her report, District Justice Kennedy said that the whole aim of child care services should be geared towards the prevention of family breakdown and the problems consequent on it.  Great emphasis has been laid on the need for proper family support services but this Bill does not provide sufficiently to ensure that such services will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the regulation of day care services, creches, day nurseries, child minding services, playgroups, pre-school and out of school facilities. In that regard, however, too much seems to be left to regulations and not enough written into the legislation.  Regulations will be prescribed for premises, staffing, the numbers of children and the number of hours which children will attend a day care centre.  Will every day care centre have to register or will it depend on the number of children in the centre or how many hours the centre operates each day?  Health boards will have the power to provide their own day care centres and I had hoped that where there are no voluntary organisations providing these centres at present, health boards would provide them.  However, from the Minister's remarks, it appears that the health boards will not have the resources to provide such facilities.  While we all piously support the need for day centres, it is important that the Government should provide these facilities through the health boards where they are not provided by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives the right to the CEO of <Col N="83" /> the health board to appoint an authorised officer.  However, I wonder who this authorised officer will be.  Will it be entirely at the discretion of the CEO or will there be any regulations laid down regarding the person who might be appointed?  Will they need qualifications in social work or child care?  If they are inspecting premises, perhaps they will need a technical qualification.  Will there be a number of authorised officers?  It is very vague to say that the CEO will have the power to appoint an authorised officer who will be responsible for child care.</P>
    <P>We welcome the changes in relation to a foster care and I fully agree with the Minister's remarks about it being preferable to a children's home.  Obviously, the changes in the Bill will make it easier for health boards to place a child in foster care.  The Bill requires that notice be given to the health board by any person undertaking foster care or by a person placing a child in foster care.  The board will also be entitled to receive information regarding a child in foster care and will also have power in regard to the quality of the care.  I notice that the quality of food is also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Section 12(3) the Minister has the power to exempt certain cases from the scope of these regulations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the Act, as it operates at present, is excessively vague and does not adequately differentiate between matters which are genuine official secrets and matters where there is no need whatever for secrecy?  Will he agree that the overall effect of the Act is to inhibit officials from releasing information very often for which there is no need for secrecy and that it can also prevent access by the public to information?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The law is contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  That Act in the main was a consolidation of efforts; in effect, restating the then existing law contained in the Official Secrets Acts of 1911 and 1920.  The Act creates certain offences in relation to two principal matters: (a) the acts prejudicial to the safety and preservation of the State and (b) offences against official secrecy. I am sure that the questions have been <Col N="85" /> prompted by a number of incidents but probably in particular by the trial in February, 1985 of Mr. Clive Ponting, the British civil servant who was acquitted by a jury of breaching section 2 of the British Official Secrets Act, 1911 by leaking documents about the sinking of the <i>General Belgrano</i> to an Opposition MP.  Section 2 of the British Official Secrets Act, 1911 is similar in substance to section 4(1) of our Official Secrets Act, 1963.  I am sure Deputies are aware that there have been calls for the repeal of section 2 of the British Act on the grounds that the scope is too wide, the point Deputy Manning has made about section 4(1) of our Official Secrets Act which is, in effect, the same thing.  The demand has been made in Britain because the section catches all official documents and information whatever their importance or the original source.  It is also argued and debated that it promotes excessive secrecy in central and local government. There have been calls to amend the law to give an accused person a defence to a prosecution under the Act if he could establish that he acted in good faith and the conduct of which he is accused was in the public interest.  Public pressure for the repeal of section 2 of the British Act has increased as a result of the Ponting case and I presume there is a carry-over effect in regard to section 4(1) of our Official Secrets Act.  The Deputy will be aware from what I have said that the matter has been given consideration in my Department but I am not prepared, during Question Time, to give commitments to forthcoming legislation.</P>

Is he aware that section 4 of our Act, as he stated, is identical to the British 1911 Act?  Is the Minister aware that the central point in the Ponting case was that despite a direction from the judge the jury acquitted Mr. Ponting because he drew a distinction between his duty and loyalty to the State and his duty and loyalty to the Government of the day?  Will <Col N="86" /> the Minister consider amending section 4 of our 1963 Act to make it clear that one's duty is to the State and not necessarily to the Government of the day?  That was the central point in the Ponting case but, so far, the Minister has not dealt with it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is exactly the same.  Our 1963 Act is a consolidation of Acts which existed before the foundation of the State.  In effect, it is the same legislation that was brought in and consolidated.  Section 4(1) of our Act is the same as section 2 of their Act. The provision which is common to the two Acts except from being an offence the disclosure of official information when there is a duty to communicate in the interests of the State.  As the Deputy has pointed out, the judge in the Ponting case implied that the phrase should be construed as meaning the interests of the Government of the day whereas the contrary legal argument was to the effect that it should be construed as meaning in the interests of the Crown and Parliament or, as we would say, in the national interest <Col N="87" /> rather than in the interest of the Government. It is clear from the answers I have given that officials in my Department have seriously noted the Ponting case and know that the jury found differently from the advice of the judge.  I am not prepared during parliamentary questions to give a commitment that we are going to change legislation but if I am going to bring in an amendment it will be announced in the usual way.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the answer which I gave to a question on this subject from Deputy Bernard J. Durkan on 7 July 1983, Official Report Vol. 344, Col. 2131.</P>
      <P>In my reply I gave the only figures available for the cost of this particular service which is borne by the State.  I also indicated in that reply that this service was not sought by the banks or other financial institutions but imposed by the Government in the public interest and that many of the large cash movements included substantial sums of cash from the banks for post offices for the payment of a variety of social welfare benefits. Because of this, I do not think it would be appropriate to levy charges for the provision of Garda escorts.  The answer to Deputy Allen's question, therefore, is no.</P>
      <P>Apart from the escort of cash consignments the Garda are involved in other security duties relating to banks and financial institutions.  Statistics are not maintained in a manner that would make possible the extraction of details of the number of gardaí involved or the cost to the Exchequer.  In any event it would be contrary to established practice and to the public interest to disclose such setails.</P>

      <P>Has sufficient consideration been given by the various financial institutions and State agencies to the transfer of cash from one location to another or from one agency of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to <Col N="91" /> another?  In my view, there is great scope for a reduction in the volume of cash in transit on any given day.  Does the Minister think anything can be done to reduce the volume of cash in transit, which is a grave temption to robbers and thieves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As Deputies are aware, following a robbery of £432,984 from a security van near Newcastle West in County Limerick on 7 June 1978, when Deputy G. Collins was Minister, the Government directed that certain changes would be made.  Those changes of a confidential nature, have been made but they have been in practice for so long now that any alert citizen is aware of the nature of those changes. Even though there were other subsequent robberies of cash in transit, the measures taken have been reasonably successful.</P>
      <P>As regards the stealing of money from a post office van which led to the shooting of a garda in Drumree, the Government also examined the situation to see what could be done.  Other measures were taken, some have been implemented and some are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are a society who use cash to a greater extent than most other western European countries.  The movement to non-cash transfers and credits cards has not been as rapid here as it has been in other western European and American cities.  It would ease the situation dramatically if there was a general movement towards plastic money rather than cash. Because of the high use of cash in this country and because of the payment of wages and benefits in cash, there is an obligation on the State to protect the movement of cash.  We are not simply providing a service for the banks.  The banks put a lot of money into security within their own buildings, but they also invest in various security firms who transmit the cash.  The State has another interest and that is that large sums of money should not be allowed fall into the hands of subversive organisations.  It <Col N="92" /> would be wrong to see us simply as providing a service to banks.  We are also there to protect the ordinary citizen so that subversive organisations do not have easy access to large sums of money.</P>

The banks provide a monetary service which the public desire.  This has a lot to do with people wanting to be paid in cash, whether wages or benefits.  It has a lot to do with the use of credit cards in shops and whether one has free credit in shops or one has to carry a roll of notes every time one goes out.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is a coincidence that we have such a question down today, after the events in Brussels last night.  It is appropriate that I should sympathise with the relatives and friends of the victims before I answer this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of security arrangements to meet the needs of events of the kind referred to in the question is an operational Garda matter and one on which, moreover, the Garda obviously have to <Col N="94" /> adopt a flexible approach involving a willingness to change plans or tactics at any time to suit developments.  Accordingly all I can appropriately say is that, whenever incidents occur such as occurred at Dalymount Park and adjoining areas on 18 September 1984, the Garda take full account of them with a view to preventing, as far as possible, a recurrence.</P>

      <P>From our own experience with Glasgow Rangers supporters at the match in question and, as the Minister himself referred to, the events last night, with the savagery of some of the Liverpool followers in Brussels, does the Minister now believe it to be appropriate that he consider the possibility of a ban on the entry of British supporters of soccer clubs into this country?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister of State at the Department of Education is primarily responsible, in association with the relevant sporting bodies, for safety and crowd control measures at sporting fixtures.  Obviously, as a result of the events of last night and other events, any police force anywhere in Europe which would have had experience of large sporting situations, especially involving soccer matches, would be reviewing the position today.  For the benefit of the House, the House may not be aware that Recommendation No. <Col N="95" /> R85.8 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe member states on the reduction of spectator violence at sporting events and, in particular, at football matches was adopted by the Foreign Ministers of 21 member states in the form of a recommendation to Governments on 19 March 1984.  The recommendation was fully supported by the Irish delegation, even though they were not on the working party.  The recommendation as adopted by the Committee of Ministers was circulated by the Council of Europe in July 1984 to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I have seen a copy of that report.  Certainly, it contains a number of recommendations which are well worth implementing.  It might be helpful if I provided it in the Library or in whatever appropriate way to interested Members. It deals with exactly the problem which occurred last night and makes a whole series of recommendations dealing with the sale of tickets, separation of supporters, crowd control, control on the way to matches, at matches and so on.  Those recommendations we could certainly subscribe to.</P>
      <P>On the question of banning any particular group of supporters, that raises very wide issues on the common travel arrangements we have with Great Britain and also raises constitutional issues.  Our Constitution protects non-nationals as well as citizens.</P>

Will he, tomorrow morning, arising out of these horrific events of last night, which shocked this and many other countries, make it quite clear that these supporters are not welcome here?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not so aware.  But, if the Deputy assures me that the situation is such, I accept what the Deputy says.  The Committee of the Council of Europe have made recommendations, first, that we should acknowledge as member countries our responsibility, complementing that of regional and local government and other public agencies, that the football authorities curb violence among spectators, coordinate at national level the policies and actions of Government Departments and other public agencies against spectator violence and foster similar co-operation to this end at other levels.  There was a whole series of recommendations, for example, to segregate rival supporters, with one or more terraces reserved for visiting supporters only; to ensure the segregation by controlling the sale of tickets for matches and to avoid the casual sale of tickets which might undermine such segregation; to ensure, in so far as is legally possible, the exclusion of known trouble makers.  I do not intend reading them all out.  They mention considering the appointment of liaison officers to discuss before matches arrangements for crowd control with all appropriate public authorities so as to ensure that any relevant rule is enforced with concerted action, the encouraging of the establishment of official supporters' clubs, the appointment of stewards from within their membership to help manage and <Col N="98" /> inform spectators at matches and to accompany parties of supporters travelling to away fixtures, the ensuring that the design and the physical fabric of football stadiums provide for the safety of spectators.</P>

I just want confirmation from him that consultation and liaison occur on a regular basis between the Garda and the organising committees of the various functions here <Col N="99" /> which attract large gatherings of people. Would the Minister confirm that that liaison exists and are there contingency plans in relation to the more obvious areas like large GAA gatherings and race meetings, with regard to action which could be taken within a short period of time to deal with the kind of problems which are likely to arise at such events?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am putting it in the context of international agreement and international recommendations. Ireland has now been co-opted to the expert group who are dealing with spectator violence.  The next meeting is in Strasbourg on 25 and 26 June.  The fifth conference of the meeting of European Sports Ministers will be held in Dublin in the autumn of 1986.  It is fairly clear already that spectator violence at matches will be on the agenda and will play a prominent part at the meeting. Copy of the resolutions to which I referred were sent to the sports section of the FAI, to the Irish Hockey Union, the IRFU, the Irish Basketball Association, to Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann, Comhairle Liathróid Láimhe na hÉireann and to the GAA on 27 May 1985.  As recently as last week those resolutions were sent to the sporting bodies to make them aware of them.  We accept the recommendations.  We are party to the agreement.  Obviously the Garda have a major part to play in crowd control but they do it in consultation with the sporting organisations.  This is not something that is being neglected.  It is not something I am talking about now as a result of last night's tragedy.  The matter was already in hand.</P>

We were also represented by Deputy Commissioner O'Doherty, <Col N="101" /> acting in his capacity as Chairman of Cospóir.  The group to which the expert group reported has got on it one of the most senior gardaí in the country.

      <P>My question relates directly to Deputy Gregory's query. In what way do the Garda decide the degree of security required at an event, whether it be a football match, a concert or any event that will attract a large number?  Does it depend on the amount of money a club, an organiser or a promoter is prepared to pay for security? What rights do the Garda Síochána have inside a stadium or a hall where an event is taking place?  Do the organisers decide how many gardaí are needed and the extent of security inside a stadium?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The decision is normally made on local knowledge and information as to what is likely to happen.  One can predict if there might be aggression between supporters in certain matches, but in other matches one can say quite categorically there will not be any trouble.  I am sure when Limerick play Cork in a fortnight's time in Pairc Uí Caoimh there will not be much trouble down there.  Normally they consult with <Col N="102" /> the organisers and they come up with a level of security that is appropriate.  It does not depend on the availability of money.  A garda is a garda whether he is on or off duty.  He has the same powers inside a football stadium as he has on the street and he will have the same powers off-duty.</P>

Sometimes I think they have not the kind of guidance and training that would help them to perform their duties in the best way.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's initial reply he said that the Garda take full account of these events when they occur in order to provide for them in the future.  I question that statement. Some months after the Glasgow Rangers match I was present outside Dalymount Park at the Ireland-Italy match and Garda personnel were almost non-existent, where the gates before the match had to be opened to prevent people from being crushed to death and where all of the money from a number of the turnstiles was taken in an armed robbery.  All of that took place in an environment of absolute chaos.  I drove around the ground on that occasion.  Will the Minister ensure that for major matches in the future sufficient gardaí are present both outside and inside Dalymount Park to prevent a recurrence of these events?  The Garda did not take full account of the events at the Glasgow Rangers match as was borne out a few months later at the Ireland-Italy match.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is not much one can say in reply to that intervention.  It is an operational matter. I know the Garda take account of past experience when they are making arrangements.  Probably it would be inappropriate for a lay person to decide on the deployment of gardaí.  Even in the comments made last night which were published in the newspapers today there is a suggestion that it might not be a good idea to have extra men in uniform inside <Col N="104" /> the stadium because it might lead to greater aggression and that the proper deployment would be on the access routes to the stadium.  I am not familiar with the detail of what the Deputy has now said but I know that there was a concentration on the access routes to Dalymount on the particular day.</P>

      <P>The Garda inform me that in October 1983 a special unit from Store Street Garda District was set up to investigate drug abuse and drug trafficking in the district.  It was envisaged from the outset that this particular assignment would be of limited duration and it was terminated in August 1984.  A further special drug unit has been operating in the area in question on a temporary basis since January of this year and the situation is being kept under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>May I first take this opportunity of congratulating the Garda Drug Squad on their recent major heroin seizures in Dublin.  Does the Minister now accept that this special drug unit has been reformed and is operating effectively within the north inner city area of Dublin?  Does he now accept that it was a serious error of judgement at the time to disband this unit, which led to the regrouping of heroin suppliers in that area of Dublin and to the establishment of a heroin supply operation in O'Connell Street itself?  Would he accept <Col N="105" /> that it was this serious situation only that led to the reforming of the special unit?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no information at all to suggest that what the Deputy says is so.  The facts, as presented to me, are that a special unit set up in October 1983 operated and was terminated in August 1984, and that a new unit was organised in January of this year.  I have no information to suggest that there was any big change in the situation in the Dublin inner city area between the termination of one group and the formation of another.  The Deputy should bear in mind that there is a drug squad in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. But, apart from that, up to 2,000 gardaí have been given specific training in the drug area.  It would be wrong to put the emphasis totally on the drug squad.  This has been the experience in other countries.  It has been the experience, in, for example, London, Amsterdam&mdash;our drugs squad is probably about the same size as the drug squad in Amsterdam although the problem is far greater in Amsterdam.  Internationally the concentration now is on having an expert group but then the training of as many policemen as possible, so that they are all aware of the dangers of drugs and have expertise in the area.  The statistics of arrests and drug finds bear this out because the force at large have had something like 85 per cent of the finds over the last year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am always careful not to be too dogmatic about things like this.  Drugs are like forest fires, they flare up when one thinks one has them under control.  But certainly <Col N="106" /> it seems to have plateau'd somewhat and the information emanating from the Garda, the hospitals and medical practitioners is that they are not seeing new addicts.  But that does not mean that there is not a problem.  Obviously there is a problem of addition.  It is probably also true to say that there will be more deaths of people related to drug addiction in the future, not necessarily because of an increase in use but because there is a time lag between addiction and mortality, and that we will be seeing deaths from the difficulties of the years 1981, 1982 and 1983.  The big fear internationally at present is that in regard to cocaine &mdash; which is so prevalent in the United States &mdash; its exporters, the people who organise it, will be looking for new markets and they will look particularly in areas where there is disposable income. Western Europe probably is the next best market after North America.  We should be very vigilant about it because, even though the thing seems to have plateaud out now, there are huge amounts of money involved in the international drug business and there are people who are prepared to develop new markets because they run it as a business.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are various ways in which one can use accommodation.  The intention would be that it would be used for males from 16 to 21, like St. Patrick's.  As Deputies are aware, the Department of Education are responsible for people committed to custody who are under 16 years of age. Despite repeated newspaper reports that the Department of Justice have an involvement in the school in Lusk, they have not; that is a Department of Education institute solely under the control of the Department of Education.  Then for the age group 16 to 21, there are places like St. Patrick's or Shanganagh, and then the more general prisons after that.  I cannot at present say what will be the situation in 1987, whether we would be in a position to close down parts of St. Patrick's for refurbishment purposes or whether we would be better closing down St. Patrick's and Mountjoy for rebuilding and refurbishment.  It is in that kind of area that the development will take place.</P>

There are educational and rehabilitating facilities there, including third level educational facilities for some of the prisoners.  The situation in Mountjoy is different.  The physical accommodation in Mountjoy was very bad but a refurbishing programme is almost at an end and the accommodation has been improved a lot, although it is certainly not up to the standard of modern prisons in Arbour Hill, Cork and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that an announcement was made today by my Department that a building which was intended for the use of single prison officers in Portlaoise is not being used and will be taken over by my Department for custodial purposes.  We are trying to decide whether to use it for the rehabilitation of prisoners with problems such as alcoholism or for women because the accommodation is very good and it would require approximately one month's work to put a secure fence around it.  On the question of the women's prison in Wheatfield, a design has been completed by the Office of Public Works and it is the lack <Col N="110" /> of resources which will stop it going ahead at the moment.  The Deputy is correct in saying that there is space there for 144 women prisoners and that the number of women prisoners is much less than that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>These three questions relate to the same prisoner and were originally put down for answer on 4 December 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must assume that the Deputy did not receive my letter dated 16 November 1984 in which I explained that a postal order for £5 was sent by the governor of the prison to a solicitor acting on behalf of the prisoner's mother, receipt of which was acknowledged.  In my letter I also outlined the results of the governor's investigation into the loss of a registered letter in which £5 was said to have been <Col N="111" /> sent to the prisoner by his mother.  I have arranged for a copy of my letter to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The prisoner was transferred from Mountjoy prison to Cork prison on 15 August 1984, about a month before the visit from the select committee to Mountjoy, and he was transferred back to Mountjoy on 9 October 1984, almost a month after the visit.  The transfer had nothing whatever to do with that visit. The original transfer to Cork was for security reasons.</P>
    <P>There is no record in either Mountjoy or Cork prisons that any letter written by the prisoner to the Deputy was not allowed to issue.  The normal practice is that letters written by prisoners to Deputies are issued automatically.  There is no record in the Department that the Deputy raised the issue.  The records do show that a request was made by the Deputy in April 1984 for early release for the prisoner.  The request was refused and the Deputy was so informed by letter dated 21 May 1984.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="147" />
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was questioning why the Minister had taken unto himself the power of exemption from the regulations in relation to the control of foster homes and private foster care.  Section 12 (3) provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, grant exemption from the provisions of this section to any class of person undertaking the care and maintenance of children or to any premises in which children receive care and maintenance and may withdraw any such exemption.</P>
      <P>I would like to know why the Minister wants that power.  He has been very specific in section 12 (2) about the nature of the regulations that will be made. What had he in mind when he decided that he would have this power to exempt any premises or any person involved in foster care?  It is important that when a child is placed in foster care the foster parents be selected by somebody professionally qualified in child care and there is nothing in the Bill to indicate that this will be the case.  Indeed, what the Minister said this morning about resources would cause concern that the health boards would not be in a position to appoint the type of staff necessary to ensure that the best care is made available to children.  I agree with the Minister that no child should be in a children's home if a family setting is available for that child, therefore this section on foster care is important.  When the Bill comes to be implemented that section must be appropriate to the needs of children so placed. It was disheartening to hear from the Minister that there are 70 children in children's homes who could have been placed in foster care had the parents given their consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a point that cannot be made too often, that prevention and good rehabilitation with good family support will ensure that more children will be able to remain in their homes.  This is the ideal we should aim at, and it has been the experience in other countries.  We welcome the provision for the regulations <Col N="148" /> on children's homes.  Again, the Minister has taken the power of exemption from the guidelines he has laid down for the regulations.</P>
    <P>Regarding the regulations, the provisions of this Bill will not extend to various institutions listed by the Minister such as any school recognised or premises provided by the Minister for Education &mdash; that is fair enough &mdash; and a hospital or any institution within the meaning of the Health Acts 1947 to 1985 and the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1966.  I question in this day and age whether children, particularly young children, should under any circumstances be admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  I do not believe that the psychiatric hospitals have the appropriate accommodation or facilities for younger children particularly.  Perhaps young persons aged between 15 and 17, while it would be better to have some more appropriate place for them, in the absence of another place perhaps could be treated, particularly if they are at risk to themselves, in the psychiatric hospital, but we should not have young children admitted to psychiatric hospitals even though they have to have the written consent of their parents and a letter from their family doctor.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for regulations for the proper control and conduct of children's homes.  Again this might be spelt out a little more in legislation as regards staffing numbers, qualifications and who will be in charge or working in those homes.  What qualifications will they need?  Will they be home parents, child care workers, persons with a diploma in child care?  Admission will be through the health boards except in an emergency, and this is desirable.  It is desirable that the homes would be small, that there would be fewer than 24 children in any of these homes in any given time.  It would be desirable also that there be a sufficient number of homes to ensure that the children will not be placed too far away from their own homes and their parents who may wish to visit them.  In this context at present we have not sufficient homes. Outside the Eastern Health Board area there are only 22 homes <i>in toto</i> in the <Col N="149" /> country.  Ideally one would hope that homes would not be necessary, but one would like to see a small home in each community care area so that it would be in close proximity to the parents if they wanted to visit their children.  Some form of special home should be provided for children who need special care and attention.</P>
    <P>Section 23 puts an obligation on the home to identify children and provide certain services such as advice, guidance service and facilities so as to diminish the need to receive such children into care or to keep them in care.  This is one of only two sections in the Bill that goes any way towards prevention.  This section is too vague.  CARE in their document in 1975 identified the groups who are most at risk where problems might occur with unmarried mothers trying to look after their children on their own, fatherless families, families where the father is long term unemployed, where there are alcoholic problems in the family or where the mother is unable to cope and in the travelling community.  They also made a point about the need for an adequate income in all homes, for education and recreational facilities for the proper assessment of handicap if there are children at risk, and for a social work service.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is in Part III of the Bill which deals with children in need of care and protection.  It refers specifically to children. It does not refer to young persons. I wonder were young persons excluded intentionally by the Minister.  I see a case for including in the section and throughout the Bill young persons of 17 years of age as well as those under 15 years of age.  Very often persons between 15 years and 17 years could be subject to some form of neglect or abuse, and it might be necessary for the health board to intervene. Persons up to 17 years of age should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a widening of the health board's authority to take persons into care.  At present parents must be dead or destitute, or a child must be abandoned. Under the new proposals the health board can take a child into care while the mother is deciding on adoption, or where <Col N="150" /> the parents are ill, or where there is marital breakdown, or a family crisis.  They can take the child in for a short period.</P>
    <P>We support the place of safety provisions. The health board have power to designate places of safety and they have power under section 26 (2) to cancel any such designation.  Whom do they notify if they cancel a designation?  Would they notify the Garda authorities who have fairly wide powers in relation to taking children into care in an emergency and having them placed in a designated home? Section 27 outlines the power the Garda have.  If the health board were to cancel a designation, would they notify the Garda so that they would know the place was no longer designated?</P>
    <P>Section 28 puts an obligation on the Garda to apply for a care order or supervision order within 72 hours of the child being brought into care in an emergency. I wonder is 72 hours too short a period. If a child were taken ill on a Friday evening, 72 hours might be too short a period to enable them to bring the child before the District Court.  The district justice can grant a place of safety order for neglect, or assault, or where parents are unable to provide guardianship or are not providing proper guardianship, and for children who are sexually abused.  That is an improvement on the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>There is no accurate information on how much sexual abuse of children and young persons there is in this country. We must address ourselves to that.  The information from other countries is that it is quite prevalent.  In the States each year 100,000 children are sexually abused, the majority of them by family members.  Of those who got into trouble afterwards, in one survey by the Incest Crisis Link in the United Kingdom it was found that 90 per cent of rapists had been abused as children, 30 per cent of rape victims were abused as children and 40 per cent of alcoholics and drug addicts were abused as children.  We must ensure that if this is happening in our community we can deal with it effectively and correctly.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with care proceedings. I wonder whether young persons should <Col N="151" /> be included together with children so that all those under 17 years of age would be protected by this Bill.  There is an obligation on the health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order. Who will make that application and who will carry out the supervision?  Will it be the authorised officer, or will it be somebody else in the health board?  We welcome the new provisions for care proceedings and for supervision orders.  In all legislation of this nature it is important to keep a balance.  It is important that the health board personnel involved should keep a balance and ensure that, as far as possible, there will be the minimum interference and intervention with the family and that only where it is absolutely necessary will there be intervention to apply for a care or supervision order.</P>
    <P>Section 42 is the other section which makes some gesture towards the prevention of abuse.  It provides that a health board &ldquo;shall, as far as practicable and subject to the provisions of this Act, promote the welfare of children in its area&rdquo;. That is vague.  This Bill falls far short of providing proper legislation for prevention which is most important in order to ensure that the smallest possible number of children will need care through the health board.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides for the removal of a child from voluntary care.  This is another area which must be carefully looked at because there could be a conflict between the rights of the parents, the rights of the foster parents and the welfare of the child.  I was glad to hear the Minister stating on a number of occasions that the welfare of the child will be paramount. We must examine this section carefully on Committee Stage.  Is the section in conflict with Part III of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which provides for enforcement of the right of custody?</P>
    <P>Reference is made in section 53 (5) to the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, but it is not clear if that Act will be used or some alternative with similar powers to that Act.  Section 56 gives health boards <Col N="152" /> power to work in conjuction with voluntary organisations and to have voluntary organisations carry out services on their behalf.  One of the major criticisms I have of the Bill is that it does not lay down fairly and squarely the role of the voluntary organisations in the provision of services. We are very proud of having a large number of voluntary organisations engaged in all areas of social activity.  We have many great organisations in the area of child care, such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, the CARE organisation, Barnardos and many others, who are doing excellent work.  The section states:</P>
    <P>A health board may, in accordance with such conditions (which may include provision for superannuation) as may be specified by the Minister, make and carry out an arrangement with a person or body to provide services under this Act.</P>
    <P>It does not put any obligation on the health board to work in conjunction with these bodies and organisations even where they are providing a very excellent service at the moment.</P>
    <P>The task force were very specific in relation to the role of the voluntary organisations and it is disappointing that something positive does not appear in the Bill to ensure that the voluntary organisations who are doing such excellent work are not allowed to continue to do so. They should have some form of statutory authority and the health boards should be obliged to involve these voluntary organisations in such work.  The task force report said that the child care authority, who in this case would be the health board, should not use professionally trained workers in aspects of the work which can be performed as well or better by people in local communities, associations or other voluntary workers if such resources exist or can be developed.  They list the various areas where voluntary involvement is available at the moment, such as youth services, home help services, pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries and, to a lesser extent, work with mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> The task force recommended a new form of home help service where the home help would be trained specifically in the care of children as distinct from the position at the moment where they mainly work with the aged and infirm. The task force also suggested that the child care authority should not be directly involved in those associations but, where necessary, the child care authority might assist financially or otherwise voluntary groups who organise play groups.  The task force also referred to the provision of youth services, which are mainly provided by voluntary effort and centre around structural activities through clubs and centres.  The task force felt that this kind of activity attracted children who are amenable to structures but that it failed to deal with children who are most in need of help who are usually not amenable to organised activities.  It is important that there is a proper development of services and that it is acknowledged that there is proper support for the voluntary organisations who are making a valuable contribution to the care of children.</P>
    <P>Section 57 makes provision for setting up child care advisory committees by each health board.  There is an obligation on health boards to set up such committees. The section states that the child care advisory committee may include persons not members of the health board.  It is disappointing that the section does not specify certain people who should be, as of right, on the child care advisory committees.  The directory of community care, social welfare workers and representatives of the voluntary organisations providing services in the community should, as of right, be members of the child care advisory committees.  This is left entirely to the discretion of the health boards in section 57.  While I believe most health boards would ensure that there is proper composition in the child care advisory committees, there is always the danger that this might not happen and we could find a child care advisory committee where there would not be any representative working in the area of child care.  It should be written into the Bill to ensure that there are people who are involved in <Col N="154" /> the provision of child care services on the child care advisory committees who will have an important role to play in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>Many of the voluntary organisations are concerned about their position when the Bill is enacted.  A good case can be made for having a legal obligation on the health boards to accept the services provided by many of the voluntary organisations but also to enter into a contract with them for three years or perhaps five years so that the voluntary associations will be able to provide for their staff and they will know they will be retained for a certain period.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill provides for custody orders.  As the Minister pointed out, the welfare of the child will be paramount.  That is important because in other areas there could be conflict between the rights of parents, the needs of foster parents and foster parents' rights.  Foster parents, with the parents' consent, can apply for a custody order after one year and the health boards are obliged to give their consent after three years under section 64 (1) (b).  If the consent of the parents of the child is not forthcoming after three years, the foster parents can apply to the district justice for a custody order and the health board's consent is not necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 66 (4) gives the health boards the right to be heard.  I believe they should be directly involved in the case where after three years foster parents can make an application for a custody order, just as their consent is necessary, with the parents' consent, when a couple are applying for a custody order after one year.  It is important, in the interests of the child, that there should be health board consent.  Section 64 (4) reads that:</P>
    <P>A court shall not hear an application for a custody order unless the applicant has given notice of the application within 14 days of the making of the application or such extended period as the court may allow....</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether that period is too short particularly in view of the fact <Col N="155" /> that the parent of the child may not be available at that short notice.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what is most extraordinary about the Minister's speech is that in dealing with Part VI of the Bill which relates to court procedures and evidence, he devoted fewer than three lines to that entire Part.  He said that Part VI provides for various technical measures concerned with the conduct of court proceedings involving children, rules of evidence and so on.  Anybody who has read the Bill is greatly disappointed that the court procedures are to be within the District Court system.  I am sure the Minister will agree, as all authorities in this area agree, with the need for a proper family court system and with cases involving children not being heard in the present District Court system.  The District Court has not the environment, the resources or the support services necessary for dealing with such cases.  There should be one district justice initially with special training to hear cases involving children.  The task force recommended that such a district justice would have available to him the services of two assessors and that he should be encouraged and facilitated to acquire the knowledge and training necessary for dealing with problems involving children.  The recommendation of the task force was that a justice of the children's court should sit with two assessors if he considered that such assessors would be helpful to the proceedings. The task force recommended also that the proceedings be held <i>in camera</i> and be informal.  There were recommendations also about the physical conditions that should obtain in a children's court.  The section in the Bill in that regard is very disappointing.  It is fundamental that we have a proper procedure for dealing with cases involving children but there is nothing worth while in the Bill in that regard. The Minister may say there will be something on those lines in the third Bill which will be dealing with juvenile justice but that is not sufficient.  A great opportunity is missed on this occasion to introduce a <Col N="156" /> very necessary provision, namely, provision for a proper children's court system.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the assessment of children and young persons who find themselves in trouble with the law is worthy of serious study especially at a time when serious crimes are being committed by young people and when there are not available the facilities necessary to assess those involved to identify those who need care and those who should be brought before the courts.  In the past there may have been a tendency to have more sympathy with the perpetrator than with the victim of crime but it is important to have a balance in this area and to help children who can be helped without the necessity for court proceedings and thereby without prison sentences being imposed.  There is a proper system of assessment but it is inadequate to deal with the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>On the question of the role of parents whose children engage in criminal activity, some suggest that the responsibility should rest with these parents.  While agreeing that parents have a responsibility to ensure that their children are kept out of criminal activity, there are many very good parents who are perplexed on finding that their children are involved in serious crime.  It would be wrong that such parents should be charged with any offence committed by their children.</P>
    <P>Section 79 provides for a prohibition on the publication or broadcasting of certain matters.  One may ask whether that section goes far enough.  While it will prohibit the publication of the names of the people involved, it may lead to sensational reporting in some instances and that might not be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with section 83 which deals with the control and sale of solvent substances.  We agree with that section because we must ensure that these substances are not available in cases in which they might be misused by a young person.</P>
    <P>Another opportunity that was missed in this Bill regards the failure to do something about under-age drinking.  There <Col N="157" /> are sections in the 1908 Act that deal with the sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons and which deal also with the presence of young people on licensed premises.  On this occasion we should have availed of the opportunity of amending the Act so that we might deal with what is a very serious problem.  The Minister referred this week to the drinking of cider, so he is very much aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>The 1908 legislation should be extended also to the sale of tobacco and tobacco products to young persons. While sections 39 to 45 of the 1908 Act provide for some control regarding the sale of cigarettes, there was no such provision in relation to the sale of tobacco.</P>
    <P>We welcome, too, section 86 which provides for the placing of an obligation on the Garda to notify a health board in certain specified cases of crime involving children.  This is in the interest of the children concerned and one can only hope that it will have the result of preventing children who have become engaged in crime from committing further crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the cost of implementing those measures.  It is obvious from what he said and also from what we know of this Government, that they have no intention of allocating extra resources to the health boards for the provision of the services that will be necessary in respect of the implementation of this legislation.  The Minister might have been expected to make a special allocation to each health board but I recognise that the policy of the Government is to provide services, expanded services and new services out of a reduced allocation.  Obviously this also applies to the child care services and will cause major problems in growth areas such as Tallaght which has a population of 70,000 people.  If money is not allocated to the Eastern Health Board to provide services for these people they will be seriously deprived.  In new towns where people have moved away from their families it is essential to provide proper child care services.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="158" /> I would remind the House that the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> makes it clear that within the health services the aim will be to bring about a redistribution of resources away from institutionalised services towards community services, particularly those for disadvantaged groups.  If we are successful in this aim &mdash; and I am making every effort to ensure that we shall be &mdash; then I would expect to see gradual but worthwhile developments in our family support services over the next few years.  Furthermore the area of the child and the family will be one of my first priorities in relation to any additional funds that may become available.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the Minister can save money elsewhere then there will be a gradual introduction of the services necessary for child care.  The Government know that there cannot be a saving because every health board has a serious deficit at present.  This year the Government transferred responsibility for the general medical service to the health boards.  Formerly they were financed from the Exchequer through the payments board.  The health boards are in a serious dilemma at present because of an overrun on the cost of the general medical service.</P>
    <P>If there is any redistribution it will be absorbed by existing services.  As we know, the dental service, the optical service and other services have been practically abolished.  The Minister has committed himself to improved services for the care of the aged in the community. Yet he says that if he is successful he would expect to see gradual but worthwhile developments in the family support services over the next few years and that the area of the child and the family will be one of his top priorities.  How many different groups has he told that their group will be his top priority since coming to office?  It must be asked if the Government are serious about providing the resources necessary to implement what is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 8 <Col N="159" /> May 1985 gave a widely held view of this legislation and stated:</P>
    <P>The Children (Care and Protection) Bill is a sorry thing.  For nearly 80 years now we have been making the best of the Children Act 1908 in looking after our deprived children.  It is over 15 years since the Kennedy Report on Reformatory and Industrial Schools was published, and the whole debate began on child deprivation and the responsibility of the State.</P>
    <P>In that 15 years, voluntary bodies, such as CARE and the ISPCC have jolted public opinion and harried the politicians.  Governments have made promises, and none more than the present Government.  At the end of it all, what we get is a Bill about rescuing children when they are already damaged, a Bill about closing the stable doors too late.</P>
    <P>Two things have been taken for granted by those concerned about deprived children.  The first is that the main responsibility for looking after children must remain with their own families.  In modern conditions, many families will, of course, need support and encouragement from the social services if they are to do the job we expect them to do.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that Public Authorities providing social services will only do what comes easy to them or what they are obliged to do by law.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in the Bill should, then, have been on family support and on providing an administrative framework to ensure that families who need support will be supported.  The Constitution, with its emphasis on the family, demands nothing less; the Government, with its much vaunted commitment to social reform should have offered that at least.</P>
    <P>As the seven major child-care organisations have pointed out, this is a policing Bill.  If children are neglected or abused, it offers public care after a hearing in a District Court.  The District Courts, as we know them, <Col N="160" /> inexpert and over-stretched, are indeed a crude instrument of child care.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a whole range of court orders to be preceded by social workers' reports, and followed at regular intervals by reviews.  The energy of the social workers and the resources of the Health Boards will be spent entirely on the extreme cases and there will be nothing left for supporting families not yet at the brink.</P>
    <P>In the coming months, the politicians and the public will be caught up in a debate about what should be done when families break down.  When the Government is asked what it proposes to do for families before they break down, for deprived children who are not yet abused or neglected, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill will be no answer.</P>
    <P>The majority of the task force believe that many of the services at present under other Departments should be transferred to the Department of Health and that the Department should be the main one dealing with the care and protection of children and young persons.  It is disappointing that there is no reference to a transfer of services; for example, special schools are still under the aegis of the Department of Education.  Some of these cater for children who are seriously deprived both socially and emotionally.  They should be the responsibility of the Department of Health.  While there is an educational element in them and that is very important, the same is true of residential institutions for the care of the mentally handicapped.  These are under the aegis of the Department of Health and provide education for those resident in them.  Some youth services could be transferred to the Department to ensure that they are available to those who are deprived in society.  The majority of the task force recommended that the duties of school attendance officers should be carried out through the health boards or the child care authority.  Outside of the boroughs, the Act is enforced by the Garda.  Young children who miss school <Col N="161" /> on a regular basis are in need of some kind of health care assessment and could be children at risk.  Assessment and remand units might be placed under the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that there was no reference in the Bill to the setting up of a national children's council such as was recommended by a number of bodies. Perhaps it is not necessary to have it included in law but it is something that has been strongly recommended and the task force went so far as to suggest that it should have been set up immediately in advance of any legislation.  It would have had an advisory, monitoring and promotional function in relation to child care.  It is disappointing that there is no indication from the Minister that he intends to set up such a council.  The Constitution provides for the protection of children in Article 42 which states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in so far as it goes, is in keeping with that Article.</P>
    <P>While we support the much needed improvements in the Bill, we are disappointed that the Government, who set themselves up as a Government of social reform, have wasted an opportunity to bring in legislation which would have ensured the highest level of prevention services and comprehensive provisions for the care and protection of children, especially those at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  It deals with many gaps in current legislation and tries to provide a better child care structure and legislative framework for dealing with children who are at risk and in need of care and protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very reluctant at such an early <Col N="162" /> stage to introduce a party political note but I found it difficult to restrain myself during Deputy O'Hanlon's contribution. Criticism of a constructive nature is welcome but to criticise the Bill in a destructive way on the basis that it is not doing enough, without going into the detail of the specifics which he wishes it to do, other than a reference to the task force report, is an indication of the limitation of his party's commitment, research or understanding in dealing with these areas.</P>
    <P>The Bill must be welcomed simply because it is there before we deal with its specifics.  Different Governments, including those of Fianna Fáil, did absolutely nothing in this area over decades. It is an indictment of all parties that this is the first time since 1908 that we have tried to tackle the legislative framework relating to children's law and child care services.  We have tinkered around with it and introduced limited amending legislation over the years but we have never really come to terms with introducing anything that could be described as a comprehensive reforming measure.  It is the shame of politicians in all parties that it has taken so long to produce this legislation. It is not as if they did not know about it and, to that extent, some of Deputy O'Hanlon's comments are difficult to stomach.  In the three years I have been in the House, I have persecuted successive Ministers for Health, including Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Health, to introduce legislation on children's law.  I raised it by way of Dáil Questions, Adjournment debates and on the Order of Business.  I welcome the fact that the Government have at least produced this legislation and it appears that the Fianna Fáil Government in office in 1982 were no nearer producing it than I was of flying to the moon because it took the Department another two years to do the necessary background work to put this Bill together.  This is not a party political matter.  There is no difference in our theoretical mutual commitments to reform in this area.  We are all in favour of children just as we are all against sin. We can all join hands in the House and <Col N="163" /> regularly make stirring and passionate speeches in favour of children, born or unborn, but it does not mean that we do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The indictment of politicians in all parties can clearly be seen in the Kennedy report in 1970.  The introductory portion of that report said that the child care system had evolved in a haphazard and amateurish way and had not radically altered down through the years.  It said that it might have been admirable at one time but that it is no longer suited to the requirements of a modern and more scientific age and our greater realisation of our duty to the less fortunate members of society.  Politicians ruminated on that throughout the seventies and many of them made stirring speeches in that regard.  They ruminated so much that they had to set up a task force in 1974 to urgently report on the issue.  The task force took six years to produce their urgent report and, in September 1980, it was made available to a reluctant Department of Health who finally got around to publishing it in 1981.  I do not mean that as an insult to anyone in the Department, I know that many officials there are passionately committed to this area.  Possibly a Minister sat on it when he tried to understand it before it was printed.  What did we do then?  We sat on it again, it took nearly five years to produce this Bill and that is why I say that I welcome it simply because it is there.  It provides us with the format for implementing many necessary reforms and it also contains a number of reforms that are so badly needed.  Those reforms are easily documented and have been referred to by the Minister.  I intend to deal with them in some detail later on.</P>
    <P>The Bill essentially updates the provisions relating to the care and protection of children in that children can be taken to a place of safety &mdash; safety orders could be made under that 1908 Act so that is not an entirely new provision &mdash; but it updates the procedure and provides new grounds for taking children into care where that is necessary.  It provides flexibility in the context of care orders so <Col N="164" /> that the health boards will have a discretion when children are taken into care, to decide whether a child should be placed in residential or foster care.</P>
    <P>It also provides a mechanism which people have been saying for years is necessary but no Government got around to providing it.  I refer to the provision of supervision orders for children where there is a belief that they are at risk within the home.  It is not necessarily the position that they should be taken out of the home but that families in difficulty or who are inadequate could, with support from the community or the health board, provide within their home care for their children under supervision.  Therefore, I welcome in principle the provisions to provide for the making of supervision orders.</P>
    <P>The position of foster parents over the years has always been legally ill-defined as our child care services have tried to evolve within the constraints of our archaic legal structure.  Over the last three or four years we have sought to place emphasis on foster care and the Eastern Health Board and other boards have been involved in establishing groups such as the fostering resource group. There has been a lack of necessary legal framework to provide protection for children in the context of the fostering arrangement to ensure that such arrangement is stable and to provide protection for the foster parents.  In so far as this Bill attempts to deal with that issue I welcome it as an indicator of the Minister's thinking and desire to tackle this problem.</P>

      <P>Already we have had an example of the limitations of the approach of that party in the contribution by the Opposition's spokesman.  Deputy Browne's approach was a more eloquent example of the level of expertise and committed contribution which the party intend to make to the debate.  I would welcome the Deputy doing this on a regular basis if for no other reason than that it removes the mask of concern and commitment Deputy O'Hanlon tried to present in regard to this area, a commitment that was never evident at any stage from the party opposite when in Government in the past three of four decades.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne is welcome to call for a quorum on a regular basis because I am sure Deputies around the House are waiting with open mouths to hear the pearls of wisdom I am going to utter on the Bill.  I hope he has the decency to allow us to conduct ourselves as a legislative assembly rather than as a playground for parliamentary slapstick in which we can all engage in tossing the odd humourous party political point at each other, or arranging for bells to ring whenever we are bored, run out of constituency work, or have nothing better to do than come into the Chamber and try to make political asses of ourselves.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to have a constructive debate on the Bill, though to what extent Fianna Fáil will permit that to take place I will wait and see.  I also wait with an equally open mouth to see what level of contribution they will make on the substance of the Bill as opposed to simply attempting to score fairly irrelevant political points. I welcome the fact that the Bill provides <Col N="166" /> a number of new legal mechanisms.  I referred to the provisions relating to the taking of children into care, providing protection for children by way of place of safety orders, and so on.  I also referred to the legislative provisions in regard to foster care and welcomed the fact that when children are taken into care, health boards will have some degree of flexibility in deciding whether that care should be residential or should be by way of foster care.  I also welcomed the provisions in a general way relating to day care in creche facilities for children and the provisions to provide a minimum code of standards. That area has grown up greatly in recent years.  There is no State involvement in it and I do not think the State wishes to have unnecessary involvement in a way which could prevent people operating such facilities.  They are providing a facility that is badly needed but one wants to ensure that minimum standards and basic precautions operate in homes or buildings where such a service is provided.  I am referring to the area of fire safety. We must ensure that those offering such facilities are properly suited to look after and care for children.</P>
      <P>One of the oddities in the current legal position is that a parent or a couple, deemed to be completely inadequate by the courts to look after their children or whose children were placed with foster parents by a health board can open a day care centre to look after the children of other people.  As things stand no meaningful intervention could take place on the part of either the Department of Education or Health.  In so far as there will be a basic structure provided in this area I welcome that.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things in the Bill that I regard as disappointing.  Many aspects of the measure could be greatly improved and I hope that on Committee Stage we will have an opportunity to flesh out some of the provisions, amend some and add to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  He said he hoped this would be a wide ranging and comprehensive debate, that he had an open and flexible mind to <Col N="167" /> improvements being made in this legislation and he would be willing to consider amending some aspects or adding others as a result of comments made by Deputies and representations which may be made to him by many of the children's and voluntary organisations who campaigned for changes in children's law.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  We recognise the work done by many voluntary organisations over the years in seeking to press for changes in children's law and children's services.  This is the first opportunity I have had to refer to the work done by these organisations.  I have no doubt it is their work and their prodding of politicians which has assisted the Minister in producing this measure.  They have helped push politicians of all parties into acknowledging the need for reform and change.</P>
    <P>I do not want to insult any individual organisation by leaving them out but tributes should be paid to organisations like CARE, the Campaign for Deprived Children, the Children First Organisation, the Adoptive Parents' Association, ISPCC, Dr. Barnardos, the Irish Foster Parents' Association, the Irish Association of Social Workers and the Association of Workers with Children in Care, all of whom have made important contributions in advocating reforms of law and reforms of child care services and seeking greater facilities for children generally. The Irish pre-School Play Groups Association have made an important contribution. They sought the provision of minimum standards to deal with day care facilities.  I have no doubt that the intent of this Bill is welcomed by them and that at some date in the future they will be able to make representations to the Minister about possible amendments they want to see in this legislation, as will all the other organisations.</P>
    <P>The people involved in all these organisations have voluntarily laboured for many years.  Hard working social workers have devoted a lot of their free time seeking to bring about changes to improve social services and legislative reforms in areas where they see such a <Col N="168" /> need.  It is only right to acknowledge the work done by these organisations. Another organisation which sought reforms in this area is FLAC.  To some extent I have a vested interest in referring to some of these organisations because I am proud to say that over the years I have had involvement with most of them. The work of these voluntary workers has not received the acknowledgement in this House it so richly deserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred specifically to the different legislative proposals the Government have to deal with children and children's law.  This is the first piece of the legislation.  The Minister referred to work being done on adoption legislation, to a juvenile justice Bill and to the status of children legislation which has not yet been published as a Bill but which is contained in a booklet, together with a commentary, seeking public response prior to it being introduced as a Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not take this badly, but while I welcome the Bill I am disappointed that we are only at the stage where we have this particular measure. The hope was that we would have a comprehensive Children Act dealing with all aspects of child care and juvenile justice and that an adoption reform measure would be included in a Children Bill.  It is unfortunate that we do not have an overall measure covering those areas because this means that we are not seen to be dealing comprehensively with the law in relation to children.  We are seen to be categorising the different areas of law and not necessarily acknowledging the interaction between them.</P>
    <P>In the context of adoption law, which has been crying out for reform for many years, one of the statements contained in the minority report of the Task Force on Child Care emphasised &mdash; and I will paraphrase it &mdash; that there was a need to see adoption as an overall part of a child care service and child care legislation and to integrate adoption law into overall children's law.  It is unfortunate that adoption law is still being kept as a separate area of legislation.  It is also unfortunate that it has taken so long for this Bill to appear.  The Minister expressed the <Col N="169" /> hope that we would have adoption legislation in this House before the autumn. I hope he can fulfil that aspiration because in my experience we have a major problem in the area of drafting legislation.  The Minister referred to this when he said he would have preferred to produce one overall Bill but because of the length of time it takes to produce this type of legislation we have this Bill as a start.</P>
    <P>If we have such difficulty in drafting legislation and providing comprehensive legislative measures in areas where the need for reform is so well documented, the time is long overdue to reform the whole system in the preparation of Bills at the parliamentary draftsmanship stage.  I cannot understand why it takes so long.  It seems that every Government Department &mdash; the Department of Health are not unique in this &mdash; have commitments to produce legislation in a wide variety of areas.  Much of the legislation is not controversial in the party political sense; much of it is long overdue and necessary, and much of it is required to reform anachronistic legislation which can no longer provide for the social and legal problems of modern society.  Yet this legislation seems to be clogged up in a parliamentary black hole which is described as the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman into which it seems to disappear and out of which it emerges many years later.  It seems that different Governments have been caught on this problem.  In the areas of social legislation and social reform we seem to be particularly caught.</P>
    <P>While I fully accept the Minister's commitment and acknowledge the Government commitment to reform in these areas, once that commitment exists why can we not reform the present procedures that exist in the drafting of legislation?  If we do not have a sufficient number of parliamentary draftsmen, why not employ more?  I have never been a Minister, I am not a member of a Government and I probably will never be a Minister, but I presume Ministers know how the system operates and have an insight into <Col N="170" /> where the delays are.  I find it extraordinary that it is impossible to produce a comprehensive child reform measure dealing with all the areas and that after two and a half years in Government we are only in a position to produce this measure, albeit it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>This must be contrasted, for example, with the approach of other democratic countries of similar background to ours. In the early seventies Australia had a similar law system to ours in the area of family law and children's law and their legislation was totally out of date.  A Government there in a couple of years was able to introduce one of the most wide ranging legislative reforming measures to deal with family law.  What is our problem?  Why do we lack the capacity to produce comprehensive legislation quickly?  We have that capacity with regard to the Finance Bill, but perhaps that clogs up the works for six months of every year.  Legislation of a social reforming nature takes too long to come through.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the Minister's commitment and hope that he can fulfil his aspiration of producing an Adoption Bill next year.  I have my doubts, not because of any lack of commitment on the part of the Government or the Minister but simply because, having been a Member of this House for three years, I see how slowly Bills emerge out of the bowels of the draftsmanship process.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with an important Bill, but because we are not dealing with the adoption area or the juvenile justice area we are tackling only part of the problem.  I also regret that the Bill relating to the status of children has not been formally published and given a First Reading before this House.  A Bill is not a Bill until it is published in this House. The consultative process that might arise from the publication of a Bill, which is perfectly correct, could just as easily have been dealt with in regard to the Status of Children Bill as with the present Bill if the former had been given a First Reading, had a Second Stage debate and after some months had Committee Stage.  I do not see the necessity for producing a <Col N="171" /> glossy booklet containing a draft Bill, with what is basically a precis of the type of memorandum which would accompany a draft Bill, not giving it a First Reading here and not affording the House an opportunity of debating it.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in the manner in which it is drafted, has inherent problems contained within it because it has not been preceded by the Status of Children Bill and the Minister does not know whether that Bill will be completed before or after this present one.  He has clearly indicated that, if and when the Status of Children Bill comes before this House, this present Bill will have to be amended by that. There is need for an overall approach, to deal with these issues in a more comprehensive way.  One cannot divide up children's rights and deal with one part of the problem at one time and another at another.  As it has taken us so long to deal with the present part of the problem, I do not know when we will be able to deal with the other parts.</P>
    <P>I want to make a number of comments of a general nature relating to the provisions of this Bill.  When we come to deal with the Bill on Committee Stage we will have an opportunity to go into matters in far greater detail.  First, there is the concept of the child.  Let us take the provisions relating to children at risk, in need of care and attention, in respect of whom one may seek a supervision order or a care order, children who may be placed in fosterage or in residential care. It seems to be presumed in the Bill in the context of care proceedings, if we can call them that, that these proceedings can be brought only in respect of children under 15 years of age.  If a child of 15 years and one day is being ill-treated and neglected by the parents, under this Bill there is a difficulty, if not an impossibility, in seeking a care order in relation to that child.  If parents ill-treat their three children of six years, eight years and 15 years, it seems that a health board could take the two younger ones into care but would have no power to seek an order in relation to the other.</P>
    <P>I refer to a document produced by <Col N="172" /> CARE, the Campaign for the Care of Deprived Children, one of the very first comprehensive documents produced by a voluntary organisation, called <i>Children Deprived</i>, which was published in 1972. It suggested that it should be possible to make care orders for children up to the age of 17 years.  I do not understand why 15 years is the cut off point.  In retaining the definition of a child as someone up to the end of his fourteenth year and a young person as someone between the ages of 15 and 17, as this Bill does, we seem, for no explainable reason, to be slavishly adopting the categorisation contained in the Children's Act of 1908, as amended. I do not understand why.  It gives rise to a major lacuna in this legislation in the context of what the Minister wants to achieve and what should be achieved.</P>
    <P>There are also problems with regard to the definition of a parent under this Bill. A parent in the context of an illegitimate child is expressly said not to include the natural father.  In looking for a care order a parent does not include the natural father if the child is illegitimate.  What we think about when talking about illegitimate children is a child born to an unmarried mother, who has not been married to the father of the child and is not living with him.  In those circumstances we can envisage that the father of the child is an irrelevancy as regards determining whether the child should be taken into care or not.  The problem is that children are illegitimate under our law in circumstances not as simplistic as that.  The problem, effectively, is that children may be illegitimate, for example, if one parent has been married, has obtained a Church decree of annulment and remarries in church.  If a wife has remarried for the second time in church and is living with her second husband and is regarded by the Catholic Church as genuinely married to him, the civil law does not recognise the marriage.  They can have as many children as they like, but the problem is that, although the parties have gone through a form of marriage because the child is regarded as illegitimate, the father is regarded as <Col N="173" /> playing no role and having no rights and no involvement in the context of any care application made by a health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity of raising the important matter of the adequacy and security of our prison system.  The fact that it is necessary to raise this question is itself an indication of the deteriorating social and economic situation prevailing in our country at present.  Sometimes when I hear the Minister and other Government speakers talk about the number of people behind bars I think it is a sad reflection on society generally that we have to have that kind of environment. I say to the Minister, particularly at this time, that I have raised this important national issue not for the purpose of embarrassing him or the Government in any way, tempting though that might be from the political point of view, but because of the public unease prevailing at the moment in relation to our entire security system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is fully aware that there is growing public unease about the law and order situation, particularly in relation to the adequacy of places of detention.  They want to know that the State is in a position to ensure that people will serve the sentences handed down by our courts.  I raise the matter for that reason and because of the frustration of the Garda, the prison officers and the courts in their efforts to combat the current wave of crime and vandalism which has been sweeping the country for some time.  I also raise it particularly for the purpose of reassuring the Minister that <Col N="174" /> he will have the full support and backing of our party in any efforts he or the Government make to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that we have a serious security and accommodation problem in our prisons and I say to him that this problem will not go away unless some positive action is taken by the Government to resolve it.  That must be the starting point if we are to have an objective and constructive debate on the current situation.  However, I am bound to say that the problem was compounded in a big way by the Government's decision to abandon the phased prison building programme initiated by Fianna Fáil. I ask the Minister in his reply not to resort to his usual negative defence of blaming Fianna Fáil for the problem with which he is now trying to cope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put the record straight in relation to Government expenditure on prison accommodation. When in Government in 1982 Fianna Fáil spent £15.5 million, with a projected expenditure of £17 million for 1983.  This Government came to power in December 1982 and they immediately cut the Estimate from our projected £17 million to £11.5 million.  Perhaps of greater interest is the fact that the eventual out-turn of the Government's own Estimate was an expenditure in real terms of £10.5 million. I hope that will put to rest once and for all the accusation that is coming across the floor of the House to me day after day that Fianna Fáil are responsible for creating the problem the Minister has to deal with now.</P>
      <P>In 1985 in their Estimates the Government provided for expenditure of £11.5 million but their spending in relation to that provision was £5.5 million.  That shows the commitment of my party in relation to the provision of prison accommodation. This Government made a drastic reduction in our Estimate but, even more important, the actual out-turn and expenditure by the Government in relation to their own Estimate was less than the amount for which they made provision.</P>
      <P>This Government are almost three years in power.  The security of our prisons and the state of law and order has deteriorated during that period.  I am not going to point my finger at the Minister and say he is responsible for that.  That would be an unfair accusation and I would not like to resort to that.  However, the Minister, the Taoiseach and the people are tragically aware of the situation because in the final analysis the latter are the victims of this serious deterioration in law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the admission by him and the Government of their intention to abandon the prison development programme gave a psychological boost to potential criminals.  These people knew in advance that if they broke the law there would not be any prison accommodation for them.  I hold the view that if there was anything worse than <Col N="176" /> abandoning the programme it was the announcement by the Government of their intention to do so.  It was almost as if it was a waste of public money.  I put it to the Minister that the real waste of public money is the cost of fragmented, stopgap action now being taken in providing inadequate and insecure prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>If we are even to commence tackling the problem, in the first instance we must have an honest admission from the Minister that the problem exists.  There is no point in his saying the situation is under control when it has been out of control for the past 18 months at least.  There is no point in his saying to the public that the situation has improved, that there is adequate prison accommodation now to cater for people convicted in our courts when we know that all our accommodation is completely overcrowded.</P>
    <P>I supported the Minister in his efforts to open Spike Island.  I say it was a necessary emergency measure to deal with the major problem of car thefts and joyriding. I would have to say to the Minister that, to some extent, the timing of the decision by the Government was reactionary or panic in nature because of the public outcry which existed at that time, and continues to exist, in relation to the deterioration of law and order.  I want to ask the Minister why the Government did not proceed with their plans for the development of Spike Island.  The Minister knew that there was a serious problem obtaining which would get worse.  Yet he and the Government chose to close their eyes in the hope that it would go away. It must be acknowledged that the Prison Officers' Association &mdash; because of their concern about deteriorating prison conditions and the threat to law and order &mdash; gave the Minister their full co-operation on the opening of Spike Island.  They did so under extremely difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>Surely the Government must have been aware that, in deciding to abandon the prison development programme, there would be need for additional accommodation.  That decision was taken almost 18 months ago.  It is not unfair to <Col N="177" /> pose the following question to the Minister here this evening, why did he not at that time take some positive action in relation to the opening of Spike Island? Why did he not take whatever action was necessary to ensure that it would be a safe place of detention?  Perhaps the Minister has problems within the Cabinet in relation to the provision of moneys for this work.  I can appreciate any Minister finding himself in that situation.  But Governments must face reality and the reality always existed that there was not sufficient accommodation in our prisons.</P>
    <P>Following the decision to open Spike Island the events which followed in relation to the actual opening left much to be desired.  Prisoners and prison officers were assigned the task of securing the island as a safe means of detention.  While I agree with the therapeutic value of work for prisoners it was tempting nature too much to expect that a group of prisoners would work hard at securing their own detention when the natural instinct of the prisoner would be to secure his freedom if at all possible.  We now know that that experiment did not succeed.  I am sure the Minister himself would admit that the experiment has not been successful, at least to date.</P>
    <P>We had the example of six prisoners escaping from the prison, one of whom is still at large.  We had a further attempted escape from the prison in the last couple of days.  Indeed, we had the ludicrous, if not frightening, report emanating from the prison officers' conference in Kilkenny that prisoners were involved in the brewing of beer.  That might be funny were it not for the fact that it was taking place in what is, to all intents and purposes, an open prison and on an island on which ten civilian families live.  The Minister should immediately render Spike Island a secure place of detention or else take a decision to abandon it altogether. He owes it to the families residing on the island to ensure their safety and that of the prison as well.  He owes it to the prison officers whose lives have been put at risk performing a dangerous and demanding task on the nation's behalf. Sometimes sufficient recognition is not <Col N="178" /> given to the fact that the Minister owes it to the prisoners themselves who are also entitled to the protection of a system which guarantees their individual safety while in the custody of the State.</P>
    <P>Spike Island was to be the safety valve in relieving over-crowding in our established prisons.  We know now that it has failed to achieve that objective to date. The tragic evidence of that failure has been demonstrated over the past few days in another prison here in Dublin, Arbour Hill, where there was an outbreak of violence related directly to over-crowding and which placed the lives of prison officers and prisoners alike at risk. The Minister and the Government have a duty to take immediate action to put our prison system in a secure state.  Apart altogether from the officers' position, which is a very dangerous and serious one, public confidence in our system has been shattered; there is absolutely no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I was tempted to move into an area which the Ceann Comhairle asked me not to and I shall respect his wishes in that regard but I might say that those areas are relevant in the present situation. I acknowledge that the Minister has an extremely difficult task endeavouring to cope with the problem which has now got out of hand.  I would not expect him to admit it but he himself is now the victim of a Government decision to ignore the problem in our prisons 18 months ago and, to the extent that violence is a product of the economic and social climate prevailing, the Taoiseach and the Government must take immediate action to put this matter right.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister at Question Time today announce his intention to use a recreational block at Portlaoise as a detention centre.  I put it to him that this constitutes a further stop-gap measure only.  I question the location and the suitability of the block for the purposes for which the Minister now intends to use it. I wonder if the Minister had consultations with the prison officers and other interested parties in relation to the opening of this area of detention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The House will be aware of the efforts which have been made to ensure that adequate accommodation is available in the prisons to cope with the increasing number being committed to custody.  The need for these efforts &mdash; and, indeed, their success &mdash; can be seen from the fact that whereas at the beginning of this year there were 1,491 in custody 1,940 offenders are accommodated in our prisons today.</P>
      <P>Accommodation in our prisons has increased by 449 in four months.  That is an increase of 30 per cent and the Deputy will appreciate the kind of pressure it puts on the system when one is trying to get adequate staff and adequate accommodation over a very short period.  Whether one is talking about schools, hospitals or prisons, once one is faced with such a dramatic increase over a short period, it creates problems.</P>
      <P>It would be foolish to pretend that such an unprecedented growth over such a short time does not cause difficulties and problems for the prison service.  But the prison service is making every effort to cope with the additional demands being made upon it and it is unfortunate when some people, either through ignorance or malice, undermine those efforts.  Specifically, the charge that has been made here today that a &ldquo;serious crisis&rdquo; has developed in our prisons this week is as foolish as it is dangerous.  The prisoners have access to the media and they can be convinced that there is a crisis in the prison and a problem will arise from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of the operation of the prisons whether inside or outside this country shows that the reality of prison life is that from time unfortunate incidents occur.  We should not describe these flare-ups as a breakdown of the <Col N="180" /> system because that can be quite dangerous. It is regrettable that these incidents took place last week but in the context of previous experience of prison administration both here and abroad the incidents which took place last week while regrettable are fairly minor.</P>
    <P>In Arbour Hill at about 7.15 p.m. last Tuesday three prisoners out of about 55 who were in the recreation hall forced out the five staff who were on duty and then attacked some other prisoners whose presence they objected to because they were serving sentences for sex offences.  Order was restored in about a quarter of an hour.  Three prison officers and one prisoner were brought to hospital but thankfully none had been seriously injured.  The dispute among the offenders seems to relate to an on-going feud concerning sex offenders and there have been outbursts of this type of trouble over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The Governor has reviewed the situation and is taking certain measures which it would not be in the public interest to disclose.  In addition, proposals which were put to my Department this morning by representatives of the Prison Officers' Association are being considered.</P>
    <P>The decision to acquire Fort Mitchel on Spike Island &mdash; incidentally it is only the fort and not the entire island that has been acquired &mdash; was made because of the capacity of the fort to be brought into use as an open prison virtually immediately and because of its potential in the long run to be made relatively secure.</P>
    <P>My Department took over Fort Mitchel on 29 March last and within a fortnight the first prisoners were housed there.  There are now about 70 offenders there.  The prison is run generally along the lines of other open centres such as Shanganagh Castle and Shelton Abbey, although the fort does provide somewhat more security than others.  The offenders are occupied during the day on work to improve security which will enable the fort to be used in the longer term as a relatively secure prison.</P>
    <P>The Criteria generally to be used in selecting offenders for Fort Mitchel for <Col N="181" /> its present use are that they should be assessed as suitable for the type of regime operating there and be serving short sentences or have served a large portion of longer sentences.  There are offenders who would be going back into the community soon in any event, either finally or as part of a programme of release.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give assurances about Fort Mitchel particularly while it is being run along the lines of an open centre, that offenders will not abscond. In relation to the question of the risk to the safety of the people living on the island because of escapes, we cannot give an absolute commitment in relation to anybody's security but any local people living near it are as secure as anybody else and probably more secure than most people having regard to the fact that there is extra security on the island.  There is no suggestion that there is a risk to the people of Arklow from Shelton Abbey or to the people of Bray from Shanganagh Castle and nobody has suggested that the people in Cavan are a risk because of Loughan House.  There is not a direct relationship between the location of a prison and the risk to people living nearby.  I appreciate that people living on the island are concerned.  I had consultations with the Garda Commissioner last night and four gardaí were on the island last night and there will be gardaí on the island every night, not to look after the prisoners but to make the residents on the island feel more secure.  We will continue with that solution until we have a secure prison and it is possible to make Spike Island secure.</P>
    <P>This morning officials of my `Department had a meeting with officials of the Prison Officers' Association and a number of measures which I propose to take to deal with the increasing numbers in custody were discussed with them. These proposals include:</P>
    <P> (i) recruitment of temporary staff pending a recruitment competition for permanent prison staff.</P>
    <P>(ii) the transfer of about 20 officers from Loughan House to other institutions. This will enable 20 staff to be <Col N="182" /> transferred to Fort Mitchel so that more offenders can be dealt with there and</P>
    <P>(iii) the use of the single officers' quarters at Portlaoise as custodial accommodation. </P>
    <P>I believe these measures will help the situation and I would appeal to all concerned to adopt a commonsense and realistic approach to the prison system.</P>
    <P>People should bear in mind that the prisoners have access to media reports and statements which are made &mdash; however well intentioned &mdash; can have an inflammatory effect in the institutions.  In this regard I have been concerned at the effect of some statements which have been made particularly over the past couple of weeks by people who purport to represent the interests of staff.  I intend meeting the new president of the Prison Officers' Association over the coming week and I would hope that our meeting will lead to an end to this situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland referred to cuts and the abandonment of the prison building programme.  The Deputy talked about his Government spending £15.9 million in 1982.

      <P>Council Directive 85/210/EEC concerning the lead content of petrol was adopted on 20 March 1985.</P>
      <P>The main proposals are that, from October 1989, member states must ensure the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol throughout their territories and may require the marketing of unleaded petrol from an earlier date, if they so wish.  In addition member states are required, as soon as they consider it appropriate to do so, to reduce the maximum lead content of leaded petrol from 0.4 grammes per litre to 0.15 grammes per litre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refinery at Whitegate is making the necessary technical adjustments to enable it to produce petrol with a maximum lead content of 0.15 grammes per litre by 1986.  In addition, the Department of Energy are in consultation with the oil marketing companies in relation <Col N="123" /> to the importation of petrol with that lead content.  In the light of those consultations, I will be amending, as appropriate, the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) Regulations.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive new air pollution legislation which I hope to introduce later this year will contain provisions in relation to the regulation of the composition of fuels, in so far as this is necessary to prevent or limit air pollution.  Pending the enactment of this legislation, regulations to provide for the introduction of unleaded petrol could be made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>My Department are arranging discussions with other Departments concerned with a view to ensuring the smooth introduction of supplies of unleaded petrol consistent with the demand for it.  The intention will be to ensure an orderly introduction and reasonable spread of unleaded petrol on the market and to ensure that its introduction does not have a detrimental effect on the availability of petrol in rural areas.  The timing of any regulations in relation to the sale of lead free petrol will be decided in the light of these considerations.</P>

    <P>The number of widows involved in the claim for parity is about 9,600, and the increased rates of pension arising from such parity would entail a cost to the <Col N="124" /> Exchequer of some £3.56 million in 1985 terms.  These figures include certain areas of the public service &mdash; viz. the industrial Civil Service, the local authority and health board service (employees) and the Permanent Defence Forces (non-commissioned ranks) &mdash; where contributory widows' pension schemes did not operate from 1968 but were introduced on later dates.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the question of pension parity for the widows concerned is a budgetary matter which will have to be considered in the context of the 1968 provisions for public service pay and pensions generally.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, would be unable to provide general practitioner services including the supply of drugs, for themselves and their depen-dants without incurring an undue level of hardship.  The long term illness scheme provides drugs free of charge where prescribed for the treatment of one of a specific list of illnesses.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the services provided, possession of a medical card comprehends the benefits of possession of a long term illness book and these are therefore withdrawn on issue of a medical card.  The nature of the conditions listed in the long term illness scheme is such that regular consultation with a medical practitioner is likely in any event so that significant inconvenience to the patient should not generally arise on issue of a medical card.  It is unlikely that the cost of supplying drugs through the medical card scheme would be greater than through the long term illness scheme because of the financial terms upon which drugs are supplied in the GMS relative to normal retail sales of drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have approved a non-capital allocation of £75.480 million for the Mid-Western Health Board for 1985 in respect of its direct expenditure, including its share of the expenses of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.  This compares with a corresponding allocation of £71.820 million for 1984 and represents an increase of 5.1 per cent on the 1984 figure.</P>
      <P>The 1985 non-capital allocation for the Mid-Western Health Board and for other health boards was determined on an equitable basis within the limits of the Exchequer provision for health services for that year and associated Government decisions as regards specific measures to be implemented to achieve reductions in expenditure or increases in income.</P>
      <P>I have advised health boards repeatedly as to the necessity to draw up a detailed plan setting out the precise measures selected by them to ensure that expenditure is contained within approved allocation levels.  Regrettably the Mid-Western Health Board has not so far approved of and implemented appropriate measures to secure essential reductions in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delay in tackling the budgetary situation realistically will inevitably give rise to more serious problems later in the year and in future years.  I appreciate the difficulties that must be overcome in the context of restricted budgets and, in recognition of this, and in order to assist health boards to the extent that it is possible for me to do so, I have, as announced today, decided, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to allow the boards to retain fully amounts collected from farmers in respect of arrears of health contributions.  In effect this will mean that health boards' approved 1985 <Col N="133" /> allocations may be increased <i>pro rata</i> with arrears of health contributions collected.</P>
    <P>There are no additional funds at my disposal which would enable me to provide further financial help for health boards in regard to the financing of their on-going services.  I would, therefore, exhort the Mid-Western Health Board and other health boards who have still to resolve fully their 1985 budgetary situation, to give top priority to this essential and unavoidable task.</P>

      <P>The cost of including inhalants for asthmatics in the long term illness scheme is dependent on the number of cases, the severity of the condition in the individual case and the type of medication involved. While it is not possible to indicate these accurately, it is estimated that the net additional cost involved would be in excess of IR£10 million.  This is roughly equivalent to the total expenditure on the scheme last year.</P>

      <P>The only basis upon which medical cards are issued is where the chief executive officer of a health board is satisfied that a person is unable to provide general practitioner services for himself and his dependants without undue hardship. Medical cards were issued to the victims who survived the Stardust tragedy on the grounds that their medical and financial circumstances at that time rendered them eligible.  The Eastern Health Board gave no commitment, and could not have given any commitment that medical cards would be retained indefinitely, irrespective of individual circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with standard procedure, when the cards issued to these persons came up for review all of the relevant circumstances, including the fact that they had been involved in the Stardust <Col N="135" /> disaster, were taken into account.  Where any cards were withdrawn they were only from those persons whose incomes were considerablty in excess of the national income guidelines operating at that time and having full regard to the cost of necessary medical treatment.  Even where medical cards are withdrawn the persons in question continue to be eligible for free hospital treatment and to have the cost of drugs in excess of £28 prescribed for use in a calendar month refunded by the Eastern Health Board.</P>

The rate of pension payable to the widow was consequently reduced to £22.50 a week.  This is the appropriate rate for a widow with no qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £22 but do not exceed £24. She is assessed with means of £23.07 a week derived from a farm holding.  If the child in question is still in full time education, the form which was sent to the widow should be certified by the school authorities and returned to the Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will outline the present policy with regard to whether or not any obligation rests on the Garda Síochána to notify parents in the event of minors being arrested; whether he will consider the introduction of a mandatory regulation which would oblige parents not merely to be notified in such cases but to be also present in Court in the event of their children being charged; and if he agrees that this might also help parents who wish to exercise proper controls on their children and who apparently, under the present system, may very well be totally ignorant of misdemeanours being carried out by their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Garda have instructions at present that where they find it necessary to question a child or take a statement from him they should, as a general rule, request a parent or guardian of the child to be present.  The instructions further provide that if a parent or guardian cannot be contacted, an adult relative of the child should be approached, if possible.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 &mdash; which is not in force as yet &mdash; provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where a person under the age of 17 years is detained in a Garda station, the member in charge must inform the parent or guardian accordingly as soon as practicable.  The regulations to be made under section 7 of that Act regarding the treatment of persons in custody will set out the steps to be taken by the Garda to give effect to section 5.  With regard to the attendance at court of parents, section 98 of the Children Act, 1908 makes provision for the Garda to warn parents to attend and for the court to require their attendance.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the free post-primary education scheme, pupils from Arranmore Island are entitled to boarding grants payable in respect of children from islands or remote areas outside the range of transport to suitable day post-primary schools.  The terms of this scheme are of general application and do not provide for the payment of the cost of transport to home and back to school at weekends. I have approved the provision of a post-primary school on Arranmore Island.</P>

      <P>The question of the eligibility of a candidate for a higher education grant is a matter in the first instance for the local rating authority.  If the person in question wishes to have her case for a higher education grant considered she should apply to Dublin Corporation, the body administering the higher education grants scheme in her area.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of an EC grant the person concerned is not eligible for the award of such a grant as, under the terms of the European Social Fundaided special training grants scheme these grants are available only to students attending one and two-year courses of vocational training at national certificate level in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology.</P>
