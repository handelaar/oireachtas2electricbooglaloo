    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That a sum not exceeding £731,140,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu of rates on agricultural land and other grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Environment estimate is one of the largest which the Dáil will be asked to vote this year.  It is fair to say that it also probably covers at least as wide a range of public activities as any other single vote.  In moving any major estimate such as this one cannot but be conscious of the amount of public money being sought from Dáil Éireann and of the onus that lies on the Minister to whom it is voted to see that it is spent to the best effect possible in providing the services for which it is made available.  This means ensuring that the right policies are being pursued to achieve the Government's objectives in the areas in question and that the services are delivered in a manner that is at once cost effective and responsive to the needs of the community. As most of the services with which my Department are concerned are actually provided by the local authorities one can readily appreciate in this context the importance of the fundamental reform of the local government system on which the Government have now embarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net 1985 Environment Estimate at £731 million is up 12 per cent on last year's actual expenditure.  Some £578 million of the Estimate represents current expenditure and £153 million is classified as capital.  In the non-voted part of the Public Capital Programme, the Government are providing a further sum of £475 million to finance local authority capital works.  The total money for which my <Col N="549" /> Department have responsibility is therefore £1,206 million.  This year total expenditure by local authorities &mdash; capital and current &mdash; will exceed 10 per cent of GNP.  The local authorities provide direct employment for some 35,000 people.</P>
    <P>These increased provisions demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to the social and economic development of the country even at a time when the scope for any increases in public expenditure is severely constrained. Deputies will note that these provisions are fully in line with the global allocations given in chapter 7 of the national plan and are therefore fully integrated with the economic and fiscal policies underlying the plan.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before us can be usefully broken down into five important classifications, namely, grants and recoupments to local authorities&mdash;£455 million; subsidies to local authorities for loan charges for specific services&mdash;£230 million; direct departmental services&mdash;£54.9 million; departmental administration&mdash;£14 million; and grants to voluntary, semi-State and international bodies&mdash;£7.3 million. Deputies will see from the above amounts that £685 million or 90 per cent of the Vote is paid to local authorities to assist them in providing the normal day-to-day services which many people take for granted.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to deal with some of the more important areas of my Department's work.  I will try to concentrate on what we achieved in each area in the past year and, more importantly, the goals which we have set for the coming year. The need for reform in local government has been recognised by all parties and by successive governments.  The Government decisions which I announced on 11th of this month mean that major initiatives in this area are now under way. The measures announced are part of a comprehensive programme for strengthening and improving the system which will be carried out in stages and will take some time to complete.  Fundamentally, the Government intend to put new life into local authorities not only through organisational changes but by bringing <Col N="550" /> about a situation in which they are working more effectively and are more widely involved in the delivery of services to local communities.  A widening of the local authority role in social and economic affairs, featuring substantive devolution of functions from the centre, is seen as an integral part of this purpose.</P>
    <P>A major reorganisation of the local government system in the Dublin area has been decided on.  The city boundary will be adjusted.  In the county area, three new county councils will be established to take over, in due course, the administration of the areas now served by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. With a view to the further development of structures at a more local level each of the four new areas will be subdivided into districts &mdash; six in the city and two in each of the new county areas.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinating metropolitan council, which will be drawn from the four new authorities and which will encompass the proposed Dublin Transport Authority, will also be established.  The area of Dublin Corporation will remain substantially as at present but a number of changes will be made to rationalise the boundary, the net effect of which will be to increase the city's population by about 20,000.  The membership of the city council will be increased from 45 to 52.</P>
    <P>The proposals for County Dublin are based on its three natural divisions.  An administrative county will be based on the area that lies east of the Dublin mountains, containing Dún Laoghaire and its hinterland up to the watershed of the mountains and including areas like Shankill, Foxrock, Dundrum and Church-town. It will have 28 members and a population of about 180,000.  A second administrative county will be based on the part of the county between the mountains and the river Liffey, and will include Firhouse, Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Rathcoole.  It will have a membership of 26 and a population of about 166,000. The third administrative county will be based on the part of the county north of the Liffey and will include the developing area around Blanchardstown as well as Baldoyle, Kilbarrack and Howth and the <Col N="551" /> north county area beyond Ballymun, Santry and Darndale.  This council will have 24 members and a population of about 112,000.  Overall, the ratio of population to each elected representative in the Dublin area will be reduced from 10,450 to 7,716, which is still the highest such ratio in the country.</P>
    <P>I have established an independent commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Murphy, a judge of the High Court, to determine by the end of February, boundaries for 12 districts, six in the city area and two in each of the proposed county council areas.  The commission will also recommend the division of the new authorities into electoral areas.  As indicated, the districts will facilitate the more local administration of suitable services.</P>
    <P>The changes in the city boundary will be in operation for the local elections. The elections will be to the city council and to the three new county councils. Arrangements must be made during a transitional phase for the transfer from the existing county and borough councils to the new councils of functions, assets, liabilities, and staff and for all consequential matters, in such a way as to ensure a smooth hand-over without disruption of services.  This will be a complex matter and it will take some time to complete all the details.  I have initiated consultations with the existing elected councils and their officials.</P>
    <P>A transitional period during which the existing county council and the new county councils will operate in parallel will be essential, therefore, to facilitate orderly transfer.  It is envisaged that during this period the members elected to the new county councils will function also as members of the existing county council while councillors elected for electoral areas which correspond, as closely as possible, with the area of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, will function also as the borough council.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, the Government have taken action to bring about more equal representation of different electoral <Col N="552" /> areas within counties and county boroughs. In a number of instances, County electoral areas have over twice the number of representatives in relation to population as others in the same county. It is clearly desirable that this undemocratic situation be remedied and that this should be done with the minimum disturbance of electoral boundaries. Accordingly, a second independent commission has been established under the chairmanship of Miss Justice Carroll, a judge of the High Court to recommend, not later than the end of February, such electoral boundary changes as may be necessary to secure a reasonable relationship between population and seats.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government have decided that Galway should become a county borough.  This is justified by its population and by its role as the capital of the west and as a university city.  I am in the process of consulting with Galway Corporation and Galway County Council in regard to the implementation of the decision.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the Carroll Commission to consult with the local authorities concerned on whether the boundaries of the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway should be extended to include suburbs and environs and, if so, to make recommendations on such extensions and on any appropriate adjustments in membership.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for revision of the boundaries of many other towns where a large part of the urban population now lives outside the administrative area of the town.  Such revisions could not be completed for such a large number of towns within a short time scale.  The Government therefore decided that the elections in 1985 to these bodies will be on the basis of the existing boundaries. A review of each of these cases will be undertaken with a view to revising these boundaries and membership, where appropriate, in advance of the subsequent local elections.  Consideration will also be given to whether the existing status of particular towns should be altered and whether new town councils <Col N="553" /> should be set up where there are none at present.</P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined will give rise to a substantial programme of legislation.  Legislation will be required urgently to give effect to the recommendations of the two independent commissions and to deal with certain related matters.  This initial legislation, which will have to be introduced as soon as possible in this session, will provide for the alteration of the Dublin city boundary, elections to the three new county councils in Dublin, the upgrading of Galway to county borough status, possible alterations to the boundaries of Cork, Limerick and Galway cities, the alteration of the membership of certain local authorities, and related matters. This will be followed by further legislative proposals dealing with other aspects of the reform programme.  These will include provision for a metropolitan council for Dublin; for a statutory boundary commission to review town boundaries and for extension of the local authority role in the delivery of economic and social services locally.  Following the local elections, further legislation will be required later in the year to deal with the actual transfer of functions and responsibilities, and of staff, assets, liabilities and so on from the county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation to the new county councils.</P>
    <P>I will be developing these measures and explaining them more fully in presenting the new legislation during this session and there will be ample opportunity then for the House to discuss fully the reshaping and improvement of the local government system which has now been launched.</P>
    <P>Improving the system for the financing of local authorities is seen as an integral part of the overall reform programme. At present local authorities are dependent on central funding to a degree that may be detrimental to the dynamism of local government and to local democracy.</P>
    <P>Initial measures were taken by the Government to assist the finances of local authorities in 1983 by the ending of the <Col N="554" /> limitation of rate increases together with the injection of over £30 million into the original 1983 rates support grants provision. The increased provision was maintained in 1984 and 1985 and there will be reasonable increases in 1986 and 1987 under the national plan.  In addition, specific State grants and subsidies to local authorities in 1985 are higher than in 1984.  By these measures the Government are acknowledging the need to support local authority finances in the short term, while longer term measures are being identified and developed.</P>
    <P>For their part, local authorities can take steps to ensure that they use scarce resources efficiently.  I know that the economic difficulties of the recent past have made it necessary for everyone to have greater regard for value for money in planning expenditure and to have strict regard for priorities.  I know that local authorities have been taking action to maintain services and employment at a consistent level by eliminating waste and by making reasonable use of their powers to levy and collect rates and charges efficiently.</P>
    <P>Having considered the obvious need for greater equity in the taxation system and the unsatisfactory nature of local finances, the Government decided, in the context of the national plan, to introduce a farm tax for the benefit of local authorities with effect from 1986.  The preparation of this legislation is now at an advanced stage.  As I have said before, the farm tax can be regarded as no more than a step &mdash; albeit an important one &mdash; on the road to a reformed local financing system.  It has to be accepted that there is no realistic prospect under present conditions of substantial additional resources being made available to local authorities in the short term, or that they can be exempted from the constraints which necessarily govern public spending at the present time.  The Government, however, will continue to pursue the question of a more balanced system of local financing. Two bodies, the Commission on Taxation and the NESC, are at present examining the question of local finances in some detail, and I look forward to <Col N="555" /> getting their views on the subject before considering what further proposals can be developed.</P>
    <P>The past year saw a continuation, although at a reduced rate, of the pattern of declining output which has characterised the building and construction industry in recent years.  This trend, in a year which saw a resumption of moderate growth in the economy in general, underlines once again just how difficult an adjustment the building industry has had to make in the aftermath of the unsustainable and inflationary expansion of the late seventies and early eighties.  The cause of the difficulties remains the decline in private investment particularly in the areas of industrial and commercial development where the surplus of office accommodation, retail units and factory space is discouraging new investment.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to see the decline in the industry reversed and growth resumed as soon as possible. The problems of the industry are being tackled on two fronts &mdash; by raising public expenditure affecting the industry to its highest sustainable level and by creating conditions that will be conducive to increased private investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>The national plan provides for an increase of almost 9½ per cent in Public Capital Programme expenditure affecting the building industry between 1984 and 1987.  This increase will occur in spite of the fact that some public investment programmes with significant building elements have been wound down as they near completion.  Over the period of the plan, construction will account for an increased share of total public capital expenditure.  As far as the major programmes of my own Department are concerned, investment in roads, sanitary services and housing will increase by 15 per cent by 1987.  By increasing public expenditure in the industry, by promoting recovery in the economy in general, by stabilising the burden of taxation and by restoring order to the public finances, the programme of action set out in the plan will help to restore private sector <Col N="556" /> confidence and increase private investment. The plan also contains a number of specific measures which will have the effect of boosting output and employment in the industry.  I was indeed, pleased to note a recent forecast of a resumption of real growth in the industry in 1985 contained in the latest ESRI quarterly economic commentary.</P>
    <P>Last year saw the completion of a major report on the industry by the Sectoral Development Committee, a committee representative of the industry, trade unions and Government.  I am at present examining this report in consultation with the other interests involved.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I had hoped to proceed to Committee Stage with the Building Control Bill, 1984 during the last session.  However, a number of major issues were raised by the professional institutions involved in the industry which required extensive consideration and discussion with these bodies.  Arising from these discussions, a number of amendments to the Bill will be proposed. I am hopeful that the consultations which have taken place will facilitate the early and effective implementation of the Building Regulations following the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope to circulate shortly to other Government Departments the general scheme of a new Housing Bill which will fundamentally revise and update the statutory provisions on the management and letting of local authority housing in line with the undertaking given in paragraph 5.88 of the national plan.  Particular emphasis is being given to the housing needs of homeless persons, as well as the needs of other disadvantaged groups such as the aged, the disabled, travellers and one-parent families.</P>
    <P>There has been in recent years increasing concern that the housing prospects of particular categories of persons such as the single homeless have been relatively poor.  The general objective of the new arrangements will be to facilitate a greater balance and sensitivity to particular needs in the housing programme of local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The Bill will provide also for the initiatives announced by the Government in the national plan which require statutory validation.  These include the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers buying private houses, and the scheme of improvement work to &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; housing schemes and older rented local authority houses.</P>
    <P>This Housing Bill will be the most significant amendment to housing legislation in recent years.  It will afford Deputies an opportunity to consider and influence the direction and emphasis of housing policy for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Total housing completions in 1984 were around the 25,000 mark.  This represents a considerable achievement given the grave economic difficulties which we have had to face.  Over the past decade total annual housing completions have been maintained within a range from 24,000-28,900.  We are almost unique in Europe in successfully maintaining a consistently high level of new house completions. Many other countries are now building between half and two thirds of the number of new houses they were building in the mid-seventies.</P>
    <P>The Government have supported the national housing programme in recent years in a wide variety of ways.  We introduced the Housing Finance Agency which has made home ownership a reality for low income groups who would otherwise have to rely on local authority housing. I am glad the Government saw fit to maintain the £1,000 new house grant and the £3,000 mortgage subsidy payable by my Department despite the advice of the National Planning Board that we should restrict or terminate these schemes; we have substantially increased output on the local authority housing programme and have introduced a number of new policy measures designed to maintain total housing output at the highest practicable level notwithstanding the economic and financial difficulties facing us.</P>
    <P>The provisions of direct State aid for new houses and for improving existing houses remains a central feature of housing policy.  The Government decision to continue the schemes of new house <Col N="558" /> grants, house improvement grants and the mortgage subsidy scheme means that in 1985 a total of about £45 million is being provided for these items, which is about £7 million more than in 1984.</P>
    <P>The maintenance and improvement of the existing housing stock is a vital aspect of the national housing policy.  Since the reintroduction of a house improvement scheme by the previous Coalition Government there has been a continuing good level of demand.  The provision of £8 million this year represents an increase of approximately 20 per cent over actual expenditure in 1984.</P>
    <P>The recent spell of severe weather has highlighted the plight of old people.  In this connection, I am indeed very glad to be able to say that the annual provision of £1 million for the scheme of Special Housing Aid for the Elderly is being continued. This scheme continues to provide an excellent service in improving the conditions of old people living alone in unacceptable conditions.  The scheme is overseen by a task force under the aegis of my Department and operated by the health boards, whose good work I gratefully acknowledge.  So far over 3,500 houses have been improved under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the response to the introduction of the £5,000 grant to encourage local authority tenants and tenant purchasers to purchase houses in the private sector.  The grant has been welcomed generally as an imaginative and worthwhile measure and I am glad to say that it has evoked a high level of interest.  I understand, for example, that more than 200 applications for the grant have already been submitted to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. Because the total package now available to those eligible is so generous many will be able to purchase their houses on a no deposit easy payment basis.  The new grant is available for the acquisition of both new and previously occupied houses.  I hope it will also play an important part in enabling authorities to reach the Government target of housing 9,000 households per annum under the local authority housing programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The availability of an adequate supply of mortgage finance is an important factor influencing the private housing programme.  While final figures are not yet available to me, it is clear that the record figure of £563 million advanced by the main lending agencies in 1983 was exceeded in 1984.</P>
    <P>The building societies of course are the major providers of mortgage finance and their contribution has been one of the most important elements in the success of the housing programme over the years. In 1984, they provided loans at least equalling, and probably exceeding, the £406 million provided in 1983.  Inflows of funds to the societies have been very good in recent months.  This is an encouraging sign that adequate amounts will again be available this year.  I should like to acknowledge the commendable restraint which the societies have recently shown in relation to interest rates.  This has meant that the basic mortgage rate has remained unchanged since late 1983 at 11¾ per cent &mdash; the lowest level since 1978.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to provide through the Small Dwellings Act and Housing Finance Agency loan schemes a supply of mortgage finance for the benefit of people who wish to purchase their own home but who would not be able to obtain finance from other sources.  The Government's commitment to these two schemes is underlined by the provision in the Public Capital Programme for 1985 of £149 million, which should finance more than 9,000 houses.  There continues to be a strong demand from borrowers for housing loans from public sources, which is likely to be further boosted as a result of the £5,000 house purchase grant scheme.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to state that in 1984 building activity under the local authority programme expanded considerably. Although final figures are not yet available, the indications are that house completions last year were about 7,000 with around 8,000 houses in progress at the year's end.  This represents the highest level of completions achieved in any one year since 1976.  It is a significant increase <Col N="560" /> over the 6,190 houses completed in 1983 which in turn was some 500 houses above the 1982 figure.  This level of activity has had a considerable impact on employment on the programme; average monthly employment during 1984 exceeded 6,800, compared with 6,400 in 1983.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the local authority housing programme is in its healthiest state for years.  This improvement is indicative of the measures taken by the Government to ensure the maximum return on investment in the programme, which this year alone will absorb about £385 million in capital expenditure and current subsidies. Last year, at this time, I spoke about the revised cost control procedures introduced by my Department during 1983 which were designed to secure the best possible return on the public capital invested in the programme.  While it is too early to quantify precisely the effects of the new procedures, there is no doubt that they have provided a framework within which the most cost efficient design decisions can be made and have ensured the most effective monitoring and control of expenditure.  I am particularly gratified that the expansion in output has been achieved without any recourse to low cost methods.</P>
    <P>This year, the Government have provided £205.75 million from the public capital programme for local authority housing construction.  As indicated in the national plan, the Government's objective is to provide accommodation annually for 9,000 households between building new houses and reletting from the existing stock.  My Department are currently processing claims from local authorities for capital allocations to cover expenditure on their existing commitments.</P>
    <P>While the bulk of local authority houses will continue to be provided by competitive tendering, the national plan envisaged that local authorities should also purchase new and second hand houses in the private sector in areas where established housing needs existed and where good value for money was obtainable.  Such an approach has the <Col N="561" /> potential to promote a more balanced social mix and give the housing authorities greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of housing applicants.</P>
    <P>My Department recently issued guidelines to all local authorities on this matter and requested that they give a general outline of the policy they intend to operate. It is intended that the main thrust of the new arrangement should be towards the purchase of new houses, although second hand houses would be purchased where they are seen to offer good value where particular needs have been identified. Already a number of proposals to purchase private houses have been submitted for approval.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new national differential rent scheme for local authority houses have been put to the National Association of Tenants Organisations and discussions with the association are continuing. At this stage it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the likely outcome of the discussions.</P>
    <P>The plan also visualises greater involvement by local authorities in joint venture housing as another means of encouraging people of modest means to buy private houses and of helping to ease the pressure on local authority waiting lists.  Under this arrangement authorities provide undeveloped building land under licence to private contractors for the construction of modestly priced houses for sale to selected purchasers.  I am glad to announce that, in order to further promote the concept of joint venture housing, I intend to extend the site subsidy, payable in respect of the provision of private sites to the joint venture scheme.</P>
    <P>Applicants on local authority approved waiting lists and tenants or sub-tenants of local authority houses who do not qualify for the £5,000 grant will now be eligible to benefit from a subsidy of up to £1,000 or one third of the site cost &mdash; thus enabling them to qualify for a contribution of this order towards the cost of the site on which their houses are built.  I will shortly be notifying local authorities of the details of the extended site subsidy scheme and I will also be asking them to ensure that the full benefit of the subsidy <Col N="562" /> is passed on to the relevant categories of purchasers.</P>
    <P>Details of the new scheme to enable housing authorities to remedy the serious deterioration which is affecting certain of their rented housing stock were notified to local authorities on 10 January.  The majority of the houses to benefit from the scheme were built in the sixties and early seventies under the low cost housing arrangements then in operation, but there are also a number of older dwellings which are in urgent need of extensive renovation if they are to continue to be suitable for letting.</P>
    <P>Finance will be made available to enable authorities to carry out essential remedial works of a structural nature to groups of defective low cost houses as well as to houses that are more than 50 years old.  The loan charges on such capital will be subsidised at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally designed to remedy defects in the local authority rented housing stock, but special arrangements have now been made to deal with housing schemes in which some houses have been or are being sold to the tenants. In such cases, the tenant-purchaser will be asked to bear half the cost of the work involved.  This amount may be paid by lump sum or by extended or increased annuity payment.  The balance will be borne by the authority but, as in the case of rented dwellings, the loan charges on the local authority's share of the cost will be subsidised at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent.  In return for their contribution towards the costs involved tenant purchasers will have the value of their houses enhanced considerably and will benefit from the general upgrading of their schemes that should result from the remedial works.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the scheme will enable authorities to tackle the longstanding problem of structural defects in low cost housing and will enable them to put into good repair those older dwellings which might otherwise be lost from their rented stock.</P>
    <P>The Rent Tribunal, which was set up in August 1983, saw its first full year of <Col N="563" /> the operation in 1984.  It determines the rent and other terms of tenancy of dwellings which were formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts.  During the year the tribunal made determinations in more than 750 cases.  I should like to record my appreciation of the work of the chairman and members of the tribunal who are faced with a very sensitive and difficult job.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of financial assistance for the provision of housing by voluntary organisations was introduced in March 1984.  Under the scheme a local authority may make a loan to an approved voluntary organisation to meet 80 per cent of the cost of an eligible housing project subject to a maximum loan equivalent to £16,000 for each unit of accommodation provided, including caretaker and welfare accommodation.  The loan charges will be fully subsidised so long as the accommodation continues to be let to eligible categories including the elderly, homeless persons, and a number of other categories.  Thus the loans are in effect non-repayable grants provided the voluntary body continues to abide by the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Details of the Government's overall programme for the travelling people were set out in the Government policy statement of 20 July 1984, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.  As indicated in that statement, the primary responsibility for the provision of houses for travellers and the selection and provision of serviced sites will remain with the local authorities and my Department will continue to provide the necessary funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Government's statement, my Department have impressed on housing authorities the necessity to ensure that the accommodation programme for travellers is stepped up rapidly.  As outlined in the statement, the provision of housing for travellers is being dealt with as an integral part of local authority housing programmes.  Wherever possible, and where it is in line with their preference, the travellers are being accommodated in local authority houses <Col N="564" /> provided as part of the regular housing programme.  However, for the travelling families who wish to live among other travellers, group housing schemes will continue to be provided but these are being designed to encourage maximum integration with their settled neighbours.</P>
    <P>There remains the problem of those families who do not wish to be accommodated in houses.  The review body felt that the provision of serviced halting sites should be kept to a minimum and, while the Government accept this, it is evident that there is a considerable demand for such sites.  I have asked housing authorities to ensure that where required as an alternative to housing an adequate number of halting sites should be provided. Since the Government's statement of 20 July 1984, I am pleased to say that some notable progress has been made by local authorities in their accommodation programme for travelling people.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin, where Deputies will be aware the situation has been particularly difficult, the county council have approved a programme for the provision of 17 halting sites throughout the county. My Department will assist the council in implementing this programme by ensuring that specific proposals submitted by the council are dealt with urgently.  A number of group housing scheme proposals from Dublin County Council has also been approved by the Department.</P>
    <P>While State expenditure on improvement and maintenance on roads has increased substantially in real terms in recent years, increasing by 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984, nevertheless it has still fallen short of the level projected in the 1979 Road Development Plan by 17 per cent.  In the national plan the Government set about remedying this shortfall in investment which could be a serious constraint on our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The Government have now given a high priority to road improvements, providing for substantial increases each year between 1985 and 1987, bringing the provision for 1987 to £155 million, or 53 per cent greater than that provided in 1984. The total provision for the period will not <Col N="565" /> only match but exceed by 10 per cent the amount envisaged for the period in the 1979 road plan.</P>
    <P>With a view to a further acceleration of road improvements, the Government will also be looking at proposals for the involvement of the private sector in the programme.  It has already been indicated that one such proposal for the building of a 3.3 km road linking the Lucan Road and the Navan Road in Dublin at a cost of more than £20 million is generally acceptable to the Government. My Department will shortly be making available to interested parties details of other projects potentially suitable for private sector funding.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we have a firm medium term commitment for State investment in roads, and at a level far in excess of anything previously achieved. It will enable the most ambitious roads programme ever undertaken to get under way immediately.  Of the total vote provision of £152.5 million for 1985, £125 million will be spent on road improvement projects an increase of 23 per cent on last year's provision.  Details of each local authority's allocation for 1985 were issued this week.  As indicated in the national plan, the roads programme over the next few years will be aimed directly at improving the national route network, which although representing only 6 per cent of total road mileage carries 35 per cent of all traffic.  An accelerated programme of improvement work on these and other routes offers a worthwhile economic return as well as yielding welcome road safety and environmental benefits.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, most of these projects will qualify for EC assistance.  For example, this year road projects are expected to account for £30 million (or approximately 38 per cent) of Regional Fund aid to Ireland.  Loans totalling £40 million are expected from the European Investment Bank and we will also be seeking additional aid from the recently established EC Transport Infrastructure Fund, from which grants totalling £4 million were approved under the Irish Presidency in <Col N="566" /> December, for the Bray-Shankill and Wexford by-passes.</P>
    <P>Several major new schemes will reach construction stage this year including by-passes at Blackrock, Chapelizod, Lucan and Athlone, and new bridges in Galway, at Mallow Street in Limerick and at the Opera House in Cork.  I expect to be in a position to announce next month details of the schemes expected to start in the period 1985 to 1987.  Major schemes in progress this year will include James Street, Drogheda; Navan relief road; Leighlinbridge by-pass; Wexford by-pass, Bandon Line Road in Cork; Midleton by-pass; Waterford Bridge; Cork to Mallow Road, and, in the Dublin area, Airport Road, stage 2; Bray Road at Westminster Road/Kill Lane and the Tallaght/Templeogue Road.</P>
    <P>Concern has often been expressed in the past both by local authorities and by Deputies from all sides of the House, about the level of block grant works on roads other than national roads.  I am happy to be able to say that the overall block grant allocation has been increased this year by 10 per cent.  The system of allocation of this grant has also been reviewed, with a view to the most equitable distribution of the available funds, especially by reference to mileage of regional roads.  All local authorities will receive increased block grant allocations this year.</P>
    <P>Major capital investment in road improvement must be backed up by an adequate maintenance programme.  The provision for road maintenance this year is £27.5 million, an increase of £2 million or 8 per cent over the 1984 provision. In accordance with established practice, grants will not be available for county road maintenance which will have to continue to be funded from the local authorities' own resources.  Maintenance grants will however, continue to be given for works on national routes and, through the block grant, for regional routes.</P>
    <P>The problem of uninsured driving has been a national scandal for too long.  It is impossible to be accurate about the extent of law breaking in this area.  However, I am not in a position to refute <Col N="567" /> insurance industry estimates that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of all drivers are uninsured.  In 1983, the Motor Insurers' Bureau paid out £5.6 million to accident victims involving uninsured drivers and had claims outstanding estimated at £42 million.  The Government have already announced that the level of surveillance for uninsured driving will be stepped up. The Garda Commissioner has given a commitment that this will be done.  For my part, I introduced legislation to increase the relevant maximum monetary penalties for breaches of the law in this area.  I also made regulations at the end of 1984 which will require insurance discs to be displayed on the windscreens of vehicles as and from 1 July 1986.  Insurance companies will start issuing the discs in July 1985 and everyone should have received their discs at the end of the following 12 month cycle of insurance renewals.</P>
    <P>The downward trend in road fatalities and injuries in recent years has been encouraging.  The number of fatalities fell from 628 in 1978 to 535 in 1983 while the number of reported injuries fell from 9,313 to 7,946 over the same period. There is further encouragement in the provisional figures for 1984 which have just become available to me and which show that the number of deaths fell further to 463.</P>
    <P>However, the fact that fatalities between the hours 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. which are of course the critical hours for drink related accidents, were as high as 216 in 1983, shows the continuing seriousness of the drunk-driving problem. Drink-related accidents are largely associated with blood-alcohol levels substantially above the legal limit of 100 milligrammes.  This must continue to be a priority for enforcement and for public education.</P>
    <P>For 1985, I have increased the grant to the National Road Safety Association by £78,000 or 18 per cent to enable the association to pursue an extended safety belt campaign in conjunction with the Garda.  The wearing of seat belts is an important aspect of road safety which <Col N="568" /> cannot be stressed often enough, and I am glad to say that evidence now to hand shows a significant increase in seat belt usage in 1984.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the House's attention to the decision by the EEC Council of Ministers during the recent Irish Presidency to initiate an EC programme on road safety, including the designation of 1986 as a European Road Safety Year. This is a most welcome development and one to which Ireland will have an important contribution.  I hope that road safety initiatives at Community level will provide a further boost to our own efforts and help to continue the recent encouraging trends in road accident rates.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of roads I would like to express again my appreciation of the excellent work by local authorities and their staffs in clearing away snow and ice to make the more important roads passable during the recent spell of bad weather, which is still continuing in places.  The success of the local authorities was due to their foresight in making the necessary plans and availing of the funds made available by my Department for capital equipment to deal with these conditions.  I am grateful to their staffs who worked long hours, in some cases practically round the clock as I am aware from my constituency, and showed such resourcefulness and dedication to duty.</P>
    <P>The crucial importance of the sanitary services programme to the provision of an adequate infrastructural framework for housing, industrial and other development is recognised by the Government in the funds being made available for the construction of public water and sewerage schemes.  Over the past two years £179 million was provided to local authorities for this purpose compared with £148 million over the previous two years.  This increasing capital has ensured that substantial progress has been made in bringing schemes to construction stage and in stepping up activity generally.  Last year I was able to release a record 102 separate schemes with a total value of £101 million which completely cleared the backlog of fully planned schemes that had been <Col N="569" /> awaiting approval in the Department. These releases are now facilitating rapid progress on the programme by allowing local authorities to proceed with the tendering and ultimately the construction processes.  Last year's releases brought the total value of schemes at tender and construction stages at the end of the year &mdash; including those brought to the construction stage at various times over the past few years &mdash; to a record figure of £450 million.  Many areas throughout the country &mdash; urban and rural &mdash; are benefiting from the major advances that have been made in the programme.</P>
    <P>The non-voted capital provision for public water and sewerage schemes in 1985 is £91 million and the total provided under the national plan for 1985 and the following two years is £278 million.  This provision will be adequate to finance the balance of the cost of schemes already under way and the cost of those now coming to construction.  In addition, it will facilitate the release of a reasonable number of urgently needed schemes which are now in the various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that in 1985 public water and sewerage schemes will attract £6 million from the European Regional Development Fund and £22 million from the European Investment Bank.  The sanitary services programme not only provides the necessary water and sewerage systems to encourage development but also provides additional facilities for fire fighting and the abatement of pollution. The releases over the last two years have allowed for some of the recommendations of the Water Pollution Advisory Council to be implemented and I am confident that the financial provisions over the next three years will enable this progress to be maintained.  During 1985 average direct employment on the construction of public water and sewerage schemes will be maintained at the 1984 level of about 2,050.</P>
    <P>This Estimate provides voted capital provisions of £3.63 million for group water schemes grants and £2.55 million for grants to local authorities in respect <Col N="570" /> of public water schemes which qualify for EC aid under the FEOGA Western Package.  The EC will pay a total of £7.3 million in aid to Ireland under this package for the provision of 12 major public schemes over the period 1981 to 1985. The availability of this aid has caused these schemes to be provided more quickly than would otherwise be the case and at a lower cost to the State and the local authorities concerned.  The increased level of capital investment in sanitary services is reflected in the increased provision for subsidy, which is up some £9 million on 1984.</P>
    <P>The fire service has made major advances in recent times due to the Government's commitment to its continuing development, the initiative and hard work of the local authorities and, of course, the dedication of the staff employed at all levels in the service.  The Government are fully aware of the importance of a modern and efficient fire service to the community and strongly support the valuable work being done to develop the service and to improve fire safety in general.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for 1985 is £10.24 million which is more than four times the 1981 provision and represents an increase of 36 per cent over the amount spent in 1984.  In addition, the provision for current expenditure in the Estimate is up 65 per cent on last year.  The increased capital available will permit work to continue in 1985 on 13 projects for the provision of new stations or improved facilities for the fire service.  It is also hoped that work will commence on up to 14 new construction projects.  The programme of investment in fire fighting appliances, communications, rescue and other equipment required for emergency use will continue.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for a grant of £305,000 to the Fire Services Council which will enable it to carry out a greatly expanded programme of activity this year.  In the short time since this council was set up, it has made excellent progress in the area of training in particular.  Last year, the council ran a programme of 15 <Col N="571" /> central training courses aimed at improving the effectiveness and specialised knowledge of fire service personnel.  This year, they have a programme of 20 courses.  These courses are additional to the ongoing training being carried out locally by individual fire authorities.</P>
    <P>The preparation of standards and guidelines on fire matters is also a function of the council.  I have asked it to give priority to the preparation of a code of practice for places of public assembly, which will be issued in conjunction with management regulations being prepared by my Department under section 37 of the Fire Services Act, 1981.  Work on the regulations and accompanying code is well advanced.  The regulations will deal with premises when they are occupied and will be compatible with the standards in the Building Regulations which apply to the construction phase of buildings. These will be the first in a series of management regulations and codes of practice covering different classes of premises.</P>
    <P>Increased emphasis continues to be placed on fire prevention.  A grant of £116,000 is being included in the Estimates for the Fire Prevention Council.  This amount is being matched by the Federation of Insurers, and it will enable the council to continue its very important work aimed at increasing awareness of fire dangers through publicity, advertising, and seminars and a National Fire Safety Week incorporating a major national conference.  This year the council is paying special attention to fire safety in hospitals, nursing homes, offices, places of public assembly, department stores, hotels, and schools.  Seminars for the elderly living in their own homes are also being held in association with the voluntary organisations ALONE and St. Vincent de Paul.  This invaluable work being carried out by the council is appreciated by me, and I should like to thank the Federation of Insurers for its continuing involvement and support.  I am sure that all Deputies will join me in paying a deserved tribute to the members of the fire service who at times have to <Col N="572" /> work in difficult and dangerous conditions to protect the public and property.</P>
    <P>With the recent terrible disasters in Mexico and India in mind, I think I should mention that my Department is actively engaged in assisting and advising local authorities in the review and development of their emergency plans.  Very soon I hope to issue to local authorities a model emergency plan on which they might base their own emergency plans, and also to furnish them with copies of a framework document, recently cleared by the Government, which will ensure co-ordination of the emergency plans of the various services involved in major emergencies.  Special attention is being given to the area of dangerous substances and particularly to assisting local authorities to have available information on dangerous substances which might be the cause of emergencies in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Environmental issues have gained increased importance in recent years as increased pressure has been brought to bear on our environmental resources. There is now a greater awareness of the importance of these resources to the quality of life and the well being of society.  The emphasis of Government policy in this area must be towards intergrating environmental considerations with economic and social programmes, so that the protection of the environment is recognised as complementary to economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the need for legislation, enforcement and the use of up-to-date technology, I believe that the successful implementation of environmental protection measures is dependent to a very large extent on the support and goodwill of the public.  While Government and local authorities have specific responsibilities, there is much that individuals and communities can do to maintain and improve the quality of their surroundings.  The litter and water pollution problems are examples of specific matters where the public can make an enormous contribution.  I am conscious of the efforts of many local communities to play their part and I would like to compliment the many local authorities <Col N="573" /> who responded positively to my request to them to promote local environment campaigns throughout their areas last year.  These campaigns have resulted in considerable co-operation between local authorities and communities generally in efforts to protect and enhance the environment.</P>
    <P>One of the specific aims of these campaigns was to increase public awareness of the importance of the environment.  I am pleased to say that I have been able to include a specific provision in the Vote this year, which will enable me shortly to launch a new environmental awareness programme, to foster at all levels of society a greater respect and a more caring attitude for our environmental resources.</P>
    <P>On the question of developing environment policy generally, I should like to inform the House that I recently received a report from An Foras Forbartha on the State of the Environment in Ireland.  The preparation of the report represented the first attempt to assemble up-to-date information about the condition of our environmental resources.  I hope to publish the report and have it examined in detail on an interdepartmental basis with a view to the development of future policies in relation to the environment.</P>
    <P>Water quality in Dublin Bay has become the subject of much discussion in recent times.  Following an initiative by my Department, I am pleased that the elected members of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation recently approved of a proposal that An Foras Forbartha be requested to undertake the necessary studies required for the preparation of a water quality management plan for the bay and the tidal section of the River Liffey.  The preparation of a water quality management plan at this stage will establish the facts and identify the direction for future policy in the control of trade and sewage discharges.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Dáil approved a motion which cleared the way for ratification by Ireland of the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, commonly know as the <Col N="574" /> Paris Convention.  At the 1984 annual meeting of the Paris Commission, the Irish Government's concern at the continuing high level of radioactive discharges from the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant was outlined by a representative of my Department.  Ireland supported a Nordic recommendation which requires States to take account of the best available technology at existing nuclear reprocessing plants and proposed new plants so as to minimise radioactive discharges into the marine environment. The commission recognised that the adoption of appropriate and effective measures to minimise discharges was a matter of urgency.  My Department will be keeping developments under review and will pursue the matter within the commission.</P>
    <P>In speaking a few moments ago about environmental matters generally, I referred to the increasing level of interest at international level in environmental problems.  This is particularly true in relation to air pollution which, because of its dramatic effects in a number of areas, is ranked in some countries as an issue which is more or less on a par with national defence and fundamental economic issues.  Happily, we in Ireland have been spared problems of the magnitude being experienced elsewhere but we do have our localised problems, especially in Dublin, and to a lesser extent in other major urban areas where the quality of the air from time to time is not of the high standard one would wish.  I can assure the House that I will continue to seek solutions to the difficulties which are arising. We must, however, face up to the fact that there are no easy solutions in this particular area.</P>
    <P>During the past year, there has been an unprecedented level of activity at international level in relation to air pollution matters.  Steps have been taken to give teeth to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Trans-Boundary Air Pollution and to develop the European Programme for the Monitoring and Evaluation of Air Pollution.  There was a major multilateral conference on air pollution matters in Munich in mid-year at <Col N="575" /> which the political determination of all the countries in the ECE region to combat air pollution was firmly expressed. On top of this, air pollution has been the dominant topic in the European Communities Environment Action Programme for the past year.  I should like to review briefly some of the major decisions at the level of the European Communities which will have direct implications for the quality of our air.</P>
    <P>In June 1984, the Council agreed a directive on the combating of air pollution from industrial plant.  This sets out procedures for the control of emissions from such plant and requires that there should be an authorisation and licensing system to prevent and reduce air emissions. There is provision for similar controls to be applied to existing plant on a phased basis.  This directive will come into operation in mid-1987 and the steps required for its implementation are in hands.</P>
    <P>The level of lead in the air, especially in urban areas, has been a matter of increasing concern in recent years.  For this reason I am particularly pleased that one of the achievements of the Irish presidency of the Council of Environment Ministers was that the Ministers reached a common position on a directive for the elimination of lead from petrol.  The agreed text provides that, from 1989, member states must ensure that unleaded petrol is marketed throughout their territory but it permits them to require the marketing of such petrol from as early as 1986.  We in Ireland fully supported these proposals and I am glad to be able to say that the Whitegate refinery will be able to produce petrol with a reduced lead content from 1986.</P>
    <P>I accept that air quality in Dublin, particularly in regard to smoke emissions, has deteriorated.  This can be attributed to rapid urbanisation together with a significant increase in the use of solid fuel for domestic heating.  There are also some localised pockets of severe air pollution caused by industry which is unsuitably located.  Comprehensive policies must be developed and action must be taken on <Col N="576" /> a number of fronts if these difficulties are to be alleviated.  We must, for example, redouble our efforts to devise policies and programmes which will encourage the greater use of natural gas instead of either oil or solid fuel, for commercial, industrial and domestic purposes.  We must also examine how we can encourage the use of smokeless fuels &mdash; in addition to natural gas &mdash; in urban areas generally. I intend that consideration of all of the various policy options should be speeded up over the next year so that we will be in a position to bring forward an overall policy and programme to deal with this difficult area.  In addition, I intend that the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation, which is in hands in my Department should be speeded up as much as possible with a view to having a Bill before the house during the current year.</P>
    <P>I am most anxious that there should be no avoidable delays in the planning appeals process, in view of the impact which such delays can have on construction costs and on job creation.  The upward trend in the number of undecided appeals during 1982 and the early part of 1983 gave rise to much concern but more recent trends are encouraging.  I am pleased to report that there was a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hands at the end of 1984.  The figure at 1,687 was the lowest since 1979.  I am hopeful that An Bord Pleanála will maintain this performance and will continue to reduce the time taken to dispose of appeals.</P>
    <P>New regulations are being brought into operation on 1 February 1985 to bring within the scope of the planning control system a wide range of agricultural development which up to now was exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  I think all will agree that a review of the exemptions enjoyed by agricultural development is timely in view of the increasing evidence of water pollution arising from this area.</P>
    <P>The regulations will reduce the size of exempted farm buildings for the housing of animals from 400 sq. metres to 300 sq. <Col N="577" /> metres and introduce an overall aggregation limit of 450 sq. metres on exempted buildings within the same farmyard complex. Similar requirements to those introduced for buildings will also be applied in relation to the provision of other farm structures and much tighter conditions will be introduced for exempted farm development.  Under separate regulations, also being brought into operation on 1 February 1985, the fees payable in respect of planning applications for agricultural development are being reduced in view of the extension of planning control to a much wider range of agricultural development.</P>
    <P>On the subject of postal voting, I wish to inform the House that, having regard to the views of the Joint Committee on Legislation on the matter, it is my intention to introduce legislation in the near future to provide for postal voting for the disabled and certain other categories at all elections and referenda.</P>
    <P>In my commentary on my Department's activities I think I have shown to any Deputy looking at matters objectively that we are tackling in a prudent and constructive way the twin tasks of evolving the right policies within the overall framework of the national plan and for finding the best way of implementing them.</P>
    <P>This is traditionally a vote on which a large number of Deputies wish to contribute, each with his or her own idea of which facets are most important.  I do not, therefore, wish to prolong my remarks unduly so that as many Deputies as possible who wish to contribute will be able to do so.  I will take careful note of the points made by Deputies and even if I do not get an opportunity to refer to all of them in the time that may be available to me at the end of the debate I want to assure Deputies that their views will be taken into account in the ongoing development of policy.</P>

    <P>This debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Environment is unusual in that it is taking place prior to the budget where the final decisions of the Government will be announced setting out the exact amounts to be made available for capital and non-capital services in 1985.  The abridged version of the Estimates for Public Services published before Christmas states that the final figures for the issues from the vote in 1984 will be established at a later date and will be incorporated in the full Estimates volume to be published after the 1985 budget.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of this debate we must assume that the Estimates for 1985 are those already published and in the areas where we feel the Government have failed to provide adequate finance to maintain services, in particular that of local authorities, we can only hope that the Government will respond to the urging of the Opposition in the House and the elected councillors throughout the country and that they will make up the shortfall in the budget statement next week.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent much of his time quoting figures which give the impression that all is well in his area of responsibility. However, such is not the case and I believe that 1985 will see a continuation of the downturn in construction activity with its awful tragedy of unemployment and the liquidation of construction companies. In examining Estimates for the Department of the Environment, it is important to remember that construction work undertaken in previous years has a continuing cost effect which must be provided for on an annual basis in the form of subsidy payments.  Increases in subsidy payments do not mean an increase in funds for new construction <Col N="580" /> projects, rather it is provision for additional repayments commitments arising out of construction projects in the previous and other years.  It is significant, therefore, that the 1985 Estimate for the Department of the Environment of £731 million includes £179 million for local authority housing subsidies which, as the Minister said in the published Estimates, is an increase of 18 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>It provides £31 million for other housing grants and subsidies which is an increase of 49 per cent on the provision for last year.  It provides £43 million for water supply and sewerage subsidies which is an increase of 21 per cent on the figure for last year.  The total under these three headings alone comes to £253 million. From this, it can be seen that one third of the Estimate is to pay for work already done and most of the overall percentage increases in the Estimates referred to by the Minister is to provide for these ongoing commitments.  This puts the Estimates, as presented, into proper perspective because it is largely to the other figures mentioned by the Minister that we must look to see if there will be any changes or any growth.</P>
    <P>There are two areas in particular with which I want to deal in the short time available to me.  Although I appreciate the Minister seeking to cover every aspect of his area of responsibility in his contribution, I intend to concentrate mainly on two areas and speakers after me will deal with some of the other areas for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>One of the areas to which I wish to refer is the construction industry for which the Minister for the Environment has a special responsibility in Cabinet. The other area is the need for reform of local authorities.  The depressed state of the construction industry has been debated in this House on two separate occasions under Private Members motions submitted by Fianna Fáil. During the course of those debates and in other statements Fianna Fáil have criticised Government policy in relation to the construction industry in general and <Col N="581" /> have set out positive proposals which would result in substantial increases in private investment in productive projects which would help to provide for the important infrastructural needs of the country on which future economic growth depends.</P>
    <P>One of the most depressing aspects of this Government's performance to date has been their refusal to recognise the important role of the building industry and its capacity to generate economic growth.  This Government have continually ignored the recent arguments for incentives to attract private investment into construction projects, and have even introduced measures which were a positive disincentive.  It is a positive well known fact that the financial institutions are in a position to influence the investment of many millions of pounds from the private sector into construction but are restrained from doing so because of the unfavourable tax regime and consequent poor return on investment.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that sufficient funds would flow into prospective projects if the Government created a favourable climate for such investment.  I am further convinced, as is my party, that a strong building sector could help lead this country and economy out of the present recession. The American economy is booming.  The European economies are growing again and are well on the way to recovery.  There is a danger that we will stay permanently in recession unless we fire the engine of growth in the near future.  President Reagan recognised the value of his country's construction industry and helped its growth, which helped to lead his country out of recession. When will this Government recognise the signs and change their policy of entrenchment?</P>
    <P>There are 225,000 people unemployed. The figure is rising every month, contradicting the frequent optimistic forecasts of the Taoiseach, who seems to have lost control.  This figure includes approximately 50,000 unemployed building workers, and it is my duty to continue to highlight the plight of these men and their <Col N="582" /> families in this House and the poor prospect of any improvement in this industry unless there is a major shift in current Government policies.</P>
    <P>In case there are still any doubts on the other side of the House that we exaggerate the crisis I will refer to an EC sponsored survey of the Irish construction industry which was carried out in September 1984.  It shows an accelerated rate of decline in construction activity, work in progress and employment among firms on the trend reported in a survey carried out in the previous June.  These surveys are carried out quarterly.  The decline is particularly marked in the civil engineering and non-residential sectors where 53 per cent and 49 per cent of firms respectively reported a decline in activity in September 1984.  These firms reported on their expected activity levels for the fourth quarter of 1984.  A sharp increase in pessimism is evident particularly among civil engineering firms, where 46 per cent expected a drop in business whereas only 20 per cent had forecast a drop in business during the survey carried out in the previous quarter.  Over 50 per cent of the non-residential and civil engineering firms reported a decline in work in progress and new contracts in hand during September, representing a disimprovement on the position reported in the previous September.</P>
    <P>The survey stated that with regard to employment levels there was a marked increase in the number of firms reporting a fall in their employment levels in the September survey.  Just under one third of the firms reported that their employment levels had fallen compared to over one quarter in June.  Firms continued to be pessimistic about employment prospects for the fourth quarter of 1984, particularly in the civil engineering and non-residential sectors where 48 per cent of firms anticipated a decline.  The survey noted that larger firms in all sectors were particularly pessimistic about employment levels.  One of these large firms recently went into liquidation, adding another 120 to the number unemployed in this industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> A similar survey on building starts carried out by the construction industry in September 1984 shows an even more alarming trend, as future building activity is determined largely by the amount of building design work which has to be prepared in advance.  If we want to look into the future and predict what will be happening in the construction industry we have only to look into architects' offices to see the number of projects they have been commissioned to design.  This survey examined the change in the volume of building starts, employment and general activity levels among architects during the third quarter of 1984 and detailed the trends within nine different subsectors covering work done for both the public and private sectors.  The result of this survey for the third quarter shows an increase in the number of firms reporting a decline in the level of building starts compared to the second quarter.  The volume of building starts during the third quarter represented a marked decline on practices' expectations.  Approximately 27 per cent of practices anticipated an increase in building starts during the third quarter.  However, only 8 per cent actually reported an improvement.  Comparing building starts in the third quarter this year with the same period last year, 57 per cent of practices reported a drop in starts compared to 8 per cent who reported an improvement.  Expressing their expectations for the fourth quarter of 1984, 29 per cent of practices remained optimistic about an increase in building starts but nevertheless the same proportion of practices anticipated a decline, with large practices more pessimistic than the average for the profession.  As a whole the underlying trend remains negative.</P>
    <P>The CIF survey stated that as regards the overall level of activity among practices, that is, work in progress on new commissions, over twice as many practices reported a decline, 46 per cent, as those who reported an improvement, 21 per cent.  On balance the survey concluded that the situation represented a significant decline on that reported in the <Col N="584" /> previous quarter.  Of the architects involved in the survey only 1 per cent reported that they had increased employment levels during the third quarter while 30 per cent reported a decline.</P>
    <P>Another depressing fact to emerge from this survey was that previous expectations of architects turned out to be over optimistic as on balance one practice in five reported that employment levels during the third quarter were below their expectations.  It is clear from the results of these two surveys that there is little optimism among those still employed in this industry that things will improve. Many of those interviewed in the course of the surveys have since become redundant. The Department of the Environment's projections are seen to have been optimistic, as it now seems that the output of the construction industry in 1984 will fall significantly lower than the official Departmental estimates predicted earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Cement sales were down over 6 per cent for the year as a whole after an 11 per cent slump in the last quarter of 1984. The CSO recently reported that the numbers unemployed in the industry at the end of 1984 were likely to reach 48,000. That is the official figure but we all know it is higher than that.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the construction industry is getting worse, and the prospects for 1985 have been partly determined by the Government's public capital programme, the construction element of which will fall by about 4 per cent.  The industry is set to face another year of decline in investment, company closures and job losses unless measures are introduced in the budget next week to stimulate private sector investment through tax incentives. The industry has continuously called on the Government for a radical change in policy.  Some of the changes they have suggested in a pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance would involve changes in company taxation, incentives to stimulate investment, tax incentives to promote inner city-town development and measures to deal with the black economy which is operating extensively in the construction industry.  I should like the <Col N="585" /> Minister to take special steps to ensure that companies awarded public contracts should be required to give a guarantee that none of those whom they employ or none of the material used will come from the black economy.  At present that is not the situation, and public contracts are being met by people operating out of the black economy.  The activities of North of Ireland contractors, tradesmen and suppliers in this area are having a serious effect on the viability of many Irish construction companies down here who cannot tender successfully against this level of unfair competition.</P>
    <P>Among the other proposals are certain changes in building society mortgages to reduce the deposit gap which the Minister knows has been, is and continues to be the main stumbling block for many couples who are anxious to purchase a home. If these changes were made it would help to accelerate construction and meet the housing needs of the nation.  Other proposals were to reduce the real costs to borrowers in the early years of their mortgage, to allow the Housing Finance Agency to raise sufficient funds to clear demand for loans, to have greater flexibility in the size of mortgages and the proportion of house prices the agency could finance.  We have had a stop go situation in the past year because of the inability of the agency to operate in the market as they have been severly circumscribed by managerial and Departmental controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister is familiar with these proposals, and I hope he can influence his colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, to introduce changes along these lines in next week's budget.  If action is not taken in the budget positively to stimulate private investment in construction, people will despair and the decline will accelerate.  Loss of confidence is already a major factor that is contributing to the present decline.</P>
    <P>I have stated my belief that the construction industry can help to lead this country out of the present depression if the right investment climate is created by the Government.  I make no apology for repeating this view until the Government <Col N="586" /> take action or until they go out of office. The thousands of building operatives and their families who have been associated for a lifetime with the building industry cannot understand how an Irish Government could fail to take steps to sustain this industry, which is one of the most important.  Worse than that, people are astonished that this Government should actually take steps to depress the industry.  It is no harm to remind the Minister of this because his own speech attempted to paint a rosy picture when in reality the picture is a depressing one. There is an obligation on the Government to come forward with proposals which will generate growth and create the right climate for investment in this important industry.  Instead of that, in 1983 and 1984 a long list of measures were introduced by the Government that have depressed the industry at a time when it was in recession and when it needed help.</P>
    <P>Among the measures were the following: a 25 per cent volume cut in the public capital programme; increased planning charges; increased VAT rates; the introduction of a residential property tax; increased PRSI costs for employers; suspension of the farm modernisation scheme in 1983; withdrawal of the industry from the employment incentive scheme; increased development levies; the abolition of the residence-related tax incentive scheme; the dilution of section 23 incentives from April 1984; reduction in the mortgage interest relief and the exclusion of the industry from the new risk venture capital incentive scheme. The list goes on and on.  To give hope to the building operatives and their families and to encourage people in the industry to persevere, I wish to reaffirm that Fianna Fáil are committed to an injection of £ 200 million in productive construction programmes immediately on return to office.  We will introduce a wide range of tax incentives to encourage private investment in construction.</P>
    <P>There are 33,000 approved applicants on local authority housing lists.  This number has increased by about 1,000 each year in the past six years.  The local <Col N="587" /> authority house building programme during that period resulted in an average of 6,000 units of accommodation being provided per annum.  During the same period the cost of financing the local authority house building programme has trebled from £62 million in 1980 to an estimated £179 million in 1985.  As mentioned in the public capital programme for 1985, the loan servicing of a new local authority house is now £85 to £90 per week or roughly £4,500 per annum. Therefore, there is a rapidly increasing interest rate and a rapidly increasing waiting list.  Alternative policies must be pursued vigorously if the housing needs of the people are ever to be met, because it is clear that the capacity of the Exchequer to fund annual housing subsidies in any greatly expanded local authority housing programme would not be sustainable.</P>
    <P>As was stated in previous debates and as was shown at the National Housing Conference in Galway another 5,000 homes could be provided at reasonable cost through the operation of joint venture housing schemes where the private builder and the local authority co-operate to build houses on local authority land for tenants or approved applicants, and also through the operation of the coownership schemes where the equity in the new dwelling would be shared between the local authority and the purchaser. He would have the option to increase his equity to 100 per cent when he could afford to do so.</P>
    <P>Details of these proposed schemes have been spelled out for the Minister but so far his response has been less than wholehearted.  The joint venture scheme at present in operation will not make a significant contribution until a decision is made to enable local authorities to provide sites at nominal cost.  Surely the once-off cost of a site is less of a burden on the Exchequer than the recurring annual subsidy charge of £4,500 per annum for every new house.</P>
    <P>The decision announced today by the Minister to extend the £1,000 site subsidy to the joint venture scheme is welcomed, <Col N="588" /> but it is not going far enough.  The average cost of such a site would be nearer to £4,000 than the £3,000 referred to by the Minister and there would still be the difference of £3,000.  It would have made a significant impact on house construction and employment in the industry if the Minister had gone the full way and agreed to give local authorities power to transfer land at nominal cost for the purpose of the joint venture scheme, with the Department taking up the once-off cost of the site rather than the recurring £4,500 subsidy which each new local authority house will cost on a continuing annual basis.</P>
    <P>The recent decision of the Minister to provide a grant of £5,000 to tenants who hand up a local authority house to purchase a private house is commendable. Certainly it is now very attractive for a local authority tenant to move to a private or to a second hand house when one considers that he will qualify for up to £9,000 if he purchases a new house and £8,000 if he purchases a second hand house.  I would prefer if the incentive to purchase a new rather than a second hand house were greater, but at least the move is a step in the right direction.  I ask the Minister, why not offer the same level of assistance to those who have no home of their own?  This facility is commendable and will have some effect, but if those who have no home were offered £9,000 assistance towards the purchase of a new home there would be a dramatic change in the number of homes being constructed and the local authority housing list would decline rapidly from its present 33,000 increasing by 1,000 every year.</P>
    <P>We are not keeping up with the demand and we face a major housing crisis in a few years time unless realistic, positive steps are taken by the Government to increase the number of houses being built.  Time and time again we have heard the Minister for Finance and this Minister for the Environment state that we cannot afford to put much more money into the construction of public housing.  I have spelled out the cost of public housing.  We realise that it is not practical to suggest that our housing <Col N="589" /> needs should be met by the public sector. We are calling for a major incentive to encourage private investment in the construction of houses.  Many people today if they had housing grants available to them at the same value as housing grants were ten or 15 years ago would undertake the task of providing homes for themselves. Because the grants have not kept pace with inflation and are now of very small significance, in the decisions that propsective house buyers must make for themselves in organising their finances, people are not influenced by the grant into building their own homes.  Consequently we see the continuing decline in the construction of private houses.  The continuous drop in the number of new private homes being constructed must be very worring for the Minister.  He made very little reference to it in his speech or in the Estimates he has published.  A major crisis is building up for this State within the whole housing area unless the Government adopt realistic policies.</P>
    <P>The house-building sector is a major part of the construction industry's output and any measure to increase housing output will have the social and economic benefit of housing our people and providing employment for thousands now out of work.  To show the value of encouraging the construction of privately built homes rather than dependence on local authority or State homes, I would like to put on the record that for every £1 which the State provides by way of support for housing 60p goes on local authority housing and 40p on private housing.  On the basis of the number of dwelling involved, however, the support is spread over four times the number of houses.  Therefore, the subsidy for local authority houses is 60 per cent or 60p compared with 10p for each of the four private houses.  Therefore, the State gets better value for its support from people owning their own homes.  That is another indication that our housing needs can be met without necessarily increasing Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the Regional Development Fund and the way in which the State are devoting such funds into <Col N="590" /> projects which I believe was not the original intention under which the Regional Fund was established.  When we applied to join the EC one of the main arguments made by the main parties who were supporting our entry was the advantages to be gained for the undeveloped areas of our country from the Regional Fund.  At the time a decision was made at Brussels determining that all of Ireland would be accepted as an undeveloped region, thus qualifying us for greater funds from the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and other funds.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing, when one represents a constitutency in a disadvantaged area in the west, to see the vast bulk of the Regional Fund support from Brussels to this country being spent in the eastern counties in Leinster.  In 1984 a figure of £23.916 million of the Regional Fund was expended in the Leinster region, in Munster £13.4 million, in the three counties of Ulster £2.1 million and in Connacht £6.1 million.  I pose the question whether the Regional Fund payments which are now made to the Exchequer and passed on to the local authorities by the Minister for the Environment should not be paid directly to the local authorities. The Minister for the Environment receives this money from the Regional Fund and it is not being passed to the local authorities directly from Brussels but is really being added to supplement the funds available to the Minister in deciding priorities in regard to the various schemes funded by his Department.  The impression is given that the Government are providing the capital when in fact they are only topping up what they are getting from Brussels.  I would like the Minister in his reply to indicate whether he will give consideration to allowing local authorities throughout the country to apply directly and to be paid directly, as the Commission in Brussels appear to want that.  I want to refer to a recent debate in the European Parliament when Deputy Barrett, MEP, raised this matter with Mr. Richard, the then Commissioner, who replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I am, indeed anxious that more local <Col N="591" /> authorities should have direct links with Brussels.  Very frequently one finds that local authorities know the problems in their area rather better than central Government does.  One finds that very frequently local authorities have their own schemes, their own ideas for dealing with those problems. Very frequently one finds &mdash; and it is extremely important when we have not got very much money in the Regional Fund or the Social Fund anyway &mdash; that the money we can put in is in general seed money and genuine fresh money and therefore, it means the difference between the project surviving or a project dying. </P>
    <P>That is clear encouragement from the Commissioner for local authorities to make their own separate application to Brussels for aid under the Regional Fund. We must recognise that, with the knowledge that local authorities have, surely they would be much better equipped to make a case and to establish their priority for assistance than the Department are, especially when one considers the cumbersome procedures we have adopted in this country.  The local authorities must submit whatever proposal they have to the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister for the Environment, having duly considered it, must pass it on to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, having duly considered it, then submits an application to Brussels.  It is clear from that procedure that the urgency and priority attached to each individual application is greatly diminished because of the lack of personal interest and involvement on the part of the Department of Finance in pursuing any individual project.  We have been losing out in our claims for aid from many of the EC regional and social schemes because of the method we are adopting. Other countries are going more directly than we are and, consequently, are getting better results.  Does the Minister feel that local authorities are incapable of formulating proposals and arguing their case in Brussels without guidance from his <Col N="592" /> Department and the Department of Finance? If he does, the local authorities will have a great deal to say.  I feel that the Minister is going to hear very much more about this whole area of our method of making application for EC aid in the future.</P>
    <P>I understand that the new Regional Fund regulations introduce the concept of integrated development programmes and will give them priority for assistance. I should like to hear what action the Department have taken to date to submit those programmes to Brussels.  There should be a new quota range available to Ireland as opposed to a fixed quota of funds.  Ireland's range is 5.64 per cent to 6.83 per cent as opposed to a fixed figure of 5.94 per cent.  We will have to fight to get the maximum available cash.  The present application procedure of local authorities, first to the Department of the Environment, then to the Department of Finance and then to Brussels, is slow and cumbersome.  Local authorities could present and argue local cases more intensely than would be the case of a central Department who are far removed from local needs and from the matters surrounding the application.  Local authorities should be commissioned to prepare local development programmes for early submission to Brussels.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on that matter. The Minister has made reference to local authority reform, which I agree is urgently required as the Irish local government system has not been substantially restructured since 1898 and few people can disagree that what might have been of relevance at the end of the last century now bears little relevance to the needs of our rapidly expanding population and extensive urbanisation.</P>
    <P>The real issue that needs to be tackled is to make local government in Ireland truly local.  The present system is local only in name and in its elected membership but its functions and financing are now so tightly controlled by central government that its responsiveness to local needs is stultified with the result that local communities are identifying less and less with their local authority.  At the <Col N="593" /> same time, the remoteness of local communities from central government in many of the matters that affect their daily lives leads to a build-up of frustration and discontent which can eventually have a de-stabilising effect on democracy.  It is well to remember that the only alternative to local government is centralism with its concentration of power, and over-concentration of power is always a danger in a free society.  It is well known that the range of functions carried out by Irish local authorities is the narrowest in Europe, in fact, a substantial part of the services currently provided by central government in Ireland are provided by local government in the other European countries.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that democracy is greatly strengthened where there is a system of government that recognises the value of local participation in the administration of the variety of affairs that impinge on people's lives, and I support the view that strong multi-purpose local authorities with directly elected membership present the most efficient, economic and democratic means of public service provision.</P>
    <P>The main issues in local government at present are the reform of structures, of functions and the method of financing them.  The structures are mostly those set up in 1898.  The system is over-centralised and there is a need for a transfer of some functions from central to local government and an increase in the sphere of influence of local bodies.</P>
    <P>The present method of financing local authorities is most unsatisfactory.  There is too great a dependence on annual arbitrary state grants.  The imposition of additional taxation in the form of local service charges was resented by the public when no corresponding reduction in central taxation was applied.  There is a need for an independent source of revenue for local authorities which would have full statutory support.</P>
    <P>The principle of local self-government should be recognised in constitutional law, and that Ireland should contribute in the Council of Europe to the adoption <Col N="594" /> of a European charter for local self-government to which we could subscribe. I should like the Minister to confirm the view I have heard &mdash; that Ireland is opposing such a change at the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The introduction of service charges and the financing of local government generally is an area of great public interest. I should set out briefly the Fianna Fáil position.  Rates on domestic dwellings and agricultural valuations were previously the main source of local authority finance.</P>
    <P>In 1978, Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill abolishing domestic rates.  That Bill provided that central government would recoup to each local authority the amount it would have received from householders if domestic rates had continued in operation.</P>
    <P>While in Government, Fianna Fáil did propose that local authorities be empowered to charge for some of their services to enable them to supplement their existing sources of income.  However, when the Coalition Government came into office in 1982, they introduced the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983, which removed the statutory obligation on central government to recoup the equivalent of the domestic rate to local authorities and it also contained a provision empowering county managers to levy charges for services.</P>
    <P>The action taken by the Government in utilising the powers contained in this Act have led to the present crisis in local government.  It stopped recouping to local authorities an amount equivalent to the revenue from domestic and agricultural rates and instructed county managers to levy charges for services to make up for what the Government had cut back in recoupment of domestic rates.</P>
    <P>The cut back in rate support grants has been very severe &mdash; 17 per cent in real terms in the past two years &mdash; and local authority attempts to replace this cut back with new service charges has failed so far, as no corresponding decrease has taken place in the level of central taxes <Col N="595" /> such as PAYE, PRSI or VAT to compensate for the transfer from central to local taxation.</P>
    <P>The Estimate before us today, for 1985, shows a further savage cut back in rate support grants to local authorities of about 8 per cent, which I will return to later.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil opposed the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No.2) Act 1983, but the Government majority in Dáil Éireann brought this law into force. Service charges are now the law of the land and Fianna Fáil cannot advocate illegal action such as non-payment, but we fully appreciate the frustration being caused.  The only legitimate action against service charges is to reject the Labour and Fine Gael Parties and their policies at the ballot box, and the first opportunity for a ballot box protest against these charges is the local elections promised in 1985.  I want to make it quite clear that Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to service charges as they are presently imposed.  We are not against local authorities raising their own revenues to a limited extent to supplement a statutory annual grant from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in government will repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 and introduce new legislation providing for a serious and comprehensive re-structuring of local government finances ensuring greater local autonomy.  Such a policy would give local authorities a statutory right to an appropriate share of central government revenue.  Each local authority would be free to decide their spending priorities.  This would give power to the local authorities to decide on the precise allocation of funds within each programme area.  In this way, many of the enormous constraints associated with the present system of grants for specific services could be overcome.  This would be further facilitated by the removal of the &ldquo;<i>Ultra Vires</i> Rule&rdquo; and give freedom to local authorities to exercise their developmental role as set out in the Planning and Development Acts.</P>
    <P>People have questioned what other <Col N="596" /> ways there are of financing local authorities without bringing back rates on houses.  As a means of ensuring greater local discretion in overall financial matters, I would suggest that consideration be given to the following:</P>
    <P>1.  That a percentage of the gross national product spent by local authorities be designed as its statutory share of Exchequer Revenue and disbursed to local authorities in the form of a block grant which would replace existing central government grants and thus avoid any overall increase in the burden of taxation;</P>
    <P>2.  That power to impose service charges be a reserved function of elected members only, instead of being a manager's executive function as at present;</P>
    <P>3.  I also believe that service charges should continue only to supplement the statutory share of annual revenue and not to replace it as at present;</P>
    <P>4.  Service charges would be reviewed annually and conditions applying to waiver schemes would be a reserved function of elected members;</P>
    <P>5.  That the main direct control retained by the centre over local authority finance should be the control of borrowing.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The second main area in need of reform is the functions of local authorities.  Fianna Fáil recognise that Irish local government operates on a uniquely narrow base of functions with a concentration of responsibility in remote central departments, and believe that a wide range of direct public services can be provided more efficiently and effectively through a strong local government system.</P>
    <P>The Government should arrange to transfer the administration of many schemes from central to local government. The administration of new housing grants, house improvement grants, amenity grants, road grants, environmental protection grants, recreational facilities and many other schemes could be undertaken by local government.  The <Col N="597" /> Government should give thought to granting a role to local government in other areas such as primary health care, local policing and possibly even primary education.  The Government should establish special representative committees to identify services and schemes that could be transferred to local administration. Reform in this area would represent a radical reappraisal of the way in which we govern ourselves.</P>
    <P>To enable local government to effectively and efficiently perform its expanded range of functions the present structures would need to be reformed.  The basic structures of local government are a product of the nineteenth century.  There is an urgent requirement to provide structures to cater for the extensive and dramatic changes which are talking place in society since the last substantive restructuring in 1898.  In the newly structured local government system county councils and county boroughs should remain as a major unit of local government with boundary adjustments to take account of urban growth.  A second tier could be based on towns with a population of over 1,000 plus the population in their natural rural hinterland.  In principle only one kind of public authority should be responsible for public services within a given population area and those services which could not in normal circumstances be provided by the town councils should be provided by the county authority.</P>
    <P>The proposed new structures recently announced by the Government for Dublin and the larger urban areas are in line with the general principles of reform that we advocate but are disappointing because they do not make provision for the smaller urban areas and the rural towns which have a vital role to play in local democracy.  Special new structures should be provided to enable the 200 towns who have over 1,000 of a population to elect their own democratic council to promote the welfare and development of their areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his recent statements spoke of giving more power to local communities to strengthen the local government system.  The Minister spoke of <Col N="598" /> giving greater financial autonomy to local authorities.  The Minister may speak of the need for these things but to date he has done nothing, in fact he has done the opposite.  All during 1983 we were promised local government reform.  On Christmas Eve in 1983 we were told that the local elections were being postponed to enable proposals to be brought forward to reform the structures, functions and financing of local authorities in time for the elections in the new situation to take place in June 1985.  This is January 1985 and no new functions or finance arrangements have been agreed.  All we have are some structural changes affecting Dublin and Galway and in a small way, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.  The major reforms that caused the delay to the local elections in 1984 have not materialised and may never materialise.  The structural changes will not be in operation for the June 1985 elections.  The elections last year should not have been postponed. It was a device to avoid an electoral contest by a Government who knew they were going out of favour.</P>
    <P>The main sources of revenue for local authorities since the abolition of domestic and agricultural rates is the rate support grant from the Department of the Environment.  In the past two years the Government have deliberately reduced this by 17 per cent in real terms &mdash; a really savage cutback which has had a dramatic effect on the operations of local authorities who have been rushed into severe curtailment of services and widespread redundancies.  This year's allocation represents a further cutback in real terms of 8 per cent.  Why did the Coalition cut the support grants to local authorities by 25 per cent since coming to office?  This question should be answered by the Minister.  Such a heavy cutback reflects this Government's complete disregard for local democracy.  The crude application of this Government's policy to force local authorities to raise their own revenue through a local services tax system has caused bitter resentment and frustration, firstly because it is an additional tax on an overtaxed community and secondly because it is asking people to pay for a <Col N="599" /> service for which they are already paying through the central taxation system.  If it is Government policy to transfer support grants from central to a local form of taxation then the Government should have made an equivalent deduction in central taxation.  Why did the Government decide to treat local government this year differently from central government when finalising the Estimates? Government Departments were allocated an average increase of 5 per cent over their 1984 funding figure but local authorities were only allocated a 1 per cent increase.  These cuts display a complete disregard for the role of local councillors and local democracy.  Does the Minister believe that the local authorities are living in a different world from Government Departments?  The expected inflation rate will possibly be 9 per cent and may even be 10 per cent when we take into consideration wage settlements in the public sector.  The local authorities have to try to maintain the services which they have traditionally provided with an ever reducing amount of money.  There has been no reduction in central taxation to encourage the people to accept the transfer from central to local taxation.  An additional tax has been added at local level and there is massive resistance to it in all areas.  In Dublin only a small proportion of the sum estimated as revenue under these service charges has been collected and it seems unlikely that it will ever be collected. The financial chaos into which the local authorities are being thrown will have far reaching repercussions on local democracy.  It is hypocrisy on the Minister's part to convey concern and to say that it is his intention to reform local government to strengthen it, to transfer power to the local authorities and to develop a strong local government system when in fact he is murdering the system by depriving it of funds and throwing at it a revenue earning scheme which cannot work, which will not bring in the funds needed to maintain the services and which is causing resentment.  I can do no better to support my case than to quote <Col N="600" /> what the Tánaiste said when introducing his Department's Estimate as Minister for the Environment in 1983 on 12 May at column 1116 volume 342 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>When one realises that those grants are spent on the day to day running of the essential services the local authorities provide, including fire and emergency services, water and sewerage services, roads, the wages and salaries of over 30,000 workers, together with the mounting cost of debt service arising from the expansion in capital programmes, it is not difficult to see that the amounts provided by the previous administration were a recipe for serious cutbacks in the essential services of local authorities and, with the cutbacks, the loss of employment. </P>
    <P>That is exactly what the Government Ministers Spring and Kavanagh are doing.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the volume number, I am sorry.  It was a quotation from the Minister's speech.  The Tánaiste, who was in this Department, knows very well what the effects of the cuts in the support grants would be.  He knows that it will result in serious cutbacks in essential services in local authorities and result in loss of employment. The facts bear this out.  Since the Government set their face on this course we have had terrible cutbacks in the services and mass redundancies in the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to postal voting. Could he indicate when we can expect to see legislation providing for this.  I must ask the Minister to make a positive statement on this matter.  One will see from the Official Report that on a number of <Col N="601" /> occasions commitments were made by the Minister to do something about extending postal voting.  The matter has been debated here on two separate occasions but we still have not seen any legislation. Some elections have already been held and people have been deprived of the right to vote in them because the postal vote was not available.  With local elections imminent in 1985, it is essential that this legislation be introduced immediately. The Minister can be assured that he will get full co-operation from our side provided that it is a comprehensive Bill which is proposing an efficient system of extending the postal vote.  A further delay in the matter is absolutely inexcusable. Postal voting is not new in this country. This is merely extending it to a wider range of citizens.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the money provided by the Minister for the provision of proper homes in halting places and good housing for the members of the travelling community.  The amount is completely inadequate and could be used up by Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation in implementing a quarter of their programme without leaving anything for proposed works to be carried out by the other local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a decision during the year which again weakens local government and disproved somewhat the statements which he and his Minister of State have been making recently &mdash; that they wish to extend greater power to local authorities.  They have weakened them in the decision by giving overall power in this matter again to the county managers. This is a trend that the present Government have introduced into the local government system, of taking decision-making in certain areas out of the hands of the local councillors and giving it to the managers.  We are opposed to that. In fact, we would advocate action in the other direction, of giving greater power and responsibility to the elected members, who will respond.  Local government will develop and provide a very worthwhile role in our democracy if <Col N="602" /> mature recognition is given to local councillors' ability and capacity.  The Government have been moving in the opposite direction, detrimental to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made no increase in the local improvement schemes.  It shows his disinterest or lack of knowledge of the situation in rural Ireland.  Many of the roads there are in a deplorable condition and people residing in areas where the roads are not the responsibility of the local authority cannot have them repaired under any scheme other than the local improvement scheme.  This Government have cut back on this this year in real terms.  That is a bad blow against rural dwellers.  It might be difficult for the Minister of State to appreciate what it is like living in a rural area, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Deputy live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister, who has a rural constituency, cannot be excused as easily as can Deputy O'Brien.  He should understand the problems of the rural dwellers.  That cutback in the local improvement scheme and the decision to impose the condition that at least a 10 per cent local contribution would have to be paid have diminished the benefit which was being derived from this scheme.  In this day and age there are, unfortunately, still people whose income is extremely low, many of whom are small farmers and many who reside in rural areas, depending on unemployment assistance. These do not have farms and have not the opportunity of employment that is more readily available in the urban areas. These people are living at subsistance level, from day to day, with deplorable access roads to their homes.  They are now without hope of improving them because of the 10 per cent contribution requirement.  Previously, if their valuations were under £5 they did not have to make any contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again I have brought up this matter here and cannot let this opportunity go by without again asking some of the Ministers to take action with <Col N="603" /> regard to that 10 per cent requirement.  It has proved to be a disaster in the western counties, in particular.  I do not think that anybody here really wants to condemn some families in rural Ireland to those conditions.  If people saw what we were talking about, they might have much more sympathy.  Otherwise, I shall have to await a change of Government.  Certainly, that requirement will be changed soon after the Government are changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to An Bord Pleanála. As the House knows, we had a very traumatic debate here following the Coalition Government's decision to fire the chairman and all the members of An Bord Pleanála who were in office at the time this Government came into power. They used a very underhand argument, giving the reason that the board were not being run effectively because there was a backlog of planning appeals awaiting decision.  The implication was that the board were inefficient, lazy, and not dealing with their task in a sufficiently expeditious manner and were responsible for these delays.  Despite our attempt here, that opinion was put across to the general public.</P>
    <P>I see that in these Estimates there is a large although not quantified, figure here, included under another heading, for compensation which had to be paid to the chairman and the former members who were in office at the time.  This is completely unnecessary expense.  These people were performing their duties conscientiously and were not responsible for any delays.  These delays really were caused by the lack of planning inspectors. It was only recently that the four new inspectors, about whom we heard so much, were actually appointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that things are great in An Bord Pleanála because the number of appeals have dropped.  He says nothing at all about the number of appeals coming in.  The reason for a drop in the number of appeals is that unfortunately we are in this continuing savage recession and there are no projects coming forward.  Also, with the new planning fees, people are not now making <Col N="604" /> application for planning permission unless they intend to go ahead immediately. The volume of such applications has dropped substantially as also has the number of appeals.  That is why there are fewer appeals on hands.</P>
    <P>I wish the new board well.  I had no complaints with the decisions made by the previous board.  It is good to have an independent body, separate from the local authority structure and from the Minister, making these decisions.  In many cases it is true of the old board and the new that they are prepared to take an independent approach and a realistic one.  I compliment the men who worked on the former board and those who are working on the new board for the quality of their work and the decisions made.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would say whether the staff seconded from his Department to An Bord Pleanála have now been transferred to An Bord Pleanála and are permanently employed as staff of An Bord Pleanála or remain civil servants from the Department of the Environment working in An Bord Pleanála on a seconded basis.  That dispute, to which the Minister, in the course of Question Time, gave little recognition to this side of the House, constituted one of the main reasons for the delay in dealing with the backlog of planning appeals. Some of those people resented the terms being offered them.  I am reliably informed that there was a form of work-to-rule applied whereby planning inspectors were prepared to deal with only so many cases per week &mdash; they were slowing down the system &mdash; and a backlog was building up.  The Minister came into the House and blamed An Bord Pleanála for it, whereas the board were disposing of the files coming before them within one week of their receipt.</P>
    <P>Old people always are of great concern to Members of this House.  Recent happenings to elderly people living in isolated rural areas, indeed even in cities &mdash; when they have been continuously attacked by thugs, robbers and blackguards &mdash; has caused great distress to the community and immense hardship to <Col N="605" /> those the subject of such attacks.  I asked the Minister recently if he would agree to introduce some special grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I recognise that many Deputies are anxious to speak.  I said at the outset I had no intention of covering all the areas for which this Department is responsible.  Other speakers coming after me from this side will cover other areas and I shall conclude quickly now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a special plea for <Col N="606" /> elderly people.  In this Estimate there is provision for £1 million for special housing aids for the elderly, a figure which has not been increased and which, to my mind, constitutes a miserly sum of money when one considers that it must be spread throughout all of the health board and local authority areas.  Whenever the Minister is afforded an opportunity &mdash; whether on next week's budget, in a Supplementary Estimate or at some time in the future &mdash; he might consider increasing substantially that grant for special housing aids for the elderly.  It is provided to help those residing in homes they have not the means to repair.  That category of elderly person is experiencing a particularly difficult problem.  This grant has proved very beneficial to those who have been lucky enough to have benefited from it.  In County Galway alone, one county only, there are 100 applications for assistance under this scheme but, because of the small allocation the relevant local authority received, they shall be able to undertake only about 40. Therefore the number of applications will rapidly increase while the number being looked after will not.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase that sum from £1 million to something much more substantial.</P>
    <P>I did ask the Minister recently if he would consider introducing a special grant which would enable elderly parents who may be residing in isolated rural areas to erect some kind of granny flat or extension to the home of a member of their family so that they might live in close proximity, where they wish to do so.  I have no idea of the number of such people.  But we are aware from newspaper reports that many of them have been attacked in recent times.  Some circumstances have resulted in an elderly parent or parents being left in the old home, their families residing elsewhere, and being unable to take them in because of the size of their own families.  If such elderly parents could build a small house beside that of a member of their family, with the aid of special assistance, it would alleviate the problem for many.</P>
    <P>In his remarks the Minister quoted <Col N="607" /> many figures seeking to demonstrate that progress was being made.  I might remind the Minister that statistics often hide individual faces of despair and we do not need statistics to demonstrate the problem obtaining; we have seen their faces. We know better than most the profound unfairness of poverty amidst the wealth and new technology.  So many families live in overcrowded housing, so many families cannot afford the medium-priced home.  Let us understand the debt we owe those who built this country for us and begin to make good on it.  Old age should not be a time of isolation, silence, inactivity. We have the resources to ensure that the heritage of old age is one of dignity and not despair.  We have the resources and, I believe, the capacity.  Let us demonstrate that we also have the wisdom. How we meet the challenges facing the nation's elderly will determine the quality of life and social justice for all in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks this morning the Minister dealt with new local government proposals.  As a member of a local authority I welcome those proposals. When legislation comes before this House I shall speak on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities make an important and indispensable contribution to national life in many areas of their traditional responsibilities, in areas such as housing, roads development, provision of services as well as in a variety of other areas such as planning and environmental protection.  In order to carry out these programmes they must rely heavily on financial support from central government which is the principal purpose of the vote which we are discussing today. Many of the functions of the local authority are taken for granted.  Indeed local authorities come in for their fair share of public criticism.  Not all of this criticism may be groundless.  It is only right that we acknowledge the contribution that local authorities make to the delivery of services which are necessary supports for everyday living or which constitute essential infrastructure for development.  But <Col N="608" /> the importance of local authority work relates not only to the provision of housing and other services but also to the benefits derived in all parts of the country from their expenditure and from the employment they provide.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that the maintenance of services and employment in the current economic difficulties present great problems. As a member of Dublin Corporation, I am only too conscious of the serious financial problems which face that major local authority.  In the next few weeks we will be preparing our estimates for the coming year.  I understand the capital allocation from the Department of the Environment is only .7 per cent of an increase on last year's allocation.  The amount of the increase is of great concern to public representatives and management alike.  A substantial increase in the commercial rate could somewhat alleviate the problem, but in the current economic situation any increase in the commercial rate which would cause further unemployment, would have to be strongly opposed.</P>
    <P>Councils now have an obligation to raise revenues locally.  I am often shocked by the irresponsibility of people who should know better, by some politicians, some ex-politicians, and others &mdash; who see themselves as politicians at some time in the future &mdash; encouraging people not to make their just contribution.  I was glad to hear Deputy Molloy say this morning that it has not been Fianna Fáil policy to encourage people to act illegally and not pay their fair contribution.  He should have a word with the members of the Fianna Fáil Party on Dublin City Council who continually exhort the public not to pay their water charges. However, in spite of that, I might inform Deputy Molloy that Dublin Corporation have succeeded in collecting 65 per cent of those charges.  Those people would be doing society a lot better service were they to stand up, speak to the people, telling them that if local authorities are expected to provide services then they must contribute their fair share or do without them.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am of the belief that <Col N="609" /> the short-term measures to assist local authorities financially at present in operation are not satisfactory.  There must be devised a long-term financial base for local authorities.  I hope the Government will give serious consideration to this problem, because if the re-organisation of local government presently proposed is to be successful then it must be based on a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>The provision of local authority housing is one of the main functions of any local authority.  Dublin Corporation have a proud record with regard to house building and great credit is due to successive Governments in financing this programme.  Last year 1,717 houses were completed in Dublin city, including 231 inner city houses.  Since the inner city programme commenced in 1977, 1,804 houses have been completed in the inner city.  This achievement has received recognition, not just in Dublin but in capitals of other European countries as well.</P>
    <P>The principle behind local authority housing is that it should be available to people on lower incomes who, through no fault of their own, cannot provide housing for themselves.  With this in mind, Dublin Corporation recently set income guidelines for the purpose of allocating houses.  I welcome the Minister's comment about bringing in a new housing Bill.  It is now possible for most people who are interested in buying their houses, and who are in receipt of the average industrial wage, to do so through the Housing Finance Agency.  The Government must be congratulated on introducing a non-repayable grant of £5,000 for local authority tenants of three years standing, buying a private house and giving up a local authority dwelling suitable for letting to a housing applicant. Often the £5,000 grant goes as part of the deposit for a new house which the applicant up to now could not afford.  It is to the credit of the National Coalition Government that they have provided the means whereby the people on the average industrial wage can be given an opportunity to purchase their own dwellings.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it has to be recognised that, until now Dublin Corporation have <Col N="610" /> been solely responsible for all inner city housing.  Something must be done to attract private participation in the public housing programme.  This can be best achieved under the joint housing venture scheme where a local authority make land available to builders for the purpose of building houses for sale.  The Government in <i>Building on Reality</i> stated that joint venture housing will be further promoted. For the past number of years, Dublin Corporation have sold developed sites to builders, thereby enabling the construction of 5,000 houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is increasing the subsidy grant for the private venture housing scheme.  There is, of course, a limit to the amount of land which a local authority can make available for contractors, particularly because of the need to ensure that they have sufficient land at all times to enable them to carry out their housing programme.</P>
    <P>In the present economic situation it is most important to encourage joint venture within the public and private sector. I should like to see this principle extended further so that a system could be provided whereby tenders are invited from both the public and the private sector for the provision of all public services where appropriate.  There are a number of excellent examples of this approach, both at national and local level.  The private sector already provides waste disposal services to a small number of local authorities.  The private sector could also be given the opportunity to tender for building maintenance, engineering maintenance, cleansing, domestic services, catering, road maintenance and other services which could be sub-let.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the report of the National Planning Board supports the view that priority should be given to investment in road improvement projects identified in the 1979 plan and, accordingly, the Government in their programme <i>Building on Reality</i> have accepted the views of the National Planning Board.  The main aims of the road programme will now continue to be the provision of an adequate inter-suburban <Col N="611" /> system for major towns, ports and airports, the elimination of traffic hold-ups by the provision of by-passes for towns on national routes, and the reduction of urban congestion by providing new bridges, ring roads and relief roads.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided that the economic and social importance of an adequate road network justifies accelerated State investment and, accordingly, State expenditure on road improvements will be substantially increased over the coming years.  Public expenditure in this area should be subjected to vigorous cost-benefit analysis. Independent economists claim that new roads will give an immediate and significant economic return.  I understand that job creation in the road construction industry is high.  I also understand that there is very little import content in new road construction.  This distinguishes it from house building, which has a very high import content.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should be made to attract private sector participation in financing, design and the construction of roads.  One suggestion is that a National Road Agency should be established to own, develop and maintain the national primary routes.  The agency should be funded partly by the State and partly by private enterprise.  We should give serious consideration to this as a joint public-private enterprise under the proposed National Development Corporation. It is only in partnership with the private sector that the taxpayer will get value for money.  As a member of the Public Expenditure Committee, it has been very depressing for me to see the way public moneys have been spent in the past and the outrageous over-runs which have been allowed.  This would never happen if there was some private participation in those projects.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to deal with the problem of sea and air pollution.  Due to substantial grants from the Department of the Environment, the greater Dublin drainage scheme is now completed.  The new main pumping station and treatment works at Ringsend are operational and <Col N="612" /> the sludge vessel has been purchased and is in use.  As a result, the old Rathmines and Pembroke drainage scheme which has discharged untreated effluent into the harbour at Pigeon House since the latter part of the 19th century will be connected into the new treatment works.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the completion of the Dublin drainage scheme and the new pumping station and treatment works at Ringsend will have great beneficial results on the quality of water in Dublin Bay.  I am pleased to note that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy O'Brien, has authorised a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay.  It is now proposed that An Foras Forbartha be engaged to undertake the necessary studies required for the drafting of such a plan for Dublin Bay, that is, from the vicinity of the Bailey Lighthouse on the north to Dalkey Island on the south and the tidal section of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>In relation to air pollution, the situation is more distressing.  During the past year there has been an increase in the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide, particularly in the residential areas of Dublin city.  There were breaches of the EC limit values in five stations, at Dame St., Rathmines, Ballyfermot, Cornmarket and Cabra.  In a year when temperatures were not excessively low, it is disturbing to record a very substantial increase in pollution levels.  Most of the atmospheric smoke record of this year came from residential areas where there are many chimneys emitting smoke at the same time over a wide area at a low level.</P>
    <P>The most serious pollution episodes of recent years occurred during periods of cold weather where there was no wind and the normal uplift of hot air was curtailed. A low level of pollution was not diluted and dispersed but remained in the immediate area and was added to in the cold, calm conditions.  An excellent but very depressing example of this could be witnessed in the city of Dublin last Thursday afternoon.  The book &ldquo;Promise and Performance, Irish Environmental Policies Analysed&rdquo; has on its cover a picture taken by Michael Bailey at 2.30 <Col N="613" /> p.m. on the 13 January 1982 at Fitzwilliam St., Dublin, which graphically illustrates what I am saying.  If air pollution levels are to be reduced, the fact must be faced that it will involve a radical change in our methods of home heating.  In particular, the position of the open fire burning smokey bituminous coal must be abandoned.</P>
    <P>It is customary to price clean air in terms of the money needed for the replacement of obsolete equipment and the administrative costs involved.  However, it is erroneous to say that it costs nothing to do nothing.  The fact is that we are paying to have air pollution and its attendant disadvantages with unnecessary cleaning bills for clothes and buildings, avoidable medical and hospital expenses, less sunshine, damage to the environment and a worsening of the quality of life.  Savings accruing from a clear air programme must also be calculated and evaluated.</P>
    <P>The rich and poor, sick and healthy, young and old, all breathe the same air. It would make more sense and better economics to pay for the absence of air pollution and the benefits it would bring &mdash; clean air, more hours of sunshine, cleaner buildings, smaller cleaning bills, a healthier and aesthetically improved environment.</P>
    <P>It would be very undesirable if smoke levels were to continue to increase.  The legal powers available to Dublin Corporation for dealing with air pollution are contained in the Control of Atmospheric Pollution Regulations, 1970.  However, these regulations do not apply to private dwellings.  They now require to be updated and their scope enlarged to include such dwellings.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged by an answer the Minister for the Environment gave me to a written Dáil question on 15 December in which he stated that the work preparing new air pollution legislation, which will take account of national and EC requirements, is at present being undertaken by his Department.  Various options aimed at improving air quality <Col N="614" /> generally are being examined in conjunction with the preparation of the legislation, and among these is the possibility of designating specific areas as smokeless zones.  In view of what I have said I would sincerely ask the Minister to expedite the preparation of this new legislation in view of the health interests of our citizens. Though I have spoken generally about the air pollution problem as it affects Dublin, there is one area in my own constituency which has a different kind of pollution problem.  It is the operation of an open smelter at Price's Lane in Ranelagh. Aluminium Alloy Refiners in Price's Lane are smelting lead, stockpiling leaking sulphuric acid batteries and sorting and loading metal without any form of control.  In the opinion of Dublin Corporation this process, an open smelter, is primitive, environmentally harmful and must adversely affect the health of both workers and residents. Meanwhile, both An Bord Telecom and the ESB continue to supply the plant with scrap for burning.</P>
    <P>The activities of this smelter have increased the level of lead in the atmosphere and all residents in this residential area are seriously worried about the effects which the level of lead in the atmosphere will have on their health, not alone their own health but that of their children.  The Eastern Health Board have carried out blood tests on children in the area and the results have revealed that the level of lead in their blood is far in excess of the average level.  Dublin Corporation have brought the owners to court for breach of the Atmospheric Pollution Regulations of 1970.  They were fined £25.  If there is only one good reason for preparing new air pollution legislation, it is to deal with a problem like this, and I sincerely hope that the Department will act with the urgency which is required.</P>
    <P>At page 40 of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend that the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation, which is in hands in my Department, should be speeded up <Col N="615" /> as much as possible with a view to having a Bill before the House during the current year. </P>
    <P>That legislation will not be a day too soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that this side of the House has repeatedly shown great concern for matters related directly to the natural environment, which I have been entrusted to follow. We notice that the Government's national plan gives little or no consideration to matters of this kind.  In the last session we raised the serious problem caused by pollution of Dublin Bay and general air pollution in the city.</P>
      <P>The natural environment covers many areas, all within the framework of the Department of the Environment, and having had the opportunity to work in that Department as a junior Minister I can say that the situation is totally out of control.  It is all very fine to speak about new Acts and regulations and conditions. All these things provide information, but action is needed.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the 1982 Litter Act which I had a hand in introducing.  I will talk about nuclear pollution, particularly that caused by Sellafield, pollution of land, rural and urban, acid rain.  All the information on these matters has been made available to the Department but the necessary action has not followed.  I suggest that the Minister, instead of examining these matters, should treat this as a practical matter and establish an environmental protection body immediately. The Department could then establish what might be called an environmental educational bureau on the same lines as the Health Education Bureau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A poignant memory for me is the Litter Act of 1982 and the amount of work that went into it.  It was just pushed out by the Department &mdash; that is the way the Department work.  It was given to the local authorities to implement, end of story, no action.  There are many examples of that from the Department of the Environment, possibly occuring with the <Col N="616" /> best will in the world, and this makes the system of implementing legislation unworkable.  Unless there is a completely new approach this will continue.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has focused attention on the fact that too many areas have become the responsibility of this Department besides housing and grants.  That is so.  Reference has been made to air pollution in Dublin, on which I had a question on the Adjournment recently.  It is readily apparent to all that there is an urgent need to create a smoke free zone in the city.  In London they have all the expertise needed to do this and I strongly urge the Minister to send a team there.  In the period around 1953 so many elderly people were dying &mdash; even the flower sellers were disappearing and pet animals were dying &mdash; that they took action.  In Dublin there is as serious a problem, and as I have said the Minister should send a team of experts to London to glean information on how we can solve it.</P>
    <P>The high burning of bituminous coal has increased by 50 per cent the smoke levels and the sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide levels.  Open fireplaces are very inefficient.  In this cost-conscious energy-saving era the Minister should give incentives to people to burn fuel in a more efficient manner.  I understand that one gets 23 per cent energy efficiency from an open fire and almost 60 per cent from a closed in fire.  Why not give incentives to change to natural gas, not hand-outs. The Minister may tell me that this will cost the State an enormous amount of money.  It will not, because it means switching from one natural resource to another.  Incentives should be given to people to burn anthracite.  It is ironic that the anthracite mine in County Tipperary has been allowed to close at a time when we need so much smokeless fuel.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>At the Moneypoint power station, which will become effective in 1989, some energy burning will take place next year. From that plant there will be an emission of 70,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide.  In a European context the sulphur dioxide emission is 60 million tonnes.  According <Col N="617" /> to the Bulletin for the Cultural Foundation Environment in Europe a station in Germany was refused planning permission last year to erect a coal burning section without installing the necessary equipment to recover the sulphur from the plant.  We are creating a bad example by burning without a sulphur recovery plant.  We must consider the damage that will be done to forests and so on.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister approach the EC for direct granting for sulphur recovery equipment for the Moneypoint project.  I am aware that the cost of energy here is higher than in other European countries but when dealing with the environment we must have progress with protection.  There must be constant vigilance when industrialisation takes place. If we spoil the environment in any way the cost of repairing the damage is monumental compared to the cost of taking measures in the early stages.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of nuclear pollution and put on record my absolute abhorrence at the attempt by British Nuclear Fuels to assuage public opinion here.  Their large advertisements in our daily newspapers contain misleading information.  In my opinion they contravene the code of advertising ethics set out by advertising practitioners.  Their advertisements give the impression that all will be well by 1991.  They try to convey that impression by displaying a big box that reduces to a tiny cube in the right hand corner of the advertisement.  That is totally misleading.  It is like saying that they will not kill 100 people this year, that they will just kill ten.  British Nuclear Fuels are yielding under pressure from interests in Britain and from concerned people here.</P>
    <P>Nothing short of closing down that plant or storing the nuclear waste on dry land should satisfy us.  The replies I have received in response to questions about the flow of information from Britain on that plant are confusing.  The Minister, Deputy Spring, following his visit to London gave us the impression that the discharges would be zero from then on. That is nonsense; it will not happen.  The firm are thinking in terms of cutting down <Col N="618" /> to 1 per cent of a specific level in 1973. There is a vast vested interest in Sellafield. From an environmental view we should set up what I would call a &ldquo;Wind-scale watch&rdquo;, ignoring the decision of British Nuclear Fuels to change the name to Sellafield in an effort to add some air of respectability to their scandalous nuclear cesspit.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the prospect of accidents taking place in the Irish Sea and on 13 December I tabled a question about that to the Minister.  In the course of his reply the Minister said he was not aware of a reduction in levels taking place.  The Minister said to his knowledge no decision had been taken to cease discharging radioactive waste from Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  A statement was issued later to the effect that it was being done.  In reply to my question relating to the transportation of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea I was told that the Irish Government are not informed of such shipments.  The Irish Government should demand to be told about the shipments of this deadly waste through the Irish Sea.  As many as 18 ships carrying deadly waste to the Sellafield plant travel through the Irish Sea each year.  I understand they carry between 20 and 30 flasks of deadly waste that could contaminate our sea.</P>
    <P>The British Government are contravening all known regulations at that plant and our Government are not doing enough about that.  The Government should take the British to the European Court and not allow the nation be duped by the misleading advertisements that are appearing in our newspapers.  That is a sinister operation.  They are trying to tell us that all is well when we know that this money making industry is reprocessing the waste of Japan and Scandinavian countries.  We should not tolerate the transport of that waste through the Irish Sea.  It is outrageous that action is not taken on it.  The Government should demand an assurance from Britain that they are prepared to close down the plant or dry storage the nuclear waste.  There should be a demand to recover the plutonium that lies on the sea bed.  It will <Col N="619" /> not taken an earthquake to move that plutonium which is capable of destruction equivalent to the explosion of 20 atom bombs.  That is lying off the Cumbrian coast.</P>
    <P>With regard to marine environment I should like to refer to an Adjournment debate on pollution in Dublin Bay.  At that time the Minister of State expressed an interest in the matter and told the House he was a year round swimmer.</P>

      <P>When one does some homework on such matters one discovers startling facts.  In 1953 the sewage pipe off Bullock Harbour burst and this has caused a major problem to this day.  In Howth they cannot cope with the problem. Six weeks after the Adjournment debate the Minister said he was taking action on that problem.  The difficulty arises when we get replies in this House that &ldquo;We are coming within EC levels and all is well.  There is nothing to worry about&rdquo;.  That is causing the problem, because we know that is not the case. There is nothing to be ashamed of.  I have been told that Galway Bay will soon have the same problems as Dublin Bay.  The Minister's portfolio covers other bays as well as Dublin Bay and I ask the Minister to extend his studies into this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> Regretfully I am running out of time. There were other areas I intended to cover, principally lead pollution, which is a scandal.  I cannot see why there has not been action taken as a result of the prosecution taken against the smelting works in Ranelagh.  The Minister took a personal interest in this case but it does not appear to be possible to bring these perpetrators to justice.  That is not to say that the law is inadequate.  In my view the law is not being enforced, and this is what I find in many of my examinations of environmental issues.  The only way we can focus on issues relating to the natural environment is to have an overall protection agency within the Department. If this is done and it is then found that the agency cannot cope with the problem, perhaps another agency could be set up.  At present the system is not working.  There is no question about that in my mind, and that has to be admitted in this House.  The piecemeal approach no longer works.  There are very urgent issues to be faced.  Something has to be done about them, but it will take firm action rather than giving the &ldquo;I will produce another report&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will study this matter further&rdquo; type of reply.  That will no longer work.</P>
    <P>I notice, and I am sure the Minister does as well, the concern shown by young people about issues like nuclear pollution. The excellent book <i>Nuclear War File</i>, written in 1981, and which is out of date now, shows the horrendous effects of nuclear pollution.  Everything else fades into insignificance when we consider what can be done to our environment by radioactive pollution, yet it is happening on our doorstep.  Young people are very concerned about this and, if we feel frustrated because our system has ground to a halt and we can do nothing about it, we can make a new start for the sake of future generations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brady spoke about pollution, clean air and the environment.  I accept many of the points he made but I do not necessarily agree with what he said about Dublin Bay.  Dublin Bay is monitored and it is very seldom outside the pollution levels set down by the EC.  We have established a management study group to look at this question, because Dublin Bay is a natural resource which is under-utilised, and hopefully this study will come up with ideas which will encourage our citizens to make more use of this resource.  Many Dubliners who cannot afford to travel further afield use our bay, and it is very wrong for Deputy Brady to be scaremongering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I admit there is a problem of air pollution in Dublin city but this is mainly because people have reverted to solid fuel heating.  I have asked the Department to make proposals to solve this problem because there will be a cost to the State and to the individual <Col N="622" /> involved.  Before we talk about making smoke-free zones we must look at the costs involved and then make concrete decisions.  We should encourage the use of natural gas, natural fuels, district heating and so on.  If we looked at district heating in a more positive way, that could be one way to prevent air pollution.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of being a member of the EC is that the Community is more aware of the environment than it has been.  Last December some very good decisions were taken, particularly regarding lead in petrol.  From 1986 the levels of lead in petrol will be reduced here by 60 per cent; after 1989 new vehicles will only use lead free petrol and from 1991 all vehicles will use lead free petrol.  That is a very positive and important step.</P>
      <P>A high level committee was set up by the Council of Ministers to look at emissions from vehicles.  They were told to come to some positive conclusions and to make their report before March.  I believe that by the end of this century the problems of lead in petrol and emissions from vehicles will be solved.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>The question of high combustion plants such as large generating stations has been raised and Ireland are not the only country stalling in this regard.  This matter is under review and controls can be a major help in the area of air pollution.  As has been indicated, legislation will be put before the House later this year regarding a clean air Bill.  I want to assure the House that the Department and the Government are working towards a better and cleaner environment and we all have a role to play in this respect.  As Ireland held the Presidency of the EC last year many of our staff were working on the problem of air pollution in Europe generally but they will now be free to concentrate on the problems at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government reform is very important and I was happy to see that Deputy Molloy is looking at this area in a much broader context than he did in the White Paper which he presented in the early seventies.  I see local government reform as the start of decentralisation. Too many day-to-day activities are <Col N="623" /> operated by Central Government.  We have already published proposals regarding new arrangements for local authorities in the Dublin area and also throughout the country.  However, the thrust of any local government reform will be in the powers we hand down.  We are serious in regard to local government reform, and, if we were starting from scratch, the existing structures and approach would not be relevant at present.  Deputy Molloy said we had not announced our proposals on devolution but I assure him that they will be laid before the House prior to the local elections and that will give people an opportunity to form a balanced view and to decide on them.</P>
    <P>The centralisation of housing grants and group water schemes depends on bylaws and local authorities are very much restricted by the principle of <i>ultra vires.</i> These shackles must be removed from local authorities so that they may become development agencies within themselves. In most areas, local authorities are built around the county and there is a great pride in their achievements which must be stimulated.  In his White Paper, Deputy Molloy proposed to abolish many smaller local authorities but I am glad he has changed his mind in that regard because we are going to set up new structures.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council is basically being retained much as it is at present but we will have six new district council areas which will bring the process of local government closer to the people.  In the county they will be divided into two, giving areas of high population their own identity and sense of local government.</P>
    <P>Elected representatives should have a role to play in education.  In the area of social welfare, local authorities could act as agents for central government offices.  With computers and modern technology, there is no reason why somebody with a problem should not be able to go into an office and find out in a matter of seconds why they are not getting the service to which they are entitled.  Local services should be administered by local <Col N="624" /> authorities and central government and Government Departments should be policy makers and overseers.  With the best will in the world, if you are tied up with mundane, day-to-day operations, it is not easy to look at problems in a much broader context.  Of course this will take time but, when it is in a legal framework, we can then progress and develop our services.  Local government must respond to the needs of the community and, by removing their shackles, it will give them a new impetus which will also be good for democracy.  Since the abolition of rates, county concils and local government have become rather meaningless for many hard working public representatives.  We must confer a greater sense of responsibility on county councils.  That is why I want to assure the House that there will be no pulling back or wavering on the question of devolution.</P>
    <P>I suggested that the Government should set up a task force to look at this and to report back to the Government as soon as possible so that we will have a programme on which to act after the elections in June.</P>
    <P>With regard to the building industry, one would be rather naive if he did not accept that the Government had taken the problems of this industry on board.  For the first time the industry know exactly what the public capital programme is for the next three years and the direction in which it is moving.  That is contained in <i>Building on Reality.</i>  The weakness in the industry is not in the public sector but in the private sector.  The programme outlined in the national plan will prime the pumps.  Take the road programme as an example.  This year £101 million has been allocated and that amount will be increased over the three year period to £155 million.  That is an astronomical increase and is a clear indication that the Government see that there is a role for them to play in generating building activity and employment.</P>
    <P>We are encouraging private enterprise to play their role.  The toll bridge in</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> Ringsend and the proposals for the western  by-pass in the Lucan area are examples of how private sector expertise and money can help.  We welcome that.  The State and the private sector can work hand in hand to help the building industry.</P>
    <P>As regards local authority housing, this Government's record is second to none. This year 7,000 houses will be built.  If people wish to leave a local authority house and purchase their own home they will get £5,000 grant plus a mortgage subsidy of £3,000 plus £1,000, giving a grand total of £9,000.  That kind of incentive will generate activity in the building industry.</P>
    <P>We have been encouraging local authorities to become involved in the joint venture scheme but this is not a panacea for all the ills.  There is an additional  site subsidy of £1,000 for joint ventures.   All these schemes will help generate activity in the industry.  The economy has been depressed and no area of development has escaped.  Our programme and the money which will be allocated in the Estimate will help stimulate the industry this year, next year and in 1987 as we anticipate in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  I will confine my contribution to the construction  industry, the sanitary services, including group water schemes, the need <Col N="626" /> to avail of certain employment opportunities  in local authorities, the poor performance  of the Planning Appeals Board, cut backs in the rate support grants, the need to reform house improvement grants, the problem of travelling people, the need for regional policies to ensure that less favoured areas get maximum benefits from the EC Regional Fund and the bad condition of county roads.</P>
      <P>As regards the construction industry, it is quite obvious that this industry requires a substantial capital injection having regard to the very high employment content  in the industry and in the provision of materials for the industry.  It is necessary  to provide more money for infrastructure  which would encourage building.  There is no doubt that the industry can provide the type of employment  which is necessary to get our people back to work.  It is a pity to see so many craftsmen and skilled personnel emigrating.   I am sorry to see that the Government  have provided for only a 9½ per cent increase from 1984 to 1987 for the building industry.  This is disgracefully low and requires to be stepped up.</P>
      <P>As regards sanitary services, I said the Government should spend more money on infrastructure in the immediate future.  There seems to be a slow down in the provision of money for group water supply schemes in south Kerry.  I do not recall any group water scheme commencing in south Kerry in 1984.  There are approximately six schemes at an advanced stage, some waiting to be approved by the Department.  It is difficult to understand why these schemes are held up.  I will give the Minister details of these schemes and I will be looking for a satisfactory explanation as to the cause of the delay in getting these schemes started.  It is hard to understand why no group water scheme commenced in south Kerry in 1984.  I wish to impress on the Minister of State the importance of giving priority to south Kerry for group water schemes this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities provide employment for approximately 35,000 people.  More people could be employed as apprentices <Col N="627" /> by local authorities in certain areas with the aid of the European Social Fund grant.  That grant should be applied to local authorities.  Arrangements should be made for them to operate this fund. That would enable them to take on apprentices in machinery yards controlled by county councils, as mechanics, electricians and draftsmen.  The Government should encourage local authorities to become involved in such activity and they could get 100 per cent grants from the EC Social Fund.</P>
    <P>The Planning Appeals Board is a disaster in many ways.  The delays are disastrous  for the construction industry and for employment in general.  Sometimes there can be a delay of from one to one and a half years and when this happens in the case of a large housing development  one can realise the frustration that is caused to the applicants for houses and to the people who are looking for employment in the industry.  There is also the fact that building costs are increasing all the time.  We must do everything possible  to eliminate unnecessary delays. The Minister for the Environment should be directed to give top priority to appeals where many jobs are involved.  Secondly, planning appeals in relation to housing should be dealt with quickly.  The Government and the Minister should put a time limit on An Board Pleanaéla to decide planning appeals, particularly in relation to individual houses, extensions and other minor developments I can see the reason for an extended period in relation  to large scale developments but we cannot ignore the fact that there were 1,678 planning appeals undecided by the board at the end of 1984.  As elected public representatives we must be seriously concerned about the situation which is most undesirable.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many jobs have been lost in the context of these 1,678 undecided appeals.  This is a matter to which I shall refer on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the cutback in the rates support grants in recent years and a further cutback of 8 per cent this year will have serious adverse effects on the <Col N="628" /> operations of county councils.  It places them in an invidious position particularly this year.  As our party spokesman, Deputy Molloy, stated this morning, Fianna Faéil are opposed to the service charges as at present levied and collected. On return to office we are committed to repeal the measure that empowered managers to levy charges and that took away powers from the elected representatives.   If powers are taken from elected councillors and if they are given to the managers we are hitting at the basis and foundation of local democracy and that is very serious.  The levying of charges should be a reserved function.  I am sure that elected councillors from all parties would face up to their obligations in this regard.  It is difficult to blame them from shying away from the situation when it is no longer their responsibility in law.</P>
    <P>The house improvements grant scheme is operating in a fairly satisfactory manner but I am concerned that grants are not available for the replacement of doors and windows.  There should be a special grant for this because it is a cost that many people cannot afford eventhough  their doors and windows may be in a bad state of repair.  I am very concerned  about the ever-increasing rents for local authority houses and the lack of finance to repair council cottages and houses.  The Minister may say that these two are closely related but there are families  who cannot afford to pay high rents and who have rejected council houses because they cannot afford the rents. There are families whose homes are in urgent need of repair.  Something positive  should be done as a matter of urgency in relation to this problem.</P>
    <P>The problem of itinerants and travelling  people has to be resolved in many areas.  We have a serious problem in the Killarney area and there are a number of reasons for it.  One reason may be that the &ldquo;pickings&rdquo; may be regarded as good by outside families &mdash; by this I mean families from other counties who come to Killarney at the start of the summer season and who are inclined to stay.  They park their vans and mobile homes on the side of the main roads into Killarney and <Col N="629" /> this creates an unsightly scene, to say the least.  These people stay there, particularly  as the local urban council and the county council have a good record for rehousing itinerants.  This is evident from the pattern in Killarney.</P>
    <P>In addition, when the families of the travelling people who are rehoused eventually grow up they go back on the road and this aggravates the problem.  It cannot be solved easily.  The families from outside the county should be encouraged  to return to their native counties and to be resettled there.  Local councils must identify local families and this has been done in many cases.  I have no doubt they will accept responsibility for rehousing local families.  I am not in favour of halting sites because I think they do not work satisfactorily.  It is impossible to exercise control over them and they tend to become overcrowded and to create other environmental problems.  Once a halting site is established it is impossible to control the number of families who will use it and that is one of the greatest problems in the establishment of such sites.</P>
    <P>The Government must set out their regional policy and the sooner that is done the better.  The way in which grants from the Regional Fund have been paid to the Department of Finance and distributed  throughout the country is not proving satisfactory in less favoured areas. The greatest sum in respect of these Regional Fund grants finds its way into the eastern counties, the cities and the midlands and very little of this money goes into the west or the south-west. Regional policies should be formulated and the Regional Fund should be paid either on a regional basis or directly to county councils.  This was elaborated on by our party spokesman, Deputy Molloy, here this morning and I am convinced that he is on the right track.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the manner in which county roads are being financed particularly in regard to their maintenance  and upkeep apart altogether from their improvement.  We have national primary roads, national secondary roads and county roads as well as urban roads. <Col N="630" /> Substantial grants are available for vast improvement works being carried out to the national primary and secondary roads, but the county roads are completely the responsibility of the county councils.   These roads in many counties, particularly in County Kerry, are in a deplorable state of disrepair.  It is virtually  impossible for traffic to move over some of these roads, and the council have not got the money to carry out ordinary maintenance on these roads, never mind improvement.  As a once-off operation the Department of the Environment should allocate substantial grants to the county councils, particularly in the west and the south-west where the mileage of county roads is great and the roads are in a desperate condition, to enable the councils to do something even if it is merely filling the cavities in these roads. We have learned from experience over the past few years that the fine, dry summers have played havoc with roads built mainly on bogland.  Lorries carrying milk in bulk tanks, carrying manures and fertilisers,  sand and gravel, travel over these roads, and the roads just cannot carry this type of traffic any longer.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully and favourably  my proposal that a special grant be made available for the repair and improvement of county roads, particularly  in Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's very comprehensive coverage of all the expenditure proposals of the Department in the current year.  However, in view of the time spent already discussing the proper method whereby an Estimate in excess of £1,200 million should be debated, the document in front of us which sets out the precise areas in which this money would be spent would be more appropriate.  There has been wide ranging over the whole environmental area and I am not going to deviate from that. I am confined to time and I want to use my time as well as I can.  I have sat here all morning listening to the very interesting discussion that has taken place in perhaps one of the most important departmental areas, one of which most <Col N="631" /> Daéil representatives have a clear-cut knowledge.  They have a great feel for it because they were brought up under that system.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with an important aspect of the Minister's speech this morning on local government.  In the small contribution I was permitted to make to this environmental debate last year I said that it might not be possible to have local government elections in 1985 in view of what I regarded as the most essential aspect of local government reform, that is structural reform.  Already we have been in train with a boundary commission to rearrange the electoral areas.  That is an important first step.  Unfortunately, now we were told by the Minister and the Minister of State this morning in this House that we would be fighting the local elections in 1985 with a programme for local government structural reform about which the people will be given a wrong impression by the Opposition for vote-  catching purposes, and unless it is sold properly it may lead to a local government  reform system that would not be adequate, proper or in the best interests of the local community.  I hope that that situation does not arise.  I would prefer that we present local government reform, good, bad or indifferent, as a <i>fait accompli</i>  to the electorate and let it stand or fall on that.  Now we will be going with what may or may not be, and I am concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essential to the structural reform is the evolution of power.  In the General Council of County Councils of which I am a member a great deal of work, study and research has been put into local government in terms of financing and of handing back some of the powers from the central authority to the local area where they can be far better operated.  I know that the Department like to hold on to powers.  Once you have control of money, there you have real power and when you let it go back to the local authority  you lose that power.  There are many areas that I have not time to dwell on here, but at least a real commitment is given by the Minister and his Minister of <Col N="632" /> State to tackle this problem.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Financing is a more difficult area.  As a member of a local authority I have seen over the last ten years that the engineering  area and the housing area are stifled in promoting and researching programmes and laying out essential plans for their development.  They do not get sufficient finance, and often because of limited finance things are done in a piecemeal way.  If I heard the Minister correctly at a public function during the year, he stated that local authority members &mdash; this was mentioned in the House this morning by the Opposition spokesman &mdash; should have the power to raise local taxes.  Fianna Faéil are opposed to the present system.  It is difficult sometimes to get a clear indication as to what Fianna Faéil are in favour of or against in relation to local taxation.  They could not guage properly the electoral mood in 1977 and they decided, therefore to eliminate rates on houses.  By so doing they have left local authorities in a vacuum, a wilderness,  as far as financing is concerned. While the Exchequer might be the one to provide finance to local authorities and the legal framework was there for it to do so, it was not doing it.  Fianna Faéil did not do it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the announcement yesterday of a major investment project.  However, I agree that the agencies concerned should keep a record of joint venture-licensing arrangements and that is being done as a result of the White Paper.  I have given figures for 1984 but I cannot give any for earlier years because such records were not kept in previous years.  They will be kept from now on and as the Deputy suggests we will be closely monitoring progress in this area.  I agree, too, that this is an area where we should be <Col N="636" /> expanding greatly in order to enable Irish companies to do what up to now we have had to bring in foreign companies to do. It would be preferable to operate on a joint venture basis rather than to have a holding foreign-owned company coming in here.  That is the correct approach and I think the Deputy would be in complete agreement with me in that regard.</P>

      <P>It must be said first about all these that they involve a transfer of technology to Ireland.  Therefore, they are all areas in which there is required technology that is not available other than by means of joint ventures.  I have been asked for numbers in respect of these joint ventures but I have not been asked for details in respect of each venture  such as the areas in which they are working.  I have given such information as I have in regard to the overall numbers.</P>

Technology needs to be adopted just as much in industries in a low technology area as in those in the so-called high technology areas.  However,  I would prefer to have more information  on the 32 ventures that have been agreed during 1984 but I can tell the House that of these 29 were under the aegis of the IDA while three were under the aegies of SFADCo.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Sectoral Development Committee, representative of industry, trade unions and Government, were set up under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach in 1981.  The main objective of the committee  is to evaluate and report on how to overcome the current problems and achieve the optimum employment and output potential of our economic sectors.</P>
      <P>The evaluations which have been undertaken by the SDC to date cover a wide range of sectors namely the beef, electronics, construction, fishing, clothing  and textiles, mechanical engineering, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, dairy and plastic industries together with a number of cross-sectoral issues such as marketing, information technology, the cost environment for industry, the technological  environment for industry and linkages.  Reports have been published in respect of five evaluations including those relating to the clothing and textile and mechanical engineering sectors.</P>
      <P>I have also arranged that the Management  Committee on Industrial Policy will have regular reports on the performance of industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> the objectives laid out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  These reports will provide a useful framework for the comprehensive review of industrial development which will be carried out in the Autumn of 1986.  In addition, the Industrial Costs Monitoring Group will continue to monitor and assess the implications for industry of underlying changes in costs and prices, including those arising from changes in Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, I see no useful purpose in asking the National Economic and Social Council to undertake a study <Col N="639" /> of the impact of the recession on traditional  industries as such an assessment is part of the ongoing work programme of the committees and groups referred to above.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach told me in this House on Tuesday that unemployment in the manufacturing sector was now almost 22 per cent, which is a full 5 per cent above unemployment generally?  Is the Minister further aware that successive studies have pointed out that increasingly this unemployment  has taken place in the traditional  industries?  Will the Minister bring forward an overall report from that committee  as a matter of urgency considering the fact that while we welcome the advance of new industry and technology it is quite clear from the years 1973 to 1983 that the growth in new industries has been more than offset by losses in traditional industries and that we should now focus more assistance on the traditional  industries while we pursue high technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is correct in relation to the trend in job losses.  Until the publication of the White Paper on Industrial Policy we put greater emphasis than perhaps we should on the attraction of new foreign investment to the detriment of giving attention to existing  industry.  What the White Paper has done is to change this.  We have introduced  provisions for technology acquisition  grants which will allow existing industry to buy technology from abroad to help them reduce their costs.  We are introducing also this year new marketing grants, market entry schemes and market research schemes specifically to help native Irish industry which unlike foreign industry does not have a ready made marketing  structure to break into the export market because the market is not buoyant  enough or large enough to achieve the economies of scale that should be achieved by these industries if they are to survive.  We have also introduced measures in the tax code to encourage <Col N="640" /> venture capital in investment in manufacturing.   One of the problems that domestic  industry faces, and it is critical at the moment, is the burden of high interest rates.  To the extent that we can replace borrowed capital by equity or venture funds we will reduce dependence on borrowed  capital and hence vulnerability to interest rates.  I hope that the venture capital measures and the other measures to promote equity of investment in industry by employees and the NDC will help to improve the equity situation of native industry.  I agree with Deputy Brennan but since July last it is very much Government policy to do more for domestic  industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister an opportunity to correct my misinterpretation.   So far as domestic industry is concerned I am sure the Minister would agree that one of the big problems is the protection of existing firms.  Could the Minister tell me if an early warning system which was in operation under our Government whereby the Minister and his Department were notified as early as possible of firms which appeared to be getting into difficulties is still in operation?   Or is it the situation that the Minister  and his Government are not prepared to intervene in cases of firms getting into difficulties but that they are adopting a stand-off position?  I am asking that in all seriousness because that seems to many people to be the philosophy of the Government.  Will the Minister say whether this system is in operation as it can be a very valuable weapon in the protection of the existing domestic industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My previous response indicating the measures in technology <Col N="641" /> acquisition and marketing equity were all related to strengthening the domestic industry.  I was not talking about new projects.</P>
      <P>An early warning system is in operation.   We have a list of companies that are potentially in difficulties.  It is obviously a highly confidential list containing information  from all the agencies that would have contact with such companies, Fóir Teoranta, the ICC, the IDA, CTT and so on.  That list is examined and discussed every week by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, who is responsible for the private sector.  There have been many rescue operations mounted in good time by Fóir Teoranta, the ICC and the IDA before companies got into severe difficulty as a result of the operation of the early warning system.  Deputy Collins could give evidence of many cases where firms which could not be saved before they went out of business were restarted as a result of this work.  Unprecedented sums are now being spent by An Fóir Teoranta on the rescue and restructuring of existing companies.  I am glad to be able to set the Deputy's mind at rest on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the prognosis for many of the traditional  domestic industries is pretty gloomy at the moment and that in fact many of the job losses in the manufacturing  industry last year were attributed to this very sector? One of the critical areas has been that the basic essential costs such as, as the Minister says, energy, telecommunications and, in particular, interest rates are so high.  Would the Minister agree that it is futile to ask this sector to try to stay alive when the Government, with their own control, could make much lighter their essential <Col N="642" /> basic costs? Has the Minister anything in mind to relieve that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that older industry is the area in which there are the greatest problems.  I would also agree with him that the cost environment is a big difficulty for them. However, I would point out that inflation rates here are coming down and also our inflation rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> our trading partners  is also improving, which indicates that this cost problem is being gradually brought under control.  However, I do not think that we should under-estimate the extent to which the native industry can help itself by, for instance, better management, more attention to marketing,  controls of absenteeism and better quality controls.  On the two latter items, I have instructed the IDA to look for information, before giving grants to any company, on control and quality and absenteeism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation necessary  to give effect to the initiatives and new policy directions contained in the White Paper on Industrial Policy is being prepared in my Department.  This legislation  will contain provision for the payment  by IDA of technology acquisition grants not exceeding 50 per cent of the cost of acquiring new product or process technology.  The eligibility criteria for technology acquisition grants will be set out in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for the delay of some six months since the industrial policy document was prepared in bringing this legislation before the House? Also, how much has been provided  for these grants in 1985? Have the <Col N="643" /> IIRS staff as yet been assigned to any of the major IDA offices to assist in technology  transfer, as was promised in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not really been any undue delay with regard to the preparation of this legislation.  It was anticipated that legislation of this kind would not be introduced immediately after the White Paper.  It will be introduced  in the House, I would expect, around the month of June.  I cannot tell the Deputy exactly what the financial provisions of 1985 concern but, in practice,  what happens is that the IDA are given a block grant for all their activities and they make provision for individual grant schemes according to demand. Therefore, we do not have to set for them a particular sum of money separately for technology acquisition grants.</P>
      <P>The location of IIRS staff in overseas offices is proceeding.  I do not think that any are actually in posts at this time but they will be, I expect, during this year. The progress of all these measures is the responsibility of a management committee  on industrial policy which has been established under the chairmanship of my Department and on which all these agencies  are represented.  This body will shortly be meeting on a six weekly basis to make sure that we achieve these objectives  as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the thrust of the industrial White Paper is, to a very substantial extent, on the question of technology acquisition? That being so, would he not agree that it would be disappointing that a relatively simple and non-complex measure would have to take a year or thereabouts from date of publication of the White Paper before these arrangements  for grants for technology acquisition  could be actually made available to firms that would and could use them to great advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred if the legislation could have been ready <Col N="644" /> more quickly, but the legislation is not solely dealing with technology acquisition.   It is dealing with many other matters as well.  If we had taken the technology acquisition grant scheme on its own we could probably have brought that in by now.  We are including it in the overall legislation.  While this scheme is not in place, it is possible for firms acquiring technology abroad to be assisted by the IDA under existing schemes to some extent, but not in the manner that we would wish.  I agree with the Deputy that the acquisition of technology is a key part of the White Paper and I can assure him that it will be pressed forward with the maximum speed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just a little confused.   Would the Minister make it absolutely  clear to the House that the phrase &ldquo;acquisition of technology&rdquo; which he uses in the White Paper means the acquisition  of licences and patents by those who would develop new technology in the State, as opposed to a proposal to assist individual firms who would be the end users of new technology &mdash; for example,  in the acquisition of word processing  equipment and that type of thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not exclusively licences and patents.  As the White Paper outlines in paragraph 5.17, one of the things that may be aided will be technology  licensing and know-how agreements. But also grants may be paid towards acquiring skill and expertise abroad by being trained overseas and towards the cost of arranging joint ventures where that is the most suitable route of bringing the technology into the country.  It is not solely a question of patents and licences, although that will be an important part.</P>

This scheme has not really got off the ground.  Could he indicate what protection he proposes affording to the new technology when it comes here?  Is it that, in fact, the reason why this technology is not being freely made available is because of the proposed Copyright (Amendment) Bill which will remove the protection of design from some of this technology? This is causing quite a bit of a stir among the innovators of that technology within their home jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>May I avail of this opportunity to put a request to the Minister, that is that while many of us would wholeheartedly welcome this scheme, in drawing it up we should not be over hidebound by stipulations, regulations and so on.  I might suggest to the Minister that if he takes that approach he will prevent happening to this scheme what happened the venture capital scheme introduced by the Minister for Finance under the 1984 Finance Act which in effect has come to a halt.  I think the Minister himself will admit that that happened because of a whole rigmarole of clearances, certificates and regulations.  This scheme is urgently needed, I welcome it and I would ask the Minister to bring it in crisply and cleanly rather than allowing it become tied up with red tape.</P>

      <P>There will not be red tape of the kind the Deputy is afraid of in respect of this scheme.  However, <Col N="649" /> companies will have to have a development plan which will show that they will make good use of the aid.</P>
      <P>I omitted to give Deputy Taylor some information that is available in regard to an earlier question, that is to the effect that there is provision for £615,000 to be spent on that scheme in 1985.  Hopefully at least ten firms will participate this year, rising to 40 in the following year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if, in view of the fact that it is now one year since the establishment of the special task force to report on the unemployment problems of Cork caused by the closure of Ford and Dunlop, he will make a copy of the report available to the House; and if he will give details of the jobs created in the Cork region as a result of the setting-up of the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined to the House, in reply to a question from Deputy Pearse Wyse on 24 May 1984 why the Report of the Working Group on Employment in Cork, is not being published.</P>
      <P>The detailed Action Plan for Cork announced by me on 11 May 1984 had two main elements:</P>
      <P>(a) an immediate substantial capital injection for infrastructural work in the greater Cork area, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) long-term developmental measures designed to secure the future of <Col N="650" /> the greater Cork area as a prime location for industry. </P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give details of the jobs which have arisen from the infrastructural work as this involves a wide range of activities, responsibility for which is spread over a number of Departments.</P>
    <P>Foremost among the long-term development measures aimed at increasing industrial employment was the decision to declare Ringaskiddy a free port and to designate the estate for higher levels of IDA grant assistance.  Ringaskiddy was designated for higher grants with effect from 5 November 1984 and legislation on the establishment of the free port is currently being prepared by the Minister for Communications.  The IDA have utilised these incentives in an intensified marketing programme to bring the facilities of Ringaskiddy to the attention of potential industrialists, particularly in Europe and North America.  As a result discussions are taking place with a number of potential investors who have expressed interest in locating in the area. Already, Angus-Isochem have announced their decision to locate a pharmaceutical project at Ringaskiddy which is expected to employ 140 people after two years.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the development of small industry, the Togher, Hollyhill and Churchfield Industrial Estates were also designated with effect from 5 November 1984.  This was particularly aimed at encouraging local entrepreneurship and small industry projects.  In fact, during 1984, the Cork Small Industry Board approved grant assistance of £1.31 million to 60 projects with an estimated fixed asset investment of £2.39 million. Furthermore, the Enterprise Centre, currently under construction at North Mall, Cork will be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>Among the companies already located in Cork, there have been increases in employment in 1984 in Liebert Corporation, Western Digital, Iprodex Manufacturing and Mech.  Con. Ltd. totalling altogether 350 jobs.  Also during 1984, Bourns Electronics announced a major <Col N="651" /> expansion programme involving an additional 200 jobs over the next two years.</P>
    <P>In their future market promotional programme for Cork, the IDA will pay particular attention to the areas of opportunity highlighted in the action plan especially the food processing, electronics and service industry sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disappointing to note from what the Minister has stated that there are no jobs for the free port of Ringaskiddy.  We have seen what happened in the case of the ferry in recent days.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor has he said when the report of the working group will become available though it is a year now since it was established.  Dunlops and Fords are a long time gone and we have seen no replacement for them.  It is very obvious that the Minister and the Government are abandoning the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely wrong.  As I indicated, 350 jobs were created in expansions by industries in Cork.  I can give the details of the number of job gains in each one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a greatly increased number of site visits by foreign industrialists to Cork in the past 12 months over the previous 12 months. There were 107 first time site visits to Cork in the past 12 months as against 64 site visits in the previous 12 months which indicates a clear pickup in interest and activity as a result of the IDA's increased promotional programme.  There is also clear evidence that the number of new jobs created in manufacturing in Cork this year is greater than it was in the previous year.  I also have a lengthy report which I could go through on the various projects approved under the task force <Col N="652" /> programme for road building and bridge building in the Cork area.  All of these have gone ahead on schedule practically without exception with much improved facilities in infrastructure in the Cork area as a result.  If I went down through that list, which time does not permit, the Deputy would see how much has been done in infrastructure and industry since the task force report was considered by the Government and their decision announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be a source of great disappointment to everyone in the Cork area considering the high powered task force appointed by the Government last year.  The question relates to making available a copy of the report so that people can see precisely what is intended. The Minister refuses to indicate whether he will make it available.  Much of the Minister's reply concerns long term development and new jobs created by the extension of existing industries.  They were on stream anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few new industries.  The Minister has not given us a clear indication of the number of jobs these new industries are putting on the ground or will provide in the coming year. In the IDA report at the end of December it was stated that there were in excess of 100 new opportunities in industrial development, many of them green field developments, available and committed to.  Will he indicate now when he proposes to isolate some of those committed new start ups as mentioned by the IDA in the report on the Cork region?  I can take no consolation from the Minister's action so far as a result of the task force operation in Cork.  What action can I hope for from the task force which the Minister has appointed to the Castlebar area to relieve the Travenol problem? The Minister has a super task force in Cork.  He has given me another action force in Castlebar.  If I get something similar to what Cork has got from their <Col N="653" /> task force, I cannot be too hopeful for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

There has been a substantial increase in industrial activity, with 140 jobs created in one new project, 200 jobs in another major expansion, and 350 jobs in a variety of other expansions in other industries.</P>

They were long-established industries.  The people of Cork are entitled to their share of industry from this administration.

      <P>The Management Committee on Industrial Policy was established and held its inaurgural meeting on 2 August 1984.  It has met once since and another meeting is planned for 25 February.  The committee, which is under the chairmanship of my Department, is comprised of the chief executives of the industrial development agencies and a senior representative of the Department of Finance.  The agencies represented are the IDA, CTT, IIRS, SFADCo, AnCO, NBST, Fóir Teoranta, IGC, ICC and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The topics discussed by the committee to date include the following: Co-ordinated Company Development Approach; Product Development; One Stop Shops; National Linkage Programme; Selectively in State Aid to Industry; Quality Control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my recent statement <Col N="656" /> on action on White Paper Policies, progress can be reported in the following areas:</P>
    <P>One-Stop Shops which will provide under one roof convenient and comprehensive information on industrial aids available from all the State agencies will be in operation from April 1 this year in all regional centres;</P>
    <P>National Linkage Programme &mdash; 40-50 companies are to be selected this year and helped gear themselves for linkage contracts;</P>
    <P>Company Development &mdash; Development programmes for 50 Irish companies which are now being selected by the State agencies will get under way this year. </P>

I understood that the CEOs had a day by day arrangement about co-ordinating their activities.  Is there a suggestion in the setting up of this committee that heretofore these agencies have not acted as a unit in Irish interests, that the CEOs were not getting together in the absence of a highpowered committee?

      <P>The Government's policy is not to interfere with the activities of individual firms in Ireland who engage in either import or export business generally with South Africa.  However, no assistance is given by Coras Tráchtála, which is charged with the development of exports, to traders doing business with that country.</P>
      <P>The Government strictly observe a United Nations Security Council resolution which forbids the export of arms and ammunition to South Africa.  The Deputy is aware that information on both import and export trade is available, on a country by country basis, from the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply suggests that Government policy is not favourably disposed towards trade with South Africa, but I fail to understand what Government policy is towards firms trading with South Africa. Therefore, would the Minister be disposed to intercede with Dunne's Stores in Henry Street where some staff have been on strike for more than six months because they refuse to handle South African goods?</P>

      <P>I am aware of that, but is the Minister aware that a number of Dublin stores, including Clery's, Best's and Roches Stores, withdrew South African goods from sale when the matter was brought to their attention?  In furtherance of Government policy would the Minister be prepared to request Dunne's Stores to do likewise? It would do something practical about Government policy.</P>

Obviously the Government do not interfere with the activities of individual firms.  The Government are strictly observing international obligations in regard to trade with South Africa.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the extent of tariff reductions scheduled for implementation in 1985 under the multilateral trade negotiations; and how far these reductions are likely to impact on domestic traditional industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal tariff reductions for 1985 are those which form one of the eight equal sets of reductions scheduled under the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations for the period 1980 to 1987.</P>
      <P>EC and other OECD Ministers decided in May 1984 that, in an effort to assist world economic recovery, they would accelerate, i.e., roll back, the 1976 Tokyo Round cuts to 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it became clear that some of its major trading partners would not make the 1986 cuts in January 1985, the EC decided to restrict its tariff cuts to those which would best assist least developed countries.  Accordingly, Ireland, in common with other members of the EC, has brought forward from January 1986 to 1 January 1985 reductions in respect <Col N="660" /> of certain tariff headings of particular interest to the least developed countries. It is proposed to make the remaining 1986 cuts later in 1985 when other major trading countries have done likewise.</P>
    <P>The tariff reductions scheduled for 1985 will have a minimal impact on domestic traditional industries because, during the Tokoyo Round negotiations, derogations from the general run of tariff reductions were achieved on behalf of those industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the time has come to renegotiate these tariffs?  It horrified me to learn from the Minister's reply about the tariff cuts in 1986, some of which are being brought forward to 1985.  Would the Minister and the Government not ask the EC to renegotiate and try to slow down the reduction of those tariffs rather than accelerate them, in view of the devastation of our domestic industries &mdash; the clothing, printing and food industries &mdash; and the dumping of products on the Irish market?  Is there not a case for asking the EC to slow down the tariff cuts within the Community rather than accelerate them?  If we do not get co-operation from the EC on that, should we not spell out to them in stronger language that our traditional industries are being devastated by the cutting away of the tariff barriers? Will the Minister seek the renegotiation of those tariffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a statement outlining my view of world trade matters on the occasion of a visit I made in November too GATT in Geneva.  On that occasion I said that we must fight a developing tendency for Governments to take action to protect their home markets from imports.  I said that this was essential to the development of world trade at a time when we are struggling to shake off the effects of world recession and that it was of critical importance for small open economies like Ireland which are dependent on maintaining outlets for their exports.  I pointed out that world trade was at a crossroads and that unstable currencies, bilateral trade deals, barter <Col N="661" /> trade and the inability of Governments to resist demands from local industries for protection threatened the world recovery from the effects of the 1979 oil shock.  I said that if this recovery did not continue there would be little hope of overcoming the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that it must be the Government's endeavour to increase efforts to have freer trade in the world because the tendency towards protectionism and barter and State deals are most likely to prevent world economic recovery reaching its full potential.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1985. - Vote 29: Environment (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £731,140,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu of rates on agricultural land and other grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.) </P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the points made by the Opposition spokesman in regard to local government reform.  I agree with his suggestion that there should be a statutory right to the share of revenue coming to local authorities. A reform of the housing grant supervision system is long overdue because there is a lot of duplication.  Inspectors travel from Dublin to inspect houses although local planning inspectors carry out inspections on the same dwelling. That is a waste of resources.  With regard to the land-related income tax proposed in the national plan, it appears from the Minister's statement this morning that the revenue from that will go to local authorities.  I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have said they propose <Col N="687" /> introducing a Bill to deal with local authority financing and will give extra powers to members of such bodies.  We would welcome such a move but, unfortunately, in the past a lot of local authority members funked their responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>Because of the amount of time allocated for the debate I will not be able to deal with many aspects of the work of the Department of the Environment.  The figure of 25,000 house completions in 1984 is satisfactory.  The record of Coalition Governments on the provision of houses and their commitment to housing has been excellent.  It is no different with the Government.  In the current year a further 7,000 local authority houses will be provided.  Coalition Governments have also introduced many innovative housing schemes.  The 1973-77 Government introduced the low rise mortgage scheme but Fianna Fáil got rid of it.  They want it back again because they see the sense of such a scheme.  The £5,000 mortgage subsidy and the £1,000 grant for those who leave local authority tenancies to purchase their own home will result in many local authority houses being made available for new tenants.  In addition, for the first time local authorities will be able to purchase houses on the open market for allocation to tenants.  That new development is welcome.  I also welcome the joint venture housing and the site subsidy.  A figure of £3,000 may not be the market value of sites and the Minister should consider increasing the grant under that scheme.</P>
    <P>The road section is also worthy of consideration. In the period of the plan there will be a 53 per cent increase in the amount of funds to be made available for the development and improvement of our national primary roads.  That represents an increase of 10 per cent over and above what was promised by the Fianna Fáil administration in 1979.  The Minister said he was happy to be able to report that the overall block grant allocation had been increased this year by 10 per cent. According to him the system had been <Col N="688" /> reviewed with regard to the most equitable distribution of available funds especially by reference to mileage of regional roads.  That new development is welcome.  Hopefully, my county which has a considerable mileage of regional roads will get its share to help us carry out the necessary improvements.  I was disappointed that additional money was not provided for county roads.  The county road structure is going into decay and funds should be made available before the position gets worse.  The Department should consider making an annual commitment for the improvement and upkeep of county roads.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister indicated that a law will be introduced to make compulsory an insurance-tax disc system.  There is a crying need for a change in the area of motor insurance.  Many drivers under 25 years of age cannot get insurance cover.  Most companies do not want them or when they quote a premium it is so excessive that the young people cannot consider it.  We are all aware of how difficult it is for young people to get cover even if the parents of those young people were insured with companies for many years.  I hope legislation is introduced to reform the structure of motor insurance. The legal system and awards made in accident cases should be looked at.  Why not look at the British system?  I have heard that insurance cover in England is cheaper and there is no great problem for people under 25 to get cover.  The Departments of the Environment and Justice should prepare a scheme that will limit the level of charge and eliminate a lot of the fees paid to the legal profession for processing claims.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that an Estimate like this is not debated in greater detail here. I ask the Minister responsible for Dáil reform to allocate more time for debates on Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to comply with the wishes of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I will be brief.  If one examines the Minister's lengthy speech one will not find very much in it.  I am concerned about the construction industry, the <Col N="689" /> allocation for roads and job creation prospects.  The Minister painted a very rosy picture about additional funding for roads but he failed to say that the money would be spent on the national primary and the national secondary roads.  He said that 6 per cent of the roads carried 35 per cent of the total traffic, but those figures cover the roads in the city, not the region I come from.  In my area we feel we are being neglected because of the Government's failure to provide funds for our county and main roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about their three year programme and said industry know where they were going and spoke about priming pumps.  If he were talking to people in the country they would be more inclined to say they were priming the pumps to get the water out of the potholes rather than setting up industries.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand how the Department of the Environment, the Minister for Labour and the Manpower Services cannot come together.  I often wonder if they are even on speaking terms.  We are putting down questions asking that some of the available money be allocated to very needy essential roadworks but the Government appear to be completely involved in amenity schemes, sports pitches, with AnCO and training schemes.  It is time the Department looked at other areas, especially county and minor roads which are deteriorating rapidly because the water cannot drain out of the channels.  I believe we could provide jobs for our youth in this area.</P>
      <P>Coming here last Tuesday I noticed a Northern Ireland lorry, which turned off at Phibsboro, with a full load of salt and sand to be spread on the roads.  Can we in the Republic not even mix salt and sand to spread on our roads during the bad weather?  It is about time the Department looked at all areas where jobs could be provided.  In my region firms manufacturing concrete are in dire straits because of substantial imports of concrete products and ready mix products with an import cement base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy spoke about the black economy and the need for funds to be made available by the Department.  It <Col N="690" /> must be remembered that almost all major works undertaken in this country are financed by the Exchequer.  This means there should be a closer examination of where the products used are manufactured.  Over the last few days, probably in anticipation of this debate, the regional development organisation in my area sent me notes of their programme for the period from 1984 to 2001.  They came up with their proposals as a result of a number of reports commissioned by the EC &mdash; the EC Social and Economic Committee Report, the NERDO EC Report and the EC Catchment Study Report.  These reports stressed the strengthening of bridges and the realignment of roads.  They said that regional development could not proceed in the absence of adequate support infrastructure. The NERDO report set down the minimum requirements for the whole area, not roads alone.  They spoke about the availability of adequate fiscal and support infrastructure, which was a key element of the economic and social development of the north-east region. They talked about the importance of infrastructure for the stimulation and maintenance of agriculture, industrial, commercial and tourist activity and recognised that as a key factor underpinning the total regional development. They said the success of the effective economic sector contributed to regional growth and prosperity was dependent on a phased completion of the infrastructural programme over the period to 2001.</P>
    <P>We know we are in a serious financial position but we must acknowledge that infrastructure is the bedrock of development of the resources in all regions.  We have to come to grips with this not alone at national level but at local and county levels, but at local and county levels we are inhibited by a lack of finance.  Let us examine this document which we were given this morning.  The refund in lieu of rates on agricultural land is only slightly above last year's figure and this applies to almost every other heading.  The greatest percentage increases are in the areas of office machinery and office supplies, travelling and incidental expenses and <Col N="691" /> postal and telecommunications.  If we look at these items we will see that almost every increase is a direct result of the Government's economic and monetary policies over the last few years.  They have increased to a great extent the excise duty on petrol and diesel, postal and telecommunications charges and ESB charges. These areas should be closely examined.</P>
    <P>Last year £2.15 million was allocated to the local improvements scheme and a similar figure is allocated this year.  We are getting the same amount every year despite the fact that we get substantial sums from the EC.  My grievance is that the Minister does not have a fair and equitable system of allocating this money.  Let us examine the figures we were given in reply to parliamentary questions.  In reply to a question in 1975 the then Minister for Local Government, a Labour Minister, said the amount allocated related to the number of outstanding applications on the list.  Three counties, Monaghan, Mayo and Donegal, have a backlog of applications and are not getting as much money by way of allocation as other counties.  The allocation was not related to the need or to the numbers of bona fide applications on the waiting list.  I ask the Minister to rectify this and to give fair play to each county in these allocations.</P>
    <P>Housing has been mentioned and I appeal to the Minister, as I have done before, to provide serviced sites.  We seem to be obsessed with providing local authority housing at very high subsidised rents.  A serviced site would cost about £3,000 but I would prefer to offer a site like that to someone who was prepared to build his own house instead of, as is happening in many counties, offering a site for £6,000 which is not accepted and then the person goes into a local authority house.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about repairs to houses but, as so many other Members wish to speak, I will not detain the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to indicate to the House that the <Col N="692" /> Minister must come in at 4.45 p.m. Deputy Joe Cosgrave is offering now. Deputy De Rossa is next.  It will then go back to the Government benches and, after that, to the Fianna Fáil benches.  I am trying to allow as many Members as possible to speak and I hope that my appeal will be heard and that Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Cosgrave will heed my plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to be very brief.  I support the grant announced today by the Minister.  It highlights the Government's ongoing commitment to ensure that the needs of the public are met as far as possible.</P>
      <P>We as legislators and I, as a Member of this House and of a local authority, are chiefly concerned to see that the money is spent as effectively as possible and that the public benefit from it.  This is particularly important when money is scarce and highlights the need and urgency for this overdue local government reform.  The proposed reform is most welcome and will bring local authorities nearer to the people they serve.  My own constituency will see a major change.  Areas such as Howth, Baldoyle, Sutton and Kilbarrack will move into the third administrative county council area proposed in the reform.  This area has seen vast changes over the years and is in need of special attention.  Howth, Baldoyle and Sutton, which were villages 15 years ago, are now well developed modern communities with definite ideas as to how their areas should develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent decisions by An Bord Pleanála regarding the proposed development at Baldoyle racecourse were welcome.  End-camp proposed to erect 2,300 houses in the area but were refused permission. Cavern Systems proposed to erect underground caverns in Dublin Bay to store dangerous gases but permission to do so was also refused.  A proposal to erect houses at Redrock, Howth, was also refused.  These proposals were successfully opposed by the residents' associations in the area and they monitored the applications through the local authorities and then through An Bord Pleanála.  I <Col N="693" /> mention this because I believe that the residents' associations have a major role to play in the running and success of local authorities, especially in the success of local government reforms.  Residents' associations are very keen to play an active part in local government and they are specially interested in this proposed local government reform.</P>
    <P>My constituency has a residents' association in most areas and I suggest that they should be taken into account in this reform and an effort should be made to give them more power and a say in what is happening in their communities. I should like to see council officials and public representatives meeting the residents' associations in a different area each week or month to enable the associations to have their say in planning and other matters which affect their lives.  In my own area I visualise a headquarters for the local authority in Malahide or Swords with local offices in Howth, Baldoyle and Sutton where meetings could take place.  Residents would be very satisfied with this development.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned this morning that local authorities could act as agents for other Government bodies in the areas of education and social welfare.  I propose an extension to this in that local authorities could also play a role in the development of tourism.  I say this because Howth is in my constituency and it has developed very well over the last few years especially with the development of the fishery harbour and Howth Head. There are many scenic walks there.  Local authorities could have an input to promote tourism, thus bringing in much needed money to the area.  Other matters in my constituency need urgent attention. Howth Harbour has developed well. However, part of the roadways servicing the west pier have been left unsurfaced and they are now an eyesore.  I ask the Minister to take this into account.  I put down a question in the Dáil regarding this matter some time ago and I was informed that tenders would be sought. I ask him to speed up this work so that it is carried out at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I should also like to bring the Hill of <Col N="694" /> Howth drainage scheme to the attention of the Minister.  People there have been complaining over the years, especially in the summer, that when fires start the fire brigade do not have enough water to fight them.  The poor quality of water and poor pressure have also been mentioned.  I asked the Minister about this some time ago and he informed me that the contract for these works would be placed very soon.  I ask him to ensure that this scheme is started at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the disposal of raw sewage in the Dublin Bay area.  It particularly affects my area as there are beaches in Sutton, Portmarnock, Baldoyle and Dollymount.  Last summer raw sewage was washed on to the beaches and people were afraid to use them because they rightly felt that they were unsafe.  I attribute this to the north Dublin drainage scheme which is disposing of its sewage through the Nose of Howth and is then being washed back on the beaches.  Dublin Corporation have carried out excellent works lately to ensure that the quality of water in the bay improves but the sewerage system is preventing the quality of water from being what it should.  I ask the Minister to consider water treatment works to cater for this area which would be an excellent addition for the protection of water quality.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle estuary has come under threat this year.  Two groups wish to take over part of the estuary by filling it in, thus doing away with a great amenity. The residents objected to this and I support their objections and will continue to do so.  Dublin Corporation passed a motion supporting their objections and I ask the Minister if his Department will also support our objections to any filling in of the estuary.  The Department of Communications would also be involved as they would grant a licence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £5,000 offered to local authority tenants.  This is the single most outstanding aid offered to persons who wish to own their own homes or to improve their living standards.  Dublin Corporation have a housing list of approximately 8,000 people who are <Col N="695" /> seeking housing.  People who avail of this scheme will be mainly those on the transfer list who will now buy their own homes.  People are availing of this in my constituency and it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister's concern regarding air pollution.  I am particularly worried about this in Dublin city. Other speakers mentioned it this morning, particularly Deputy Doyle who gave some figures. The Minister has agreed to bring forward a clean air Bill.  A similar Bill was introduced in England and cities like Sheffield were cleaned up in a short time.  Smokeless zones were created and smokeless fuels had to be used.  We must do something similar as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We should also address ourselves to the problem of water pollution.  I have mentioned the north Dublin drainage scheme which is polluting Dublin Bay but I congratulate Dublin Corporation on the efforts they are making to clean it up.  We must have treatment works provided for the north Dublin drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>People are worried about the dangerous substances stored in Dublin Port. Cavern Systems were refused permission to store dangerous substances in the port. The storage of petroleum and petroleum products in the port is also a worry.  Acrylonitrile is stored there for a factory in County Mayo.  I suggest that the Department should get together with the people who import these substances, that is the oil companies, and make arrangements with them to put the storage tanks under ground.  The port would look better if that was done and tragedies such as those which occurred in Mexico and India would be avoided.  As far as Acrylonitrile is concerned, the Minister should insist that this be taken out of the port and imported through a small port on the west coast or somewhere else in order to avoid a disaster in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Local government can be looked at in a number of different <Col N="696" /> ways.  It is an important part of our democratic process.  For that reason the whole question of its funding, powers, structures and so on are extremely important for everyone in this State.  It can also be seen as a very important service industry in that, as the Minister pointed out, it employs 35,000 people directly.  Clearly it is important from a number of different viewpoints.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised a number of different issues which would require hours to deal with in any detail.  It is not possible to do that now, so I propose to concentrate on two areas.  They are the proposed reforms which the Minister intends to bring in in relation to the greater Dublin area and the question of local charges.</P>
      <P>As regards air pollution, I am surprised at the Minister's proposed solution which is to encourage people to move away from using solid fuels and oil and to use natural gas.  I wonder on what he bases this policy and how he proposes to encourage people to do this.  There is obviously a need for a greater use of smokeless fuels but would it not be equally valid to make it possible for people to transfer to the use of electricity since the ESB is a semi-State organisation and provides a countrywide service?  Why is he urging people to transfer to natural gas in the Dublin area?  It is odd, to say the least.  It raises the question of Government policy which seems to be to burn natural gas at all costs as quickly as possible.  It is a criminal waste of a very valuable natural resource to burn it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards housing, the Minister was very keen to push the idea of joint venture housing.  Anyone I spoke to in the building industry told me that joint venture housing is a recipe for shabby housing. Today the Minister said he would make available funding at special rates to local authorities to improve the structure of low cost housing built in the late sixties and early seventies.  Surely there is a contradiction in the Government pushing for joint venture housing and at the same time admitting they have to provide extra funds now, 14 years later, for houses built under a low cost scheme which were <Col N="697" /> shabby and always will be shabby and will have a short life span?</P>
    <P>What is going on behind closed doors in the professional organisations about the Building Control Bill?  I would be very interested to find that out.  Why is the Minister keeping so quiet about local authority rents?  Many promises were made in relation to the travelling people and the need to remedy the total squalour in which they are condemned to live.  All we hear about are promises that something will happen in the future.  Not one single halting site or unit of accommodation has been provided in the county area since the row which erupted last year.</P>
    <P>As regards the fire services, emergency plans and so on, we have been warned by the chairman of the Chief Fire Officers' Association that there is a disaster imminent unless something is done about how we plan to deal with emergencies in relation to chemical transport and so on.</P>
    <P>As regards postal voting, we have been told something will be done about this in the future.  We have been promised it for so long that one begins to wonder about how serious the Government are in relation to it.  The Minister did not say what he proposed to do about postal voting in the local elections.  Will he, as he promised he would, ensure that the disabled will have a right to postal voting in the coming local elections?</P>
    <P>It is clear from the national plan that the Government have a particular strategy in relation to taxation and the funding of services both at national and local level.  There is a clear shift from the central funding of all kinds of services to the private sector.  It is privatisation by stealth.  We hear denials from the Government that there are any moves towards privatisation, but the whole strategy in the national plan is towards privatisation.</P>
    <P>There is also a shift from direct to indirect taxation.  Local charges are part of that shift.  The so-called farm tax is a bit of a joke.  Someone called it a land-related income tax.  I do not understand how anyone can call it that.  It is a recipe to get the Labour Party and Fine Gael off the hook with the farmers.  It is taking <Col N="698" /> 100,000 farmers out of the tax net and allowing them to pay a land tax that will not be introduced until 1986.  It is all a bit of a joke.  The emphasis is that it is shifting taxation from paying on the basis of income to charges on services and so on. It is a policy of this Government that for every £1 levied in local charges by local authorities and also in farm tax, they will deduct £1 at the central government end. The local authorities will not end up with any more money.  It is just a shift from the money being provided through central taxation to indirect taxation at the local level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was remarkable for the fact that local charges as such were not referred to, apart from one brief mention.  When the Minister was talking about efficiency he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>I know that local authorities have been taking action to maintain services and employment at a consistent level by eliminating waste and by making reasonable use of their powers to levy and collect rates and charges efficiently. </P>
    <P>That is the only time charges have been mentioned in the statement.  Surely the Minister must know of the widespread outrage in relation to local charges and the difficulties of the local authorities in collecting them.  He must also know that some local authorities are using unreasonable powers and unreasonable methods to try to collect the charges.  I will mention three examples.</P>
    <P>In Cork they are threatening to withhold third level grants from students whose parents have not paid the local charges.  The Kildare County Council are threatening and are using section 18 of the Offences Against the State Act not against people who have not paid the local charges but who are protesting about the imposition of local charges.  In the Ashbourne area, when a man protested against the imposition of local charges and the disconnection of a water supply his employer was visited by the Garda to find out if the employer knew what his employee was up to.  All of these <Col N="699" /> are unreasonable methods; in fact, I would go so far as to say they are illegal methods.</P>
    <P>The withholding of local charges is not illegal.  No law is broken by withholding them.  It is a debt and it can be pursued through the courts as a debt.  The only conflict there might be in court in relation to local charges is when a person refuses to comply with a court order, not because of the debt.  The debtors' prison was done away with years ago.  The withholding of local charges is not illegal and anyone who claims differently should examine the facts.  It is a legitimate method of making known one's objection to the existence and the continuation of these charges.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil if they support these unreasonable and illegal methods that local authorities are using in this connection.  Will they make a categoric statement without qualification that they either support the charges or do not support them?  We get all kinds of qualifications from Fianna Fáil such as, &ldquo;We do not support these charges in their present form&rdquo;.  In what form do they support them?  In what form do the Labour Party support them?  We know that Fine Gael support them although Fine Gael Deputies and councillors are going around saying they do not support these local charges, that they are a disgrace and so on.  We should get a little honesty about this matter in this House at least.</P>
    <P>The working class people are not objecting to paying for local services. What they are saying is that they have already paid for them through PAYE and VAT.  They are paying 85 per cent of all income tax in the State and they are paying the vast bulk of all VAT collected. They have already paid for these services and it is entirely unreasonable, unfair and inequitable to demand that they pay further for them through these local charges, without in most cases any reference to whether they are able to pay.  It is a question of fair taxation, that everyone pays their fair share on the basis of ability to pay.  That is the only kind of taxation <Col N="700" /> system that will be acceptable to the working class and that is what is involved in the local charges campaign, the implementation of a fair tax system.  We will see how much of that we will get next Wednesday when the budget is announced, although I am practically certain there will be very little fairness in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the structure proposed for the greater Dublin area, I will quote from the Minister's statement.  He said:</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, the Government have taken action to bring about more equal representation of different electoral areas within counties and county boroughs.  In a number of instances county electoral areas have over twice the number of representatives in relation to population as others in the same county.  It is clearly desirable that this undemocratic situation be remedied and that this should be done with the minimum disturbance of electoral boundaries. </P>
    <P>That is good principle but what is the Minister doing in relation to the greater Dublin area?  I will tell the House what he is doing.  Under the old system Dublin city had a ratio of one representative to 11,500 of the population.  Under the new system with 52 seats and the additional population being brought in there will be one representative for 10,500 population. In the county under the old system it was one representative for 13,000 population and under the new system it will be one representative for 5,900 of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make this one point.  The Minister is introducing undemocratic, unequal representation in the greater Dublin area.  A population of 5,900 will elect one representative in the county under the new system but it will <Col N="701" /> take a population of 10,500 to elect a representative in the city.  That is unfair and undemocratic and the Minister should change it.  I am not saying the county should have fewer seats: I am saying that Dublin city seats should be increased <i>pro rata.</i>  The number of seats required to provide equality in the Dublin area would be 93 seats.  If the Minister really believes what he said in his speech about unequal representation being undemocratic that is what he should do in relation to the greater Dublin area. The matter of the municipal council is another issue that I do not have time to deal with now.  As far as I am concerned any municipal authority in this city should be elected by popular vote by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Estimate and I wish to reiterate what I have said on a number of occasions before.  Services provided by the Department of the Environment and the whole local government structure are among those most visible, whose effect is most constantly felt by members of the public.  Consequently, this is one of the most important Estimates one could discuss in the House with the possible exception of finance and health.  A number of speakers throughout the morning mentioned a number of changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could be forgiven for being lulled into a false sense of security until one considers that it is a local election year and perhaps that is the reason for the proposals coming forward from various speakers on the opposite side which effectively would mean spending by central government of more money through the local authorities and the spending by the local authorities of more money.  At the same time some of the same speakers say that it is part of their policy to abolish local charges and replace them with a reorganisation of the financial structures of local government.  It is a lovely, round phrase and within it is something that we <Col N="702" /> still have not found, but no doubt the electorate will find it in due course.  In relation to the general thrust of argument, it is about time that we got away from the kind of politics that the people no longer want, that of people being enlightened suddenly about the ways and means of doing the impossible while in Opposition whereas the same people when faced with these problems were totally unable to cope with them while in Government.  Classic examples were the removal in 1980 of the home improvement grants and the reconstruction grants.  Likewise a number of other grants faltered for lack of funds.  At least the present Government, despite attention and criticism from many people, have managed to produce something positive for the people, such as the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme which, as the Minister indicated rightly, has given the opportunity to every young couple who have made any attempt at saving money to provide a home for themselves.  That is positive.  They have also restored the home improvement grants which were abolished by the previous administration and they have introduced a new policy whereby local authorities can now purchase housing in the private sector for allocation to appropriate and approved applicants in certain circumstances.  All that is positive.  It had to be catered for and paid for by way of careful financial control, and it was done without fuss or fanfare.</P>
    <P>More recently in the national plan there is a proposal which again is most constructive, that of allocating £5,000 to each tenant or tenant purchaser of a local authority house who is prepared to hand it over to the local authority and buy a house in the private sector.  There are dual benefits in that both for the construction industry and in that is gives a greater sense of pride and well-being to the individual who rightly feels that he has contributed to providing himself and his family with their own home.  That is the kind of thing that this Government have done in very difficult circumstances very effectively, and the Minister is to be congratulated on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The most important question that could arise in this debate is local government reform.  To some people that means a change of boundaries, which is important and must be done.  It may mean a change of emphasis, a devolution of powers of one type or another, or the removal of powers, but one thing fundamental to the whole structure of local government is finance, and that has been a problem for the last five or six years.  If the diminution of the financial powers and structures of the local authority continues for the next five or six years as it has done in last five or six years, then they will no longer exist and the local authority could not possibly function.  It behoves us to consider the implications of that and why people on the opposite side of the House in this debate criticise the fact that Government were not giving what they considered sufficient support in lieu of rate grants and so on.  Any money that comes from Government comes from the taxpayer's pocket.  The structures in which the local authority system is working at present are about 100 years old, some of them even older. They served well in their time but they are now well out of date.  If there is one thing I would hope for sincerely in the course of this reorganisation which is taking place now it is that it be absolute and fundamental in the whole structure that it will be completely overhauled and that a structure be laid down whereby the requirements of the present can be met. In doing that, whether we like it or not, finance will have to be provided one way or another, either out of the Exchequer in which case it comes from the taxpayer's pocket or out of the local exchequer in which case it also comes from the taxpayer's pocket by way of direct or indirect taxes.  We must make up our minds.</P>
    <P>In some local authorities during the past year a difficult decision had to be taken, and the authority of which I am a member is among that number We had to let go temporarily a number of workers. Unfortunately, it appeared that they were among the lowest paid in the local authority system.  They were put on <Col N="704" /> short time and that caused a great deal of hardship.  I would not like to see it happen in the future and I do not think that it would be to the advantage of the public or the local authority system to allow a recurrence.  The means must be found to ensure that we can pay our local authority workers.  There are those who criticise them every time they are seen allegedly standing not entirely active by the roadside.  Like politicians and other categories they are criticised mainly because they are visible and can be seen regularly.  Very few people recognise that very many of them are poorly paid.  They do a job which is there for everybody else to do but nobody is too concerned about doing it.  There is a great deal of work which they can do which is absolutely important, provided the finance is available, such as roadside drainage, clearing of open spaces and other work in that area which can be done only by manual labour.  It is essential that we keep our local authority workforce to do that work.  If it means that we must have local charges in order to do that, then the choice is ours.  If we do not want the people to do that work, by all means let us forget about local charges but let us get away from trying to con the public into believing on the one hand that we can have a local authority structure with local control in the hands of local people through elected local politicians and at the same time have finance without making sacrifices.  Those two views are incompatible.  As I have said, in my almost eight years as member of a local authority I can recall with pride when I first became a member and I saw around me the signs of doing the kind of things that I was elected to do.  It was easy then to be able to say to one's electorate, &ldquo;There is no finance available&rdquo; or &ldquo;Provision has been made in the Estimates&rdquo; and we can or cannot do it.  That is not now the case.  The local authority system has become almost a farce.  Now we can tell our electorate that we are very sorry, we can do absolutely nothing.  Looking back over the last five or six years I find that I have less to show for my time in the local authority than I had previously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> That is a sad development in our society which has so many demands on us.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I remind the people opposite that during their term of office up to 1981, each year at Estimate time when every local authority had to meet and discuss where they were going to spend their funds it was found that there was a shortfall of approximately 30 per cent for each of three years when inflation and interest rates were high.  That is where the chasm was created.  The huge bulk of the shortfall we are talking about was created during their term of office. Therefore, there is no use in them coming up to another local election trying to tell us that there are magical ways of providing people with the wherewithal to run the local authority services.  It is not necessary for me to outline the vast number of services provided by local authorities.  If those services must be curtailed or in some cases withdrawn, the public will recognise quickly that politicians who know the system must take full responsibility for any such action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that for such an important Estimate as this we are allowed only four and a half hours debating time.  The Estimate before us is for a sum of £731 million.  This represents 40 per cent of the total amount collected in PAYE tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been reference during the debate to such matters as roads, car insurance, halting sites and buildings.  It is not necessary for me to remind anyone here of the deplorable condition of our roads. The Minister has told us that there is to be a 30 per cent increase in grants for primary roads.  He fobbed us off with the statement that, as up to now, county councils will have to provide money for the maintenance of main and secondary roads in the various counties.  I consider that statement despicable especially since I know from living in the constitutency next to the Minister's that the roads in County Wicklow are in a deplorable condition. It was very shortsighted of the Minister not to have made some positive response to the plea that is being made <Col N="706" /> by every local authority and county engineer in the country.  It is not merely a question of providing some finance next year or the year after for the maintenace of country roads because the roads are in such a state of deterioration that to put them right would necessitate digging out the foundations and replacing them.  I agree totally with the proposal to introduce the compulsory display of insurance discs on cars but if we do not improve the conditions of our roads it may well be that insurance companies will not insure cars to travel on such surfaces.</P>
    <P>Most of the expenditure on roads comes from the EC Regional Fund.  I submit that large savings could be effected in respect of local authorities if a format were devised whereby they could go direct to the EC headquarters to seek funding for this work.  I am not suggesting that money coming from the Regional fund is laundered to any great extent by the Department but local authorities must lose some percentage of their funding as a result of administrative costs incurred by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Regarding the itinerant problem, which is common to most counties, I am confident that local authorities are seriously trying to alleviate the plight of travelling families, some of whom are in very poor conditions.  However, I do not consider the Department to be doing enough to help local authorities to provide halting sites.  The Department may be providing the money to a large extent but much more is needed.  There is a need for more people who are experienced in the matter of dealing with the problems of travelling people.</P>
    <P>Another matter that must be tackled is the problem of housing as it relates to local authorities.  I welcome recent move regarding the purchase of private houses by county councils.  This movement is to be encouraged, not only in terms of the provision of accommodation but also from a social viewpoint, because it is important socially that people in local authority accommodation are intermingled with those who are in the happy <Col N="707" /> position of being able to purchase houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the cost of local authority housing, to the fact that this has reduced in recent years and that so many more houses are being built. The reason for that is that the building industry is on its knees.  There is no point in builders building private houses because people are not in a position to raise the finance to buy them.  Deputy Durkan talks of young people buying houses for themselves.  Statistics indicate that more young people than ever before are applying for local authority housing and the only reason for that is that so many of these people cannot get jobs.</P>
    <P>Some time ago my colleague, Deputy Gerard Brady, played a prominent part in putting through both Houses the Litter Act, but I am disappointed that only few local authorities seem to be implementing the provisions of that Act.  The Act provides for the prosecution of offenders within the terms of the Act but we can see from the state of the countryside and of urban areas too that offenders are not being pursued.  The fast food takeaway areas are among the worst examples of breaches of the law.  One need only go to an area early on a Saturday or Sunday morning in which one of those shops is to be found to realise the extent of the litter problem there.  I am appealing to the Minister to direct local authorities to implement the provisions of the Act.  Not only would this result in a countryside that looks much better but it would save local authorities a good deal of money in terms of what they must spend in employing people to sweep up the streets.  In some areas it is necessary to have the streets cleaned even on Sundays.</P>
    <P>Urgent attention should be paid to the area of the repair of local authority houses.  The situation in this regard has deteriorated to such an extent in recent years that one finds that the housing stock has fallen into a very bad state of repair. Local authorities are only carrying out essential repairs such as structural work. In some cases they are not prepared to repair windows or front doors.  Some of <Col N="708" /> the housing schemes built in the mid nineteen seventies have major faults with windows and chimneys, and many people are unable to do repairs work due to financial constraints.  The Minister should seriously consider this problem.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the announcement of the £5,000 grant but we are not clear on some of the details.  I would ask the Minister to broaden the scope of this scheme to include houses built by semi-State bodies such as Bord na Móna and SFADCo.  SFADCo have found that the residents of some of their houses wish to move out and make the housing stock available for other people on the housing list but they have found that they are not entitled to the £5,000 grant.  I would ask the Minister to look at that and see what he can do.</P>
    <P>Another thing that concerns me are the rumours of building contracts being put out in Border areas for local authority housing schemes, where tenders are accepted by builders in those areas and they are subletting parts of the contract to builders in the Six Counties.  Our aim should always be to employ local labour.</P>
    <P>Local authority financing has been raised by every speaker and I too am concerned about it.  Fianna Fáil are at the moment studying the problems of restructuring local government and local government finances.  We should ensure that local authorities have direct access to Europe to get money from the EC.  The finance offices in most county councils would have to be magicians to balance the books at the moment.  Every county council is in debt.  To pay the interest that is accumulating is a serious problem for most local authorities.  It is a problem that will have to be solved fast.  The Government will have to come up with a real solution as the situation cannot continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said that Fianna Fáil were fudgy in their attitude towards service charges.  Our attitude is that it is up to each local authority to make their own decisions on whether or not they want to introduce service charges.  We oppose the fact that it was made an executive function by Deputy Spring as Minister for <Col N="709" /> the Environment.  County councillors are close to the ground and they are the people to decide whether or not service charges should be introduced.  When we return to power we hope to give this power back to local authorities.  A service charge that worries me is the charge for fire brigade services.  If a chimney fire started in a chimney in a group of houses, a tenant might be afraid to call the fire brigade because of the charge and a disaster could occur.  I would like the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the restructuring of local government, county councils, urban district councils and town commissions will not remain as a rubber stamp.  I would ask the Minister to give the powers back to the county councils.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on this Estimate and I appreciate that the Deputies ensured that the debate was on the whole constructive. In the time available to me it would be impossible to deal adequately with all the points made by Deputies. The Minister of State has already dealt with some of the points.  In the time available I will try to answer the major issues raised.  The other points have been noted and will be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to local government reform.  I was very glad to hear from Deputy Molloy that his party is in general agreement with the measures on local government reform which I announced on the eleventh of this month. I look forward to the co-operation of the Opposition in the legislative programme which will have to be advanced urgently to give effect to the first phase of the reform programme in the light of the recommendations of the two commissions to which I referred.  I agree with the Deputy about the need to develop the local government system in the smaller towns.  This was referred to in my announcement and will be taken on board as part of the general review of town boundaries and status.  As I have said already, I will be bringing forward <Col N="710" /> legislative proposals to get this general review under way.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed European Charter on local Government, we support the principles of the draft and I made this clear at the Conference of Ministers which the Council of Europe arranged in November last to consider the matter. The only real issue is whether the charter should take the form of a convention or of a recommendation.  Ireland was one of a number of countries which favoured a recommendation.  This was unresolved and I understand that it will be considered further at a forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa questioned the number of councillors assigned to the Dublin City Council as compared with the number for the county areas.  He said a city council of 93 members was needed to maintain quality of representation. The Government view was that a council of this size would be too unwieldly.  Moreover equality of representation within a local authority is of more importance than equality of representation as between local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give as many replies as possible.  I have given my reply on this issue to Deputy De Rossa and he can take it up with me again some other time.  I am aware of the Deputy's point of view but feel that a city council of 93 members would be unwieldly and would afford members involved in it less chance to highlight the problems in their areas.  We have allowed a big increase in the country areas because of the three different councils and a sufficient increase in the city area.  It has operated very well with a lower number but we think this extra number will allow them to operate just as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Molloy and De Rossa referred to the question of postal voting. As regards the Postal Voting Bill, it is the aim to introduce the Bill before the summer recess.  It will not become effective until the 1986 registers are being <Col N="711" /> prepared and there will be no difficulty about being in time for that.  I can assure the Deputies that there will not be a general election in the meantime.  As regards the local elections next June I can confirm that postal voting will apply.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Molloy elaborating on his party's policies in regard to local authority finance and I would like to offer some comment on his contribution.</P>
    <P>If I understood him correctly, he sees additional finance being provided for local authorities through a fixed, and presumably, bigger, share of national taxation. There are some general comments I would like to make on this.  In the first place, it seems obvious to me that additional grants for local authorities can only be provided through increased taxation. I would greatly fear that Deputy Molloy's suggestion would as Deputy Durkan has already said, have to result in higher central taxes, presumably for the PAYE sector, if it were to have any advantage over the present general grants. Secondly, the idea of fixed funds in the form of assigned revenues is outmoded. In this country, Fianna Fáil themselves abolished the Road Fund and the evidence of countries which have such systems, for example, the Netherlands, is that local authority share of taxation is the subject of annual negotiation.  I can see no advantage in that arrangement over the present system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also sees merit in allocating most of all of the grants to local authorities as block grants, thus replacing the present mixtures of block and specific grants.  I am sure that he would agree with the need to ensure an adequate road between Dublin and Galway and I am also sure he would agree with the need to ensure adequate provision for housing in such areas.  These are matters in respect of which the Government must ensure adequate provision and must, therefore, be able to influence the direction of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Finally on finance, I must set the record straight on some points which Deputy Molloy made during his contribution.  Let <Col N="712" /> us be clear that when Fianna Fáil abolished domestic rates in 1978 and substantially increased reliefs to farmers during the period 1978-82, they failed to make adequate finances available to local authorities to replace revenues lost to them by these decisions.  The rates limits imposed by Fianna Fáil Ministers from 1978 to 1981 were substantially below the level of inflation.  When we came back into office in 1983 we had to make an additional £31.5 million available through the rates support grants so as to avert a crisis for services and employment in that year.  The grants have been made available in the past two years and have enabled local authorities to maintain a reasonable level of service in extremely difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa criticised some local authorities for their methods in collecting charges.  I do not support unreasonable or illegal methods and I do not think that acting outside the law by some of those promoting opposition to the payment of charges should be condoned by anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the local improvements scheme.  I wish to clarify the position about local contributions. On the aggregate, contributions under EC requirements meet at least 10 per cent of the cost of a project.  The amount to be paid by an individual beneficiary is a matter for arrangement between the beneficiaries themselves.  In effect, it is open to the beneficiaries of the scheme to agree the apportionment of the contribution among them so as to avoid hardship to any individual involved.</P>
    <P>Turning to road grants, I am sure Deputy Molloy and his colleagues opposite remember only too well that in the first year of the operation of their 1979 road plan the provision of road improvement grants in 1980 represented a cut of 43 per cent on the level of grants projected by that plan that was only decided the year before.  May I remind this House that a total provision of £125 million for these grants for 1985 represents an increase of 23 per cent, or 17 per cent in real terms, relative to 1984.  In this, the first year of the Government's national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, we have fully <Col N="713" /> honoured the commitment made in our plan last year about State investment in road improvements.</P>

      <P>Several Deputies referred to the question of county road maintenance.  As I indicated in my opening speech, there is to be no change in the long established policy under successive Governments in this regard.  Local authorities will continue to be responsible for funding maintenance works on county roads &mdash; that is the same as it has always been &mdash; and from their own resources. For example, in the case of Galway County Council, the overall road grant allocated by my Department to the council in 1985 at £5.2 million represents an increase of 20 per cent on the grant of £4.3 million paid to the council in 1984. The council may, at their discretion, apply the block grant to the improvement of county roads, as opposed to maintenance. The council's block grant this year amounts to £887,000 compared with £818,000 in 1984.</P>
      <P>Over and above the block grant, special grants have also been provided for local authorities for strengthening works on non-national main roads.  In 1985 a special grant of £265,000 is being provided for strengthening works on the Galway-Spiddal-Carna roads, part of which serve the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reference was made during this debate to the level of unemployment in the building industry as being approximately 50,000.  I should like to point out that the unemployed in the industry was 44,273 last November.  In January of last year it was 44,774.  I do not think that people should just pick figures out of the air like 50,000.  I believe there is a very significant difference.  Something in the <Col N="714" /> region of 5,700 fewer unemployed, according to the statistics, is the accurate figure and that is the one that should be brought forward by Deputies rather than misleading people not only in the House but outside it.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the widespread redundancies in local authorities. The actual position is that because of the need to introduce short time working in local authorities about 156 man years were lost in 1984.  Much as I regret that, I would not describe this as widespread redundancy over the whole area of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the rate of decline in the building industry is accelerating and that the decline in output last year was higher than projected and that the PCP investment in the industry will be down by 4 per cent in 1985.  This is not true on all counts.  The rate of decline in the industry is decelerating and the decline last year was not higher than that projected.  Also the PCP investment in the industry in 1985 is £1,227 million in comparison with £1,188 million in 1984. Indeed, over the period of the national plan, 1985 to 1987, construction will account for an increased share of the total capital public programme expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have already told local authorities that all persons to whom contracts must be given must be able to produce a C2 certificate for the Revenue Commissioners. I have also recently directed local authorities to use the powers available to them under Government conditions of contract, to ensure that PAYE, PRSI and pension contributions in respect of each person employed by contractors working for them are paid, and that a rate of pay not less than that agreed by the Joint Industrial Council for the Building Industry is paid to each person.  I am satisfied that these measures will have the desired effect and I am sure Deputy Nolan was concerned about that point.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Opposition's cure for the ills of the building industry is to inject a further £200 million of taxpayers' money into it.  As usual, no thought is given to the economy's ability to sustain this type <Col N="715" /> of extra borrowing, its effect on the taxpayer or on the industry.  Given past experience on the effects of such borrowing, I think people would expect a more thoughtful contribution from the main Opposition Party.  That is all I wish to say on these aspects of the building industry.</P>
    <P>A number of contributions have been made and we have taken note of them.  I should like to take this opportunity to thank my Minister of State for his contribution and his work in the Department and to assure Deputies on all sides of the House that the programme which I have brought forward in the Estimate today is an adequate one for my Department and will be carried through over the year to the benefit of people, particularly those who depend on local authorities for services and for housing, etc.  I am satisfied that the figures involved in the Estimate represent a considerable improvement on the previous year and will show an improved result, not only for those within local authority areas but for the economy of the country as a whole.  I thank the House for its reception of the Estimate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the allegation that the Taoiseach gave an interview on a local radio station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having given me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Taoiseach <Col N="716" /> himself is not present to answer the allegations contained in an article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Wednesday, 23 January 1985 because it was the Taoiseach himself who was involved in this matter and not his Minister of State, Deputy Nealon.  Nevertheless, I presume the Minister of State has been briefed by the Taoiseach in relation to this matter.  As a matter of practice and principle when a matter on the Adjournment is addressed to the Taoiseach or to any Minister, the Taoiseach or that Minister should appear in the House and should not be allowed to run away from the situation by sending in a substitute.</P>
    <P>I refer to an allegation by Liam Collins of the &ldquo;Ad Lib&rdquo; column of the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 23 January 1985 regarding an interview by the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, on an illegal radio station, namely, Radio Dublin, and the interviewer was Mr. Pat Jennings.  I understand that Mr. Jennings made himself known to the Taoiseach at the official opening of a cluster unit in Séan McDermott Street two weeks ago when he gave an exclusive radio interview to Mr. Jennings. I wish to know from the Taoiseach if he was aware that this interview was with a representative of an illegal radio station and, if so, does he approve of this recognition by him of this station.  I understand that the relevant tape is in the possession of Radio Dublin and has not yet been broadcast but, of course, it could be broadcast at any time.  I must say that I am concerned that the interviewer, Mr. Jennings, seemingly was approached, after the interview with the Taoiseach, by a representative of the Government Information Service asking, indeed instructing him not to broadcast the particular interview with the Taoiseach. I believe the statement was made to Mr. Jennings that if this interview was broadcast Radio Dublin would be closed down.</P>
    <P>This difficulty for the Taoiseach or indeed for any other Minister or Deputy would not arise had the Government honoured their undertaking to provide the necessary legislation for independent local radio, as was promised on numerous <Col N="717" /> occasions since they assumed office in 1982.</P>
    <P>In June 1983 we in Fianna Fáil brought before this House our Independent Local Broadcasting Authority Bill which was defeated by the Coalition partners with a promise to bring legislation before the Dáil at the earliest possible opportunity. I want now to quote what the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, at column 981 of the Official Report of 8 June, 1983, had to say at the time when he stated he would prepare a Bill and introduce it as quickly as possible, but as yet no such Bill has been brought before the House:</P>
    <P>May I say, this Government recognise fully the urgency of introducing legislation to regulate the use of local radio and to bring order into what is, essentially, a near chaotic situation. In our Programme for Government, there is a commitment that community radio will be developed in an orderly manner. </P>
    <P>The Minister himself said at that time that he had particular responsibility to bring forward this legislation and to examine all of its aspects.  I understand there is serious conflict within the Coalition regarding the composition of the Independent Local Radio Authority and that the Labour Party are anxious to have majority control by the present public broadcasting authority, RTE.  To my mind that would not provide an independent local radio service, which we could support and as we envisage it.  The Minister for Communications, Deputy J. Mitchell, at columns 1429-30 of the Official Report of 14 June, 1983 stated in this House:</P>
    <P>As further evidence of the Government's determination to provide for the orderly development of community radio services at the earliest possible date and pending the enactment of the necessary legislation, I will be setting up in the immediate future a Local Broadcasting Committee. This committee will consider submissions from various interested parties, especially youth organisations, <Col N="718" /> on their concepts of local radio services and will make such plans of an administrative and technical nature as are feasible. I see these steps as facilitating the speediest possible introduction of legal local radio after the enactment of legislation. </P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden, the matter you gave notice of intention to raise on the Adjournment does not afford an opportunity for a discussion on local broadcasting and all the rest of it.

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In such circumstances, the Taoiseach giving an interview to an illegal radio service is a reflection on the official public broadcasting service, RTE.</P>
      <P>I might remind the Minister of State also that the Lord Mayor of Dublin is also involved in the giving of interviews to this illegal radio station but as he is not a member of this House I shall not elaborate further on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this development with concern and seek clarification from the Minister of State in relation to this interview.  Will he indicate if he is aware that this interview was given willingly by the Taoiseach <Col N="719" /> to Mr. Jennings of Radio Dublin, that the relevant tape is in the possession of Mr. Jennings and may be broadcast by that station at any time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say I am amazed that Deputy Leyden should have any objection to my presence here instead of the Taoiseach as he proceeded to devote most of his contribution to areas that appertain to me and not to deal with the question on the Adjournment. Perhaps he himself was the wrong person to make his case on this occasion.  In the ordinary course of events it is not unusual for a Minister to have a Minister of State reply on his behalf and the Taoiseach has perfect confidence that I will be able to give an adequate reply to the points raised by Deputy Leyden.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach attended and addressed a press conference organised by the Séan McDermott Street Youth Employment Group on Thursday last, 10 January 1985, at 10 o'clock.  It was announced at that meeting that planning permission had been given for the development of an industrial cluster on a site in the Gardiner Street/Summerhill area.  This is a very important development in which the Taoiseach himself had taken a personal interest over a period.  The group invited the media along to the conference.  It was not a question of the Government Information Service or anybody else inviting the media; the group invited the media.  There were two television teams present, including one from RTE.  The Taoiseach's address was taped and recorded in the usual manner and, as is usual or indeed common place nowadays, some of the print journalists present also used tape recorders instead of taking notes.  At the conclusion of his address the Taoiseach was surrounded by the youth group and gave a special interview which was taped and recorded by the RTE television crew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that interview another journalist who was present approached the Taoiseach and, without identifying himself, began to tape questions and answers <Col N="720" /> between himself and the Taoiseach. From the tenor of his questions it appeared that he was working for a radio rather than for print journalism, a newspaper or a magazine.  Naturally the head of the GIS who was present did not like to interfere because he could have been from any of the many magazine programmes on RTE.  As always happens with the Taoiseach the interview was going exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>As soon as the brief interview concluded, the head of the GIS asked the journalist to identify himself.  He was a freelance journalist, named by the Deputy correctly, who worked for a number of publications at home and abroad and also worked for an illegal radio station here.  When he indicated that he proposed to use the interview for an illegal radio station &mdash; and he was working for an illegal radio station on that occasion &mdash; he was advised that, under no circumstances, should the interview be broadcast.  Permission for its broadcast was being refused.  He was informed of the stated Government policy that interviews by members of the Government for broadcast or report on illegal radio stations were not permitted.</P>
    <P>The journalist said correctly that he was a member of the NUJ in defence of his entitlement to conduct the interview and, in the best traditions of the NUJ, to which I had the privilege of belonging for very many years, the journalist agreed that he had not initially declared his interest and, in deference to the request not to use the interview as obtained by him, he would not use it in his report that evening.  This undertaking was fulfilled and the broadcast did not take place.  I have sufficient confidence in that member of the NUJ to believe that, despite the fact that the tape still exists, it will not be broadcast.  As the Taoiseach said during the week the local radio Bill is at an advanced stage and will be before the House early in this session.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the conversion of Deputy Leyden against illegal radio stations.  This is a very big change from the time he had a very high profile presence in a demonstration outside my <Col N="721" /> office in favour of illegal radio stations.  I am glad that conversion has taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

There in high profile, mixing with the disc jockeys and cutting as good a dash as any of the disc jockeys, was Deputy Leyden.  I am glad he has now changed and is totally against interviews being given to illegal radio stations.  Presumably he is also against illegal radio stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will introduce this Bill and we will <Col N="722" /> get it passed into law and get the whole thing regularised.  Deputy Leyden's party introduced a Bill when they knew they were about to be defeated in the Dáil and the Bill would fall with them.  Finally after years of dallying and allowing this monster of illegal stations to grow throughout the country they were spurred into action and a Bill was produced. Duly the Government went out of office. We have taken longer than I would have liked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Embassy in London, like all Irish embassies, has as one of its primary functions the provision of consular assistance to all Irish citizens who seek it.  This includes assistance to persons detained by the British authorities under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), as well as under other legislation.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be possible to detail the number of persons assisted and the type of assistance given since the Prevention of Terrorism legislation was enacted in 1974 without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time and money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has been detained under the PTA, the Embassy can and does help his or her family in ascertaining where the person is being held, whether the detention order has been extended or <Col N="662" /> whether charges are being brought.  The Embassy also seeks to ensure that the person detained has access to a solicitor, can communicate with his family, has no medical problems and is being treated correctly.  Where complaints are made to the Department or the Embassy by those who have been detained about the treatment of persons in detention, the Embassy raises these complaints with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The Embassy acts in PTA detention cases at the request of families, legal counsel, or public representatives or where the Embassy is otherwise aware that there are grounds for concern.  In some cases persons do not wish the Embassy to intervene.  Such wishes are at all times respected as is the privacy of the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the possibility of abuse of powers and of discrimination against Irish citizens is inherent in the PTA legislation and, in consequence, I make representations concerning the scope and method of operation of the Act to members of the British Government on a regular and ongoing basis.</P>

As soon as this information is supplied a decision will be made and the applicant will be notified.  The question of determining entitlement to free fuel in any individual case is a matter for the health board.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed from August 1984 on the grounds that his means exceeded the rate payable to him.  His means were derived from the profit from his holding.  He appealed against this decision and arising out of contentions made by him in support of his appeal, his claim was referred to a social welfare officer for further inquiries.  These inquiries have proved to be extensive as the information on the various documents submited by him had to be checked and verified.  However, it is expected that these inquiries will be completed shortly and his case will then be referred to an appeals officer for determination of his means.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>A claim for children's allowance was received in the Department on 3 July 1984 from the person concerned in respect of her two children.  As birth certificates were not received until 10 December 1984 a decision could not be given on the claim until that date.  The appropriate allowance books were issued to the nominated post office of payment in December 1984 for collection by the claimant and she was notified accordingly.  She should now be in receipt of an allowance at the rate of £24.10 per month.  All arrears due have also been issued.  In the light of the Deputy's question, however, the Department is writing to the claimant in the matter and when her reply is received any action necessary will be taken without delay.</P>

      <P>A claim to optical benefit was received from the person concerned on 26 October 1984.  According to the records available then only four contributions had been paid on his behalf.

      <P>The following is a full statement of the position with regard to the claim of the person concerned to deserted wife's allowance and disability benefit and of the payments made to her.</P>
      <P>She was intially awarded a deserted wife's allowance at the reduced weekly rate of £6.55 from 30 June 1983 based on weekly means of £56.99 derived from earnings and was issued with an order book at this rate payable from 10 November 1983.  The book contained payments to 4 April 1984.  A payable order for £124.45 for arrears for the period from 30 June 1983 to 9 November 1983 was sent to her on 27 January 1984.</P>
      <P>Her rate of allowance was revised to £58.55 per week from 1 March 1984 when she was assessed with nil means and she was issued with a supplementary order book at £52.55 weekly payable from 22 March 1984 to 4 April 1984 and a book at £58.55 weekly payable from 5 April 1984 (increased to £62.65 from 5 July 1984).  The supplementary book however should have only been for £52 and she was therefore overpaid £1.10 over the two weeks.  Arrears for the period from 1 March 1984 to 21 March 1984 amounted to £156 and a payable order for the balance of £154.90, after the overpayment had been deducted, was sent to her on 10 May 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 August 1984 following correspondence from her it was decided to allow the increase in her entitlement from 3 November 1983.  The arrears for the period from that date to 29 February 1984 amounted to £936.  However, a total of <Col N="681" /> £1,471.46 had been overpaid to her in disability benefit during the period 5 November 1983 to 22 August 1984, when she was paid at the full rate plus increases for two children instead of at half rate (without child increases) which is payable concurrently with deserted wife's allowance. All the arrears of deserted wife's allowance were used as an offset against this overpayment of disability benefit leaving a balance of £535.46 due. Arrangements are now being made to have this amount repaid by deductions of £5 per week from current disability benefit of £18.63 weekly which is being paid to her (in addition to her deserted wife's allowance payment of £62.65).</P>
    <P>During the period 27 April 1984 to 27 <Col N="682" /> December 1984 an amount of £280 due to the Western Health Board, for supplementary welfare allowance paid to the claimant from 28 November 1983 to 14 January 1984, was also recovered from her by deductions of £8 a week from her disability benefit payment.</P>

      <P>My investigations into the possibility of a grant payment to Glenahulla national school, Mitchelstown, County Cork, for new windows and repairs to the heating system indicate that my Department issued approval in principle for a new heating system to a former chairman of the school's board of management.  My understanding is that work was carried out but that the school authorities are not yet in a position to claim grant payment. I am arranging for the present chairman to be contacted with a view to assisting him in processing the claim.  My Department's records indicate that the question of a grant for updating the lighting installation at the school was also raised but not the provision of windows.  I propose to have these matters and repairs to the heating system included in the scope of further investigations.</P>
