      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach about a date for a debate on the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  He indicated, as the Tánaiste had previously indicated, that this had been referred to the Chief Whips of the parties.  In a report in the <i>Evening Press</i> last Saturday the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party indicated that it had not been referred to them.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the position?  Has it been referred to the Whips?  If not, when will it be and when will we have a debate on the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to restore to certain pensioners of Irish Shipping Ltd. the <i>ex gratia</i> element of their pensions which was formerly paid by the company before the appointment of a liquidator by the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pension arrangements for employees of Irish Shipping Ltd. were a matter for the company and the pension arrangements in force at the time of the liquidation of the company were those established by the company.  The Department of Communications' understanding of the position is that the company operated three pension schemes &mdash; one for senior executives, another for sea-going staff and a third for shore-based staff. Although section 3 of the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Act, 1984, provided that the Minister's approval would be required from then on for any alterations in the then existing pension arrangements, he was not in fact called upon to exercise that power in regard to these pension schemes.  So I have to make <Col N="1955" /> clear that the Minister has had no function, statutory or otherwise, in the pension schemes that existed at the time of the liquidation.</P>
    <P>The <i>ex gratia</i> portion of the pension, to which I have just referred, was, of course, unfunded and was met out of the company's revenues.  It was not paid out of a pension fund and the company were under no obligation to pay it.  So far as the Department understands the matter, the <i>ex gratia</i> retirement payments made by the company arose mainly from limitations in the pension fund provisions in regard to adjusting pension amounts to cost of living increases.  The company evidently decided to make these <i>ex gratia</i> payments as a way of topping up the pensions in question.  In addition, some <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made to retired employees who were not in pension schemes.  The level of these <i>ex gratia</i> payments was a matter for the company, and when it went into liquidation the continuation or cessation of them became a matter for the liquidator appointed by the High Court.  In view of the nature of these payments, the liquidator could not continue to pay them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, when he spoke on this issue in the course of an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on 6 February last, gave an undertaking that, despite the fact that he had no statutory function in the matter, he would seek some alleviation for those pensioners who had service aboard Irish ships during World War II.  In all, there are 23 recipients to be considered, some of whom are widows of deceased pensioners who had such service.  It is now the Minister's intention that the <i>ex gratia</i> portion of their pensions will continue to be paid from Exchequer funds as a charge on the Vote for Communications, with retrospective effect to the date on which they ceased to be paid by the company.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the circumstances which led to the liquidation of the company and it is an unfortunate consequence that pensioners should be among the innocent victims of the liquidation. When the Government were considering <Col N="1956" /> the restoration of the <i>ex gratia</i> pension element, the possibility of extending this concession to all pensioners of the company was considered.  Due to the financial and legal sensitivities involved it has not been found possible to do this, however much we would like to do so.  I have great sympathy with the plight of all the pensioners but I feel we have a special obligation to those who braved the danger ridden seas during what we know as the Emergency to enable this country to survive.  These are sentiments with which I know you will all agree and it is with confidence that I commend the approval of this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>Before calling on Deputy Wilson, I wish to refer the House to Standing Order No. 124, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>In the discussion of a supplementary Estimate the debate shall be confined to the Items constituting the same, and no discussion may be raised on the original Estimate, save in so far as it may be necessary to explain or illustrate the particular Items under discussion.</P>
      <P>I ask Members to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that, in accordance with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister should have organised this debate for a time when he was here, thus giving it the importance which it should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Irish Shipping and the former employees are concerned, the Minister is once more rubbing the sore when he should be bringing the balm.  The Minister's words show that he is dealing with 23 former employees of Irish Shipping. That is an indication of the Government's concern for the former employees of a wholly owned State company.  It is an indication that the Government, knowing that the people were assessing them in the cavalier way they treated the employees, had to at least make a token award to just 23 out of the total work <Col N="1957" /> force.  Deputy Ahern, our spokesman on Labour, will deal in more detail with the actual numbers who were thrown out of employment, some early, by the liquidation of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;When the Government were considering the restoration of the <i>ex gratia</i> pension element, the possibility of extending this concession to all pensioners of the company was considered&rdquo;.  That is precisely what this side of the House are asking the Minister to do &mdash; to extend it to all the pensioners of the company.  That is precisely what the trade union representatives are asking of the Government and of this House.  In discussions with leaders and members of the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the Seamen's Union, the Opposition, who have kept in close contact with the workers since the liquidation, have been asked to support those just demands.</P>
    <P>This is an illiberal measure, a penny pinching measure.  It shows the kind of parsimonious mind the Government have with regard to this company which, as we put on the record of the House, traded successfully, proudly and profitably for 16 years and then, by one stroke of the pen, was abolished, liquidated, leaving all the workers high and dry until today when the Minister came in and asked us to take seriously a measure designed to help 23 out of the total workforce.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have great sympathy&rdquo;, says the Minister, &ldquo;with the plight of all the pensioners&rdquo;. Sympathy will not butter any parsnips for those who are not covered by this Bill.  That is why Fianna Fáil are taking a very serious view of what the Minister is doing here or what he is not doing for the workers of Irish Shipping. We are putting it to this House that there is an obligation on the Government, on Fine Gael and especially on the Labour supporters, and on Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party in Opposition, to see to it that all those people who were thrown out of work with very little opportunity of getting any other work, are treated properly by this Government.</P>
    <P>If our young people, many of them <Col N="1958" /> unable to get jobs, assess what has happened in this instance, where a fully owned State company, which served the Irish people well since its establishment in the early forties and in particular made a profit for the Irish people for 16 consecutive years prior to being liquidated, hurriedly &mdash; I would say ignorantly from talking to the crew &mdash; by the Minister and his Government, how can they have any hope that they, as labour units, will be appreciated no matter what effort they put into the development of this country? This is the reward for that kind of service. This is the reward for that kind of commitment which those people gave.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that the Government were shamed into doing this by the details of the careers of some of the people who were deprived of payments as a result of the liquidation.  The plight of Captain Kelly, 80 years of age, got great publicity. The money he was getting was reduced from £212.67 to £29 per month as a result of the liquidation.  I do not suppose it caused the Minister any worry when he was liquidating that this kind of thing was happening.  Perhaps the Minister of State in his reply would tell us if the back money will be paid to Captain J.P. Kelly who served this country and who when he was interviewed with the generosity that must have belonged to those workers, said he was bad enough but what about the captains and masters, younger men whose careers were blighted by this deliberate act of Government.  He, among others, said we need a deep water fleet not merely to serve the needs of the nation in peace and in war but to provide career opportunities for the like of him and the other people who are now being deprived of any moneys from the Government in accordance with their expectations.  I will list those expectations later.  He said with contempt, this old man, this practical patriot whose ship was torpedoed in the Atlantic during the war, that it was a disgrace that an island country is now set to have coasters and cross-channel ferries and no other shipping fleet.  He must have thought wryly of 15 <Col N="1959" /> May 1942, the day when his ship the <i>Irish Oak</i> was torpedoed in the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>Commodore Caird was also interviewed at the time of the liquidation and he indicated that his pension from Irish Shipping was gone.  He retired later and he has some pension, but I would like the Minister to tell me whether people like him will have restored to them what Irish Shipping Limited were paying.</P>

How is the Minister catering for them?  Apart from the fact that their ship was sold from under them for $2½ million when its replacement value is $15 million, what about the workers themselves?  What about the crew?</P>

The anger of the deputations which I have met should be felt in this House. They were foolish enough to believe that they and their services were appreciated. If we do praise Mr. Tempany for having saved some money for his liquidated fund, we must blame the original decision for putting those people in that position.

      <P>The cold, clinical judgment of the Chair is appreciated &mdash; by me, anyway.  I would refer the House to the Labour Party motion on the matter of pensions passed at the Labour Party Conference in Cork.  The unions concerned, as I have mentioned, are the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the Seamen's Union.  I think the House should hear exactly what the <Col N="1962" /> motion said.  Mr. Terry Clare of the Seamen's Union of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>He served on the <i>Irish Spruce</i>&mdash; I presume that is the <i>Irish Spruce</i> No. 1 &mdash; during the Second World War.  During a discussion on the collapse of Irish Shipping he said that the company had been established to give jobs to Irish seamen, that it had never been intended that they would be involved in the charter business or have to take huge risks.  He was speaking to a motion from the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland which demanded the reconstitution of a State-owned shipping company, the restoration of all pensions and adequate compensation for those who lost jobs.</P>
      <P>The motion also urged the Parliamentary Labour Party, including Labour Ministers, to take all necessary steps to ensure that this policy be implemented. I have the greatest pleasure in this House in joining with Mr. Terry Clare in urging the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Labour Ministers to see to it that the pensions of all those who were employed by Irish Shipping should be adequately catered for by the Government, by the Government parties and by this House as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned, I had a meeting with the workers concerned about pensions and who must look at what the Minister has brought into this House, sympathy and all, with very angry eyes.  According to my notes of the meeting on Saturday, 25 April, they want to see, of course, a State-owned deep sea company established again.  That is a minimum desire, and again I would call the attention of the House to the kind of spirit that motivated those people.  Secondly, they seek restoration of pensions and pension expectation. This Estimate before the House is not adequate for that purpose.  It is for that reason that we are opposing it.  I want to make that quite clear to the House. We are opposing it in the hope that the Minister, his Department, and ultimately the Government, will improve it <Col N="1963" /> to the extent that it meets somewhat the demands of the workers.</P>
    <P>They emphasised also the comparatively shabby treatment which the workers got with regard to redundancy money. They are making a demand for six weeks' pay for each year of service and that is what I thought might be included in the Supplementary Estimate before the House &mdash; provision in púnts for that kind of deal for those who have been superannuated by the liquidation of the company. What is being offered now to these people?  There might be some argument, in the normal course of events, for the statutory payment.  An argument might be sustained that in harsh times the statutory payment was adequate but the House should take note of the particular plight of these people.  There is no place for them to go.  A paltry few have been able to get jobs.  The British Merchant Navy, which is considerably weakened, has no vacancies or openings.  I think Deputy B. Ahern will give some statistics on that and will indicate to the House how unsuccessful sailors and officers have been in their quest for jobs.  A half week's pay per year of employment is what the Government are offering and one week for people over 41 years.  This is the offer made by the Government who cut their throats.  Because of the summary way in which the company was liquidated, because of the tuatach way this was done, there is an obligation on the Government to do better by their own employees.</P>
    <P>They have also indicated to me that they are owed two weeks ordinary pay for the first two weeks in November of last year.  That is a scandalous situation. It is a disgrace.  The workers had not been paid at the time of my most recent meeting with them and I do not know if anything has been done since.  I should like the Minister to tell me why people who have earned two weeks pay have not been paid it.  We hear nowadays a lot of talk about industrial relations, of high demands from workers and so on.  There was never an industrial dispute in Irish Shipping &mdash; another reason why the <Col N="1964" /> workers deserve the confidence and support of this House.  They do not want our sympathy because that is not worth a damn to them.</P>
    <P>They mentioned also the shore staff whose pensions and expectations have been cut off.  In particular, they mentioned telephonists.  A rather delicate matter but one that they mentioned to me was that an executive was treated in a certain way &mdash; the man in question is since dead, go ndéanfaidh Dia trocaire air.  They regard that as a reasonable headline of how staff down the line should be treated.  I want to put that on the record of the House.  It is not an unnatural expectation.</P>
    <P>During the years there has been no industrial dispute in Irish Shipping.  There was what we talk about a lot nowadays, namely, a community spirit among the workers, a kind of freemasonry with the small &ldquo;f&rdquo; and there was a not inconsiderable amount of wisdom.  The workers probably knew better than their management of the dangers, if we read their submissions.  These are the workers we are dealing with today.  The Minister is pretending to deal with their pensions, emoluments, redundancy payments and so on in this measly little offering that is being made to a very insignificant percentage of workers in Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>Before the liquidation the workers mentioned that there were management problems.  They said:</P>
    <P>In the main we feel there is a bunching of the managerial functions into the hands of a small number of people.  It is true to state that very important and far-reaching decisions are being taken by two or three people with little, if any, reference down the line.</P>
    <P>There is a wisdom in that statement that deserves the attention of this House. It came from people whose case we are pleading today in this House.  They have said that it is hard for members of their union, who have contributed so much in the period of their employment with Irish Shipping, to see the company spiral downwards.  That was said before the <Col N="1965" /> liquidation.  On the basis of the seriousness with which they did their work and reflected on the operations of their company, they deserve extra special treatment from this House.</P>
    <P>The workers whom I met are not really interested in being pensioned off.  What they are really interested in is employment. What they are really interested in is an Irish deep sea shipping company that will employ them.  Then they can do without cries to an unheeding Government for help by way of pension or redundancy. They want a State owned company.  I would settle for a semi-State company &mdash; half and half, private if Irish, Irish crew, Irish flag and Irish registered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Chair is being even-handed.  The workers themselves have done a considerable amount <Col N="1966" /> of work on the formation of a co-operative. These are the workers we are dealing with.  I should like the Minister of State to tell us in his reply if he, his Minister or the Department have addressed themselves to that matter.  The workers are worried also about Irish Continental Lines, about Belfast Ferries and their future as well.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister had this to say:</P>
      <P>The company evidently decided to make these <i>ex gratia</i> payments as a way of topping up the pensions in question. In addition, some <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made to retired employees who were not in pension schemes.</P>
      <P>From those two sentences the House can catch something of the spirit of the management of Irish Shipping <i>vis-à-vis</i> their workers.  I do not think the word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; would be too strong a word and do not forget that I am talking in the context of a company that was making profits.  But by no stretch of the imagination could the word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; be applied to what the Minister has put before the House in his remarks on this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also worried about this whole business of the liquidator.  It is a common way of saying someone hides behind one skirt or another.  But replies from the Government side since the liquidation have tended to hide behind the skirts of the liquidator and say: I cannot do anything about that; it is within the liquidator's competence; I cannot answer that question.  The amount of effort, thought and hard work put into that company by the Irish people has been so great that the niceties of company law should not be allowed to come between the people and information about this company. There are some proposals about company law &mdash; Deputy Gay Mitchell raised a question about it this morning &mdash; but this House and the people are entitled to know what is the situation with regard to the whole range of activities covering, of course, workers' interests, pension rights etc.  There should be some mechanism <Col N="1967" /> whereby we can get that information from the Minister in this House who, a very short time before the liquidation, got the permission and support of this House to raise the amount of money that Irish Shipping could borrow.</P>
    <P>In replying I should like the Minister to indicate whether he is willing to consider an expansion of the provisions mentioned in the course of his remarks this morning.  I should like him to take the opportunity to put some heart into the people who are unemployed and waiting for some kind of a gesture, not a very expensive one in a national context, on the part of the Minister in their regard.  I should like the Minister to also put some heart in those who have ambitions to serve in a deep sea fleet and to indicate what the Government think about a continuation of the educational services for seamen.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate what I said about this side of the House.  One of the men whose transport philosophy we on this side of the House follow, namely, Seán Lemass, founded the company for a specific purpose.  He found, in various dealings with regard to supplies during the war, that gentlemen's agreements that he had with merchants and seamen in London etc. were not adhered to and he cryptically and characteristically said: you can only make gentlemen's agreements with gentlemen.  He was convinced, as I am sure a majority in this House is convinced, that we need our own deep sea fleet.  We are dealing with the servants of a deep sea fleet, those who served it faithfully and well &mdash; I do not want to dramatise it &mdash; in dangers and hazards from war and all kinds of perils at sea.</P>
    <P>A generous gesture on the part of the Government would give hope in the future.  If the Minister and the Government are not prepared to expand what is in this Supplementary Estimate &mdash; which as I said is a measly, beggarly and mean little piece of a Supplementary Estimate and not worthy of the people for whom it is designed &mdash; then we shall have to vote against it, hoping that we will defeat <Col N="1968" /> the Government, possibly with the aid of the members of the Labour Party who passed a resolution along the lines I have been talking about at their conference in Cork.  Then we shall have another chance of putting together a decent package to show the appreciation of this House, this House being a representative House of the country and of those people who served Irish Shipping so well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, being restricted by the Standing Order mentioned. Early in December last I was asked to call to see a constituent who was a captain with Irish Shipping and who, due to the liquidation, had lost his ship and his position.  Before going to see him I found it difficult to know what to say. Having spoken to him for a short while I realised he was not going to talk about his own situation but rather that of his colleagues who are covered by this Estimate. It was then I understood that Irish Shipping had been making <i>ex gratia</i> payments to former employees who were not covered by the pension fund and also, in some cases where pensions were small, Irish Shipping had topped them up.  The first thing the liquidator did when he took over was to stop those payments because I understand he felt he was not entitled to continue making them.  That gentleman was deeply concerned about his colleagues, mentioning Captain Kelly and others who had risked their lives on the high seas during the war to serve our country well and who now found themselves without any pensions.  I promised I would bring the matter to the attention of the Government and I did so personally to the Taoiseach.  I was informed at that time that the Government had considered the matter on numerous occasions at Cabinet in order to find some mechanism to pay pensions to the people covered in this Estimate.  I want to refute the suggestion made by Deputy Wilson here this morning that it was only when the publicity about this broke in the papers that the Government acted.  That is not true.  The Government were always trying to find some system and I am glad that they have come up with this here <Col N="1969" /> today.  The Minister might inform the House more fully of the legal problems the Government faced in this instance and how they were overcome.</P>
      <P>Many people have suffered as a result of this liquidation.  But those who suffer most of all are those who will be left with nothing, people who served their country well.  They are covered by this Estimate and for that reason I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Wilson, has gone through a number of the aspects of this Estimate.  He has outlined in great detail how we feel.  As this is the first attempt we have got to debate Irish Shipping for several months it is a pity we cannot go into more detail.  The Chair has outlined the restrictions on the debate, that we cannot go into the whole history of it.  We have continually argued that the staff of Irish Shipping who have lost their jobs and the pensioners have been treated in an extraordinary fashion. The Kernel of the matter is that the staff were State employees.  They had their jobs in a semi-State body.  They had to contend with the various restrictions applicable to a semi-State body.  They were bound by the pay regulations and the various conditions which apply to all semi-State bodies.  They were under the direction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only a few people on the board who were not appointed by the staff, who made decisions, which in hindsight were bad mistakes, but I am sure were not regarded in that respect when they were made.  The argument we have continually put forward, which unfortunately has been rejected by the Government, is that Irish Shipping is just not any company in liquidation.  It is a State company.  Over the 40 years many of the staff were employed by Irish Shipping they understood they were State staff.  They understood that while the company made profits they had the security of tenure of any State employee.  I am sure the people in the Department of Communications who dealt with this matter probably thought that too but the attitude of the Government was that they should teach some semi-State company a lesson.  They <Col N="1970" /> decided they would pick out one to try to put the fear of God into others.  Irish Shipping was picked.</P>
    <P>This side of the House have never denied that because of the various chartering arrangements and the debts that it was not a major problem but we argued that liquidation was not the only way of solving it.  We are still at a loss and the staff are also at a loss as to why the Minister did not try to renegotiate the contract, why he did not make an effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I am making is a relevant one.  Irish Shipping employees always considered themselves to be State employees.  They felt that because they were under various restrictions in relation to pay, conditions and service which apply to State employees &mdash; this was quoted in memo after memo &mdash; they should be treated like State employees.  That has not been done. Their pleas for compensation and their arguments put forward have been neglected by the Government.  I know this Supplementary Estimate benefits a few people in a small way and I welcome that.  The situation is not so good when one examines the details of all those people who were on pension and sees the reductions made to their pensions.  One captain was receiving a pension of £268 and he is cut back to £40.  There are huge reductions right down through the list.  A Mr. Doyle was receiving £13.81 and he is reduced to £9.  It is as if somebody worked out on a calculator that the percentage cut right across the board would be so much.  The employees who only had a few pounds a week were cut in the same way.  I do not believe anybody can stand over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will continue to fight for those people who have been treated so harshly by the Government.  Deputy Wilson has gone into the history of some of those people who have served the State for years through difficult times and through times when Irish Shipping made great profits.  At the end of the day their miserly pensions are even reduced.  People, such as captains, receiving a pension of £300 a month, had their pensions cut by over £100.  We cannot stand over those cuts. Those people paid their contributions all during their working life.  The Minister of State in the House, who is standing in for the Minister in charge of Irish Shipping, did not say what it would cost to restore their pre-liquidation benefits to the staff. Surely the Government have calculated that.  Was it not hard enough to throw out 240 employees and to leave people <Col N="1972" /> blocked in ports across the world?  Was that not a very harsh Government decision? Many of those people were in their fifties and have expertise in one area only. There is not another Irish company to take up their expertise which is now lost. It is a dreadful decision to cast those people aside and also to see Irish Shipping pensioners having their pensions drastically cut.</P>
    <P>Since I took over as spokesman for Labour I have seen firms in this city going into liquidation and the new employers have continued to give almost full pension rights to the workers.  If that can happen in recession when the economy is on a downward trend, if private companies who have no responsibility and no legal commitment to pay employees after a takeover can have the interest of X employees at heart, surely, when the State is liquidating one of its companies, it could restore in full the pension payments of its workers?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in the House was not involved in the various discussions. The Minister obviously would prefer not to come into this debate although he ordered the time for it and we agreed to it last week, so there is no question of it being rushed through and people not knowing about it.  The reason the Minister is not here is that he has met some of those people, he has read their case histories, all the documents are in the Department and I am sure his advisers have told him to go to the Cabinet table and argue for the few million pounds to give those pensioners their rights.  No effort has been made by the Minister. Irish Shipping are in liquidation and those pensioners have had their pensions drastically reduced.  The attitude of the Minister is hard and uncaring and once he gets away with that he marches down to the Port and Docks, the B &amp; I and everywhere else and tramples on them also. He will threaten to do what he did with Irish Shipping.</P>

      <P>Last November or December was the first time the Minister mentioned he might bring in a Supplementary Estimate.  It is not the fault of Fianna Fáil that it has taken him four months to deal with the matter.  It is certainly not our fault that the Minister chose 10.30 on the morning that did not suit him.  Had he asked us yesterday I am sure we would have agreed to cancel the debate until next week.  The Deputy's argument does not hold up at all.</P>
      <P>At a later date we hope to be able to go into the various aspects of why we need a shipping company and why, as Deputy Wilson said, it must be streamlined into a realistic concern that will not be a lossmaker and will serve the purpose of the State.  In the meantime we ask the Minister of State to explain to the Minister for Communications the plight of those who have been left without jobs. Last week, with Deputy Wilson, I attended a meeting of a representative group of the staff, members of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland, to discuss the matter.  Some staff picked up jobs in Europe with the various carrier companies that were involved with Irish Shipping but they are only a handful of the 240 people involved.  Those people got jobs because they are specialised in a specific area.  Others run the risk of losing their expertise.  Deputy Wilson has already announced that Fianna Fáil will set up an Irish shipping company because it is needed.  Some Government backbenchers accused us of making commitments to pick up debts amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds.  That is not the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell those who make that point that it is a lot of nonsense and it does not carry any weight with anybody.  We are giving an assurance to set up something that is necessary.  I note that any time I attempt to raise certain issues the Chair gets excited; but we will make another attempt to put forward a proposal that most Members, with the exception of the Minister and some of his colleagues, will support because they hold the view that it was a mistake by the Government to liquidate a semi-State body.  If that mistake cannot be rectified by the Government they should at least deal with the hardship experienced by the staff and ex-pensioners of the company.  Those pensioners served the company and the country well.  They served during the war years to bring much needed supplies to the country.  They worked extremely hard to make one of the dreams of Seán Lemass come true and made it a profitable and viable company. For years Irish Shipping was a profitable concern and then the Government decided that they would not liaise with Chinese and Japanese and folded up the company.  Surely one does not fold up the pensioners?  Surely one does not cut back pensions from £50 per week to £20 per week?  Those people do not have anybody to argue for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Mr. Tempany and his staff feel they must cut a few pounds off the pensions, surely the Minister for Social Welfare, who has a budget of more than a billion pounds, or the Minister for Health who has a similar budget, can find a few hundred thousand pounds to restore those pensions.  That is all we are asking.  If the Minister has a good answer about why the Government cannot do that, we will listen to him.  But I am aware from information I have &mdash; Deputy Wilson and I have kept in touch with the staff, who are still united &mdash; that a gap of six months will not stop or break them, as the Minister thought.  They are still hopeful that the type of company they served down the <Col N="1975" /> years will again get off the ground.  However, they are very concerned about their colleagues who are in ill-health, advanced in years or in bad circumstances and who have suffered a reduction in their miserly pensions.  The Minister should give us an assurance that this matter will be looked at again and that the small amount of money required will be forthcoming.  Will the Minister tell the House what it will cost to restore in full the pensions to those who retired from Irish Shipping to the rate prior to liquidation?  It is vital that we are given that figure.  It must be possible to find that amount of money from the billions of pounds spent in the public sector annually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have had an opportunity, even if it is limited, to comment on the plight of employees of Irish Shipping as a result of the liquidation, although the debate relates to an Estimate that has to do with pensions. The Estimate enables retirement payments to be resumed and provides a subhead under which the pensions can be restored.  From the Minister's statement I gather that the company is not due to make this payment.  The reason the Minister has to make it is because there was insufficient provision against inflation.  As the company is not obliged to pay, the payments were made from the company's revenue, not from the pension fund, and a special category of Irish seamen who served in ships during World War II has been established so that pensions can be paid to them or their widows. The Minister has said that because they are regarded as a special category the State should undertake to pay them.  He said that it was considered paying all those who were due pensions at that time and were in receipt of pensions.  However, as the Minister said, because of legal and financial sensitivities it was not possible to do that.  He made a case that there was a moral obligation on the State to pick up the tab here and that it was both the prudent and compassionate thing to do.  He said there was a national obligation to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> They are the clearly and distinguishable categories and the positive thing to say is that this is the right thing to do. There is a parallel also for the Irish seamen who were injured during World War II when bringing in supplies to the country.  The payments will be backdated to November 1984, when payment ceased, to the end of this year.  It may be possible to make arrangements other than an <i>ex gratia</i> payment by the State and through other means in the private sector to look after such matters in the future.  However, the Minister's speech also makes a wider case for the other victims in Irish Shipping.  I was disappointed with the approach of Deputy Wilson, his emotional appeal and negative approach of condemning everybody.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson kept making cheap points.  He said that he did not suppose it caused any worry to the Minister.  That is a scurrilous remark <Col N="1977" /> made about the Minister, because the Minister is as deeply concerned about what has happened to Irish Shipping as anyone else; and, if there is a way out, he will find it and try to compensate those people for what has happened.  Because of our backgrounds neither the Minister nor I could be insensitive to what has happened.  The Minister understands hardship and the plight of the employees. We sit down in a business like manner and try to find a solution.  We do not come in here and waste an hour by slandering the Government and the Minister in the House for not picking up a tab of perhaps £200 million.  If they were in Government they would have done the same thing.  Deputy Spring has outlined to the House where the Opposition have already promised to pick up the tabs for £800 million.</P>

      <P>If anything the Irish Shipping employees were taken advantage of because of their patience and endurance. It may have something to do with their association with the sea.  I have found the same qualities in all fishermen, and I am a fisherman too.  They are looking for a solution and have offered us every help to reach a decision.  I have not taken advantage of their patience.  I have pressed very hard to have this matter attended to.  Admittedly at the beginning we were cut off by the liquidator, the legalities surrounding the liquidation and <Col N="1978" /> by the fact that the Minister could not interfere with the liquidation.  The possibilities of finding a way around the legalities are being examined.  It is usually the Deputies on this side of the House who provide both the Government and the Opposition for most of the Bills introduced here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The people concerned would be quite happy if that problem were addressed and they could get their just entitlements.  At the beginning of this saga, when there was a possibility that the Government would have to pick up the tab, the cost of keeping the company in business was put at £144 million.  A lot of things have happened since then to convince me and others that that no longer applies because of what has happened in the High Court and because of the charter contracts.  A worry was expressed to me by the Department and the Minister that, if they paid Irish Shipping employees redundancy payments or pensions, they might have to pick up the tab for the rest.  That line of argument may now be dispensed with.  There is a document in the Minister's Department which was presented by myself and other Deputies on this side of the House which addressed a lot of the problems and asked for a solution.  We have not had a reply <Col N="1980" /> yet, but I know it is being considered and I am anxious to get a reply.</P>
      <P>The objective is to give redundancy payments to employees whether or not a new shipping company starts up or the people get other jobs.  Hardship has been caused by only paying statutory redundancy payments.  Redundancy money is a pension, it is a lump sum one gets on early retirement.  It is possible to address this problem during this Estimate for that reason.  If the huge sums mentioned at the beginning of the saga are now not due, then the only problem to solve is the redundancy payments.  The employees have only been offered statutory redundancy, which is very small.  It is possible to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to those employees.  In relation to the World War, while it grabs the imagination, the logic of the thing is that if they are entitled to it, so are the other employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other arguments to back that up.  Upon the liquidation of the company the employees lost their livelihood.  Many of them have little hope of re-employment, in some cases because of their age and in others due to a lack of openings in the specialised business Deputy Wilson mentioned.  The shipping industry in Ireland is too small to absorb the sea-going staff.  Most of the ships' officers will have to seek employment abroad.</P>
      <P>It is important to mention that an extra argument for making a just and generous settlement is that those who are successful in getting employment will be employed in companies which will make no arrangements for the payment of pensions or social welfare contributions. Some of them who have managed to get employment are taking a drastic cut in salary to enable them to keep going. Many of them will receive no social welfare benefits from the State in future years.  Although the employees pension funds were secured and properly funded, the demise of the company meant the demise of the pension funds.  Due to this, all have lost out in benefits.  They had to take early retirement or deferred pensions. Benefit at normal pension age will be considerably reduced.  They also lost the life insurance which attached to pension schemes, which many people cannot afford to replace on an individual basis. If there is a moral obligation to look after these few employees there is equally a moral obligation to look after the bulk of the employees.</P>

      <P>In this instance I am not asking the State to expend £200 million, £300 million or £400 million to set up the company again.  I am asking the Minister to give these people their due.  Being the owner, the Minister could do that.  We <Col N="1982" /> have the examples of Verolme and NET who are being heavily subsidised. Because of the small numbers in the fishing industry and because, generally speaking, they are quiet people and not effective lobbyists, they get the wrong end of the stick.  Irish Shipping have got the wrong end of the stick for the same reasons.  They have been lauded over the years as being a very successful company. I should like the Minister to address the problem.  I honestly do not believe that it is not possible to find a way around this problem.</P>

      <P>It is not acceptable to hide behind the corporate veil of the liquidator. Ways around problems are found every day in the courts, in contractual matters, property matters, business matters and planning matters.  They sit down with senior counsel and find ways around the problem.  There is a company 100 yards from the Green with 600 employees.  They spend their time and earn their revenue by advising people with tax problems, money problems, property problems and deals.  This is a normal commercial activity.  We need the will to do what I am suggesting.  We need to accept our obligations.</P>
      <P>I am not disappointed, as Deputy Wilson was, at the short speech made by the Minister.  Ten pages of waffle would achieve nothing.  The Minister's speech opened the way to a search for a solution to the problem.  I want to mention a few matters which I do not think have been addressed by the Department.  The charters were mentioned as a big argument because the figure would amount to hundreds of millions of pounds over a five year period.  The suggestion was that there would be so many claims and so much money would be involved that the State could not look after all the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very few Irish creditors of Irish Shipping.  It is important to mention that charter hire was paid in advance and these owners were not technically <Col N="1983" /> creditors of the company on 14 November 1984.  The court allowed the liquidator to repudiate these owners' contracts and there is serious doubt that they are entitled to claim damages in the liquidation. In that sense it is difficult to see how the Government could expose themselves more than they have already done in respect of these companies by paying compensation to the staff who are <i>de facto</i> and not <i>de jure</i> employees of the State.  There is correspondence in existence between the Minister and the chairman of Irish Shipping to substantiate the fact that these employees were State employees.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>There are precedents which can be looked at.  The Government have already created precedents with regard to redundancy in dealing with problems at NET and Verolme Cork Dockyard.  Moneys were made available to pay for redundancies when already a subvention had been made in one form or another against losses incurred by these companies.  An <i>ex gratia</i> payment made completely without prejudice would not expose the Minister to liability for similar payments to other creditors.  A solution could be found along those lines, or along other lines which I cannot come up with in this case.</P>
    <P>Some groups in the State are very effective at lobbying and other groups are very weak at lobbying.  One example in the bigger sector is the farming sector who are absolutely first class at lobbying. In the motoring sector they are hopeless at lobbying.</P>

We should not take advantage of that, because if we do we will be sending out a message that if people want to get anything done they must come and protest outside Leinster House, cause destruction, harass and annoy people.  This problem should be addressed fully and finally.  If the Government do not agree with me, the arguments should be made properly.  They have not been made properly.  I urge the Minister to consider these points.  I do not know the procedure, and I do not know whether the Minister has the right to reply to a debate on an Estimate.

      <P>I welcome the fact that money is being provided for 23 pensioners or dependants of former employees of Irish Shipping.  While welcoming the money being made available from the State to these people, like others I am disappointed that we could not have gone further.  While not wishing in any way to take from those who have been selected, anyone who was involved at that time was very worthy of consideration, but there are others and there should be some support for them, too.</P>
      <P>In his brief statement presenting the Estimate, the Minister indicated that the extension of the payment to the other pensioners was considered but that due to financial and legal sensitivities it was not possible to make the payment.  One can readily understand the financial sensitivity. Money is in short supply but perhaps when replying the Minister will indicate how much money would have been required to increase the pensions of those other people.  Regarding the legal sensitivities &mdash;&ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; being taken literally rather than in the sense of there being a legal bar &mdash; the fact that the money was available for a certain number of ex-employees and pensioners probably means that the same could have been done for the remainder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1985" /> I agree with those speakers who have indicated how polite and disciplined they have found some of the people concerned. That, too, has been my experience of them.  I recognise that the company and the Government could not have allowed the situation to continue but what has happened since the action was taken has been disappointing.  There has not been a total sense of fair play in respect of the people involved.  There have been difficulties with various groups.  In one instance some of the money due in respect of employment from 1 to 13 November is still outstanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the people concerned have had any response to date.  While I appreciate that both Ministers and liquidators have official functions and that certain legal requirements and technicalities must be considered, a certain compassion or at least dialogue with the various groups is warranted.  So far as I know there has not been any such dialogue or if there has, it has not taken place to a satisfactory degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I await the Minister's reply regarding what would have been involved in extending payment to the non-World War II pensioners.  Perhaps he would reconsider this aspect of the matter. While expressing the hope that even in this situation, the Opposition would have more consideration in regard to the spending of public money, I would urge the Minister to consider the extension of the payment of pensions to these other people.  As a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, I have become aware in the past couple of years that vast sums of money are being spent in the various semi-State areas and it is only fair to say that in many instances the money could have been better spent. However, it will be spent better in the future if we continue to consider the spending of these various bodies.  What we should aim for is the expenditure of less money while continuing to provide <Col N="1986" /> the same level of services and, where possible, improved services.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the matter of the co-op that has been set up by ex-Irish Shipping workers in an effort to stay together and, as a body, to speak for the Irish Shipping people with the prospect of providing services in the future.  Clearly, services will be required in certain areas, regardless of whether these services will involve the employing of a massive fleet.  There will be a need at least for a scaled down fleet.  I understand that in April the co-op submitted some proposals to the Minister regarding particularly the <i>Irish Spruce</i>.  They need an urgent reply, certainly within the next seven to ten days in respect of a possible future chartering agreement.</P>
    <P>I might mention, too, that the <i>Irish Spruce</i> is still in Marseilles at a cost of £15,000 per day, simply to keep her there.</P>

A decision should be reached in this matter of the chartering agreement to allow for the possibility of an agreement being reached before the opportunity is lost.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to bring this request to his Minister and, through him, to the remainder of the Cabinet for an urgent decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust there is some hope yet of making some movement in the area of doing something for the other pensioners, some of whose pensions have been reduced by alarming amounts.  Many of these people have had to change their entire lifestyle because of what has happened.  I welcome what has been done but if there is a will there is possibly a way in which more can be done.  We all appreciate the financial sensitivities involved but there were financial sensitivities, too, in respect of what happened in Verolme and in other areas but some of these difficulties were overcome.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the difficulties he has <Col N="1987" /> faced in the area of financial or legal bars, some of which may not be as big a handicap as might have been thought initially.  I welcome this Supplementary Estimate which will provide for those people who served the country so well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the opportunity to discuss this most important situation.  Other speakers referred to the fact that we are only considering 23 pensioners and their spouses, who had sea-going experience during World War II with Irish Shipping.  I concur with my colleagues on both sides of the House who made a special plea to the Minister and to the Cabinet, because that is where the final decision will rest, to try to consider all the other pensioners who will not be included in this quite restricted category we are discussing this morning.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that we would all like to see those involved in Irish Shipping looked after as best the country possibly can but we must recognise that the Government have no statutory function in this and that there is no obligation on the Government to do what they are doing.  That must be recognised.  We must thank the Minister and the Cabinet for allowing us to look after, at this stage, the World War II pensioners who served the country so well during the Emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a particular interest in this topic because Wexford has a long sea faring tradition going back over the centuries. Before other counties had transport or communication one with the other, Wexford men were playing the sea for years. During the war the country was very dependent on the coastal shipping companies for emergency supplies, pre-Irish Shipping.  One of these companies was the Wexford Steamship Company.  There was also Limerick Steam and what was known as Palgrave-Murphys at the time. Wexford Steamship Company was synonymous with the Staffords of Wexford who are still serving our town and county extremely well to this day.  Old J.J. Stafford, as he was known, subsequently <Col N="1988" /> became Chairman of Irish Shipping during the fifties.  Indeed Wexford has been exporting its expertise in seafaring throughout the world.  John Barry, the founder of the American Navy, was a Wexford man.  J.J. Stafford was called to India for advice when they were forming their merchant fleet many years ago. Every October in Wexford we commenorate the Irish seamen, particularly the Wexford seamen, who lost their lives during World War II at the same time as we commemorate John Barry of Wexford fame.</P>
    <P>We often pay lip service to the strategic importance of a deep water fleet and recently the question of neutrality has been aired in many arenas.  There are many of us who feel that the two issues are tied together and it is questionable if neutrality will continue to be attainable unless we get back to a position of having a deep water fleet and our own merchant fleet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a just a passing reference. In March 1941 Irish Shipping was formed &mdash;&ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; is the expression used by the legal eagles.  To those involved in the company at the time the O'Neill family, the Stafford family and the Chairman of the day Dr. Leyden, the first Chairman, we owe a tremendous debt.  Going through the annals of Irish Shipping over the years, particularly to those involved in World War II, this country is beholden for vital supplies. Many of the boats at the time plied between Dublin and Lisbon and went as far as New Brunswick and Montreal for hard wheat so that we could have proper bread rations during the war.  The Wexford Steamship Company had the <i>Menapia,</i> the <i>Kerlogue</i> and the <i>Eden Vale</i> which became part of Irish Shipping.  The Government bought older boats at the time and farmed them out to the coastal companies.  All of this formed the nucleus of what we knew to be Irish Shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the list of the 23 pensioners that this new subhead will look after, several are <Col N="1989" /> from Wexford.  Unfortunately as far as Wexford is concerned we are talking about the spouses of World War II pensioners. In passing I mention the widow of the late Captain Poole, whose name is synonymous with Irish Shipping, and Mrs. Dillon whose husband was chief purser and who had a tremendous record and service with Irish Shipping over the years.  Names like McCann, Moran, Dillon, Captain James Sydney Kerr, better known in Wexford as EI Cid, are synonymous with seafaring tradition. Other names include Dixon, Roche, McGrath, O'Rourke &mdash; the list is endless. From deck boys to masters, to cooks, to the firemen, Irish Shipping was known as the Wexfordmen's navy in the constituency I come from.  Is it any wonder many of them followed with interest and great sadness the tragedy of the liquidation of Irish Shipping over the last six months?</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has been able to make the pensions to the 23 World War II pensioners and their spouses retrospective.  Other colleagues in the House have indicated the dramatic decrease in the pensions they were presented with.  This debate begs the question about the funding of pension schemes in the country generally.  Private companies have had their difficulties and so have pension funds.  It seems incredible that a semi-State company could be caught in this situation.  I understand they had a few different types of pension schemes but in all cases the provision for an increase was between nil and 3 per cent which did not match inflation or the cost of living.  Those with years of service with Irish Shipping would have had paltry pensions but for the decision by Irish Shipping to top up the pensions from the company itself.  Unfortunately this <i>ex gratia</i> portion of the pension went when Irish Shipping went into liquidation.  This has now been taken up by the Government without any statutory obligation to do so but with a moral obligation particularly to those who served the country during the Emergency.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is very easy for my generation to forget how beholden we are as a nation to these people who, without any <Col N="1990" /> consideration of danger to themselves, plied the waters during the troubles.  My little knowledge on this subject has been gleaned from those who lived through the time and from the hundreds of people in Wexford who recall the stories and involvement of Wexford people and other Irish people with Irish Shipping during the war.  It is often very salient for my generation to listen to these people because for us it is history.  Those of us who were born post-war find it difficult to comprehend what the country went through and we tend to forget that the Government brought back the Irishmen with deep sea experience and service from the British fleet to serve this country during the war.  Many came out of retirement and went back into active service to ensure that we had the supplies virtually necessary at the time.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government have managed to meet their moral obligations to the pensioners.  I concur with my colleagues in urging them to try to find a solution to the problem of the rest of the pensioners and the other employees who have been hard done by in Irish Shipping. We must be honest and accept that there was no statutory obligation on the Government to do so and for that and what they have done in meeting their moral commitment I sincerely thank them and particularly the Minister who took a personal interest in the issue.  We have now opened up a new subhead to allow payments to be made retrospectively to these pensioners.  In a way this is not without precedent in the Vote for the Department of Communications because, to my knowledge, there is a subhead under which we make payments to the dependants of those lost in sea-going services during World War II and those severely injured.  Over 141 Irishmen were lost during World War II.  The <i>Simrick,</i> a schooner from Arklow, was lost plying to Lisbon with nearly all Wexford people on board.  I am grateful that the Government recognise the tremendous debt we owe to all Irishmen and, as far as I am concerned, to Wexford's contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1991" /> Many backbenchers including my colleague, Deputy skelly, referred to the fact that in many debates the Government can provide the Opposition as well as the Government line on many issues. That is extremely healthy.  It is but a reflection of the representative viewpoint and the total spectrum of opinions of the Coalition Government.  I am one of the many backbenchers who pressed the Minister and the Department to look after the pensioners in Irish Shipping and I have here a reply which I received from the Minister dated 13 March in relation to representations on the pensioners, specifically of Irish Shipping:</P>
    <P>Dear Avril,</P>
    <P>I refer further to your letter of 18 February 1985 regarding the position of certain pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited.  Irish Shipping Limited has been paying a number of pensions, either wholly or partly on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  The <i>ex gratia</i> portion of the pension was, of course, unfunded.  It was not paid out of a pension fund and the company were under no obligation to pay it.</P>
    <P>Consequently, arising out of the liquidation of the company, having regard to his legal obligations to the creditors of Irish Shipping Limited, which has insufficient assets to meet its liabilities, the liquidator cannot continue to pay those pensions which were formerly paid by the company on the <i>ex gratia</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Although I have no statutory function in relation to this matter, I will make arrangements, that in the case of those pensioners who had seagoing service during World War II, and their spouses, the <i>ex gratia</i> element of their pensions which they have lost will now be paid by the Exchequer.  Their pensions will, therefore, continue at the previous level.  I am sorry that the financial and other remifications have not allowed me to cover all the pensioners affected.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> While I thank the Minister for allowing us to reach the stage of being in the House today to grant these pensions to this particular category of Irish Shipping ex-employees, I should like him and his Cabinet to consider in detail whether it would be possible to extend their moral &mdash; not their statutory &mdash; obligation to other pensioners and to the other categories of employees in Irish Shipping who have been so drastically affected by the liquidation.</P>
    <P>Employees of Irish Shipping at all levels recognise the Government's obligation in general to the taxpayer and that decisions taken by a triumvirate at the top of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, but I merely made a passing reference to it.  We must make it quite clear that all those involved and the people supporting the case of those who have been adversely affected by decisions, recognise the reality of the situation.  As well as appealing to the Minister and the Government to see if they can extend what we are discussing today, I ask them to give serious consideration to the future and to the provision of a deep water fleet.  This should be considered in line with the discussions on our neutrality, as we cannot be dependent indefinitely on flags of convenience or Liberian registered ships for necessary provisions such as fuel, etc. in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When one considers the manner in which Irish Shipping were sunk by the Government, the statement by the Minister of State is an insult added to injury in that so few pensioners have been granted pensions.  Only 23 pensioners are accounted for and there are many more who, over the years since Irish Shipping began operating, served the country faithfully.  They did us proud throughout the world and made Irish Shipping a profitable company.  These people have been cast aside and ignored <Col N="1993" /> and the Government stand indicted on their treatment of these people.</P>
      <P>By this gesture, the Government are trying to salve their consciences, albeit in a small way and the public will see this exercise for what it is.  In the last few days the <i>Irish Rowan</i> was sold for a miserly sum.  If the Government had conducted their business properly, the sale of this ship could have meant the provision of pensions for those who are not included in the vote.</P>
      <P>A serious aspect of the Government's treatment of the pensioners is that it will show our young people that there is no hope for the future.  It is very disheartening for them to see the pensioners of Irish Shipping treated in such a dastardly way. I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider extending the pension rights to other pensioners who are in a bad way financially.  I should like him to consider the future of a deep water fleet.  As many Members said, we are at the mercy of mercenary forces on the high seas. Although I welcome this measure, it does not go far enough and I appeal to the Minister once more to extend the rights to other pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle, in her highly articulate way, laid the foundation for my brief comments on the supplementary Estimate introduced here this morning.  She stated, in historic and national terms, what we owe to Irish Shipping and the incredible importance of their part in the sheer survival of this nation.  The dedication of some staff led to the sacrifice of their lives on our behalf. Everybody connected with Irish Shipping &mdash; not just those on the high seas &mdash; had an abiding sense of loyalty, an incredibly high level of dedication and a sense of being part of a State and a national company. They had an exemplary work ethic and that is what we mean when we refer to Irish Shipping employees, who are without pension and employment far earlier than they thought.  To give an idea of the sense of uniqueness and loyalty within the company, over 35 per cent of the staff of Irish Shipping were working there for over 30 years.  This must be a <Col N="1994" /> singular achievement in regard to companies, staff and long lasting jobs within the State.</P>
      <P>We are not just considering the financial deprivation, hardship and shock suffered by the employees of Irish Shipping; we are also talking about the psychological effect; which is very marked.  These employees had a sense of unity and dedication down the years that gave them a sense of security, a sense of family.  When considering pension and redundancy rights for these employees it is very important that we do not understimate the psychological shock and sense of personal let-down these employees have suffered.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate, which hopfully will allow further expansion.  We are recognising pensioners who were serving Irish Shipping during the Second World War, but I would like this list to be extended to include people who have given many years of loyal service, sometimes more than 40 years, providing very necessary back-up services.  I have heard of one woman who worked in that office for over 40 years and finds herself on a pension as low as £14 a week.  She has been forced to seek cheaper, less comfortable accommodation at this hour of her life, she is in her seventies.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, due to the financial and legal sensitivities involved, it had not been found possible to consider extending the concession to all pensioners of the company.  Other Deputies have spoken about the financial and legal sensitivities involved and we all hope that a new look will be taken at this.  But the Cabinet should look at other areas too. As a caring Government we must look at the financial, physical, and psychological hardship suffered by the pensioners of Irish Shipping and recognise that we have a moral responsibility to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many Deputies have said, we must also recognise the painful circumstances these people find themselves in through no fault of their own.  In the days of the company's working life there was never a more loyal, dedicated expert group of <Col N="1995" /> people than those working for Irish Shipping. Since the tragedy of the liquidation there has not been a more responsible, mature, wise and disciplined group than these employees, who are trying to achieve a certain modicum of their pension rights, particularly for their older workers and hopefully job opportunities in a rescaled and re-established shipping line.</P>
    <P>As public representatives, we know the families of these workers and the hardships they are suffering.  It is up to us to bring these matters to the attention of the House and to make the Government more aware of the position.  These very hardworking people have found themselves at this incredible disadvantage through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>If we are to be seen as valuing the loyal service given to this country by people in the State or semi-State areas, then the Government must recognise they have a responsibility to respond to the hardship suffered by these people and not leave them adrift on a very cruel sea.  The least we can do is to give them the protection of decent pensions.  As Deputy Doyle said, this is a subject which, hopefully, we can discuss in the not too distant future so that we can provide this protection for all working people.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister and the liquidator had to look at the fact that these pensions were being topped up; but we, as legislators, have to ask ourselves if we can allow long-serving hard-working people to rely on pension schemes which are so inadequate that they have to be topped up and that when a crisis erupts that topping up is taken from them.  This topping up is needed to help these people to survive.  If we are to be seen as valuing our workers and encouraging the work ethic, that is one of the first areas on which we will have to concentrate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly put forward a series of options which, hopefully, the Minister and Cabinet might consider.  I would welcome an early response from the Minister, perhaps even today.  As Deputy Skelly said, crisis situations and emergency situations are constantly changing, both financially and socially.  These <Col N="1996" /> demand negotiations, consultations and changed structures so that bridges can be built.</P>
    <P>I am asking this morning that structures, which in the past would not have allowed consideration of what we are putting forward this morning, be re-examined. I wish and hope that all the pensioners may be included in an expanded Supplementary Estimate and that redundancy payments be accepted as a type of pension.  When a work life is cut off earlier than wished, redundancy should be seen as a pension to which these people are entitled.  I support completely what other Deputies have said about a re-examination of the matter to allow decent, honourable redundancy payments to be given in recognition of the cutting short of working lives.</P>
    <P>I hope that future Cabinet decisions will take into account what has been said in this debate.  I also hope that the employees of Irish Shipping who have formed themselves into a co-operative will be allowed once more to use their responsibility, maturity and expertise in setting up a national shipping line here, giving them the satisfaction, not just personal but on a national level, of putting their talents to good use for the country. This would allow Ireland as a nation to retain its independence and neutrality. A re-established, modified, practical and profitable shipping line would go very far towards enabling us to retain the needed independence and neutrality that we have striven after and wish to continue.  The employees of Irish Shipping are an absolute example of what we are talking about when we speak of what we want &mdash; a national society and an independent nation for the future.</P>

      <P>I join with some of my colleagues in welcoming the fact that the Government have made some moves in the direction of meeting the needs of some of the pensioners in this case.  I also join with Members on all sides of the House who have expressed the view that perhaps we have not gone quite far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech this morning <Col N="1997" /> raises a number of questions and I would be grateful if he would elaborate a little on some of the points which I think are, by implication, unanswered.  I am struck by the fact that the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Act of 1984 provided that the Minister's approval would be required from then on for any alteration in the existing pension arrangements and that he was not, in fact, called upon to exercise that power in regard to this pension scheme.  Could the Minister give the House some indication as to the regulatory mechanisms, if any, which operate in his Department with regard to Irish Shipping?</P>
    <P>We are talking here about a company which was owned, in effect, by the State. That poses obligations of a statutory nature and also undoubtedly of a moral nature.  That commitment, above and beyond the statutory, is one which has been regularly met by the State in certain specific cases, either of individual employees &mdash; we have had examples of that which we could go into &mdash; or in relation to companies which, in the judgment of the administration of the day, needed supports and a treatment above and beyond the statutory, minimal norm. I submit that this is a case similar to those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the burden of what I intend to say.  Would the Minister be good enough to explain how it is that increasingly there is a succession of instances such as this one where the State is perceived to have some kind of overriding regulatory function which is seen in due course not to operate, or not to operate efficiently.  When the final day of judgement of the company or institution comes about it is discovered that the particular controls that one assumed were in place were not operating in such a way as to ensure that the company's interests, and particularly those of the taxpayer, were being adequately safeguarded.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is very skillfully getting into the failure of a Department of the Government to monitor a company and to prevent such a thing.  That is getting into a discussion on the operation of the company, which is more for the Estimate and is certainly ruled out by Standing Order 124.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister this morning said:</P>
      <P>So far as the Department understand the matter, the <i>ex-gratia</i> retirement payments made by the company arose mainly from limitations in the pension fund provisions in regard to adjusting pension amounts to cost of living increases.  The company evidently decided to make these <i>ex-gratia</i> payments as a way of topping up the pensions in question.  In addition, some <i>exgratia</i> payments were made to retired employees who were not in pension schemes.  The level of these <i>ex-gratia</i> payments was a matter for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> To what extent was that situation generally known to those whose job I would have presumed it would have been to keep an eye on these things?  Leaving aside for a moment any dissatisfaction that anyone might have about what I might call arbitrary topping up of pensions, there is a case to be made that the scrutinies that should apply may not have applied.  What I really want to know in this case is whether this House feels that there is at least a strong case to be made for saying that if we have agreed, or are proposing to agree, to assist 23 particular pensioners because of the fact that they were in receipt of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments, out of the goodness, not of hearts of the executive of the company but out of the hearts of the taxpayers, is there not a case similarly to be made for those who are also in extremely worthy service in the national interest in that company but who might not have the area of adventure or glamour which that particular group of people had?  This is without any question of denying for a moment that they were engaged in extraordinary important national service.  However, national service can also be service in the accounts office, behind a typewriter, or as a filing clerk.  I would certainly be unhappy about defining one group of employees as being innately superior to another while all of them were engaged in serving the State and serving a company, the shares of which were wholly owned by the State.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, were I working in that company, I would have assumed that ownership was in some way a safeguard above and beyond the mere minimal norm that would apply under the law.  We should consider that.  If we are going to insist that the minimal is appropriate here, then we must explain how the State acted in other instances of a not dissimilar nature.  In that connection I mention Verolme dockyard, NET and our readiness to respond recently because of the implicit threat to our banking institutions. In the case of Irish Shipping we must have compassion for people who have been deprived of their livelihood through no fault of their own.  These <Col N="2000" /> people were in a position where they could reasonably have expected the State to be aware of what was going on.  This is not just another company liquidation and we have to see it in a different light from the normal liquidation process.  In my view here we have a question of public accountability.  Obviously it is not appropriate to go into it now but it must be considered in any discussion on this issue. Ultimately somebody should be held accountable above and beyond the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the salaries and conditions of employment of the people in Irish Shipping were monitored and controlled by the Department of the Public Service.  Surely that enforcement of authority has its concomitant responsibility?  It is reasonable for an employee to expect that if his conditions of employment are circumscribed by a Department that Department thereby accept a modicum of responsibility with regard to his employment.  The Government held all the shares in the company. In companies where they held minority shares they went beyond what they propose to do in the case of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>It would be a reasonable interpretation, though perhaps not a correct legal one, that the employees of Irish Shipping were employed <i>de facto</i> by the State by virtue of the State's ownership of the company.  Regardless of how pivotal we may see a group of employees in terms of their economic impact, their political relevance or their essential role in society, we should be very wary of running the risk of leaving ourselves open to being accused of not giving fair and just treatment on the pretext that we have given them the minimal requirements. This is especially the case in this company, where the problems that were created had nothing to do with the employees on the ground.</P>
    <P>We should remember that we are not talking about lay-off or rationalisation measures or the nice euphemisms that we sometimes use for the streamlining or redeployment of staff.  In this case we are talking of people losing their livelihoods, <Col N="2001" /> many of whom have no chance of re-employment because of their long service with Irish Shipping.  In such a specialised area of commerce and industry there is little likelihood of their getting employment again.  In the case of sea-going staff, because of the size of the State's involvement in this part of the industry all of those people cannot be absorbed.  If these people are lucky they will have to take employment on foreign ships.  Other staff will have to make do with unemployment help.  In one fell swoop many of these people have been removed from what they thought was secure employment and now they find themselves unemployed and probably unemployable.</P>
    <P>The demise of the pension funds which this Estimate is designed to meet in part needs detailed examination.  As Deputy Barnes was hinting we should ensure that there will be a proper scrutiny of similar situations in other State and semi-State agencies.  I am aware that the under-funding of pension funds is not uncommon. However, if there is such under-funding allied to questionable management operations and concern by employees, as happened in this case that all is not well that situation must be considered seriously.  At the very least we should make sure that this kind of unfortunate occurrence does not repeat itself in other companies.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister with regard to the statutory redundancy.  That cannot be considered adequate compensation. There is an obligation on us beyond that. While I admit that the Minister has gone beyond the minimal requirements in relation to the 23 employees, the question of moral obligation arises.  I realise it is difficult to define moral obligation, but on a common understanding of those words it is my view that we have such an obligation in this case.  To be truthful, the treatment of employees is in contrast to the treatment given to senior executives in the company where above and beyond the minimum requirement was paid out of public funds.  I will say no more about it other than to say that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. I cannot see any reason why somebody is <Col N="2002" /> deemed automatically to be entitled to less generous treatment merely because of his position in the company.  In any case Irish Shipping employees consider they are morally entitled to the same treatment as that given to those who were senior in the company, and I cannot blame them for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that the question of making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to all pensioners in the company was considered by the Government but he said that due to financial and legal sensitivities involved it was not found possible to do this however much the Government would have liked.  This appears to me that the Government would have liked to do something in this matter if that were possible.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on these financial and legal sensitivities.  I presume the financial sensitivity is that there is not enough money but that is a question of priorities.  I am not clear about the legal sensitivies.  If there is some problem over the legality of making a pension, an <i>ex gratia</i> payment or a lump sum to an employee instead of the pension entitlement he could have expected, it appears that reservation has to be entered into across-the-board in relation to all employees different in that respect?  If the legal and financial sensitivities to which the Minister referred could be clarified, then perhaps the door might be open so that something might be done for the employees whom all sides of the House agree have been treated in a tragic fashion in this whole mess.</P>
    <P>I want to sum up by saying that obviously it is easy for a Deputy to get up here and ask for an open cheque book approach to any problem that arises in our economy, particularly in regard to major companies.  It is politic to do it.  It is the easy thing to do.  In recent times it has not that often been done.  We have not seen many people respond in this way to this kind of situation.  I have to say that there is a perception among the public that in this case the pensioners have been hard done by.  It is no solace or no persuasive evidence to say to members of the <Col N="2003" /> public: &ldquo;Well, the reason those chaps had those pensions was because of the fact that the company paid a sum over and above that to which they were entitled. Therefore the liquidator cannot pay them any money.  It is all technically wrapped up.&rdquo;  The reality is that people used to an income suddenly find they do not have it. They have mouths to feed, and all of the normal obligations everybody has, with no means out of which to pay.  If this was a private company this debate would not be taking place.  It would be another tragic statistic on the economic landscape. But the basis of my argument is that this was not a private company.  This was a company which had the full aura of State ownership, thereby invoking the full aura of State responsibility.</P>
    <P>I feel we should look at this again and in so far as it is possible, allowing for the fact that money was never so scarce, grant some measure of consideration and compensation to the other pensioners in this company.  Whether it be done by a once-off payment, some form of redundancy sum, or some form of very small pension, I do not know.  I have to say that I cannot see how the State could fund indefinitely pensions of groups of people some of whom would have yet to come on pension.  But some modicum of consideration should apply to those people now bereft of employment, of employment opportunities and even hope of such opportunities.  I would appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to the plight of those people, ascertaining to what extent the State can meet, as it has done on other occasions, their specific needs, the depth of which nobody in this House seriously questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate on the basis that it gives rightful recognition to the efforts and the service of those who served Irish Shipping throughout the world over a long number of years, particularly during the war years, when they risked life and limb to serve the company and their country in order to ensure the availability of <Col N="2004" /> basic supplies of food and materials to this country.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am a little saddened that it has not yet been found possible to extend the facilities proposed in this Estimate to a number of other employees of Irish Shipping, including pensioners, who are somewhat hard done by.  I am not suggesting that the State should pick up the tab on every occasion a company goes to the wall or on every occasion when there is mismanagement resulting in people being hurt financially. Nonetheless it is a reflection on the management of pension funds and their security that it has been found necessary for the Minister &mdash; laudable though it is &mdash; to introduce this Supplementary Estimate at this time.  A great deal of hard examination needs to be undertaken in relation to the pension funds of all companies, semi-State, State and of a private nature.  Although mine is not a maritime constituency I have had some experience of difficulties arising there of a similar nature.  While appreciating that the Minister had no statutory function or responsibility whatsoever, no reason other than a moral or compassionate one, to introduce this Estimate, I welcome it on the basis that the need was there and represents a recognition of the plight of the people whom it proposes to assist.</P>
      <P>Throughout the whole of the debate on Irish Shipping Opposition speakers have been highly critical of the Government's handling of this Estimate and the whole affair relating to Irish Shipping. I do not want to do other than make a passing reference to that.  But we must treat with a certain amount of scepticism the howls of indignation that have emanated from across the floor on the basis that, if one is to believe what is said on that side of the House, we can expect to have a re-introduction of Irish Shipping at a later date or the reproduction of a slimmed down version of Irish Shipping.</P>

      <P>It seems incongruous that this concern that has emanated from across the floor should not have indicated also, along with the proposed slimmed down version of Irish Shipping, perhaps a slimmed down version of the taxpayer who ultimately would have to carry the burden for this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all of that, I welcome this Estimate.  Bearing in mind the financial constraints within which all Departments must operate, I would ask the Minister if he can find some means in his Department of perhaps extending assistance to a number of those other employees who are similarly affected as the group this Estimate now proposes to assist and who are in as great a need and have given sterling service to their company.  I would ask the Minister to consider their plight and ascertain whether he can give them some assistance. I say that without giving a blank cheque to anybody to pick up the tab in similar cases.</P>
      <P>It is high time that a very careful examination was undertaken of all pension funds.  It is unfortunate that employees, whether at senior, middle management, administrative level or whatever, should become the unwitting victims of mismanagement or changes of circumstances entirely outside their control and that they should have to suffer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention shall be brief in the extreme.  It is very clear from the speeches this morning that the plight of the employees and the pensioners of Irish Shipping is one which causes great concern across party lines in all parts of this House.  In the Fine Gael Party over the past number of months a large number of us backbenchers have been meeting on a fairly regular basis <Col N="2006" /> with former employees of Irish Shipping. In my time in politics no group of people has impressed me more than these.  To a man, to a woman, they have been people of quality, dignity and commitment. They have been public servants in the finest and fullest sense of that term. These are people who gave of their best to a public company and who were in no way responsible for what happened.  The failure of Irish Shipping, for which these people are carrying the can, owed much to the inadequate and outdated mechanism by which the affairs of public companies with large investment of public money or semi-State bodies were conducted.</P>
      <P>I, like other speakers this morning, will want to know what changes have been made in the various Government Departments to see that something like this can never happen again and that there is proper monitoring of public money invested in this way.  Like Deputy Keating, I believe that this is a question of public accountability; but it is also a case where public accountability has not been seen to operate as fully or as openly as everybody in this House and the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The case which I support today has been made this morning eloquently and in a reasoned, researched way by Deputies Skelly, Doyle and Barnes.  In particular I have no intention of being repetitious, as there are other speakers who want to come in.  The only thing I want to say is that I fully support the case that has been made by them with such strength this <Col N="2007" /> morning.  Their case is a just one and I urge the Government to look again to see what can be done, to see if the whole question can be re-examined.

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I would like to comment on a few points made by the Minister and to add a few thoughts of my own without being too repetitious in relation to what has already been said.  It is a fact that the Minister has no function in the pension schemes of Irish Shipping. It is equally clear that those pensions were grossly underfunded and topped up out of current expenditure.  It is also selfevident that a liquidator has no current revenue and, therefore, cannot continue to top up such pensions despite the fact that everyone would like him to do so.</P>
      <P>That is the crux of the matter for the Minister, but it is also the crux of what is a horrific financial tragedy for the people involved.  I am speaking about pensioners who have given a lifetime of service to the country.  In February the Minister stated that he was seeking alleviation for the pensioners who had wartime service on Irish ships.  This alleviation is being provided for in the Supplementary Estimate we are considering today.  I was rather curious about how he was able to single out any group of people, even the most meritorious.  I gather there is some clear precedent for treating people who served in the Second World War and to that extent the question of fraudulent preference does not arise.  I would like to mention that matter again later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is not really about people who served on Irish ships during the war because everybody wants to see that they are protected to the maximum degree possible.  It is about the question of the others.  I feel that three groups of people are suffering grave hardship.  First of all, there are all of the other pensioners who are not covered by this Supplementary Estimate; secondly, there are all the future pensions of those who would have retired after the date of liquidation and <Col N="2008" /> away into the future; and, thirdly, there is the question of redundancy, which is strictly not pension but is related.  This is something which many of us on all sides of the House have been searching our hearts about.  What are the obligations of the State here?  We are not talking about the strict legal obligation of the State; that is probably no obligation.  The question of moral obligation raises its head, as it so often does &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; in matters affecting politics and Government. Most of the speakers this morning believe that in varying degrees there is a moral obligation on the State, and I agree with them.</P>
    <P>We are then left with trying to define what that is and why.  Irrespective of how we try to describe Irish Shipping, there is no doubt in my mind that anybody working for Irish Shipping never felt he was working for the private sector or never felt he was working for a private company where his conditions of employment were in doubt.  That is one of the advantages of working in some Staterelated organisation.  While it does not appear to place a legal obligation on the State, it most certainly places a moral obligation on it.  The State by its actions, on foot of moral obligations of one kind or another, has certainly responded positively to similar types of situations in the past.  They are not identical situations but they are similar enough to create some kind of moral precedent in my mind.  I believe the State under those two headings has a moral obligation above and beyond what we are talking about in this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is easy to say that, but the question arises as to how far one can go with that.  In this instance, apart from the financial constraints which exist more now than at many times in the past, there are also some formidable legal constraints. The total amount of money involved to top up the unfunded portion of all the existing pensioners' pensions providing for all future pension obligations, which would have arisen if the company had not gone out of business, plus giving enhanced redundancy repayments, would probably make up a figure <Col N="2009" /> which in all fairness the Government do not have nor could easily justify.  Therefore, the question of how far one can go, and with what groups, would undoubtedly arise.</P>
    <P>That, of course, raises the issue of fraudulent preference, of making choices between people.  I would not like to say how that can be done except that I feel it has to be done.  My sympathy would lie primarily with the people who have been pensioners for some time.  They should be given preference.  I am referring to all the pensioners, apart from those being provided for in the Estimate.  They would be my first priority but not the only one.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the legal problem of creating preferential creditors. In discussions I have had, in the company of a number of Deputies, with representatives of the staff of Irish Shipping they have argued against this.  When we discussed this with the Minister he told us that he had received strong advice about the dangers associated with creating preferential creditors.  He cannot ignore that advice.  There are also the questions of precedent created and knock-on effects.  It is not fair to say to the people who are suffering grave hardship that this is a simple matter of the Government picking up the tab.  It is a very difficult matter.  I suspect that the sum of money is hardly capable of calculation at this point but it is bound to be a large amount.  I am sure there are formidable legal constraints and questions of precedents.</P>
    <P>One practical thing the Government could do in relation to those people who have been put out of work and who are well capable of working is to tackle energetically the question of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and re-employing as many former employees of Irish Shipping as possible. That may not be an issue for today but it is a related matter.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day political action in a democracy is, amongst other things, about blending <Col N="2010" /> legal and moral considerations in an equitable and balanced manner.  That is what I ask the Minister, and the Government, to look at again.  They face serious financial difficulties in relation to this matter at a time when the country is grossly overtaxed and grossly overborrowed. They also face difficult issues of precedent which would be created, knock-on effects and legal problems. However, the present limited action, welcome as it is, does not get the balance right.  I appeal to the Government to look at this matter again.  They may be doing that.  The Minister who met concerned Deputies from all sides of the House, has not come back with a response to some of the questions we put to him.  I hope that he, and the Government, will address the question of the other former employees and pensioners of Irish Shipping in a way that will strike this balance between moral and legal considerations, between financial constraints and compassion, and come up with a package which will significantly add to the welcome Estimate we are considering today.</P>

      <P>Since the sad news of Irish Shipping going into liquidation I have had but one letter on the issue from a constituent of mine.  I am not rising to represent the number of people in my constituency that have suffered &mdash; there may be others that I am unaware of &mdash; but I am doing so partly as a member of the Federated Workers Union of Ireland of which many of the employees of Irish Shipping are members.  I realise that the State did not have any option but to put Irish Shipping into liquidation because of the financial liabilities our taxpayers would have had to face if the company continued in existence.  However, I am very unhappy at the way the workers in Irish Shipping were treated.  I look upon the Estimate as a gesture to a small number of the former staff of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years a lot of the closures in industry here have been brought about by a desire by many people in those industries to bring the concern to its knees <Col N="2011" /> and close it down because of the attractiveness of the redundancy packages on offer.  Irish Shipping was a different type of company.  Up to 1982 it was a successful concern and record profits were recorded in that year.  The company was brought to its knees by a small number of people making vital decisions at an important time in the history of the company. I have had a number of facts put before me by a correspondent in Cork concerning the company and I am sure they were put before the House today. The clerical sea-going staff did not have any participation in the vital decisions made that led to the closure of the company. In its 40 years of existence the company never faced a strike.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a number of people in the company worked long and hard hours above and beyond the duties required of them to keep the concern going.  I am aware of the role the company played during the Emergency.  I have been informed that 39 per cent of the shore staff have more than 30 years service with the company.  Those people were dismissed by the provisional liquidator on 16 November last and were not paid for 13 days of that month.  The last speaker mentioned the liabilities and duties of a Government to make decisions and, like him, I believe there is a moral obligation on the State to cater for the workers of Irish Shipping.  They have suffered grievously for the decisions made by a few people.  Governments are elected to legislate for the good of the people who elect them.  It is a major scandal that a few people could make decisions affecting so many people but not be held accountable. In fact, the opposite is the case in one instance.</P>
    <P>The Government have a difficult task in trying to compensate people adequately for their long and faithful service with a company that went to the wall through no fault of theirs.  Any legal arguments that have been brought forward must not be allowed stand in the way of paying compensation to these people.  In early March I wrote to the Minister asking him to set up a public <Col N="2012" /> inquiry into the factors that brought about the closure of Irish Shipping.  In the course of his reply on 28 March the Minister said that the position was that Irish Shipping Limited was in the hands of a liquidator.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to this debate. The main point of criticism has been that not all of those who have lost <i>ex gratia</i> retirement payments will have them restored under the arrangements for which this Supplementary Estimate provides. As I mentioned in my opening statement, the possibility of providing for all pensioners was considered but because of the legal and financial implications it was not found possible to do so. What is being arranged is that a clearly defined category of pensioners and dependants, who are distinguished in a very special way by service to the nation during war-time, are having restored to them payments of which they were deprived on the collapse of the company.  I might mention that there is perhaps a useful parallel in the long-standing provision in the vote of the Department of Communications for the payment of pension and allowances to Irish seamen supplying this country with essentials, who were injured at sea during World War II and to depandants of Irish seamen who lost their lives at sea in that period.  The alternatives, I might remind Deputies, were not to take any action at all in the matter, which not many Deputies would be keen to defend, or to risk overstepping the limits of prudence in a manner which might possibly have unfortunate consequences for the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked by Deputy Ahern, Deputy Cosgrave and a number of others if I could quantify the total amounts that would be involved in giving the <i>ex gratia</i> element to all the pensioners.  Unfortunately because of all the on-going factors relating to how long the pensions would last and other variations it is not possible to give that assessment.  More important is the precedent and the implications this might have in a variety of areas.  I am sure that on reflection Deputies will agree that the Government has taken a prudent <Col N="2014" /> and compassionate step to deal with a most unfortunate problem.</P>
    <P>Many other points were raised by Deputies not all of which had much to do with the immediate purpose for which I introduced the Supplementary Estimate. I do not propose to go back over the whole story of Irish Shipping's collapse, which was dealt with fully and in detail by the Minister for Communications in this House last November.  Irish Shipping Limited is now in the hands of a liquidator who has been appointed by the High Court.  The Government has, therefore, no longer any function in relation to the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned that we were inclined to hide behind the skirts of the liquidator and Deputy Skelly said that we were hiding behind the corporate veil of the liquidator.  It would be quite improper for me to discuss any aspect of the liquidation process and I am not about to do so.  Both Deputy Wilson and Deputy Skelly said that there should be provision in this Estimate for redundancy payments.  That point was made perhaps with a view to bringing the question of discussing redundancy payments within the strict rules laid down by the Ceann Comhairle at the outset.  The question of redundancy payments for former employees of Irish Shipping is one for the liquidator to be dealt with under the terms of the Redundancy Acts.  There are no funds available from which compensation payments other than statutory redundancy entitlements can be made. The position of the former Irish Shipping Limited employees is no different from that of other workers who find themselves redundant in similar circumstances.  It is a most tragic consequence of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited that the employees and their families are innocent victims of the situation.</P>

      <P>A matter mentioned earlier by Deputy Coveney, in relation to preferences comes into being, so a totally different situation arose there. Deputy Wilson also raised the question of payment to the group chairman.  I should like to make it clear that there was no question of a preference payment to the late group chairman of Irish Shipping Limited in relation to the liquidation of the company.  When the group chairman resigned at my request, the board of the company proposed payment to him of a lump sum in lieu of salary up to June 1986 when his term of office would have normally terminated.  Following careful consideration of all the legal and other factors involved, the Government accepted that the proposal advanced by the board had fewer drawbacks for the company than all others; consequently, that proposal was approved in August 1984.  The decision to ask the High Court to appoint a provisional liquidator to Irish Shipping Limited was not taken until 14 November 1984.  Deputy Allen just now and Deputy Wilson earlier and a number of other Deputies mentioned the question of the payment of wages due to the employees of Irish Shipping for a two or three weeks period.  The payment of the wages is a matter for the liquidator.  The employees are preferential creditors of the company and in the event of the wages remaining unpaid would have first call on the assets of the company.</P>
      <P>Passing references were made to the question of a strategic fleet and the possibility of employment in that respect.  The Minister referred in considerable detail to that in November and indicated that the Government had given careful consideration to the question of a strategic fleet and was satisfied that the winding up of Irish Shipping Limited was not a cause for concern in terms of our current strategic needs.  However, the Minister has recently initiated a review of maritime transport policy.  This is now under way in the Department of Communications and will address the question of a strategic fleet among other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating mentioned the question of the inadequacy of pension funds. <Col N="2016" /> As far as Irish Shipping Limited are concerned the Minister has not a statutory function in relation to pensions.  These are being administered by trustees of the company.  The statutory power given to the Minister in the 1984 Act was not exercised as the company did not approach the Minister with any proposals which would require him to exercise these powers.  This was a new power which was brought in, Deputies will recall, in the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>As I said, the question of dealing with all the pensioners was considered.  That was the source of the main criticism during the course of this debate.  The implications of doing so are obviously wider in terms of setting a precedent than if a clearly defined, identifiable and particularly deserving group of people are covered and it was considered that the implications were such that the State would not be justified in taking the risk involved.  I join in all the various tributes which were paid during the course of the debate to the excellent staff who unfortunately, as many people have said, were caught up in this tragedy.  It is not only a great tragedy for Irish Shipping but also a great financial tragedy for many people.</P>
    <P>This measure provides for the alleviation of a special group admittedly.  Very serious consideration was given to the possibility of providing for all the pensioners. Financial implications and various legal implications were weighed up and it was not found possible to do so. Having listened to the contributions from all sides of the House I understand the great depth of feeling in those contributions. Many Deputies have personal knowledge of the situation and many of their contributions were based on meetings with people who have become redundant and have been victims of this tragedy.  I appreciate the concern expressed that this should be a wider measure than it is.  All I can say is that the Minister was deeply involved and took a great personal interest in this.  We have gone as far as it is possible to go.</P>

A strategic fleet would cost that multiplied by five, £12½ million or dollars, and there would be no need for pensions, redundancy payments or anything else. Would the Minister consider that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are generally technical.  I imagine that most of the provisions will hold little interest for those not directly involved.  However, the aim underlying the Bill is of general interest. That aim is the simplification and streamlining of procedures in the District Court in a number of respects, of which the most important relate to a new procedure for the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences.  In regard to this new procedure <Col N="2018" /> it is important to ensure &mdash; and the proposals in the Bill take this into account &mdash; that no person's rights are infringed, that a full and proper hearing is accorded in every case where necessary and that no injustice is effected by the modification of existing procedures.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate the introduction of revised comprehensive Rules for the District Court that have been in preparation for some time but whose promulgation must be preceded by the changes in the law that the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>It may be that, in the light of what I have just said, Deputies may want to come forward with suggestions for more simplification and improvement in District Court procedures than is catered for in this Bill.  I would say two things in that regard; first, that if we are to wait until we can update everything, we may end up producing nothing; second, that the Bill is framed in the light of the proposed new District Court Rules that I have mentioned &mdash; many of which will themselves further improve other District Court procedures, though without the need for statutory changes as a preliminary &mdash; and that it would be better to await the promulgation of the new rules, to see how the District Court operates in the light of all those changes and then to think again about further changes.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the text of the Bill. Having regard to the technical nature of a number of the proposals and to the fact that the purpose of any particular proposal may not be readily evident from a reading of the Bill itself, I believe that this explanatory memorandum will prove particularly useful.  Since the Bill and the explanatory memorandum, taken together, make it reasonably clear what is being proposed, and why, I think I need not here discuss the proposals in detail.  I propose to confine the burden of my remarks to one or two matters of particular interest.</P>
    <P>The main change that would be brought about by section 1 of the Bill is that, where enforcement of a judgment debt is being sought, a single sitting of <Col N="2019" /> the District Court will normally suffice to settle the matter: the preliminary hearing to order lodgment by the debtor of a statement of his means and to order his attendance for an examination as to his means is being eliminated.  Elimination of that preliminary hearing will work no injustice against the alleged debtor since, under the law as it stands, he does not in any event appear and is not represented at that hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides a new scale in relation to the periods of imprisonment that may be imposed, on summary conviction, in default of payment of a fine and any associated costs, compensation, or expenses.  It reduces the present maximum period of one year to 90 days and makes reductions of much the same order at other levels of the scale.  While the reductions appear to be sweeping, I should say that the scale that is being replaced is for the most part contained in a statute of 1851 whose relevant provisions have little bearing on the circumstances, outlook and practice of the present day.  In setting this proposed new scale, I have been concerned to see to it that the District Court remains in possession of a sanction adequate to ensure that fines will be paid.  Revenue offences as such, that is, revenue cases apart from ordinary motor taxation cases, will continue to carry their own penalties.  I may remark in passing that the machinery for collecting fines is being separately studied: that question is not one that concerns us here.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 3 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940 that is proposed in subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill is consequential on the proposals in section 1 of the Bill.  The other changes in the Act of 1940 that are proposed in section 3 represent improvements in that Act with which I think members of the House will agree.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the most important feature of the Bill is the proposed new procedure for renewing intoxicating liquor licences.  At present, an applicant <Col N="2020" /> for a renewal must obtain a court certificate before the licence is renewed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Now, in accordance with a recommendation made by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and the District Court Rules Committee, I am proposing in section 4 that intoxicating liquor licences may, except in certain exceptional cases, be renewed annually by the Revenue Commissioners without the production of a certificate of the District Court.  The main exception will be where objection to the renewal has been lodged with the court.  The other exceptions will be: first, where there has been structural alteration of the premises concerned; secondly, in certain cases where the licence has expired and application for renewal is made within one year after expiry by a person other than the holder of the licence; and, lastly, where any change is proposed in the nature of the licence or in the conditions attaching to it.  Where one or more of these exceptions apply, an applicant will still have to obtain a court certificate, as heretofore, as a prerequisite to renewal of a licence by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (11) places the onus on the applicant for renewal of a licence to inform the Revenue Commissioners if there has been any structural alteration of the premises concerned since the licence was either granted or last renewed.  It will also be up to the applicant to inform the Commissioners of several other specified matters, where applicable, such as whether any change is proposed in the nature of the licence.  Failure to comply with the provisions of section 4 (11) could result in the court ordering the forfeiture of the licence.  It will of course be the function of the court in every case to decide whether there has, in fact, been a failure to comply.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that removal of the need to get a court certificate for most renewals will make it easier to renew a licence.  It will amount to automatic renewal in all but a few cases.  The safeguards I have mentioned will ensure that there will be no weakening in the control of liquor licences.  In addition, to guard <Col N="2021" /> against the new streamlined procedure being used to gain a renewal fraudulently, I have provided for a fine of up to £300 for anyone found guilty of obtaining a licence on the basis of giving false or misleading information to the Revenue Commissioners.  Anyone convicted of such an offence may have his licence forfeited by the District Court.</P>
    <P>The amendments and repeals of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts proposed in the Schedules are either consequential on the provisions in section 4 or are changes of a procedural nature being made in the light of recommendations of the District Court Rules Committee.  One significant change proposed in the First Schedule is the amendment of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 which will ensure that all club certificates will be renewable on a common date, in practice the date of the annual licensing District Court.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 4 perhaps I should make it clear that the section represents no change in principle in the procedure involved in the renewal of liquor licences. As I have said, a court certificate is required in every case before a liquor licence can be renewed.  In the majority of cases there is no objection and the court certificate issues accordingly.  So far as licensees are concerned the new procedure simply means they can apply directly to the Revenue Commissioners for renewal of the licence and a court certificate will be required only in the cases mentioned in subsection (5) of section 4.  These cases represent a very small proportion of the overall cases.  Subsections (10) and (11) outline particulars which must be furnished by the licensee in applying to the Revenue Commissioners for a renewal of his licence.  This material will be relevant only in a minority of cases.  In those cases also there will be no new burden for the licensee because at present these particulars must be furnished to the court in any case.</P>
    <P>So far as the court staff are concerned, the removal of the necessity for a court certificate in the great majority of renewals of licence will mean a considerable reduction in the demands on staff time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> While the section therefore facilitates both licensee and the court administration it contains safeguards to ensure that the new arrangement is not abused and cannot give rise to fraudulent or illegal renewals.</P>
    <P>The change that is proposed in subsection (1) of section 5 of the Bill is procedural. The change proposed in subsection (2) will mean that where a person is remanded on bail in accordance with Part III of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, and there is no sitting of the court on the day to which he is remanded, he will be required to appear, not at the next sitting in the District Court District concerned, (which might be in a relatively distant location), but at the next sitting in the same District Court area.  The provisions of the 1967 Act in relation to persons remanded in custody are not being amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil welcome any legislation aimed at updating our outmoded and archaic legal system. The opening paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the Bill reads that: The Bill proposes certain amendments designed to simplify procedures in the District Court.  It is interesting to note also that the Long Title of the Bill defines it as:</P>
      <P>An Act to amend and extend the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1961, and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1983, and to provide for other matters relating to the courts.</P>
      <P>The very brevity of the Minister's statement is an indication of the limitations of the Bill.  It is laudable and desirable that we update any legislation that is in need of updating but this Bill is extremely limited in scope and deals only with two areas of district court activity, namely, the enforcement of court orders and the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences without the need for court certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has covered all the ground as the Department perceive it in relation to these two provisions.  Perhaps the very fact of our having a Bill of this <Col N="2023" /> kind before us is at least an indication that the Government recognise the growing public awareness, indeed the growing public demand, for a radical reform of the entire judicial system that has operated for a long number of years.  I have no wish to be vindictive in any way, but the Minister has admitted that this Bill is not the answer to this public demand.  I regard the Bill as being extremely barren in content and totally disappointing in that it has failed to recognise and to deal with a very wide area of court activity that is crying out for reform.</P>
    <P>The publication of this Bill has come as a great disappointment to many Members of the House and the public who have been waiting for an opportunity to debate and, hopefully, reorganise the entire judicial system as it operates.  We are living in very exciting and to some extent very challenging times.  Social values are rapidly changing.  There is a greater public awareness of our democratic institutions and their effects on the future and lifestyle of our people.  People, particularly young people, are asking questions.  There is a greater expectation of accountability from those who make our laws; and it is in this context that the Minister, in introducing the Bill, has missed out on an excellent opportunity of reforming our judicial system with particular reference to District Courts, which the vast majority of people feel at this time are irrelevant, outmoded and very remote.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister made the point that it was better to be making some progress rather than waiting to bring in something major and more worthwhile.  That attitude has bedevilled the entire legislative process.  The Bill before us deals with no fewer than 26 Acts and when this Bill is passed it will be the twenty-seventh Act.  When we get around to bringing in major reform we will have to deal with the fragmentation of legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister brought in this Bill at this time or why, in bringing it before the House, he failed to recognise the very obvious and urgent <Col N="2024" /> areas where reform is needed.  Before dealing with the provisions in the Bill I ask the Minister if there is any real need for the kind of legal jargon used by parliamentary draftsmen when drafting Bills. As a layman with no legal training I would be less than honest if I did not say that much of it is meaningless to me and I have no doubt that it is also meaningless and confusing to many of our citizens. Why should this be the case?  Why in the preparation and presentation of laws which govern the behaviour of our citizens should the language be couched and drafted in such a confusing manner that those who are expected to comply with it do not understand it?</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is a little hypocritical of people who debate legislation to pretend they are <i>au fait</i> with the complexities and intricacies of the Bills as presented.  In this regard debates lack a little credibility. I would dearly love to see a situation where I, as a ordinary unqualified legal person expected to debate the provisions contained in various Bills on behalf of the people, could readily identify with the provisions of a Bill and, more importantly, that the citizens could do so and understand in simple terms what they are supposed to comply with.  We and the public seem to be the prisoners of a group of people who for some archaic traditional reason specialise in putting together a form of wording which ordinary people are not meant to understand and which also poses difficulty for legally untrained Members of the House who have to interpret what they are saying.  If we all understood what they were trying to say there would be no need for the lengthy legal debates which take place in our courts day after day on the interpretation of this confusing phraseology.</P>
    <P>I say sincerely to the Minister, who is as interested as every Member in reforming our various statutes, that if we are to embark on a programme of reform we should commence with the Acts on which the judicial system is based.  I believe in calling a spade a spade and I will not pretend that I am qualified to interpret something which I am not qualified to do. Nonetheless it is my duty to endeavour to <Col N="2025" /> interpret what is contained in the various Bills.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell &mdash; that is not legal jargon &mdash; this Bill sets out to do two things: it transfers from the district justice to the court clerk the authority to issue a summons for the examination of a debtor as to his means.  Under existing legislation a creditor would simply make an application to the courts to have the debtor summoned to appear for the purpose of having his means examined.  In this proposed change, the Minister, in the interest of general law reform, is merely saying that the court clerk may issue that summons.  Perhaps that is streamlining the system, and certainly it simplifies in a minimal way that aspect of District Court activity.  However, it is not a major change and does nothing in relation to the simplification of the present system. It merely transfers the function from one court official to another.  It is important to recognise this, because from the way it is couched in the Bill you get the impression that there is a major change.</P>
    <P>The other change proposed by the Minister in section 4 is that he provides for the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences without the need for a court certificate. This is also a minimal, insignificant change &mdash; and I wonder if it is a change for the better.  Let us look at the present position in relation to the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences.  There is a traditional system whereby in September each year the publicans make an application to the court clerk who brings all these applications together before a sitting of the District Court.  If there are no objections &mdash; and there seldom are in rural District Courts &mdash; the district justice stamps his seal on the applications which are then forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and the licences are granted. Where is there even a semblance of District Court reform in relation to this proposal?  The Minister's proposals do nothing by way of positive or worthwhile reform in relation to the activities of the District Court.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that the court clerk and his office are an essential <Col N="2026" /> part of the court's administrative structure. Court clerks play a major role in District Court administration and they are known for their dedication, commitment, help and courtesy.  The public identify far more easily with the District Court clerk and his office than with any other agent in the District Court system. I appeal to the Minister that, before contemplating any kind of reorganisation of the District Court system, he should put his own House in order and satisfy himself that the various agencies of the system are fully equipped and supported by his Department to carry out the job which they are expected to do.  I do not think that there is anybody who does not acknowledge that the role of the District Court clerk has become increasingly onerous and demanding.  It requires time and attention far beyond the call of duty. Down through the years these clerks have responded in a generous and committed way to the demands of their work.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to recognise the importance of the role of the District Court clerks and the wide range of activities which they perform on behalf of the public, especially in the area of family law cases where his involvement in many instances has been responsible for bringing about reconciliation and a successful outcome.  I have a great belief in the capacity of the District Court clerk and his office to bring about successful reconciliations in family law cases.  I hope that my plea will not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>I made the point that the Bill and its provisions are meaningless and almost totally irrelevant in so far as reform is concerned.  It is interesting to note that in the Bill the Minister transfers one additional duty from the district justice to the District Court clerk <i>vis-à-vis</i> his entitlement to issue a summons for the examination of a debtor's means.  There is no mention in the Bill nor was there any acknowledgement in the Minister's speech of the importance and relevance of the role of the District Court clerk.</P>

This year the other milk producing countries in the Community had to take a further reduction of one million tonnes or approximately 1 per cent in their output in the current year.

      <P>That was a general question. It is a matter of debate between certain co-operatives involved in certain disputes, if one can call them that, at the moment.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of New Zealand butter into the United Kingdom is covered by Protocol 18 to the Treaty of Accession and the quantities provided for have been steadily reduced from some 166,000 tonnes in 1973 to 81,000 tonnes this year and that will be down to 79,000 tonnes for 1986.  In regard to the period after 1986, I shall be urging the Community to take due account of the market situation and the interests of Community milk producers.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Could the Minister indicate to the House the <Col N="2036" /> effects which butter imports from New Zealand have on the Irish dairy industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very difficult question to answer and a very difficult point to evaluate.  The imports of New Zealand butter into the Community are into the United Kingdom alone.  They do not go into any other country.  We have persistently argued that, if such imports are to be allowed, they should go into the EC generally, not just into the United Kingdom, thereby allowing us to get back into a traditional market in a stronger manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>As the Minister is a person who has now taken part in three major negotiations annually in Brussels, could he give us any indication as to whether he is optimistic that the EC would be in a position totally to control the situation and protect the interests of farmers, suppliers and manufacturers within Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot depends on the action of the other members of the EC.  Their attitudes have changed considerably on a number of matters, particularly referring to the dairying industry since the advent of the super-levy.  It has made them look at imports and other movements in the market a lot more closely.  I signified that in my original reply.  We have always been concerned at the level of New Zealand butter imports into the Community. While they have been more than halved since our accession to the Community, we are still not satisfied that they are at a low enough level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to make that prediction.  We will have to see the on-going development in the Community and the attitudes of the member states. I might also point out that we have a traditional role to play &mdash; and when I say we, I mean the members of the Community &mdash; in conjunction with New Zealand in seeing that the world market is properly <Col N="2037" /> ordered.  If we do not have an understanding with New Zealand in particular and the United States, there could be an entirely unsatisfactory trading position where we would be undercutting one another in the world markets.  That would not do anyone any good.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the unfortunate situation with regard to pigmeat where no slaughtering plant is licensed to export to the United States because their standards are not up to scratch in that regard.  That is something about which I worry.  With regard to CBF's role in the <Col N="2039" /> pigmeat industry, some years ago it was suggested that they should have responsibility for the marketing of pigmeat as they have for beef and sheepmeat.  However, that suggestion was resisted by people in the industry.  Perhaps it is one of the factors that will emerge in the review that CBF are carrying out at the moment.

    <P>There are a range of facilities and incentives available from various State <Col N="2041" /> agencies such as An Foras Talúntais, UCC, IIRS, and the IDA for product development and improving the value-added content of agricultural output.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage the food industry to avail of these facilities and incentives in order to enable it to diversify away from commodity type products such as butter into consumer type products which have considerably higher value-added and employment content. In addition, Government strategy, as outlined in the national plan, is to encourage the food industry to seek and exploit opportunities for the production of consumer type products and the grant-aiding agencies have been asked to give priority to projects related to such products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the question of funding from the Exchequer arises, because Bord Bainne are a private company.  While I am open to correction on this, my information is that when they were a semi-State body their activities were found to be contrary to EC regulations. I know that Bord Bainne have set up a research and development fund. That is a most desirable activity and I hope all the co-operatives will contribute to that fund.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it does not seem wise that the major processors, that is the co-operatives especially in the milk sector, should duplicate their efforts by going their own way on research programmes.  As I have stated here previously, I am concerned <Col N="2042" /> that the major research unit which is available at UCC is not being utilised to the full.  It is a magnificent facility, it cost an enormous amount of money, much of which was supplied by the State, and it is underutilised.

These are matters which will be of particular relevance in the future development of our agri-food industry.  I also visited the offices of Kerry Co-op in Chicago which is developing a significant export trade in dairy products.</P>

That is an unfortunate situation and I shall be discussing that aspect with Bord na gCon.</P>

      <P>The recommendations in the Report of the Working Group on the Four Year Plan for Agriculture were carefully considered in the context of the preparation of the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> A number of their recommendations are already being implemented as a result of the decisions announced in <i>Building on Reality,</i> in particular the measures being taken to improve the efficiency of the advisory services and the proposals currently being drawn up for the new farm investment scheme, that is the structures. The question of additional changes in the taxation and social welfare codes to further encourage land mobility is at present being pursued.  Other recommendations of the group have also been of value in the preparation of the national plan.</P>

Would he not agree further that there are many farmers who need professional advice at a critical time in Irish agriculture to whom that advice is not available?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, I said in my reply that it was being looked at at present.  In regard to the earlier part of the Deputy's question I should say the advisory services are functioning very satisfactorily, I would say better than ever, due largely to their restructuring. The four year plan makes specific reference to the need to concentrate on that band of farmers who can benefit most from individual attention and we have incorporated that in the national plan.</P>

I said there is a particular group of farmers, which we believe to be 40,000 to <Col N="2048" /> 50,000, who would benefit tremendously from additional attention from the advisory services.  We have put that into the plan.  I have stated publicly that a number of farmers have reached such a high level of proficiency that they do not need the same degree of attention and that there is also another brand of farmers who cannot assimilate the type of advice and knowledge which is disseminated by the instructors.  It may be because of old age, lack of education or something else.  We have suggested that the advisory services concentrate on those people who could benefit tremendously from concentrated attention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>Development of the Common Agricultural Policy is necessary to take account not only of changes in production, consumption and world market conditions for various products but also of new situations facing agriculture &mdash; for instance, in the areas of environment protection, biotechnology and the search for alternative lines of production.  The European Agricultural Commission is at present preparing a document which would be the starting point for a wide debate on some of these aspects.</P>
      <P>In any such debate it is of course important for this country, and indeed for the Community as a whole, that the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as the aims of article 39 of the Rome Treaty, should receive proper recognition.  It will be my aim to ensure that such recognition continues to be given in any future adaptations to the Common Agricultural Policy and that adequate financial resources are available accordingly.  In this connection it will of course be recalled that the funds available to the Community as a whole are to be increased as from January next.</P>

      <P>A wide variety of factors affect the economic circumstances of any farm and it would not be practicable to attempt to assess the &ldquo;viability&rdquo; of all farms in the country even if an objective and satisfactory definition of this term could be agreed.  However, all of the Governments' agricultural policies, and particularly those relating to farm structures, are aimed at facilitating and promoting the development of our farms.

      <P>Considering that we recently had an extension of the severely handicapped areas, that we have the Agricultural Institute operating for a long number of years and that there is a large group of people working in the economic division of the Department of Agriculture, surely the man charged with the responsibility of leading the development <Col N="2059" /> of Irish agriculture has an idea at least within each province of the number of fallow acres throughout the land?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for Question Time I was talking about the futility of the Bill.  It is a pity that the Minister in deciding to bring a Bill on court reform before the House did not decide to broaden it and deal with many of the areas which have been omitted. <Col N="2075" /> This Bill will only be a statistic in terms of the legislative output of this Government. It will only add further confusion to the complexity of fragmented legislation at present on our Statute Books.  The need for court reform was never greater than it is now.  The number of people coming before the courts is on the increase.  That trend reflects on the economic climate and to an extent it reflects on this House.  We have a higher number of unemployed on the live register than ever before and, while I do not condone law breaking, it is easy enough to understand why people are finding this sort of outlet in their economic situation.  We are missing out on a great opportunity in this debate.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes that intoxicating liquor licences may, except in certain exceptional cases, be renewed annually by the Revenue Commissioners without the production of a certificate to a District Court.  This change does not remove any great burden of work from the courts.  The time taken by District Courts in granting licences was a very small fraction of the time spent on other cases.  The method of dealing with applications was very efficient and organised and it was done largely by the clerks. Anybody who ever attended a District Court at the annual licensing procedure could appreciate the efficient manner in which applications were processed.  From my inquiries in County Laois I know that the granting of licences in 1984 would have taken up only one hour of the court's time.  That is really what we are talking about here today in the pretence that we are going some way along the road towards reforming and streamlining the court system.  It is important that the House recognises exactly what is involved and acknowledges that there is a wider area which the Minister has decided to ignore in terms of the proposals put forward in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will agree that the law relating to publicans' licences is complicated, as can be seen from the First Schedule to the Bill, which refers back as far as 1833. I can envisage the moonshiners operating <Col N="2076" /> in a very organised way back in those years.  While I have no great desire to trace this Act of 1833 to see exactly what was contained in it, I feel that it will be totally irrelevant to the modern legislation society requires.  There has not been consolidating legislation in the meantime. The laws have been revised in a very piecemeal fashion.  The Minister should have availed of the opportunity in this Bill to update and consolidate existing legislation in relation to the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the sale and consumption of alcohol is generally of great concern, It has been commented on by community leaders, social workers, teachers, members of the Garda, the clergy and by the Road Safety Association. While the vast majority of publicans conduct their business in a creditable and responsible manner, there are isolated cases where this is not the case.  I refer particularly to the effects of late night extensions which seem to be granted with great ease by District Courts under existing legislation.  I would have thought this was an area the House should examine when debating this Bill. Deputies will be aware of the tragic cost to the nation in loss of life and serious injuries resulting from road traffic accidents. The Road Safety Association estimated that in 1983 road accidents cost the Exchequer somewhere in the region of £200 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now dealing with a matter which does not come under the Department of Justice. It comes under the Department of the Environment, strange as it may seem.

      <P>I hope Deputies on the far side of the House share my concern about the very restricted measures in the Bill and that they will support my plea to expand the Bill into a much wider area for which there is a greater demand.  A recent survey carried out by the IMI, published in the past couple of weeks, revealed that alcoholism is a major factor in our very high and costly level of absenteeism. Alcoholism and alcoholic psychosis account for more admissions to psychiatric hospitals than anything else. I make these points, not for the purpose of getting away from the Bill but to support my views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your consideration and leniency.  Any legislation dealing with the sale of alcohol should be carefully considered and monitored by the House.  There is more to this Bill than meets the eye.  I hope I have demonstrated clearly that the provisions in the Bill do absolutely nothing for District Court reform.  The issue of a summons by a court clerk, for example, for an examination order does absolutely nothing to deal effectively with the problem of debt collection. It does nothing to eliminate the waste of time and the duplicated efforts in the various legal procedures which must be complied with and which far too often end up in the final analysis with the non-collection of the debt.  This view will be confirmed by many creditors and their legal representatives.  I am sure Deputy Molony would agree with me on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 4 we need clarification on what the Minister is really trying to achieve.  To simply remove the need for a court certificate for the issue of a licence does very little to reduce the workload in the District Court, particularly when we know that the court will have to sit in any event to deal with objections under the various headings specified in the Bill.  The Bill clearly identifies the areas in which objections can be lodged in regard to the renewal of an intoxicating liquor licence.  Section 4 (5) provides:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, a licence shall not be renewable on expiry without the production of a certificate of the District Court for the district court area within which the premises concerned are situate where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a notice of objection to such renewal has been lodged with the Court within the time prescribed in rules of court, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2079" /> (b)  there has been structural alteration in the premises concerned since the licence was granted or renewed, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the licence is one which is renewable by virtue of the provisions of section 30 (1) (b) of the Act of 1960, or</P>
    <P>(d)  any change is proposed in the nature of the licence (including the insertion of a condition) or in the conditions attaching to the licence.</P>
    <P>To some extent the phraseology used there bears out the point I made about understanding the legislation.  Many people feel the old system of renewing licences through the court provided the greatest safeguards for the community.  I spoke to many members of the licensed vintners trade who agreed that the old system was very fair in safeguarding their interests as well.  I could see some reason for supporting the proposal in the Bill if the Minister could convince me that he was streamlining the courts, but in fact he is not doing that.  Nobody on the far side of the House would disagree with me, I am sure.  Deputy Molony has appeared in more district courts than many of us in relation to the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences, and I am sure he will agree that the district justice was capable of disposing of all those applications in the course of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</P>
    <P>Why are we debating a Bill today which was supposed to be introduced in the interests of court reform when it does nothing about it?  The old system of renewing licences was more accommodating to the views of fire officers and planners in respect of the suitability of premises within their areas.  Having regard to recent and not so recent tragic events, I doubt if anyone would question the desirability of an input in the matter of the safety of premises by people who have a view to express when licences are being granted.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of the Bill which <Col N="2080" /> concerns me and which I trust the Minister will be able to clarify when replying. I should like to hear how the general public are to be made aware of the fact that an application has been made to the Revenue Commissioners for the renewal of an intoxicating liquor licence.  I will be happy to bow to the informed opinion of the Minister in this matter but as I read the Bill, unless there is an application before the court for the renewal of the licence there will be no basis on which anyone can object to the renewal.  This is a very important aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The existing system worked well.  The public are familiar with it and no one, not even the courts' administrative staff, is seeking a change in this area.  I remind the House again that the amount of time involved annually in any district court in renewing licences is not much more than a couple of hours.  Therefore, one must look elsewhere for the Minister's reasoning in bringing the Bill before the House. Can it be that he is not prepared to make additional facilities available to the District Court clerks?  We know that there is much understaffing in this area. The Minister would be providing a better service to the courts system if he were to make more resources available to the District Court clerks for the purpose of streamlining their operation.</P>
    <P>Reluctantly, I must ask whether the Minister is endeavouring, in some hidden way or by some back door method, to give more power to the Revenue Commissioners. If that is the case he should so inform the House and leave us in a position to judge whether he is justified in what he is trying to do but it is not fair to the House that we should be left to speculate in the context of what is not in the Bill for the purpose of trying to tease out what the Minister's aim is.</P>
    <P>Section 4, among others, and particularly subsection (2) of section 4, are of much concern to many licensed vintners. That subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>An officer of the Revenue Commissioners empowered to grant a renewal of a licence for premises which have <Col N="2081" /> been licensed in the immediately preceding year may, subject to subsection (5)  of this section, grant such renewal without the production of a certificate of the District Court.</P>
    <P>The cause of concern in relation to that subsection is the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. Why is the word, &ldquo;will&rdquo; not used instead? As the subsection reads, there is an option for the Revenue Commissioners to introduce, by some side door method or otherwise, something that is not included in the Bill, whether in the area of taxation or in some other area.  On Committee Stage I will be tabling an amendment designed at least to exclude the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; because this word leaves the Bill open to misinterpretation, misrepresentation, confusion and doubt.  No one in the House could allow the Bill to pass without establishing what the Minister has in mind in terms of this section. It creates all kinds of possibilities.  Up to now the procedure has been that a district justice granted a certificate which was forwarded automatically to the Revenue Commissioners and on that basis they granted the licence.  However, under the proposed legislation the Revenue Commissioners may consider granting a licence following the submission of an application, if the application is in order. It would be in order, having been forwarded to them in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and myself faced each other satisfactorily across the House when dealing with the Animals Bill.  I am asking her now to make a special note to ask the Minister to tell us when replying to this stage of the debate what he means by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4.</P>
    <P>Unless we get clarification on this point everything else in the Bill could be misleading and irrelevant.  We are talking about a section that represents a very serious change in the licensing laws but which has nothing to do with court reform.  We must be told why, if an applicant is qualified under subsection (7), it will not be obligatory on the Revenue Commissioners to grant the licence automatically. The provisions of subsection <Col N="2082" /> (7)  are very important.  They are cherished by members of the Licensed Vintners' Association because they relate to the credibility of members in respect of operating commercial premises.  The subsection refers to the good character of the licensee and to the peaceable and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence.</P>

      <P>I am representing our spokesman, Deputy Woods, who I regret is not with us.  I am sure it would be in order to wish him a speedy recovery and welcome him back to the House as soon as possible, but in the meantime I have been entrusted with the task of representing the view of our party on this Bill.  While I would like to oblige Deputy Molony and my good friend, Deputy Allen, I would leave my case on behalf of my party unfinished and I would have to answer for that somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 proposes a change in the law in relation to default on payment of fines. We must make provision in legislation for imprisonment where people deliberately break and defy the law, but in relation to this area of administration the act need not necessarily be one of defiance but inability to pay.  We know of many cases where families are in severe hardship and they find it difficult to pay a court fine.  One crib I have in relation to court fines is the fact that there is no provision whereby fines can be paid in <Col N="2083" /> instalments.  An unfortunate individual could be faced with meeting a fine of £40 and, because of unemployment and so on, it might be very difficult for him to pay that.  We should be able to make provision for court fines to be paid by instalments.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for prison sentences in relation to failure to pay court fines.  I do not question the right of the Minister to insert in the Bill the need for prison sentences in certain instances, but it is ridiculous at present to be talking about prison sentences for small, insignificant, petty offences.  For example, if a person does not pay a fine not exceeding £50 he could be imprisoned for five days.  We all know that there is no prison accommodation at present.  It is strange that the Minister did not refer to the possibility of substituting community service orders for prison sentences &mdash; in other words, that people who under the Bill would be faced with a prison sentence could be penalised by being required to perform some task under a community service order.  This order has a lot of merit.  I always supported the idea.  In many instances it is a humane way of dealing with the petty offences we are talking about.  Perhaps in the long term it might prove to be a great deterrent.  In reply I hope the Minister refers to the possibility of substituting community service orders for prison sentences.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make his views known when replying and to let us know his proposals and plans for reforming the District Court clerk system as an essential part of the overall structure of the judicial system.  This Bill does not touch the tip of the iceberg in so far as there are many shortcomings in the system.  There is a monumental and unbelievable waste of time and money in the District Court.  One can see 15 or 20 gardaí waiting for two or three hours for their case to be called while the court deals with dozens of uncontested and non-controversial matters.  In the Dublin area it is more organised.  They have staggered lists in operation, which means that certain cases are listed from 10 a.m. to <Col N="2084" /> 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. until whatever time the court adjourns.</P>
    <P>Most courts commence at 11 a.m., and there is nothing wrong with that since many defendants have to travel long distances and it would be unfair if the courts commenced work at 9 a.m.  However, the normal procedure is that applications for bar extensions, lottery licences, draws, instalment orders, examination orders, commital orders, restoration of driving licences and other civil matters are heard first.  The more minor of the Garda offences &mdash; no tax, no driving licences, no insurance and speeding offences &mdash; come next.  After that the more serious criminal offences, such as drunken driving, dangerous driving and assault, are heard; and, finally, civil cases are taken, usually at the end of the day. Family law cases may be taken either at the very beginning of the list or else at the end of the list, depending on the attitude of the district justice and on the number of cases to be heard.  If a district justice deals with a family law case first, there may be long delays while he adjudicates on a family problem but there might be 40 or 50 people, many of them gardaí, waiting for him to commence a day's work in court.</P>
    <P>I estimate that approximately 60 per cent of the work to which I have referred is non-controversial and non-contested. By that I mean applications for bar extensions, local draws by various clubs, auctioneers' licences, speeding offences, no tax displayed on vehicles, no driving licences and failing to produce driving licences.  A great deal of time is taken up in the District Court office writing each separate application into the list and in collating all the documents necessary for each application.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the role of the Garda.  District Courts may have to deal only with a few serious crimes like drunken or dangerous driving, larceny and assault.  However, several gardaí dealing with minor offences may be detained in court for a number of hours waiting for their cases to be called.  Their prosecutions relate to speeding offences, failure to have a vehicle taxed, failure to <Col N="2085" /> produce a driving licence and other minor offences, all of which would be admitted by the defendant and would, therefore, be uncontested in court.  At present a defendant feels that he has to appear in person to answer the charge or to employ a solicitor to appear for him.  Many of these matters could be dealt with by an on-the-spot fine which many defendants would be agreeable to pay, although of course they should be given the opportunity to have the matter adjudicated upon by the court if they felt they were not guilty.  The net result of such a procedure would free a massive number of gardaí to deal with more serious crimes.</P>
    <P>One other major waste of Garda time in connection with the courts system relates to the serving of summonses.  The present procedure is that, if a driver exceeding the speed limit is stopped, the local Garda will send the summons to the Garda station nearest the residence of the person who was summoned.  A summons must be delivered to the driver in person and, if he resides in a flat, a garda may call there on numerous occasions before he finds the driver or someone prepared to accept the summons on his behalf.  In civil cases a civil bill can be served by registered post; and it is ridiculous that a summons for a minor traffic offence cannot also be served in this way, subject to the right of appeal by the driver if he can show that he did not receive the summons.  The system of recorded delivery is used very successfully in other countries.</P>
    <P>One other shortcoming in the District Court system is that there is a substantial amount of money outstanding in unpaid fines.  Some of these go back for a number of years because the District Court office staff are overworked and unable to issue the warrants to the local Garda to collect the fines.  If each District Court office were allocated a junior civil servant the backlog could be dealt with, resulting in a great boost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill has not dealt with the area of family law.  When a dispute arises between husband and wife relating to maintenance, assault or the question of access to children, if either party wishes <Col N="2086" /> to have the matter adjudicated upon it will come before the local District Court. It is patently obvious that such a case will not be brought without one party having incurred months or years of agony, terror and fear.  When innocent children are involved the problem is even more worrying. All these cases fall to be heard by a district justice whose main training is based on legal principles.  A family law case may have been simmering for years and, if it is suddenly brought into the open, it is very unfair that it has to be dealt with in the course of an ordinary morning's work where the Judiciary and the administration are under pressure to maintain a timetable and to dispose of other numerous harrowing matters which come before them.  There may be only one or two family law cases at a sitting of the District Court.  It would be simpler and more efficient if one day was set aside every month in each town where the local justice would hear family law cases only and would be prepared to listen in detail to each side of the story.  An even better solution would be for the district justice, assisted by a marriage counsellor or a social worker specialising in family law cases, to visit each county on one or two days per month.  The cost of employing two or three extra judges would be offset by the amount of time which the ordinary justice could devote to disposing of the more urgent criminal and civil cases.</P>
    <P>While the ordinary district justice might be an excellent lawyer and well capable of dealing with civil and criminal matters, he is totally ill equipped to deal with family disputes.  Separate family law courts would also save the unfortunate litigants the embarrassment of waiting around in overcrowded courthouses and hallways to have their cases heard.  I apologise for having to read through my final notes in relation to the Bill.  I did so for the purpose of speeding up my contribution and to give the Members opposite an opportunity of expressing their views. I hope I have succeeded in convincing the House that the Bill does nothing by way of introducing even the simplest reform to the District Court system although the Minister stated that that is what he was <Col N="2087" /> setting out to do.  I appeal to him to bring in new sections which will deal with the many areas of more urgent reform which we are crying out for.  I thank you for your indulgence, Sir, and I also wish to thank the Members who have so patiently waited on the other side of the House to contribute.  I sincerely hope that this debate will be broadened so that we will be all happy in the knowledge that we have contributed towards bringing about some kind of worthwhile reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any moves to take certain functions out of the court system.  Even though the proposals in the Bill are not major, I hope they are the forerunners of many reforms which will come before the House over the next two years.</P>
      <P>Many changes can be brought about by ministerial order and I hope that the Minister will use his powers to bring about other changes in the District Court system.  I sat through the long contribution of Deputy Hyland &mdash; I did not realise he could speak at such length.  I agree with many of his views, especially in regard to the need for a simplification of the legal jargon which many of us have to interpret in our role as legislators.  There must be a major programme of demystification of some of the professions and we should start with the legal profession. We must also overcome any opposition we may encounter in this regard, especially in relation to the barriers which the public come up against in the legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago I had to spend a day in the District Court in Cork, as I was called as a witness for the prosecution.  I was very saddened by what I saw.  I saw a production line operation between the legal people, and the lay people were pawns in the game.  The witnesses, the plaintiffs and the defendants were there, but we did not know what was happening most of the time.  There was inadequate amplification which resulted in almost a closed contest between the legal people, mostly a mumbling contest.  I did not have a clue about what was going on, nor did <Col N="2088" /> most of the people in the court.  I was there as a State witness but nobody had the courtesy to tell me when the case would be heard or how long it would be before I would be called.  If I was treated like that as a State witness, God help the defendants and the defence witnesses.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Hyland, I had plenty of time to notice the number of gardaí sitting around wasting time.  They should have been doing more constructive duties dealing with crime on the streets. Instead, because of the failure of successive Governments to deal with the operation of the District Court, they were forced to sit around all day waiting their turn.  That is a sad waste of a scarce resource.  The Garda are employed to detect crime and then to bring people to justice in an efficient manner.  The Garda have been let down by the legal system in this way and in other ways.  That day in court taught me many lessons I will never forget.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation as a small contribution to District Court reform. My day in court convinced me that the legal profession must become customer orientated and stop being so defensive when legislators and lay people question the procedures forced upon us.  They should welcome the steps being taken by the Minister to bring about reforms in all areas of legal justice and a reform in the courts system.  If they adopted a positive attitude they would show that the profession has nothing to hide.  Deputy Hyland inferred earlier that the legal profession, through the legal jargon and the mumbo jumbo that goes on, are attempting to carry on a closed shop.</P>
    <P>The courts should make themselves more accessible and less forbidding places for the public.  The courtrooms and courthouses should be modernised and made less forbidding.  Persons participating in the higher courts should be obliged to wear proper dress and not the ridiculous regalia they wear at present.  I believe the legal profession and the practice of law in the District Court are too removed from the society they are supposed to serve.  People are confused about whether the law is supposed to <Col N="2089" /> serve them or they are supposed to serve the law.  This comes about because of the failure to modernise our law, our legal system and legal practice.  It has come about from what I consider the inadequate training lawyers get and the social background of most lawyers.</P>
    <P>The Minister must continue to look at the administration of justice over the next number of months.  He must, as a followup to acting in areas of the District Court, act in other areas of the administration of justice.  I take this opportunity to appeal to him to look at the procedures in our courts and to tell us why we have to have so many lawyers in simple road cases.  Why do we have to employ up to eight lawyers in a particular case?  Why cannot we set up a system of pre-trial hearings outside the courthouses where the plaintiff and the defendant could discuss the case and come to some agreement? I submit that as that may not be in the best interests of the legal profession they would oppose it.</P>
    <P>These issues must be looked at immediately because the present system has major consequences for our people.  We only have to look at the side effects, which are evident today, of the present outdated system.  I am not alone in saying that the cause of the huge premiums demanded by motor insurance companies can be traced back to the area of justice, the enormous public liability premiums being demanded by insurance companies, from sporting organisations and from employer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this opportunity to ask the Minister to follow up this small but important Bill with other legislation almost immediately.  This is urgently needed if we are to make our legal system more relevant.</P>

      <P>The Minister has committed himself to looking at the jury system immediately but he has to look at the whole question of legal costs in the District, Circuit and High Courts systems and the sooner that is done the better.</P>
      <P>If the legal profession have a duty to co-operate with the Minister in bringing about a reform of the legal system, we as legislators must look at our role and at the role of the Law Reform Commission. That commission have an important function to carry out in bringing about a reform of our court system, be it the District, Circuit or High Courts.  I contend that the Law Reform Commission are not carrying out their function in this area.  They could be more relevant to everyday problems if they looked at the court system as it stands.  We as legislators must look at the level of public dissatisfaction which exists in this area and tackle the problem immediately.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by referring to one important person in this system, and that is the judge.  There is a tradition in this House that we should not criticise the Judiciary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  From time to time we see very inconsistent judgments coming from the District Court.  The performance of judges at that level must be monitored closely.  I detect from press and other reports which I receive in my clinic an inconsistency in the judgments coming from the District Court.  Judges and justices are doing a job no different from that of most other people.  They are dispensing a service of justice similar to anyone in the service industry.  Their quality of service must be monitored closely at all times.  Should District Court justices not be put through a period of training before they are allowed to sit on the bench?  That matter should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading and rereading the Bill, I cannot see how the role of the Revenue Commissioners is increased by the provisions of this Bill.  Any disputes between <Col N="2091" /> the applicant and the Revenue people can be referred back to the courts, anyway.  I do not share Deputy Hyland's fears on that count.  I have no reservations about supporting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard of a Courts Bill coming out of the pipeline, I assumed that it would be the first major reform to be undertaken by this Government. I was looking forward to it, as I always do to legislation relating to legal matters.  I was contemplating it as being a Bill in the context of the many promises made, for example, by Deputy Fennell, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, who over the tenure of her office has been proclaiming the need for a reform of law, particularly in relation to illegitimacy.  I do not deny that lady the right to do and say what she has been doing and saying but I give this as an example of promises unrelated to the reality.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated on numerous occasions, to my certain knowledge, her intention and concern for reform of the law on illegitimacy.  In the end we got a document which asked us to comment on her views and those of the Government in relation to that subject. That means that the question of illegitimacy has once more been put on the long finger.  This was one of the hopes that one had on hearing about the Courts Bill, and what does one get?  Instead of a major piece of law reform, one gets legislation which creates more confusion, more bureaucracy and does more harm than good to the courts system.  First, we are told that it will improve the issuing of liquor licences.  The second major law reform which comes in this Courts Bill is imprisonment for non-payment of judgment debts &mdash; two major shafts of wisdom in the area of law reform from this reforming Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that I am a party to wasting the House's time on this Bill.  However, I was requested to come and speak on the Bill, which is what I am now doing. I offered my views on it at the parliamentary party meeting yesterday morning. <Col N="2092" /> The Bill was introduced to that meeting in a very able fashion by the present spokesman for Justice, Deputy Hyland. The views expressed there on this piece of law reform were particularly worth hearing.  It was a very good parliamentary party meeting in the context of this Bill and of law reform generally.  The reaction at it is reflected by my reaction here, being given the opportunity of speaking on the Bill in Dáil Éireann.  It is a fraudulent piece of nonsense.  Meant to be a law reform Bill, it is nothing of the kind.  It is my intention now to expose to the House the wretchedness of this production.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an effort to mislead the House in the context of what is required &mdash; which is major law reform.  The Courts Bill, 1984, is being discussed &mdash;&ldquo;1984&rdquo;, let it be noted.  We are now at the end of May 1985.  Perhaps the Minister in responding might like to tell us how much time it took for the civil servants to produce this Bill.  Undoubtedly, a lot of effort has gone into it on the part of the civil servants, the number of whom we do not know.  It is extremely technical legislation, undoubtedly.  There are seven sections and then a first and second schedule. One wonders at the research required to come up with this piece of unwisdom, because that is what it is.  It makes my blood boil to have to stand on the back benches of my own party to be treated to this contempt of Dáil Éireann presented in the context of law reform.</P>
    <P>We talk about bringing this House into disrepute.  Is it any wonder that people have a low perception of us when we produce this fraudulence?  The Minister for Justice is now present.  Where is the rest of the Criminal Justice Act that we spent so much time discussing in this House?  At that time he accused some of us of being weak on law and security. Nothing could be further from the truth. That accusation is made if one expresses a view in this House in relation to civil liberties.  Where is the great family law reform that we were promised from this Government?  Would it not have been better if the Minister, his acolytes, or assistants &mdash; no disrespect to the Ministers of State &mdash; had produced a Bill <Col N="2093" /> which would give many thousands of families hope, instead of having to queue up for justice in courts which would do justice to some of the courts in Iran under the Ayatollah?</P>
    <P>This country needs, and needs badly, proper family law courts.  Of course, people with family problems are on the increase as the economic pressures increase.  Despite what some of our institutions &mdash; religious or otherwise &mdash; are telling us, the realities are there.  What we want in this House is genuine law reform, not phoney law reform.  What we want is family law reform, district courts and family law courts that will deal principally with family matters.</P>
    <P>I am a qualified lawyer but I am not here to defend lawyers, the Law Library, the Bar Council or the Incorporated Law Society.  They are all well able to defend themselves.  However, when charges are made against lawyers they should be substantiated by facts rather than fiction. Lawyers are not afraid of change.  If the jury system is to be looked at, it will be met with reasoned arguments by the lawyers.  However, it is a matter for the Government to produce whatever reforms they have in mind in that regard. If the law must change let it change but those changes should be for the benefit of the people, not for the lawyers or other professions.</P>
    <P>We read that this Bill is an Act to amend and extend the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1961, and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts, 1961 to 1983, and to provide for other matters relating to the courts.  The explanatory memorandum states as follows:</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes certain amendments of the law designed to simplify procedures in the District Court in relation to a number of matters, principally the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences, and it also proposes certain other changes of which the most important relate to the periods of imprisonment that may be imposed in default of payment of fines.</P>
    <P>Hurrah for the Government.  They should be ashamed of their effort at law <Col N="2094" /> reform.  It is a total waste of time and effort.  They should be ashamed to come here with this pettifogging measure.  The Bill treats the House with contempt.  It is my personal view that the House has been humiliated because of it.  It has been produced under the guise of law reform. The attitude is that we should hasten slowly, that we cannot have law reform overnight or in bulk.  We are told we must have law reform in the context of the renewal of liquor licences and in relation to periods of imprisonment that must be imposed in default of payment of fines. All of these are regarded as major pieces of law reform.  God help us and protect us from the efforts of this Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>The question might be asked: why not bring before the Dáil another problem with which the Minister is confronted, namely, the role of the Garda Síochána in the context of the District Court?  In any such court there may be only a few serious crimes; for example, drunken driving, dangerous driving, larceny, assault and that type of crime.  The Minister might address his mind to the procedures in the District Court in connection with such crimes.  Those of us who began our legal careers in the District Court often had to wait many hours to have our cases taken.  On such occasions we saw many members of the Garda Síochána at the back of the court waiting to deal with matters such as summonses for speeding, tax offences, failure to have a driving licence and so on.  In the ordinary way if those crimes were admitted by the defendant they would be uncontested in court and this would relieve the Garda Síochána of having to waste their time and the taxpayers' money.  That is the kind of law reform we should be dealing with here.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there is a serious breakdown in law and security in Dublin city and county.  It would be much better if members of the Garda Síochána were out on the beat rather than wasting their time in the District Court in cases dealing with tax offences and failure to have a driving licence.  I am not suggesting that these are not serious matters <Col N="2095" /> but if one were to make a comparison between a case of assault and failure to have a driving licence I suggest the driving offence might be seen as a minor one. At the moment the defendant thinks he either has to appear in person in court to answer the charge or to employ a solicitor to act for him.  Such matters could be dealt with by an on-the-spot fine.  It is only where a defendant genuinely feels he is innocent that he should have to trouble the court.</P>
    <P>If matters were dealt with in the way I have suggested, the Garda Síochána would be free to deal with the more serious crimes in this city and in the country. In that connection, perhaps we should pay a tribute to people in the rural areas.  The urban sickness, in the context of crime, does not appear to have spread to a great degree to rural Ireland.  I know that crimes are committed in rural areas but not to such a degree as in Dublin city and county and a tribute should be paid to our rural citizens for their attitude to the law.  It is a pity that attitude does not exist among some of our less unruly citizens, particularly in Dublin city and county.  The waste of Garda time in the District Court has to be seen to be believed. As somebody who practised in that court for a considerable number of years I found that one of the most stark matters with which one was confronted was the number of gardaí dealing with so-called minor offences.  This is an area the Minister could well examine.</P>
    <P>Another area he might well examine is that of the service of summonses by the Garda Síochána.  Under present procedures, if, say, a driver is stopped in Dún Laoghaire for exceeding the speed limit the local Garda will send the summons to the nearest Garda station to the driver's residence.  A summons has to be delivered either to the residence of the driver or to the driver in person.  For example, a driver resides in a flat in Dublin.  Those of us who lived in flats know what flatland is like &mdash; I lived in a flat in Galway for a number of years; I do not have much experience of flatland in Dublin.  It is, to say the least of it a <Col N="2096" /> warren-type experience from the point of view of delivering a summons on the part of the gardaí.  Why should a garda be exposed to attempting to deliver a summons in Dublin flatland?  It is a will o' the wisp operation to which he should not be subjected, a waste of taxpayers' money. In civil cases a civil bill can be served by registered post.  It seems ridiculous that a summons for a minor traffic offence cannot also be served by registered post, subject to the right of appeal by the prospective recipient.  I understand a system of recorded delivery is used in other countries, which the Minister might well examine.</P>
    <P>One other shortfall in the present District Courts system is that there is a substantial amount of money outstanding in unpaid fines.  The Minister will be aware that a large number of them date back a number of years, the reason appearing to be that the District Court offices are so under-staffed and overworked they are unable to issue the relevant warrants to the local gardaí to collect the fines.  If each District Court office was allocated a junior civil servant that backlog could be dealt with, thus resulting in a great boost to the Exchequer.  I should like to pay tribute to our District Court clerks throughout the country who have performed their duties in an excellent manner.  In the nature of things the District Court deals with so-called minor offences.  District Court clerks have never been found wanting in their profession or calling, but the more we place on the District Court the more over-burdened become the district justices and clerks. An efficient District Court clerk is what makes for an efficient District Court, and the relationship between him and the district justice is all important.  It is the clerk who sets the work for the day, informs the district justice what is before the court for that day and does an extremely valuable job.</P>
    <P>This so-called piece of law reform has not touched on family law, which is a great tragedy.  If the Minister wants to make a real name for himself he should allow his Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, a genuine and concerned person <Col N="2097" /> who has shown genuine concern for family reform, loose &mdash; and I use the word in its best sense &mdash; in the Department to produce genuine law reform.  Let her get on with the production of this illegitimacy Bill about which we have heard so much from her on so many occasions. Let her implement the other views she has expressed in the context of family law reform.  Obviously she is a very willing, able and articulate person.  Here I may use an expression that may well get me into trouble, but I do not think she is getting a fair crack of the whip from the Minister; in the nature of things she is not being given her head.  I appeal to the Minister to allow his Minister of State get on with the business of law reform in the interests of his good name, that of his Department and of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill we are treated to the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences, which undoubtedly constitutes law reform but lower case law reform, as is the question of the periods of imprisonment to be imposed for default of payment of fines.  Of course that is law reform, but is it genuine law reform?  When we go into the technicalities of the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences we note that in certain circumstances a certificate of the court has to be obtained.  If one is dissatisfied with the Revenue Commissioners with regard to what they may do in relation to the renewal of one's liquor licence one can go back to the District Court.  This is ping pong legislation of the lowest type.  Why has it not been left in the hands of the District Court altogether?  Why has not the issuing of liquor licences been left in the hands of the District Court rather than engaging in table tennis legislation &mdash; if you do not get it one place you can go back to the other and if you do not get it in that place you can go back to the other, an ever spiralling piece of bureaucratic nonsense?  If this is one way of creating more jobs in the Civil Service let the Minister say so.  I am not against the creation of more jobs, but I am against the confusion of existing procedures.</P>
    <P>When we have laws adjudicated on in regard to liquor licences they should be <Col N="2098" /> up front before the District Court, having it out in public.  I say that with no disrespect to the Revenue Commissioners, who fulfil an important if intimidating role in our society.  That is where we should have our laws adjudicated upon. I accept that the procedures may appear to be simple ones, but I can foresee an awful lot of hardship and confusion being brought about under that system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mary Harney has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the siting of the national waste disposal dump at Baldonnel, County Dublin.  The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought for some weeks now to have this matter discussed in the Dáil ever since the Minister for the Environment made a statement that the was now to review the need for the development of a national waste disposal centre at Brownsbarn, Baldonnel.  I was delighted to know that the Minister had at last decided to review this proposal. However, I must admit that I, together with many people who live in this area, have become somewhat sceptical of this review in view of the fact it was announced in advance of the local elections and that the Minister does not seem to be prepared to give any kind of commitment other than that he is reviewing the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that is good enough. It is now over three years since the Government announced their intention to provide a national waste disposal centre at this location near the densely populated areas of Tallaght, Clondalkin, the villages of Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle.  During that time the Minister and the Minister's Department, together with the firm of Danish consultants who were employed by the Department of the <Col N="2099" /> Environment, have had a considerable amount of time and have had expertise available to them to finalise their plans and to tell us, once and for all, what their proposals are in relation to this site.</P>
    <P>I, together with many of the local people in the area, have tried in the Dáil, at county council level and elsewhere to seek information to clarify what exactly the nature of the development at Baldonnel was.  As late as last March I was told by the Minister, in reply to a Dáil question, that the National Building Agency &mdash; the group charged with the development of this facility &mdash; had now prepared their plans, that these plans were with the Department and that they would shortly be lodged with the county council.  In view of that statement by the Minister in reply to a Dáil question last March we have become somewhat cynical of his recent announcement that he might review the possibility of providing this facility.  So far as I or anybody else can encourage him to change his mind, I want to do that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provision of a national waste disposal centre is not the correct way to proceed with the treatment of dangerous waste in this country. We have at the moment in use in Ireland 27 dangerous substances which in the main are being used by about 52 manufacturing industries.  Approximately 40 of these companies have come from the United States.  They have not come here because they like the Irish climate or because they want to provide muchneeded jobs; but they are here because they have not been allowed to locate those industries in their own countries.</P>
    <P>That is the primary reason they are here.  The second reason is that they have got very generous grant aid and tax concessions. Thirdly, they have come because they realise that we are a country with very low standards for dealing with pollution and the monitoring and controlling of dangerous and toxic materials. The most appropriate way of dealing with these chemicals is to have strict controls on the type of industry which can be located here.  Perhaps it is our craving to <Col N="2100" /> have three or four jobs here or there which has allowed us to be so lenient with many of these multinationals.  We have to accept the fact, however, that they are now here.  We have got to decide what is the best way to proceed in dealing with their toxic waste.</P>
    <P>I believe that each local authority should be responsible for monitoring and controlling the disposal of toxic waste material in their region and that the cost of disposing of these substances should be borne by the user that is, in most cases the multinational firms.  The most inappropriate way to proceed is to have only one central location.  In that way dangerous waste will be transported all over the country through densely populated areas.  This is a very irresponsible and danerous thing to do.</P>
    <P>We must also realise that our own fire authorities do not have the expertise resources or equipment to deal with any serious accident that might occur in the transportation of toxic waste.  Are we going to have large tankers travelling through densely populated areas with very bad roads and fire authorities who cannot cope in the event of an accident? We have been very lax in controlling and monitoring any of these substances.  The fire authorities have absolutely no idea what substances are being transported since tankers are not adequately labelled. I am not a toxicologist but I do not believe that it takes much knowledge of science to realise that the storage of 27 different dangerous substances together would be a highly dangerous prospect.</P>
    <P>Ireland has ratified the EC directive in relation to the treatment of these toxic and dangerous chemicals.  Paragraph 2 of that directive, S.I. No. 23 says:</P>
    <P>A special waste plan shall be designed to secure that toxic and dangerous waste is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment and, in particular, (a) without risk to water, air, plant or animals, (b) without causing a nuisance through noise or odours and (c) without adversely affecting the <Col N="2101" /> countryside or places of special interest.</P>
    <P>I want us to consider that very seriously, because the proposal is to locate a waste disposal centre at Baldonnel within a very short distance of Peamount Hospital, formerly a sanitorium, which with a recent increase in TB has again been dealing with many cases of TB in Ireland. It is very close to a school for spina bifida children.  Are we fulfilling the EC directive that we have been happy to endorse if we locate close to these two institutions a national waste disposal centre?  Of course, we are not.  The River Camac, which flows through this site, one of the only rivers in this part of Dublin, which is used widely by fishermen in the area, will be adversely affected by this.  Many people have been lobbying the local authority to look after this amenity.  Are we now to decide we will build a national waste disposal centre beside this river?</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council in their wisdom purchased a large acreage of land in close proximity to this site for a major regional park for the residents of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Saggart, Rathcoole and Newcastle areas of County Dublin.  Surely the location of a national waste disposal centre beside a major regional park is a frightening thought and would endanger the soil, the amenities and the environment of the area.  One must also be concerned, more than anything else in relation to this development, with the health of the people who have to live in the area.  This is one of the most densely populated regions in western Europe.  We have a population now of just under 90,000 and, as a result of the recently published ERDO study, that population will grow to over 150,000 people.  Surely the provision of a national waste disposal centre in an area so densely populated as this is not the correct way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The prevailing winds at Baldonnel are westerly.  I understand that this will result in fumes and odours being blown across the new towns of Clondalkin and Tallaght.  The people who live there are naturally very concerned about this prospect and do not want us to proceed with <Col N="2102" /> this toxic dump.  I believe the Minister must, before the local elections, make it clear to the people what he intends to do in relation to this matter.  When he employed his Danish consultants some time ago to help the NBA in drawing up the plan, I asked him to make that consultants' report available to the House.  He refused to do that.  He said it was confidential in so many respects.  I believe he refused to do so because perhaps the Danish consultants realise that the site at Baldonnel is not the most appropriate one for a national waste disposal centre.  I am sure they realise, as most people do, that an area so densely populated and so close to a hospital like Peamount and a school for spina-bifida children is not the correct area to locate a national waste disposal centre that may have to deal with 27 dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>We have for far too long ignored our planning laws.  We have had irresponsible and dangerous decisions made in many cases in relation to planning matters throughout the country.  We have made many planning mistakes in the past and thousands of people have had to live with those mistakes for many years.  Let us not make another mistake.  This land is zoned for the further development of agriculture. There are no public facilities provided close to this land in the line of water or sewerage services.  A site like that is not the appropriate one on which to locate a national waste disposal centre. This site is in very close proximity to the Department of Defence aerodrome at Baldonnel.  I do not know what the attitude of the Department of Defence is to this proposal, but I have not heard any opposition from them.</P>
    <P>For a considerable length of time the authorities in the Department of Defence have seen fit to object to individuals who come from that area trying to get houses built for themselves and their children. In one case they saw fit to object to a couple who were trying to have an old cottage rebuilt.  The objection was based, they said, on the fact that it would endanger aircraft.  Yet the Department have not made any noise about the possibility <Col N="2103" /> of a national waste disposal centre being erected in the vicinity.  Their position in that regard is irresponsible and I hope they do not remain silent on this proposal.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with toxic substances and the best way to do so is on the basis of having each local authority look after the toxic and dangerous substances being used in their area.  Taxpayers should not have to pay for the disposal of these substances. The authorities should monitor and control these substances and make sure they are appropriately dealt with. The users of dangerous and toxic substances should have to pay for their disposal.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will be able to enlighten us as to his plans in this regard.  Having read the bulk of the evidence submitted by many interested groups to his Department, I hope he will be convinced, as most others are, that the site at Baldonnel is not suitable, that this manner of dealing with toxic substances is not the appropriate way to proceed and that we need a regional policy approach in this regard.  In the current review I hope the Minister will consider consulting with the groups who have come together in the area, such as the Amalgamated Anti-Toxic Group who have asked time and again for meetings with Ministers and the Taoiseach to discuss the proposals.  Indeed when they heard of the Minister's decision to review the matter, they sought to be part of the review.  They asked the Minister to consider having some of their representatives involved in the review.  That is a reasonable request and it should be granted.</P>
    <P>A week or so ago the Minister for the Environment met with his British counterpart to discuss the disposal and treatment of dangerous substances, the pollution of our atmosphere, and the pollution of our seas and general environmental issues.  Great play was made about that meeting.  If he discussed the provision of a national waste disposal centre at Baldonnel he was told by his British counterpart that they did not have <Col N="2104" /> any interest in importing our toxic material.  We have been told by the Department of the Environment that, when the facility goes ahead at Baldonnel, the substances will be treated and exported to Britain to be processed.  I do not believe the British authorities have any interest in taking our dangerous substances and I have no doubt that the Minister was told that when he met the British authorities recently.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to outline how long the review will take, and if it will be completed in advance of the local elections.  If it is not, the people who live in the area who will be most adversely affected by this facility will look cynically at the Government and their candidates in the elections.  They are deeply concerned about the matter and see the latest statement about the review as simply another cynical political exercise which the Minister of State will I hope tell them is not the case.  I am concerned about the health of the people and the environment of our area.</P>
    <P>We have all read and heard of the evidence from other countries of the dangers involved in the treatment of toxic and dangerous materials.  We have seen the disasters that occurred and the lives that were lost.  We are lucky that we have not had any such disaster here.  If we proceed along the lines of the proposal for Baldonnel, it will not be long before we have disasters similar to those that occurred in other countries.  I hope the Minister can allay our fears and assure the people of the area that his Department will not proceed with the building of this facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for a central waste facility was accepted by the Government in 1981 having regard to the problems posed by lack of adequate facilities in the country for the disposal of hazardous industrial waste.  Industrial growth had given rise to a greatly increased volume and variety of wastes the safe disposal of which is a matter of serious and growing public concern.  There is a problem for industry, <Col N="2105" /> and an environment problem, if wastes cannot be disposed of satisfactorily.  Lack of suitable waste disposal outlets can hamper the operation of existing industries and inhibit the attraction of new ones at a time when the need to provide employment is a top priority.  In addition, the emergence of a number of EC Directives, and in particular a Directive on toxic and dangerous waste to which effect is given in the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, emphasises the need from an environmental viewpoint of developing proper disposal arrangements.</P>
      <P>Whilst most industrial wastes, including many of the wastes listed in the EC Directive on Toxic and Dangerous Waste, can safely be disposed of on suitable landfill sites, there are some which require treatment or incineration prior to disposal.  There are no public treatment or incineration facilities here and considerable quantities of potentially dangerous wastes are exported for disposal in the UK.  A number of the larger industries producing hazardous waste have their own in-plant treatment facilities or have well-established export arrangements. Disposal problems arise mainly for firms producing relatively small quantities of waste.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that new arrangements are required for a relatively small amount of hazardous waste mainly in the form of metal sludges, solvents and chemical wastes.  The idea was that the central facility would develop and streamline an export disposal service for such wastes on a national basis.  This would have added significance with the coming into operation in October 1985, of an EC Directive on Control and Supervision of Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Wastes.  The proposed centre was to provide for reception, storage and bulking up of wastes for export and not to serve as a dump or a permanent storage area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1982, a 14 acre site at Baldonnel, County Dublin, was acquired for the central waste facility by the National Building Agency which had been asked by the Minister for the Environment to undertake the development role.  Following <Col N="2106" /> protracted negotiations, the agency commissioned a Danish firm of international standing in toxic waste disposal to design and plan the facility.  It was first necessary to identify more precisely the quantities and types of wastes to be catered for and, while some information was available in national data banks, there was need for consultations with a considerable number of industrial interests in order to establish the up-to-date position regarding in-plant treatment capacities and export volumes and plans.</P>
    <P>While there have been some unavoidable delays, plans for a facility designed to the highest possible environmental and safety standards have now been virtually completed.  In the meantime, however, there have been developments which could have a bearing on the proposal. In particular, consultations with private sector interests have established that the waste disposal services now being provided have developed to a considerable degree since the central waste transfer station was decided upon and that there may well be an interest in expanding these services and providing new facilities. In addition, recent developments suggest that the continuing availability of the export option for certain wastes may be in question.  For these reasons, and because the planned facility would provide only part of the total hazardous waste disposal service needed by industry, we consider it essential that all aspects of the proposal should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>With a view to exploring further the possibility of developing other options for dealing with hazardous wastes, the Minister has invited interests concerned to submit to him any proposals they may have for the development of existing hazardous waste disposal services, or the establishment of new facilities to deal with these wastes.  Such proposals or facilities could relate to depots, transfer stations, or facilities for the incineration, solidification, recovery or other treatment of wastes.  We would be particularly interested to learn of possible joint-venture operations between existing Irish firms and firms which operate, or have <Col N="2107" /> access to a range of disposal facilities abroad.</P>
    <P>On foot of these invitations discussions are being arranged with a number of groups.  At this stage it is far too early to say what proposals if any may emerge. We have established a small expert group to assist those interested in development proposals, for example by giving them access to relevant information, to assess whatever proposals may emerge and to make recommendations to the Minister. We will consider on the basis of these recommendations to what extent we could assist in the development by private sector interests of suitable schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney referred to the multinationals and it is up to them to keep their own house in order.  What we are talking about is small industry who have problems in dealing with toxic waste.  The local authorities have a responsibility to arrange for the disposal of all waste, hazardous or otherwise.  We cannot run away from this problem.  It is like many problems about which people want something done, they do not want it done in their own areas.  I understand the fears of people and I will not minimise them but what is proposed is a facility for the disposal of toxic waste.  It is not a disposal unit.  It is a facility to monitor the disposal of toxic waste.  If we did not do that we could put people at risk.  The Government and local authorities must take a responsible attitude.</P>
    <P>Since the 1981 decision the situation has changed in industry.  We are getting to a stage where a firm decision must be taken.  We are now in the process of reviewing the possibilities, meeting interested bodies and so on to see if what is proposed is relevant.  I cannot tell Deputy Harney at this stage that the Baldonnel proposal has been forgotten.  The proposal is being looked at in a reasonable manner.  The situation has changed.  That is why we are asking interested groups to make suggestions.  We wish to allay the concern of people but a facility must be obtained to ensure that we no longer dispose of toxic waste in a haphazard way <Col N="2108" /> which could be dangerous to life.  I have covered the Deputy's question by saying that the proposal is being reviewed.</P>

I assure the House that we are not taking precipitate action for short term purposes.</P>

Details of the location of various projects are not available.  The main organisations which benefit from the Social Fund are AnCO, IDA, SFADCo, Udarás na Gaeltachta, CERT, YEA, NRB, the Department of Education and the National Manpower Service of the Department of Labour.  (ii) Grants are awarded to firms in the food sector under the guidance section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  These grants were made under Regulation 17/64 and since January 1978 are made under Regulation 355/77. They are aimed at improving structural efficiency in the marketing and processing of agricultural and fish products in the Community.  Since 1973 grants have been awarded to 48 projects in the Dublin area:</P>

Payment ceased after that date as he had less than the required minimum of 156 paid contributions since his entry into insurance to entitle him to further payment.  In order to re-qualify for payment of benefit it is necessary for him to resume insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid for a minimum of thirteen weeks.</P>
      <P>It is understood from the South Eastern Health Board which administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the Wexford area that the person concerned has not applied for this allowance.  It is open to him to apply for this allowance by contacting his community welfare officer at his local health centre.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  The social welfare officer completed his report on 26 March 1985 and stated that the applicant had failed to furnish details of his wife's earnings.</P>
      <P>His case was referred to a social welfare officer again on 19 April 1985 to afford applicant a further opportunity of co-operating in the investigation of his means.  These inquiries were completed recently and he has now been assessed with means of £40.60 weekly derived from the benefit of his wife's earnings.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £31.65 weekly the appropriate rate £72.25 less means £40.60.  All arrears due to him will be paid this week and weekly payments of £31.65 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person named was not eligible for sheep headage under the 1984 disadvantaged areas scheme because his off-farm income exceeded the limit of £3,500 then applicable.  He will, however, be paid his advance under the EC 1984-85 ewe premium scheme as soon as the batch which contains his payment is processed.</P>
