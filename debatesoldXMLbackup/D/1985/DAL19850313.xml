    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of the Debate last evening I had made the point that the Government had indulged in a rather sophisticated form of conjuring in the budget.  I had been saying that the arithmetic of the budget seems to be extraordinary, especially in respect of the figure arrived at for the average number in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance &mdash; 217,000.  I had made the point that this seems incredible.  Unless the Government have some magic wand by which they can bring about that sort of situation, it is not credible but the budget offers no solution to the problem.  If the Government have a massive remedy to the greatest social evil of our time why are they keeping that remedy a secret?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government pride themselves on their credibility, honesty and consistency but their arithmetic does not add up.  In the absence of an enormous increase in employment creation, the scenario presented by this Bill is not realistic.  I do not believe that the Government have <Col N="2202" /> one worthwhile idea to even attempt to bring about such a change.  Therefore, one must conclude that they used false figures deliberately to mislead the House. Instead of catering for an average of 217,000 unemployed, the Bill should be catering for upwards of 240,000.  In the prevailing circumstances, the higher figure would be much more realistic, honest and effective.</P>
    <P>Recently Deputy O'Kennedy asked the Minister for Health and Social Welfare what would be the additional cost to the Exchequer if the number in receipt of social welfare payments were to increase to 230,000.  The Minister replied that an extra £31 million would be required in that event.  Deputy O'Kennedy then asked what the increased demand would be if the number increased to 235,000 and he was told that an extra £43.5 million would be required and that in the event of the number increasing to 240,000, which is the most likely average for the year, the additional amount required would be £56 million.  Given that situation, the Minister and the Government are deliberately concealing an additional £40 million to £50 million expense and burden that will have to be carried by the taxpayer as a direct consequence of Government policies. The conjuring trick is to pretend that matters are much better than they really are.  In that way the Government are holding back some of the bitter pills until later.  The attitude is, &ldquo;give them the medicine in doses so that it may be sugar coated&rdquo;.  The Minister knows that the figures underpinning this Bill are false, unrealistic and designed deliberately to mislead the House.  They render the Bill irrelevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said that the figures are false, that the Minister knows that and that the make up of the Bill is designed deliberately to mislead the House.  Both of those statements are unparliamentary and must be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the wording but it is intriguing and amazing <Col N="2203" /> that the figures being used and which have been confirmed by the Taoiseach have not been withdrawn by the Government. Any reasonable person must agree that the conclusions reached in the budget are extraordinary in the extreme and that eventually they will be seen to make the Bill irrelevant.  It is obvious that substantial supplementary estimates will be necessary later in the year, in other words, a mini budget.</P>
      <P>If the figures are erroneous as a result of the drawing unwittingly of certain conclusions, the Government must review the arithmetic and decide whether there is a more realistic approach to the overall state of affairs.  One very disturbing aspect of this Bill relates to the rates of increases.  While speaking on the budget on 6 February last, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare said, as reported at columns 1833 and 1834 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office they gave a firm commitment, despite the gravity of the recession and its impact on social welfare expenditure, to endeavour to maintain the living standards of all people who depend on social welfare for their needs. </P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; should be deleted because everyone knows that the Government gave an unequivocal and unqualified commitment that that situation would obtain.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>Thus, this budget has ensured that the living standards of social welfare recipients will not only continue to be protected until mid-1986 but it has also protected the real improvement in their living standards which has been brought about by this Government in office. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the rates of increase to both short term and long term recipients as provided for in this Bill, we must ask whether the provisions reflect accurately the euphoria expressed by the Minister on 6 February last.  I say they <Col N="2204" /> do not reflect anything of that sort and should be withdrawn.  They can be regarded only as inaccurate and misleading statements.</P>
    <P>The increases respectively of 6 and 6½ per cent represent, when annualised for the tax year 1985-86, about 4½ and 4¾ per cent.  This is an insult to the most vulnerable and voiceless in the community. The Minister has gone out of his way to juggle the figures and to bring forward compound increases.  Both he and the Tánaiste, speaking on the budget, used the term, &ldquo;compound increases&rdquo;.  One can draw a number of conclusions following an exercise with statistics but the conclusions drawn might not correspond directly to the real situation.  The Minister says his Party gave a firm commitment to maintain the living standards of our people.  I would remind him that that was an unqualified commitment.  However, the Minister omitted to say that his party have reneged on that commitment in the past two and a half years.  They have broken their word and have let down the underprivileged.  They have been unwilling to deal with the indifference of their Coalition partners in this area.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable person will admit that a sum of £69.65 unemployment assistance for a husband, wife and two children is totally inadequate to meet their needs. Four people have to be clothed and fed. The children must have money for school expenses and must have bus fares to get to and from school.  Two bags of coal will cost £16 per week.  Rent to Dublin Corporation under the differential rent scheme will cost between £6 and £7 a week for an income of that kind.  ESB bills will cost an average of £10 per week and after all these costs there is very little left to feed and clothe the four people involved.  It is quite certain that a family in such circumstances will face the prospect of having the electricity supply disconnected on a number of occasions throughout the year.  The percentage increase the Minister is proposing will do nothing meaningful to make up for the shortfall in the means of such a family.</P>
    <P>In 1980, 1981 and 1982 social welfare recipients received an increase of 25 per <Col N="2205" /> cent per annum from the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was a clear recognition that the base in respect of these rates was most inadequate and that it needed to be increased significantly.  In the three years in question Fianna Fáil gave a total increase of 75 per cent and it was a reasonable effort to come to grips with the serious problem of poverty.  I emphasise again that we are talking about the base and the important point is whether the base is adequate to meet the needs of people.  If the base is adequate a small percentage increase will be sufficient to cover increases in the cost of living but when the base is so low and when it has been allowed to diminish even further in the past two and a half years the percentage increase needs to be much greater.</P>
    <P>It is an inescapable fact that the increases on offer here are miserly and insulting.  They do not take account of the increases in the cost of living in the past year, never mind the severe increases imposed in the budget.  Last year was an extremely harsh year for those on social welfare.  The miserly increases annualised at about 4½ per cent or 5 per cent and left people in a most unenviable plight.  In addition, they had to swallow the bitter pill of the halving of the food subsidies, the increase in electricity prices and the radical diminution in the form and extent of assistance under the supplementary benefit scheme.  Yet, members of the Minister's party went around the Dublin constituencies telling people they were the party who could best look after them.  Consistently they kept trying to convince themselves and delude others into accepting that the Labour Party were not in any way responsible for the plight of the poor.  I have spoken to some of my colleagues in the House and it appears that this was common practice throughout the greater urban area of Dublin.  I always understood the Minister was a member of the Labour Party but the party followers who are active in the constituencies do not seem to be too convinced of that fact.  On the other hand, perhaps they do not want to be aware of it.  Perhaps they are embarrassed at the abysmal performance of <Col N="2206" /> their party in Government and are ashamed of and feel let down by the disgusting and insulting increases in social welfare provided for in this Bill and which were also provided for in two previous Bills from the same Minister.  Perhaps their only option is to fudge the issue and to try to convince people they are very concerned.</P>
    <P>In the past two years this Government have abolished the gains that our party had made in respect of the help we gave to those on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability pension or old age pension.  It is a sorry plight for those who sadly were duped by the very hollow promises of the parties in Government during the election campaign.  They were told they would get doses of honesty but these doses may be fatal.  On 6 February last the Minister stated in this House in relation to social welfare payments that what they had done there was &ldquo;an achievement of which I am proud&rdquo;.  Has he asked the people on the receiving end of his medicine if they are proud of what he has given them?  I am not sure they would agree with his sentiments in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was always the practice of previous Governments that social welfare increases were paid out about 1 April each year.  However, in 1983 the Government broke from that practice and left all social welfare recipients without the much-needed increase until the beginning of July.  The new practice was carried through into 1984 and it will obtain again this year.  A delay in payment in these cases is very harsh and cruel and is a stubborn refusal to help the people who are already in poverty to enable them to cope with the additional increases in the cost of living that come directly as a result of any budget.  We must not forget that such increases come into effect well in advance of social welfare increases.</P>
    <P>We have 10 per cent VAT on footwear for the first time.  The 1981 attempt to do this brought down the then Coalition Government and that was certainly right and proper.  VAT on clothing has been increased from 8 per cent to 10 per cent. Coal, gas and electricity will be dearer <Col N="2207" /> for everyone because of the VAT increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. All these additional burdens have to be endured for at least four or five months by people who are already on the poverty line before an extra penny is given to them.</P>
    <P>When speaking in this House on 31 January last the only solace the Tánaiste had to offer was the following:</P>
    <P>What we have done is to ensure that all such benefits at least match inflation over the period they are intended to cover... </P>
    <P>My view is that the Tánaiste was wrong in that statement.  It was not accurate or correct.  Secondly, he made absolutely no attempt to justify the continued delay in payment of social welfare benefits in successive budgets from this Government and in his speech yesterday the Minister made no attempt to justify it either.  Such an attitude can only be regarded as irresponsible from the leader of the Labour Party and the Minister and it is most insensitive to the needs of the poor.  The Labour Party always spoke about the most needy in our community but they appear to have betrayed the legitimate aspirations of the voiceless and the defenceless among us.  They are anxious to cling to power at the expense of those people.</P>
    <P>The net result is that thousands of people will be driven deeper into poverty and debt.  It is very easy to push a man further into debt when he is already in debt. It is very easy to push a man further into the muck when he is already in the gutter. The attitude seems to be that if he does not like it down there he can jump aboard the emigrant ship.  However, the problem is that many of the poor do not even have that choice.  I have spoken to many people in the past 12 months who have informed me of their increasing debt problems, problems that in many instances arose because of grossly inadequate finance to meet the day-to-day running of their homes and to provide for their families.  I accept that in cases there is <Col N="2208" /> very bad management in the home and that very definitely contributed to it. However, day after day and week after week throughout 1984 stories abounded relating to the curtailment of the supplementary benefit scheme &mdash; for example, the alterations in the guidelines for eligibility to assistance for school uniforms, the almost total abolition of assistance to the poor, the unemployed, the widowed and the sick with the payment of ESB bills &mdash; yet at the same time the price of fuel was rising substantially.  This Government seemed totally incapable or unwilling to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of the scenes that obtained in the health centres around Dublin last year.  Because of all the difficulties and curtailments and because so many people who were formerly eligible lost eligibility to assistance with school uniforms, renewal of medical cards and so on, there were considerable protests.  I do not agree with those protests; I think they were wrong.  Anybody who occupies a health centre is not helping the situation.  Nevertheless, this showed the extent of hostility and opposition to Government decisions.  In many cases while there might have been ringleaders who were not entitled but who were there to cause trouble, this demonstrated to me that there was a very real and serious level of poverty that was not being met.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of scenario the Minister must have witnessed because I know a number of deputations went to him from the people in health centres in Dublin North-East, Dublin North-Central and Dublin Central, seeking assurances that some of the directives that had emanated from his Department to the superintendents in the health boards would be withdrawn so that the rigidity being applied to entitlements would be eased.  There was very little evidence towards the end of the year that any action had been taken.  That is the kind of nightmare the people in poverty and in need had to face and anyone who tries to deny it is flying in the face of reality because the facts are there.  All these things appear to have happened primarily <Col N="2209" /> because this Minister and his Government introduced massive cutbacks in the funding of social welfare services through the local health boards.</P>
    <P>The situation was repeatedly compounded by the constant passing of the buck.  There was categorical denial after denial from the Department that there was any responsibility.  If it was not emanating from the Department, then the health board officials were very confused. They were being asked to administer this scheme but they were attempting to administer it and meet the guidelines which, under their calculations, appeared to be totally inadequate.  Despite all the attempts the Minister has made over the last six to nine months to explain that situation away, he certainly has not succeeded and he should try again because there is a great deal of confusion about this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and his party in Government were seriously concerned about the plight of the poor and the extent of poverty so obvious to anybody prepared to look at the situation fairly, honestly and openly, then they would throw out the miserly, cruel and unfair increases proposed in this Bill.  It is quite obvious that the Labour Party no longer have any feelings or care for those most dependent on caring Governments.  It seems they have no longer any stomach to take on the right wing policies of Fine Gael and bring a semblance of decency and concern to what has been a two year nightmare of Government and is likely to be even harsher and more insensitive in the days ahead in 1985.</P>
    <P>To me there is no justification for the postponement or delay in the payment of increases to social welfare recipients.  The Minister will have an opportunity at 6.40 p.m. today to address this matter comprehensively. I will be very anxious to listen to what he has to say and then judge for myself whether he is genuinely attempting to justify something for which there does not appear to be any justification. He is the person who made the decision, so perhaps he will have something more to say about it.</P>
    <P>If a budget brings in provisions that <Col N="2210" /> cause increases in the cost of living, directly or indirectly, and if some of these increases are brought on board immediately, then the necessary measures should be taken to cater for those people who are unemployed, sick, or aged and those on low incomes who cannot benefit from the other provisions in the budget. I am referring now to a statement made by the Taoiseach when speaking on the budget.  He was telling us how different categories could make up for increases in deductions in their wages.  He pointed out that there were various mechanisms in the budget which would enable people to offset one thing against another.  When I asked him what mechanisms were there for the social welfare recipients to enable them to offset these increases immediately or within a reasonable period, he had no response to make.</P>
    <P>In my view it is most unjust and very harsh to leave these people six months suffering the hardships of budgetary decisions before the Social Welfare Bill makes provision to give them a miserly increase.  There is no defence for such a policy and the fact that it is being put into operation for the third successive year is a terrible indictment of any Government. I call on them to change this provision. I appeal to the Minister to pay these increases on 1 April, as happened in the past.  This is only fair to social welfare recipients because budgets are usually brought into the House at the end of January or the beginning of February and it is not unreasonable to suggest that consideration should be given to paying the increases to social welfare recipients almost immediately after the budget.  As I said earlier, there are always provisions in the budget which cause a reaction outside and which cause an immediate, although sometimes only slight, increase in the cost of goods and services.  To enable the poor to meet these increases it is only common decency that we, as legislators, provide for them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The more one examines the record of this Government the more one is intrigued by their attitude to social policy concerning children and the family.  In <Col N="2211" /> the Social Welfare Bill, 1983, absolutely no increase was given in children's allowances.  Later that year both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste floated views regarding the means testing or taxing of these allowances.  Such statements left many people aghast at the time, but some concluded that rash statements of this kind did not necessarily reflect intent or policy for the future.  Although 1984 saw a 7 per cent increase in children's allowances, it was deferred until August and therefore took effect for only eight months of the year.  It amounted therefore to 14p per child per week over the full year.  That is miserly, derisory and insulting.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Social Welfare Bill makes no reference to children's allowances.  Again our children are forgotten.  This Government never fail to amaze me.  They talk long into the night about the need for the stay at home wife to have an income &mdash; they were going to champion that cause &mdash; yet they show a total lack of sensitivity to the fact that the children's allowance is the only income many women get directly into their own hands and over which they have control.  Anybody proposing to diminish this income potential for the housewife certainly has not equity in mind, indeed certainly has not fairness to the housewife in mind.  It is obvious to most people that this Government propose to abolish the system of children's allowances at the earliest possible opportunity. They would have done it this year if they thought they would get away with it, but they realised the backlash would be too severe.  This form of income for the stay at home housewife has been chopped drastically over the past couple of years, having been reduced by nearly 30 per cent in real terms since the time of the last Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>In the previous couple of years Fianna Fáil had significantly increased the allowance to bring it more into line with Europe.  They recognised that substantial increases were necessary, but all advances made in this area have been abolished by this Government.  In 1982 the rate was £11.25 per child per month.  The present <Col N="2212" /> Minister, who was then an Opposition Deputy, said that the rate should be £11.25 per week and not £11.25 per month.  The Minister's actions in this Bill show an extraordinary inconsistency.  It says a lot for conviction, honesty and credibility.  It defies reasoning that the Minister, having issued such a definitive statement in 1982, should now as a result of Government policy refuse to grant the slightest increase.  It does not make sense. I am convinced that this Government are anti-family.  They must realise how important the children's allowance is to the housewife.  The Government's pronouncements about care for the housewife and the family are shown to be just posturings.  Indeed, where is the voice of the Minister for Women's Affairs?  She should be here championing this cause.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago on the Finance Bill I said that this Government will never be believed again.  Coming up to the election of November 1982 they made promise after promise and said that we were inconsistent, lacked credibility and care and concern for people.  All they have offered to the public over the past two and a half years in Government is derision, cynicism and insult.  They are offering total indifference to the most underprivileged and the most needy in our community.  If the Government were serious about keeping family provisions in line with inflation the children's allowance would be in excess of £15.50 and not at the rate of £12.05.  That is an enormous difference for people who are trying to eke out a meagre existence.  It must be clear to the public that his type of problem falls on deaf ears as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a very serious problem and the trauma for people affected is very great as is the trauma arising from sickness and inability to work.  People who lose their jobs take it as a life shattering blow.  They find it extremely difficult to cope with it.  People who are sick for long periods become depressed.  Despite the fact that most people like a holiday, 90 to 95 per cent of these people are anxious to work although they are often derided as people who do not want to <Col N="2213" /> work.  These people find idleness boring, depressing and demoralising.  Their problems are compounded by the Department of Social Welfare.  The assessment of means and the processing of claims for unemployment assistance generally takes anything from two to four months.  I have come across cases where the process took more than six months.  When a person comes off the unemployment benefit scheme he has to apply for supplementary welfare assistance to the health board.  It is great that that scheme is there to cater for the interim period but the period of waiting for a decision and the issuing of payments has been increasing noticably in recent months.  This is very inconvenient and embarrassing for the applicant. Such long delays should not be tolerated and the Minister should take steps to ensure that all cases are processed within a matter of weeks and not months and that assessment for supplementary welfare assistance takes place well in advance of the termination of unemployment benefit so that the transition can be smooth and efficient.  This is the very least that people can expect.  Many of these people have contributed social welfare payments for up to 20 or 30 years and when they find themselves unemployed &mdash; in many instances for the first time &mdash; they are treated as if they did not matter. People attending my clinics have complained about being left in a limbo for months.  Not alone are there delays in the payment of unemployment benefit but it takes up to six months to decide on appeals whether they relate to termination of sickness benefit or the imposition of penalties on recipients.  I do not disagree with the imposition of penalties on recipients who abuse the system.  I am heartened by the Minister's statement that he will undertake to curb the abuses and I am glad that he has taken up the comprehensive provisions introduced by Deputy Woods in dealing with abuses when he was Minister.  Nonetheless the delays of up to six months in the payment of increases under the social welfare code are not acceptable.  I appeal again to the Minister to look at the rate of increases being offered and I would ask him to <Col N="2214" /> look at the delays in payments.  They are unjust and cruel.  Neither I nor my party could stand over these delays.  The Minister should bring the payments forward to 1 April or earlier.  Perhaps these alternations are not possible for administrative reasons but a decision could be made and people could get the payments retrospectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is the budget for the needy.  I welcome the general increases of 6 per cent and 6½ per cent respectively for short and long term benefits.</P>
      <P>At present we have a social welfare commission.  The role of Deputies in outlining difficulties in the social welfare code is totally underrated and underutilised. We do not need a commission when Deputies have a first hand knowledge of the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The difference between the long term and the short term rates of payment must be discussed.  Unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare assistance, DPMA and all the means tested allowances need to be looked at.  A half a percentage differential between the two rates is not correct.  Hardship is arising where the assistance rates are applied and in future years I would like to see as much as a 2 per cent differential between the assistance increases and the benefit increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to administration in the Department of Social Welfare, I have often been criticised as being a Deputy who tables a huge number of written questions.  I will withdraw all of those questions if I get a similar service, accountable within a given period from the Department.  That service is not there.  The administration in the Department needs severe monitoring.  Invariably constituents who come to me have written and telephoned the Department without response.  In terms of consumer satisfaction, the Department does not rank highly with the other State Departments. While there has been an improvement, the nature of the work the Department do is extremely urgent and officials in the Department often do not realise that.  The Minister should set up <Col N="2215" /> some monitoring committee in relation to the operation of the Department.</P>
    <P>To get unemployment assistance one must satisfy three criteria.  One must be capable of work, available for work and one must be means tested.  Somewhere something has gone radically wrong.  Self-employed people such as fisherman, painters, and gardeners get seasonal work in the summer, but when it comes to the winter they are assessed for what they earned in the summer even though the money is spent.  I had a case recently of a married man with seven children being granted £17 a week and on appeal there was no change.  There will be such cases because of the 12 month assessment, which is unfair.  Small farmers do not have to be available for work.  They have their land set.  There is a set figure submitted. Factually, everything is in order but their figures are not accepted in the means test.  There is something radically wrong.  There is a lack of uniformity and there are severe delays between the social welfare officer's report and the chief appeals officer in the Department.  There should be a standardisation of the means testing for unemployment assistance cases.  Similarly with young people in terms of the assessment of board and lodging in relation to unemployment assistance, it seems to be arbitrary and discriminatory with total lack of uniformity, and the Minister should look at it so that real hardship cases can be met.</P>
    <P>There are three long term measures I should like to see initiated.  First is the retirement age for pensions.  At the moment it is 65 years, 66 years for non-contributory cases.  I think a study should be carried out in an effort to reduce the age to 60 years.  On a labour market study I understand that on a once off basis this would create 10,000 jobs.  I should like to know what the cost would be.  If it would not be cost effective on the pensions side, would it be possible to treat retirement pensions for recipients between the ages of 60 and 65 years in such a way as to increase their net total pension so that it would be more attractive for them to retire early?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> Another reform I should like to see is in relation to PRSI.  Employers at present pay 12.1 per cent.  The average cost of employers' PRSI contributions could be 10 per cent of the operating surplus of most companies, that is, their profits. However, in labour intensive industries such as construction and tourism employers' PRSI can be as high as 40 per cent of their operating surplus.  This means that the more people employed the more PRSI the employer pays.  In straightforward terms this is a tax on employment because the more you employ the more you pay.  It is not consistent with all the incentives and inducements for the creation of employment.  I should like to see a radical reform of the PRSI system.  It should be combined with PAYE but without confining the total cost of PRSI to employees.  I should like to see the implementation of the recommendation of the Commission on Taxation of a 5 per cent social security tax across the board. PRSI should not be operated in its present form, which is a tax on employment.</P>
    <P>Casual work is in need of immediate attention through the employment exchanges.  To all intents and purposes they are unemployment exchanges.  There is no co-operation with the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency or AnCO so that the exchanges would be enabled to give employment. The exchanges are purely dole offices.  As well as the nixers, there is the problem of employers like farmers and small businesses who want to give temporary work over two or three weeks.  They cannot do it because if they take on somebody who is on unemployment assistance they stamp his card, they pay him his money and when the work has been finished and the person goes to reclaim unemployment assistance he is sent for a means test and it will be five or six weeks before money will become available again.  This is not consistent with the inducements to create employment in our system.  Such people refuse such work but they do it as a nixer.  An employer should be able to go along to an exchange and ask to be given a person to do a temporary job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2217" /> The exchange could even pay the person's wages and recoup them later.  There must be some such way to deal with casual work because the red tape attached to casual employment is so difficult that it sends people to do nixers.  No increases in penalties and fines will solve the problem.  The State agencies must operate such a system through the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>There are many anomolies in the social welfare code which I should like to refer to.  It is totally unfair that widows of under 66 years should be treated differently from those who are more than 66 years.  Widows with young families are more in need than those older than 66, yet all the fringe benefits, free electricity, free travel, free telephone rental and so on are given to widows who are older than 66 years.  Another glaring anomaly is deserted wifes' allowances and benefits.  One of the conditions is that the wife be deserted &mdash; if she deserts, if she is battered and beaten and has to leave, she will be refused an allowance.  She must sit and suffer and wait.  The only circumstances in which she will get an allowance is if the husband leaves her.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there would be a one word change in the clause so that both deserted and deserting wives would be allowed such payments.  I have come across some appalling cases of women who have had to leave their husbands because of drink related problems and gone into caravans with three or four children.  They are in need of rehousing because the husbands will not give up the houses.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly is the free telephone rental.  I know a person who is in a wheelchair, permanently incapacitated, but he has been refused a telephone allowance because his wife lives with him &mdash; he is expected to manage on his own.  Everybody in the house must either be sick or be younger than 18 years.  How farcical could a scheme be?  A small minor amendment would change this anomalous position.</P>
    <P>UK retirement pensioners get the free telephone rental but UK invalidity pensioners do not.  Here invalidity pensioners <Col N="2218" /> get it.  I should like to see invalidity pensioners from Britain enjoying the same benefits if they live here.  Another glaring unfairness is the way the code treats children who have left school or who are about to.  Take a person who leaves school between the ages of 15 and 18 years.  Those children cannot get unemployment assistance until they are more than 18 years.  If those people cannot get work there is no benefit for them.  People who are slow learners or persons who do the leaving certificate after the age of 18 years have the dependant's allowance or the children's allowance cut off at the age of 18 years.  Families whose only source of income is social welfare have to put these children out to school or go begging to the health board for a few pounds. Therefore, we have two anomalies under the social welfare code in those who leave school too early and those who leave it too late.  I ask the Minister to address himself to this area which was referred to the Costello report on youth affairs. Young people in these circumstances should get a £15 per week allowance.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the unfair position regarding free fuel.  A married couple over 66 years of age with an income of £63.05 a week non-contributory old age pension, or £84.25 per week contributory old age pension qualify for free fuel but a similar couple who are under 66 years of age on unemployment assistance whose income is at least £10 less at £54.70 a week do not qualify for free fuel.  There is no justice in such a system.  I tell the Minister that for future years I welcome the increase in the free fuel allowance from £3 to £4 and I ask that unemployment assistance cases would qualify for free fuel.  They are the recipients of a very low social welfare income and if they are depending on the discretion of superintendent community welfare officers they will not get much satisfaction. Will a court case some months ago whereby someone on unemployment assistance got free fuel have an effect on next year's operation of the scheme?</P>
    <P>There is no reciprocal arrangement between Northern Ireland and the Republic for free travel.  It is farcical that <Col N="2219" /> people travelling on a Dublin-Belfast train with a free travel pass must stop at Dundalk and then pay for the rest of the journey, and <i>vice versa.</i> Surely we could come to some arrangement with our neighbours rather than retain this partitionist mentality.</P>
    <P>Another area of difficulty in the social welfare code is that of the self-employed. Only after 156 weeks compulsory employee-type PRSI employment can a person who becomes self-employed make voluntary PRSI contributions.  Any self-employed person &mdash; a taxi driver is a good example &mdash; can be involved in a car accident or become ill, and then how are his family to manage?  He has no recourse to social welfare because he is self-employed. The self-employed have families to keep and we are trying to encourage people to set up small businesses and become self-employed through the enterprise allowance scheme.  Surely it is only reasonable that this Minister would introduce some form of voluntary PRSI for the self-employed.  At present all they are entitled to under social welfare are pensions, widows and orphans pension, deserted wife's allowance and death benefit if they have paid the maximum PRSI.  Disability benefit should be covered for them.  These people are prepared to pay the full employer and employee rates.</P>
    <P>In the present climate of redundancies there is a great advent of worker cooperatives and people setting up on their own.  When Clover Meats in County Wexford went to the wall six men in middle management set up Drover Meats, a new enterprise.  They signed for six weeks.  They were not entitled to a penny from the State because the enterprise allowance scheme operates on the basis of 13 weeks on the live register and they could not claim two days a week social welfare.  They will make no money until the business has been in operation for 18 months.  People trying to set up small businesses should be entitled to claim on a two-day week basis officially and not at the goodwill of some social <Col N="2220" /> welfare officer, and the enterprise allowance scheme criterion should be changed from 13 to six weeks.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the area of geriatric care and the operation of the prescribed relative's allowance clause.  At the moment the prescribed relative's allowance payment stands at £23.10 and nobody else under the social welfare code receives such a low payment.  Here we are talking about daughters or nieces, very often single, who gave up their jobs in order to look after elderly people.  What is the alternative?  State geriatric care can cost anything from £200 to £400 a week, and the State gives £23.10 to the woman who undertakes to mind her grandmother or her mother or her aunt.  If these women did anything else they would get at least £31 a week.  Surely the State has it both ways here.  I would like to see a radical review of the prescribed relative's allowance system.  The clause relating to who lives with the incapacitated pensioner should be revised.  At the moment the only person who can live with the incapacitated pensioner to be eligible for the prescribed relative's allowance is the prescribed relative, unless the relative has children under 18 years of age.  Also I would like to see the rate increased.  The State benefits by major saving here when people are kept out of geriatric hospitals and tended in their homes and in the community on a family basis.</P>
    <P>I turn to a number of areas of operational difficulty in the Department where there is a pervading atmosphere of meanness and lack of sympathy and attention to certain urgent cases.  Take the availability for work clause for unemployment benefit for married women.  I refer especially to the young married woman who was working before she married and now has one child.  She goes back to work and then finds herself unemployed.  The Department of Social Welfare consider that such women are not available for work because they are minding their young children.  The women claim for benefit, are refused and appeal and sometimes their appeal is refused.  They are not advised that they can go to the <Col N="2221" /> National Manpower Service to be registered, get their mother-in-law to write in saying that she will look after the child, go to three employers who can certify that this person has sought work which is not available, and if they do all that they will qualify for the allowance.  A sympathetic person operating an employment exchange might well give a married mother such advice, whereas in another area such women would not receive that advice and the benefit would be refused to them.  With every such refusal a circular should issue to women who are refused on the ground of availability for work advising them of their right to supply proof and evidence of their availability for work to the Department.</P>
    <P>The second area of operational difficulty is disability benefit and the capability for work clause.  Some people who have been on disability benefit for five or six years on monthly certificates are being referred to medical referees.  They have appointments with them but barely get a word in edgeways.  The medical referees tend to be slightly abrupt.  The people are notified that they have been cut off although the state of their health has not changed.  What are the implications? First of all, the Department are saying that the person's GP is a liar and has stated that the person is sick when he is not, which is unreasonable.  Secondly, the Department are saying that although the referee met a person on 1 February they will not be notified until 9 February and in between times the person can sing for his money.  The medical referee does not have the guts to tell the person on the day he meets them that they will be cut off from that day.  There are major operational difficulties in relation to this and gross miscarriages of justice.  Some GPs would be prepared to verify, on oath if necessary, that their patients are unable to work.  When it comes to rectifying the position what happens?  The Department say that before a person can go to an appeals officer he must go to a second medical referee.  In every case I have had any dealing with, the second medical referee backs up the decision of the first medical referee because they are both <Col N="2222" /> Department doctors.  People then have to obtain supplementary welfare assistance. Their certificates go backwards and forwards.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to call in the medical referees and tell them that although there may be people who are abusing the system there are others, particularly those over 55 years, who will never work again.  The Minister should ensure that in all future cases where a medical referee meets a recipient of disability benefit he should be informed that day whether he will continue to be given payment.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of community welfare officers and superintendent community welfare officers are fine, decent, reasonable people who are to be complimented because they do a very difficult job.  However, the amount of money involved means that these people are very powerful.  They have almost a total discretionary say over who is entitled to supplementary welfare assistance and, in relation to appeal cases, for the free fuel scheme.  They have a very big say in relation to medical card entitlement and rent assistance in the form of supplementary welfare.  In every district there are community welfare officers who have money to give out or not give out according to their opinion.  I have come across cases where there is a puzzling lack of standardisation between one community welfare officer and another.  In some cases there are very reasonable and generous community welfare officers and in other cases one would not get anything from them. These people are making arbitrary decisions on what are subjective matters. There are injustices.  Will applicants have any comeback through the Ombudsman in this regard?</P>
    <P>The Minister should appoint one officer from his Department per health board so that if a person had a grievance they could have an oral right of appeal. The reasons why a community welfare officer refused an applicant should be furnished to that applicant.  It is merely stated now that a person's means has been assessed as being over the limit.  No reason is given such as &ldquo;you are doing a <Col N="2223" /> bit of hairdressing on the side&rdquo; or &ldquo;you have money coming from your son-in-law&rdquo;. It would be a great help to applicants if the reasons were stated.</P>
    <P>There are differences between community welfare officers in the same county and between different counties in the same health board area.  There are also major differences between the health boards.  This is not fair and needs to be checked.  The Minister should step in and regulate this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reforms made by the Minister including the family income supplement, the enterprise allowance scheme, the social employment scheme and the optical and dental benefit payment to pregnant women through their spouses' insurance.  I look forward to the child benefit scheme and the report of the social welfare commission.  If the officers in the Department took up some of the points made in this debate which is, in effect, a budget for the needy and addressed themselves to introducing cost-effective minor measures that would remove inequities and anomalies, regardless of the overall rate of increase in social welfare benefits the image of the social welfare system would be greatly improved.  The greatest irritant among people is not necessarily that they are refused benefit but the fact that Mrs. Murphy down the road, who is much better off, received it.  We must address ourselves to rectifying that.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and draw the Minister's attention to those kinds of reforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Yates on a very constructive contribution to this debate.  The Minister told us yesterday that the purpose of the Bill was to give effect to the increases which had previously been announced and to stamp out abuses.  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that social welfare recipients receive sufficient money to obtain an adequate standard of living. The Government have failed miserably in this.  The social services are particularly vulnerable at a time of cutback and recession. This year, the Government failed completely to live up to the promises they made before and since they came to office.  When introducing the Social Welfare Bill in 1983 the Minister told us he recognised the difficulties social welfare recipients had and, as reported at column 2091 of the Official Report of 9 March, 1983 he said:</P>
      <P>However, I can assure Members of the House that as soon as circumstances permit, hopefully by next year's budget, it is my firm intention to secure further real improvements in social welfare payments. </P>
      <P>At that time the Minister was giving increases of between 10 and 12 per cent to long term and short term social welfare recipients.  Last year there was no improvement in the real income of social welfare recipients when the Government granted an increase of only 7 per cent. This year we are down to 6 and 6½ per cent for short term and long term recipients. That will not compensate such people for the increase in the cost of living, the removal of food subsidies, which hit them hard, and increases in VAT.  Indeed, a 6 per cent increase over nine months represents an annual increase of 4½ per cent. Those payments will not become effective until July.  The Government two years ago changed the date of payment of increases from the beginning of April to the beginning of July and this year it will be a fortnight later, 11 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that there was an <Col N="2225" /> increase for short term recipients of 25 per cent over the last three years since the Coalition took office.  That must be compared with an increase of 25 per cent each year in the last three years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  That is an indication of the difference in attitude to the less well off in our society, the elderly, the disabled and those unemployed, between the Coalition and Fianna Fáil. Yesterday the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This real improvement in the purchasing power of social welfare recipients has been achieved by the Government in the face of the most severe budgetary constraints facing any Government during the life-time of the Members of the House. </P>
    <P>If one examines that statement critically one will see that it does not stand up because an increase of 4½ per cent does not represent any real improvement over nine months.  That increase will not improve the lot of anybody depending on social welfare payments.  In the term of the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977 when Deputy Cluskey was Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Department of Social Welfare a claim like that was not made.  I suggest that the Minister confer with Deputy Cluskey and ask him if he believes the Government are living up to their responsibility in catering for the needs of those who depend on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We must remember that there are 234,000 people unemployed at present, an increase of 18,000 on last year's figure and 48,000 more than when the Government took office.  We must remember that 70,000 of those people are under 25 years of age and that we have the highest percentage of unemployed in any EC country.  The Government's discredited document <i>Building on Reality</i> stated that the average number unemployed would be 217,000 over the next three years. However, within a couple of months of the document being produced we were up to 234,000.  The allocation in the Estimates for Social Welfare this year only allowed for 217,000 unemployed but we must cater for a figure that is 17,000 <Col N="2226" /> higher than that.  There are just less than 100,000 people who are long term unemployed, more than 15 months in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>A couple living in rural Ireland with two children will receive an increase of £4.10p per week giving them a total of £72.25p.  When one takes into consideration the increases in VAT, the removal of the food subsidy and the other increases one is prompted to ask how the Minister expects such people to survive on that amount.  We must also consider the increase in the cost of fuel.  For the first time since the national fuel scheme was introduced the Government have inserted a new paragraph in the circular sent to health boards to exclude those on unemployment assistance and disability benefit from that scheme.  Formerly community welfare officers and health boards had a discretion in the matter but the Government have decided that persons on long term unemployment assistance cannot under any circumstances receive free fuel vouchers and the discretion has been taken from health boards.</P>
    <P>In my constituency I discussed the matter with a person on long term unemployment assistance.  He told me that they have mince meat twice a week and can afford only one bag of coal per week. That lasted them three days during the winter and for the remainder of the week they did not have a fire.  That man has to support a wife and four children.  Their bad circumstances are a direct result of Government policies.  Their shortage of fuel is as a result of the Government excluding certain categories from the national fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>We were told the family income supplement would be introduced in November last.  It was backdated to September because of pressure as a result of the removal of food subsidies.  However, that supplement does not do anything for the unemployed, the self-employed or any social welfare recipients, irrespective of their income.  They did not benefit from the decision to backdate the supplement to September 1984.  We have been told that a lot of new schemes will be introduced to alleviate unemployment, for <Col N="2227" /> instance, the social employment scheme which will cost almost £30 million.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Labour on Tuesday, 12 March last, No. 707, asking if a person who is unemployed and was not allowed unemployment assistance would qualify for the social employment scheme.  I wanted to know if a person living at home on a farm or in a shop and excluded from unemployment assistance would benefit from the new scheme if they were unemployed for 12 or 18 months.  I was told that they would not be permitted to participate in that scheme.  Another interesting fact emerged in the reply to my question.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In deciding the conditions for eligibility, the Government were also influenced by the consideration that almost two-thirds of the gross cost of the scheme will come back to the Exchequer through savings in unemployment payments and additional tax revenue. </P>
    <P>We were not given that information when we were told that the Government would be spending £30 million on this scheme. If the name of the scheme, a social employment scheme, means anything surely it should be available to all who are unemployed.  If there is a condition that a person must be unemployed for 12 months then so be it, but the scheme should apply to everybody who is unemployed. It is wrong that a person who is not signing on the register or in receipt of unemployment assistance cannot benefit from that scheme.  The position of a person who decided not to go to the labour exchange or to put a drain on the Exchequer is that they are excluded from participation in the scheme.  If the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; is to be used in the name of any scheme there should be a social element in it and it should apply to everybody who is unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the assessment of married woman for unemployment assistance.  While I do not object to a social welfare officer asking anybody, <Col N="2228" /> man or woman, who will mind the children while they are at work, I believe he should accept the answer given if it is reasonable.  That applies in particular to married women.  If a married woman tells a social welfare officer that her mother, or mother-in-law, or neighbour will mind the children, the officer should accept that and the person should not be turned down, having provided evidence that somebody is available to look after the children.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in children's allowances for the current year, which is not surprising.  One of the features of the Government's social policy is discrimination against children.  This is their third budget and only last year there was an increase of 7 per cent.  There is nothing this year, no double allowance for child dependants at autumn or Christmas, as the former Government had given.  The VAT increases will be particularly hard on parents buying clothes for their children.  There is also removal of food subsidies and the imposition of charges for schools buses.  In the application of the family income supplement there has been no increase for families with more than five children and it is the larger families which are the poorest in our society.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill increases the ceiling for payment of PRSI from £13,000 to £13,800.  There is an increase in the rate of payment by employers.  That also happened last year.  All these are an increase in tax for both employer and worker. While the Minister can boast at not having increased the rate of payment for the employee, nevertheless he has increased the rate of contribution that the employee will have to make.  It does not matter to the worker whether it is an increase in the rate of payment or in the ceiling for payment.  The whole thrust of Government policy should be to ensure that the employer will not have to pay more by way of taxation now than formerly, because of the number of employers going out of business, many because of the Government's taxation policies.</P>
    <P>Section 5 increases by £6 the amount <Col N="2229" /> of earnings disregarded in calculating pay related benefits.  Since this Government came into office the figure has gone up from £32 to £49 this year, an increase of £17.  If you take account of the fact that the waiting time for payment of pay-related benefits was increased from two to three weeks two years ago, and the rate reduced from 40 per cent to 25 per cent, that creates much hardship for persons particularly those fathers of large families who suddenly become ill.  These people find themselves in hospital at a time when they are most vulnerable. Their incomes are cut down to a level which makes them incapable of meeting their commitments.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he was giving £650,000 to voluntary organisations, an increase from the £500,000 in previous years and we welcome that increase.  However, that figure is not sufficiently high.  We have the Department of Social Welfare running a system and the health boards running their system and voluntary organisations being called upon more and more to provide essential services that the Government are failing to provide for those in need.  The Minister acknowledged that, when he listed the various services which voluntary organisations provide, particularly for the elderly in day care centres, meals on wheels, services for the handicapped, youth club facilities, day care centres for the homeless and help for unmarried mothers. These are some of the services provided by the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations are being called on more and more to come to the rescue of families in difficulties, particularly those depending on social welfare payments.  As a result of the curtailment and reduction of the rate of social welfare payments, their real standard of living has dropped for these people and they are dependent on the voluntary organisations. One has only to ask any local authority about the number of defaulters on repayments, people who have suddenly become unemployed through no fault of their own and are unable to meet their commitments.  In my county there are now 500 defaulters in repayment of <Col N="2230" /> loans to Monaghan County Council.  The Eastern Health Board paid £20 million in supplementary allowances last year and paid the ESB £1 million.  That is a further indication of the failure of the Government to provide adequate and proper social welfare benefits and assistance for those in need.</P>
    <P>On the administration of the services, it appears that those dependent on social welfare are more vulnerable in times of recession and cutbacks.  Has any instruction gone out to the various agencies telling them to curtail the services?  I should like an explanation of why the national free fuel scheme in various areas can vary.  Cavan-Monaghan has a community care area with above 17,000 recipients of free fuel and Kerry, with a similar community, has 6,500 recipients.  In Monaghan, the number in receipt of free fuel vouchers dropped by over 100 in the last two years.  That is extraordinary in a time of recession and there must be some explanation.</P>
    <P>The number of recipients of social welfare allowances in County Cavan has dropped from 94 two years ago to 55 in 1983, the last year for which figures were available.  This is well the lowest number of any county.  There must be some reason for this.  The Government must examine the whole administration of these services.  People should not have to go to the Ombudsman to find out the reason for being turned down for what they believe to be their right.</P>
    <P>What particularly concerns me is that a quarter of the Minister's statement yesterday was devoted to abuse of the social welfare services.  While I would very strongly condemn abuse and think that the people responsible should be severely dealt with, I am more concerned at present with service rather than control. The Minister, in effect, has told us that he is building more controls into the system.  I welcome section 12 which will increase the fines for abuse but it is not control that we need now it is service. Why does it take 17 weeks to process a claim for unemployment assistance, 21 weeks on average to process ones for the deserted wife's allowance and 18 weeks <Col N="2231" /> for a widow's pension?  These are the questions to which we should be addressing ourselves.  We should ensure that people have their applications and claims dealt with expeditiously.  When that is looked after, then one can build in a mechanism of control to ensure that there will be no abuse.  I am all for the high fines and the other elements in the Social Welfare Bill to deal with abuses.  I am afraid that building in controls at this time will make it take longer to process applications and unfortunate people will be left with no income and nothing to survive on.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister told us yesterday that an amount of £2.3 million was involved in fraudulent claims last year.  One must compare that with the scare figure given by the Taoiseach in Tullamore in November 1982, just before the last general election.  He gave approximately £70 million as the figure for abuse.  The Minister's figure is much more realistic.</P>
    <P>In view of the increase in the number of applications for social welfare assistance as a result of the recession, has there been an increase in staff in the Department to administer the various schemes, or have all the increases been in the area of combating fraud?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Department's computerisation programme is resulting in significant administrative savings and substantially higher productivity. This was acknowledged in the 1983 Report of the Department of the Public Service... </P>
    <P>It is all right to improve the computerisation programme, but if we still have these long delays in processing claims something is very seriously wrong.  Does the embargo on appointments to the Public Service apply to the Department of Social Welfare?  The family income supplement was announced with a great fanfare of trumpets and eventually it came into operation last September.  We were told on a number of occasions by the Minister and the Minister for Finance that 35,000 <Col N="2232" /> people would benefit from that scheme. Only about 10,000 applied for it; 3,000 people benefited from it; 3,000 people were refused; and almost 4,000 applications are still waiting to be processed.</P>
    <P>The scheme does not apply to the worst off sections of the community: the unemployed, long term recipients of social welfare, the self-employed in business, and small farmers, irrespective of their income.  Handicapped persons in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance receive a free travel pass but they are not allowed to bring an adult with them.  A mentally handicapped person who may not be able to travel alone has a free travel pass.  A mother with a widow's pension cannot afford to pay for travelling and she is not allowed to travel free with her handicapped child, so the free travel pass is not of much use. I ask the Minister to see if something can be done about that.</P>
    <P>At the moment elderly people living alone in remote areas are being terrorised. We should pay tribute to the Leader of our party for his enlightened approach to social welfare when he was Minister. I refer in particular to the introduction of the free telephone rental system.  That has been of tremendous value and benefit to elderly people living alone who are fortunate enough to have a telephone.  It is a great source of comfort to them.  If they are attacked or abused in any way they can use the telephone and get help immediately.  I ask the Minister to look at this scheme particularly in view of the problems elderly people living alone are facing in rural Ireland and to see if the scheme can be extended to enable us to do justice to those people and to look after their needs.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were responsible for the most enlightened social legislation in this State, such as the free television licence. It is interesting that the BBC are suggesting to the British Government that they should follow the Irish example and give free television licences to those in receipt of social welfare assistance or benefit.  All these schemes, such as the free electricity supply, were enlightened innovations.  It is disappointing that after three years in <Col N="2233" /> office we have not had any enlightened social welfare legislation from this Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill to set up a combat poverty organisation was circulated recently.  I do not see the need for the Bill.  If the Government ask the people they will soon learn what the needs are.  Any Member of this House who holds clinics can tell them.  I agree with Deputy Yates that Members of this House are in a position to inform the Minister and the Government what the real problems are. Unfortunately the pleas of Deputies are largely ignored.  When will we see the equality legislation?  It was supposed to be implemented by 19 December but it still has not been debated in this House.</P>
    <P>The financing of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is causing serious problems.  This issue was raised here time and again.  I raised it year after year.  I do not understand why there cannot be a direct transfer of funding from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Social Welfare to take account of the obligations of local authorities.  The Western Health Board have started to sue the local authorities for money.  All this is a waste of resources, involving the high cost of litigation. Something should be done to help the local authorities who have not got the money to meet their obligations in this context.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of dental and optical treatment to the wives of insured workers in so far as it goes.  I am very disappointed that it does not go all the way and give wives of all insured workers these benefits.  One cannot accept statistics from the Government having regard to what they said about the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Very few women will avail of the dental service.  The woman has to be pregnant and presumbly that has to be proved. That will take time.  Dental treatment is recommended for three months only in the nine month period of pregnancy.  I cannot see that this scheme will be of any great benefit to women.  If it takes anything like the length of time it takes to process other applications, the pregnancy <Col N="2234" /> will be long since over by the time the application is approved.  In introducing the scheme the Minister should have allowed all women to participate.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates about the difficulty in processing claims for a deserted wife's allowance.  A more flexible approach should be adopted. Recently a woman received a letter from a firm of solicitors in Australia saying that her husband was going to court for a divorce and asking her to reply.  That letter went to the Department of Social Welfare but it was not accepted as evidence that she was a deserted wife.  She was turned down, on what basis I do not know.  This is an indication of inflexibility in the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that section 10 provides for the extension of social insurance coverage to doctors and dentists in the Defence Forces.  He said:</P>
    <P>I consider that the continued general exclusion of doctors and dentists from social insurance can no longer be justified and this is a matter which I will be putting before the Government in the near future. </P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain what doctors and dentists he is referring to &mdash; presumably the doctors and dentists in the Defence Forces.  Presumably also that has already been agreed by the Government or it would not appear in this Bill. But I should very much like to know what doctors and dentists he now intends including in social insurance.</P>
    <P>The first thing this Government need to do is to decide what way the country and the economy are going.  I accepted what the Minister told us yesterday in the course of his remarks from which I might quote:</P>
    <P>Low growth generally in the economy and the need to increase both direct and indirect taxes in order to get the budget deficit under control have all but eliminated the increment of resources from which increased social welfare expenditure could be financed without cutting into living standards. </P>
    <P>Then I read an article in yesterday's <i>The <Col N="2235" /> Irish Times</i> by their political correspondent, Dick Walsh, under the heading &ldquo;Putting nation back on tracks &mdash; Taoiseach&rdquo;, when we were told and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was in a buoyant mood.  He had already spoken, at a function in Dublin, of a quickening in the pulse of economic activity, forecasting an expansion in business, an increase in investment and a pick up in employment this year. </P>
    <P>Then there were schemes listed he thought would be of benefit, such as the enterprise allowance, the family income supplement and the social employment schemes.  It appears that the Taoiseach and the Minister are at variance on what is the situation in our economy.  Anybody who is out and about, any economist, or indeed any Member of this House would have to agree that the Minister was right and the Taoiseach wrong, that the low growth generally in our economy is as a result of the Government's policy.  Everybody might not agree with that but everybody would agree that our economy is not beginning to pick up and that we do encounter these difficulties.  This is relevant to social policy because it is when the economy is going well that there is not the same need, particularly for social assistance schemes.  It must be remembered that we have a very high population encompassing a high number of dependants which places an enormous strain on any social welfare system.  We also have the highest percentage of unemployment in Europe.  The Minister admitted yesterday that the most effective approach to unemployment is through the provision of jobs and that the Government's policies and resources were being mobilised to that end.  We do not see any sign of that and perhaps the Minister would elaborate somewhat in that regard when replying.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with the problems confronting us the first thing we must ensure is that we have a sound economy and we must create employment.  I believe this Government went in the wrong direction altogether since assuming office, believing that if they got their <Col N="2236" /> books and figures right everything else would fall into line.  Even the Taoiseach himself admitted that the policies he was pursuing were diametrically opposed to those necessary for the creation of employment.  The tragedy is that after two and a half years the books are still not right.  The Government are now borrowing more than was ever done in the history of the State and they have allowed for a deficit of £200 million more this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant because it would not be constructive for us to come in here, be critical of the Minister's Bill and of the Government's social policy if we did not examine how the situation might be corrected and how we would deal with it were we in Government. I should say that the first thing we would do is create jobs.  When we were in office and there was much criticism from the other side of the House about our borrowing &mdash; when we were not borrowing as much as the Government are now doing &mdash; there were jobs available. It is important to make that point.</P>
      <P>Another interesting statistic is this, that the decision of the Government to borrow in dollars, to leave our partners in the EMS when they wanted to borrow, has cost the country £1,000 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to this debate.  Perhaps the Deputy would return to the Bill before the House.  He is now dwelling on budgetary matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that to go into a detailed debate on that matter would not be relevant.  The point I want to make is that the Minister did tell us in his opening remarks yesterday that the Government were providing £1.3 billion towards the cost of the social welfare services, the rest emanating from the Social Insurance Fund built up by all those who contribute to it.  Out of those £1.3 billion &mdash; had the <Col N="2237" /> Government not borrowed in dollars &mdash; £1 million could have been found.</P>
      <P>In 1983 one Member on the Government side of the House found it necessary to vote against the Social Welfare Bill.  I agree with him that it was necessary.  It is even more necessary now when one sees that there were increases of 10 per cent and 12 per cent two years ago whereas the present increase is 6 per cent only.  On this occasion perhaps more Members might feel obliged, in the interests of the less well-off, to vote with the Opposition against this Bill.</P>
      <P>The real tragedy is that the social policy of this Government has done nothing for the nation or for those dependent on social welfare for their existence.  Rather has it brought massive unemployment, social deprivation and been a major contributor to the unprecedented level of crime and lawlessness now obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy O'Hanlon's calls to Members on this side of the House to vote against this Bill I should say we shall have to disappoint him thereby ensuring, in the interests of all our people, that nobody on this side of the House votes against this Bill in order to safeguard the standard of living. We should thereby guarantee that the less well-off receive the kind of compassion and consideration to which they have become accustomed under this Government.</P>
      <P>I listened at length to Deputy McCarthy's contribution last evening.  I must say that he must not have been around when his party were in office because many of the things he attributed to the present, as he contended, uncaring and unfeeling Government were very much in evidence during the term of office of the previous Government. Indeed many of the hardships to which he referred where attributable directly to decisions taken by that Government, many without any regard to their effect on people at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in that, as was the case with last year's Bill, it attempts to provide some semblance of a reasonable standard of living for the less well-off at <Col N="2238" /> a very difficult time.  It is very easy, when people call for cuts in public expenditure, to select areas where there are people dependent on forces outside their control to provide for themselves and their families. It would be very easy at such times for Governments to refuse to respond to the needs of such people, allowing their positions to be eroded with consequent hardship.  That has not been the case during the term of office of this Government. In times of great financial stringency this Government have succeeded in ensuring that the less well-off, generally those dependent on social welfare, receive a reasonable crack of the whip, are allowed some semblance of dignity and the ability to provide for themselves and their families' basic requirements.</P>
    <P>Many people do not readily recognise the extent of expenditure in this area.  It is worth mentioning, as did the Minister in the course of his remarks, that total expenditure this year will be in the region of £2¼ billion, £1.3 billion of which is provided by the State.  As always needs to be mentioned, the State does not have a crock of gold somewhere with which to provide such benefits.  The State has to get the money from the taxpayer or by borrowing.  It is well known that, in the past, borrowing took place to provide for these services.  In a society which has become highly impersonal, it is important that the rights of people who are dependent on social welfare are upheld and that they receive the benefits necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  The same figure relates to an expenditure of £6 million for each day of the year, 25 per cent of total gross current expenditure or 15 per cent of GNP at present compared with approximately 10 per cent of GNP 10 years ago.  Those figures are not snatched out of the air, they were presented by the Minister yesterday and such massive expenditure is an indication of the Government's awareness of the trauma of those who are unemployed, perhaps with a large family of dependants, and those on disability benefit or other forms of social welfare.</P>
    <P>From July this year there will be increases to the extent of 6½ per cent in <Col N="2239" /> the weekly rates of long term payments and 6 per cent in the weekly rates of short term payments.  Taking into account present rates of inflation, this is an indication that the Government are keenly aware of the need to maintain the standard of living of people in those categories.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted a considerable length of his speech to the area of abuses of the social welfare system to which I have referred on numerous occasions in the past.  There are many types of abuse and the Minister categorised the number of cases for 1983.  He said:</P>
    <P>In 1983 the amount attributed to known fraud was £2.3 million &mdash; just over one-eighth of 1 per cent of total expenditure.  The figure for 1984 is not yet available but the indications are that it will show an increase.  The biggest components of the 1983 figure were: </P>

    <P>Some cases are fairly easy to investigate. For instance, a social welfare officer can pick out cases of disability, disablement or sick benefits and have the person assessed as being fit for work in the opinion of a lay person.  However, it does not always follow that the lay person's opinion is correct and indeed in many cases it can be incorrect.  Great hardship can ensure when benefits or assistance are cut off for several weeks although I know such persons can apply for a supplementary allowance.</P>
    <P>Cases not easy to investigate are those where the person is on unemployment benefit and assistance and also working on a full time basis.  I have reservations as to the full extent of the abuses of unemployment assistance outlined in the <Col N="2240" /> Minister's speech.  I believe that the figure of 1,000 cases does not reflect the true picture of abuse in that area.  These are not my views, they are those of many people who visit me at my weekly clinics. They can tell me of people who are known to be working while drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The danger of allowing such a situation to continue is that other people will also be encouraged into the black economy. People ask me why should they operate within the system and pay all the penalties involved while others can operate quite well outside the system but are able to draw unemployment assistance.  They have the best of both worlds as they do not pay tax in either system.  From the number of representations I have had from constituents in that regard, I am convinced that the abuse is of a much larger scale than has been determined.  I do not advocate a witchhunt but it would be to the benefit of the Exchequer and to the morale of people who work and pay their taxes if a little more could be done to curtail that type of abuse.  While there are abuses, there are also a great number of genuine cases in which benefits have been withdrawn and much hardship caused.  It is easy to categorise these cases as they can be reviewed from time to time.  This does not happen in the case of a person who is working; they must be caught working and there is a much bigger problem than people realise.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that claimants for disability benefit are visited in their own homes by the Department's sickness visitor who expresses a lay person's opinion on the claimant's inability to work. He also said that doubtful cases are referred to a panel of medical referees and that a large number of claimants are absent from home when the sickness visitor calls.  If a visitor called on some of the other cases I mentioned there would also be a fair degree of absenteeism from home.  The lay person's opinion may be a little vague and, although I do not doubt the sincerity of the lay person concerned, the effect of their decisions at times can be traumatic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2241" /> There are terrible delays in the processing of cases which have been referred to medical referees and they can often go on for as long as six months.  Time is wasted, families are subjected to hardship and further efforts should be made to streamline the system.</P>
    <P>A problem that has been brought to my attention repeatedly by constituents in the past couple of years relates to supplementary welfare payments and it arises from the fact that in this area we are dealing constantly with a new type of applicant, people who ordinarily would not consider it right for them in conscience to seek social welfare assistance and who only resort to supplementary benefit as a last resort.  In many cases a considerable amount of hardship occurs and there is a great deal of anguish before the people have sufficient courage to approach social welfare officers in an effort to obtain assistance.  One would not need to be a mathematician to assess a person's needs.  There are always people to abuse the system, who make it their business to do so, but in the case of the average person an officer should be able within a short time of his investigation, to determine an applicant's means and outgoings and to reach a decision on that basis.  The need for greater recourse to supplementary benefit arises from the recession.  Many people who up to a few years ago enjoyed a reasonably high standard of living then found themselves in the poverty trap because of the changed economic circumstances which resulted in their experiencing difficulty meeting their mortgage commitments and so on while they were almost on fixed incomes.  Those are the people who have had the greatest difficulty in the changed situation and we should be very compassionate in dealing with them.  We are not talking about isolated cases but about cases that are increasing in number.  We can only hope that the recession will ease within a short time because that is the only way in which the burden can be lifted from those people.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I urge that supplementary benefit investigating officers and community care teams show as much <Col N="2242" /> compassion as possible in dealing with these types of cases.  They should bear in mind the necessity for allowing the individual to preserve some semblance of personal dignity.  That is a very important factor in so far as these applicants are concerned.  In many cases they have little but their pride to cling to.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that these cases are examined favourably and compassionately rather than by way of a cold and callous assessment which is sometimes the case.  It may be that in some cases officers are over-worked and that this can affect their attitude towards applicants but we must ensure that this will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to provide some service to the less well off and the Government are proposing to provide this service with the minimum of borrowing and with the least possible increases in taxation generally.  That is a great achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem about having to wait for more than two hours to speak is that one's contribution tends then to be longer than was intended originally.</P>
      <P>First, it must be said, not merely about this Bill but about the whole matter of Government policy, that there is a long overdue need for a major review of our social policy and social services.  Therefore, I welcomed the establishment of the commission on the social welfare system. The Minister has not indicated when he expects the commission to report but I trust they will report fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system has developed in a very haphazard and piecemeal fashion.  There is no evidence of any coherent strategy or of any kind of underlying progressive philosophy in the present system.  There is no serious attempt at integrated economic and social planning in the State and there has not been any planned development of our social services.  Bits and pieces have been added at various times. The Fianna Fáil spokesman reminded us that in the past Deputy Haughey introduced fairly useful improvements in the social welfare area.  By and large that is <Col N="2243" /> true but there has been no attempt to reexamine our whole approach to social welfare, to examine who should be entitled to social welfare payments and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent a considerable time talking about abuses of the existing system.  We deplore such abuses but I find it difficult to condemn some individuals who are forced to abuse the system as a result of the poverty trap in which they find themselves.  There is a marked difference between the urgency with which the Government are tackling abuses in the social welfare system and the virtual lack of progress they are making in tackling the matter of tax evasion and in assessing those who should be paying tax.  Almost two years ago, 90,000 additional farmers were brought into the tax net but so far as I am aware none of those has been assessed for tax at this stage.</P>

      <P>Despite this there is an increase in the number of inspectors investigating social welfare abuses.  I am not saying that the number of inspectors in that regard should not be increased but it does not make sense to talk of the need to raise money by way of taxation and by borrowing to provide social services while leaving virtually untouched the area of tax evasion, with the exception of the few cosmetic steps that have been taken.  As a result of the recession the system has become strained and is at breakdown <Col N="2244" /> point in some areas.  The recession has aggravated the weaknesses that exist in the social welfare system.  It appears that every time a hole in the scheme is patched up another hole appears.  It is long past time that we got a report from the commission on the social welfare system.  I hope that in his response to the debate today the Minister will indicate when we can expect the report from the commission and I hope he will tell us when he expects to start implementing any of the recommendations they may make.</P>
      <P>In general it is accepted that the purpose of social welfare is to provide income and other forms of support for people at a time of need, particularly for those who cannot support themselves adequately.  That can be because they are too young, too old, are sick or are involved in education and, therefore, are not in a position to take up paid employment or, as is the case of the vast majority of social welfare dependents, are unable to get paid employment because of the nature of the economic system we have on this island.  Our system provides some relief in cases of extreme poverty but it appears to be fairly inefficient in that it does not always reach those who need help.  I have a number of specific cases I shall come to later.  What the system does not do &mdash; and in reality I suppose we could not expect it to do &mdash; is to tackle the causes of poverty.  That is why I mentioned earlier there is a desperate need to co-ordinate our approaches in developing the economy, in the creation of jobs and our approach to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that the system even in its present form comes under most strain at times of economic recession when most people need to avail of it.  It is also strange that at such times we hear the loudest cries for cutbacks in the area of spending. It indicates a view that only those who are totally incapable of work or of earning a living because of physical disability are entitled to assistance.  That comes through to some extent in the Minister's speech where he indicated that when an inspector calls to a home to see a person on disability benefit and where that person is found not to be at home the <Col N="2245" /> matter is then referred to a medical officer.  The assumption is that in order to be eligible for disability benefit a person must be so sick that he must be confined to home.  Clearly that is not the case in the vast majority of applicants for disability benefit because a person's disability or sickness refers to his inability to carry out the functions of his job and they could be anything.  For instance, a person with influenza or who develops a fear of heights obviously could not carry out his job if it meant he had to climb a 40 foot tower.  That does not mean he has to be confined to the house to qualify for benefit and I am somewhat concerned at the implications of what the Minister said in relation to that aspect of disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals mainly with the increase in social welfare benefits of 6 per cent and 6½ per cent.  It is argued this will keep people in line with inflation.  I do not know if that will be the case.  It could be that by the end of this year inflation may be more than 6½ per cent but apart from that point there is also the underlying assumption that all we need to do in relation to social welfare recipients is to keep them in line with inflation, that the levels of income they have are quite sufficient to maintain them in a reasonable style of living and give them a reasonable form of existence.  I know, and I am sure many Deputies know, that there are literally tens of thousands of people in receipt of social welfare benefits who are leading lives of quiet desperation &mdash; perhaps some not so quiet, but most of them are leading lives of quiet desperation.  They do not know from one day to the next how they will feed themselves and pay their bills and, if they have a family, how they will find food, clothing and school books for their children.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned a particular case and I am sure this could be multiplied by thousands.  He told us of a 36 year old man, the eldest of his family, single, living with his parents and who was getting £12 per week.  It is astonishing that one hears people calling for cuts in social welfare and claiming that people are getting more <Col N="2246" /> on social welfare than they would earn if working when there are cases such as this, where a man is stripped of dignity and pride.  He is a quiet, decent man, 36 years of age and living at home and he is getting £12 per week because he is living at home.  If he were living in a flat he would get the full amount of unemployment assistance which is approximately £32 or £33 and even that level of income for a single man having to pay rent in the Dublin area would be grossly inadequate. To expect a man of 36 years, 46 years or 56 years to live on £12 a week is a crime against his dignity.  It is a crime against the thousands who are in that position because they are living at home or getting a pittance from social welfare.  Then we wonder why they attempt to abuse the system, go wild or get involved in vandalism. It does not make sense for us to ignore this kind of real poverty.  Poverty is not just a question of having enough money to buy food or pay the rent; it means having a sufficient income to lead a decent life that could give you the opportunity to savour the leisure facilities that are available.  That is a point I would like the Minister to address himself to. The annual increases of 6 per cent, 7 per cent or 10 per cent, are not tackling that kind of basic injustice in the present system.</P>
    <P>There was a call by the Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, in the middle of last year for further cutbacks in Government spending.  At that time I asked him through a public statement if he would be willing to move to Ballymun and live there on £80 a week rearing two or four children.  I wanted him to see that it is impossible to live on the money available. Of course the Minister did not respond but as a result of that call <i>The Irish Press</i> sent a reporter to Ballymun to interview a husband, wife and four children who were getting the princely sum of £80 per week &mdash; under this Bill that will be increased to £85 per week.  I could not live on that money with any dignity nor could anybody else in this House.  The article which appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i><Col N="2247" /> on 7 September 1984 was the result of that interview.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote a couple of exerpts from that interview under the headline &ldquo;How to rear a family on £80 a week&rdquo;.  Of the 30 families in her immediate area the lady interviewed said that only five had anybody working.  Her family did not have anybody working although two of them had left school and, extraordinary to relate, one was attending university.  It is an indication of the tenacity and strength of character of people who have to survive on this kind of money that, in the odd case, they can get one of their children into university. She said her husband was laid off four years ago and the family slid down the scale from pay-related benefit to the flat rate unemployment benefit and then on to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>During the same period her children had grown up and one by one they left the eligibility bracket for children's allowances.  Only one of her four children is eligible for children's allowance, £12 a month plus £80 a week unemployment assistance.  The article goes on to say that the family are not a troubled family, they are not a despairing family but have a lot going for them and through their own initiative and at great odds their eldest son was studying science at UCD.  At that time he was away in London working in a pizza parlour trying to earn money for next year's books.  As the lady said, she could not expect him to contribute because he needed what he earned to buy his books and things.  His mother could think of no other university student from Ballymun, although there may be others but she was not aware of any in that area. She said that most of the young people left school early but her eldest son was determined to go further.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to say that the prospects were not so cheery for the next two in the Callaghan family, one 17 year old and one 16 year old waiting for places on AnCO courses.  One of them did the intermediate certificate and a pre-employment course but the problem is there is no employment around.  The <Col N="2248" /> weekly income of £80 for two adults, three teenagers and one nine year old takes more than the average amount of stretching to make ends meet.  &ldquo;It's a subsistence budget,&rdquo; according to the article, &ldquo;with no room for manoeuvre. No flexibility for clothes, furniture, visits to the family on the other side of town, toys, books, a night out on the town, a holiday, a Christmas feast.&rdquo;  They have a diet of eggs, chips, beans, mince, stew, burgers or sausages.  They used to get a joint on Sunday but now they get a chicken or chicken pieces and Mrs. Callaghan makes a casserole.  That is an example of the kind of stretching which hundreds and thousands of families across the country have to do week in and week out, day in and day out.  In this Bill we are offering them an increase of 6 per cent to 6½ per cent on top of what is already way below a reasonable level of income for even a half decent existence.</P>
    <P>We have this fiction of these increases being announced on budget day, around the end of January, yet in this case they do not come in until the second week of July.  Last year it was the first week in July, the year before it was some time in June and presumably next year it will be the end of July or even early August. This is a clever bit of book juggling but it does not help the people in this situation to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>We have an announced 5 per cent increase in the family income supplement. When this was first introduced it was to be an incentive for people in low income jobs to stay in work and when it was decided in the middle of last year to do away with half of the food subsidies, we were told the family income supplement would assist those in need to overcome the loss of those subsidies.  The Minister's figures indicate that, excluding those in receipt of children's allowances and no other social welfare benefit, there are at least one million people dependent as their major income on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was never intended to cater for more than 35,000 people who were already in work, not people on social welfare benefit.  A tiny proportion of those who were <Col N="2249" /> expected to apply have not done so for a variety of reasons, part of which is the very poor level of benefit being offered. Most people who might be entitled to it are unaware of their entitlement and in many cases people are unaware of the scheme.  This 5 per cent increase in the family income supplement is not a substitute for a proper level of income and for ensuring that there is a statutory minimum wage for workers.  When the scheme was introduced I suggested to the Minister that application forms should be sent to people in certain income categories. The kind of information the Minister would require to do that is available from the Revenue Commissioners. This scheme is for people at work.  They all have tax-free allowance certificates and the Revenue Commissioners know the income of every PAYE worker. There is no reason why the Minister could not use the computerised files available to the Revenue Commissioners to send application forms to people on low incomes.  In that way the Minister would ensure that people entitled to this family income supplement would at least have the opportunity to apply for it.  This is what was done when the property tax forms were being issued in order to ensure that the people entitled to pay it would be notified, although there has not been great success in collecting that tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent a lot of time talking about fraud and abuse.  I oppose abuses of the social welfare system but the Minister's efforts here are in stark contrast to the efforts being made to collect unpaid taxes.  At the end of May last the Minister for Finance supplied a figure of £677 million remaining on the commissioners' books in unpaid taxes.  It has been argued that all of this may not be due to be paid because of over assessments, appeals and so on but there are still tens of millions of pounds due in unpaid taxes and there is no evidence that the Government are seriously trying to collect that money. About 90,000 farmers were taken into the tax net but have not been assessed for taxes.  Many of them may not be due to pay tax but the Revenue Commissioners should be enabled to ensure that <Col N="2250" /> everyone in the tax net is properly assessed, and to ensure that tax owed is collected. The sum involved in social welfare frauds for 1983 was £2.3 million.  It is a tiny sum compared to the outstanding taxes.  There are other areas of abuse to which the Minister neglected to refer.  I refer to the abuse of people, who through no fault of their own, must apply for social welfare benefits.  There appears to be a marked reluctance on the part of the officials in the Department at various levels to advise people of their entitlements. Many Deputies encounter people who have been refused unemployment assistance but who are not told they are entitled to appeal, are not told how to appeal or advised as to what is required for a successful appeal.  Deputy Yates has referred to this in his contribution.</P>
    <P>There are other cases where errors are made by the Department in the calculation of benefits.  I know of two recent cases where presumably because I put down a Dáil question about it, errors were found and rectified.  In one case the error amounted to over £800 due to the person from August last.  If the person had not appealed it and just accepted the Department's decision he would have been at the loss of that money.  This person pursued the case and when he could not get anywhere with the officials, he came to me and I put a question down and subsequently it was found that an error had been made.  There must be many like cases.  It would be interesting if the Minister could give an estimate of the amount of money which is not taken up by people entitled to it.  That is also an area of abuse in the system.  It is not a deliberate abuse but an abuse which arises from the failure of the Department to provide adequate information and advice to people.</P>

      <P>I put down some questions to the Minister recently to get <Col N="2251" /> a breakdown of the number of women who were being refused unemployment assistance, the number who were appealing refusals, and the number who were successful in their appeals.  I was told that the Department do not have those statistics and that it was not possible to provide them.  From the number of cases I get there appears to be a policy of refusing unemployment assistance to women, particularly if they have children, on the grounds that they are not available for work.  These women are not being advised as to how they can appeal that refusal.  I had a case of a young woman who went to the labour exchange to get her unemployment assistance but because she had her daughter's child with her, her unemployment assistance was discontinued and she had to go through the process of appealing, waiting months and going on to supplementary welfare allowance in order to re-establish her right to unemployment assistance.  There must be a bit of honesty in the Department in relation to this matter.  If the Minister does not have the statistics in relation to how women are being treated under the social welfare system it is time the Department set about providing the statistics.  I understand that most of the Department's work is done by computer, so it should be easy enough to provide the statistics necessary to ensure that certain sectors of the population are not being discriminated against on the basis of sex, age or otherwise.  It is a technical thing to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  I do not think it is very widespread but it may become a growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman with two children, married, came to Ireland and established here a new relationship, but after some time her common law husband here died leaving her with four children.  She was unable to get a widow's pension&mdash;her first husband is still alive in Britain; she cannot get a deserted wife's allowance or an unmarried mother's allowance for the two children by the common law husband because she was married.  She has been unable to get orphans' allowance because she is <Col N="2252" /> still looking after the children.  Her entire social welfare income is £55 per week. There may be only a few hundred such people, or there may be some thousands, but it would not be a great number and there is an urgent need to look at the social welfare code to ensure that such people will not be left in extreme poverty.</P>
    <P>The posting of cheques for disability and long term unemployment payments needs to be dealt with.  In Dublin 11, postal workers were attacked by young thugs who stole the social welfare cheques, and the postal workers have refused to deliver such cheques until the Department ensure that the cheques cannot be cashed except by those to whom they are made payable.  I hope the Minister will explain what the position is later.</P>
    <P>The way young disabled persons are treated needs to be looked at and the Minister some time ago promised to review the position.  A young person living at home up to the age of 16 will be given an allowance but once he turns 16 and is at school the allowance is stopped. This is particularly bad because most such young disabled persons need their independence and their pride.  An effort should be made to ensure that disabled young people can continue their education and still get assistance from either the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred several times in recent weeks to a young married couple.  They got married last year and because the wife is working the DPMA has been withdrawn.  This is a disgrace and the Minister should look at it with urgency with a view to finding a way around it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the double weeks benefit at Christmas.  Last year certain categories were paid a double week but those on unemployment benefit or assistance or those on supplementary welfare allowances were not included. They are the people in most need, at least as badly off as pensioners.</P>
    <P>The Minister is part of a Coalition who <Col N="2253" /> have not been doing anything far-reaching in regard to the structure of the economy. For that reason, presumably, there will not be any more money for those on social welfare.  I urge the Government to deal urgently with tax evasion.  In that way they might get some additional funds.  It must be remembered that for every person who abuses the social welfare code, particularly in relation to unemployment assistance or disability allowances, there must be an employer somewhere who is agreeing with or forcing that situation on that person because that employer refuses to pay the full rate of wages.  I should like the Minister to indicate the steps the Department are taking to ensure that employers who are collaborating in the abuse of the system will be stopped and brought to justice.</P>

That is an enormous amount showing that the Government have tackled the problem in an admirable way.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.  There is currently a waiting list of two months for radiotherapy treatment in the Southern Health Board area. The waiting period in 1983 was three to six weeks.  The extent of the waiting period is a matter for the consultant in charge who decides on the urgency of the treatment required by the patient.  The health board are at present endeavouring to re-deploy their resources in order to appoint an additional radiographer to the radiotherapy department of the Cork Regional Hospital which will result in a reduction in the waiting list.</P>

Is he not aware that a committee acting voluntarily, of which Members of this House including myself are patrons, have collected £220,000 for this machine?  Will he tell us today when it is proposed to give sanction to that £40,000 to provide accommodation for this simultator the effect of which would be to eliminate risk and improve results for suffers of that disease in the southwest area?</P>

      <P>Again I must say to Deputies in this House that there is no problem whatsoever in my Department about providing money for buildings or for equipment.  We can buy a linear accelerator tomorrow morning for £232,000 or a simultator for about £200,000 but additional beds must be provided in addition to the equipment and the buildings, which must be staffed.  For example, for a linear accelerator an additional three posts would have to created.  For the simultator one would have to have one radiographer and some additional buildings, and approximately 15 extra beds are required by the board.  I am aware that the number of beds in the unit in Cork is probably too low for the needs of the Munster area, and that is why we set up a working group for these services.  I expect to get that group's report quite soon.  I am aware of the money collected locally and I have undertaken to meet the Cork Deputies on Wednesday night of next week at 9 o'clock to discuss the situation in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The treatment of patients for radiography is basically a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant in charge.  Each consultant decides the urgency of the treatment required.  I am not aware of any patient who requires urgent treatment being denied treatment, and if the Deputy has any case in mind, be it in Tralee or Cork, I will take up the matter.  Meanwhile we are endeavouring to improve the general facilities for the catchment area which, after all, embraces about 1 million people depending on radiography.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that the waiting time in 1983 was three weeks and that it is now two months. Could he tell us the reason for that and if the cutbacks are responsible?  Also, would he not accept that radiotherapy is a matter of urgency for many patients and that there is a risk to health if people have to wait that long.  Obviously if the facility is not there the consultants cannot give radiotherapy to those who need it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the prime difficulties has been that one post has remained vacant for some time as difficulties were experienced in attracting a suitable candidate for appointment.  The health board is endeavouring to provide an additional radiographer in the department through the redeployment of resources.  It is not a matter of cutbacks <Col N="2257" /> but of effectively staffing the unit.  The original unit was a 20 bed radiotherapy unit and was probably too small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give details of the directives that both he and his Department have given to each Health Board in the country to reduce their expenditure in 1985; the reasons for this, the effect that it will have; the total amount of money available to each health board in the country for 1985; and if he will make a statement on the level of services that he hopes to provide within each health board during the forthcoming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards have been advised that budgetary strategy for the years 1985 to 1987 should be determined in the light of the decisions contained in and the thrust of the health sections of the national plan.  The plan envisages that the major change for the future will be a greater emphasis on disease prevention and community services. It is recognised, however, that a major constraint in effecting a significant shift of resources towards these areas will be the overall level of funds available.  The Government decisions to reduce expenditure in the health area relate largely to reductions in payroll costs.  Health boards have therefore been requested to concentrate the necessary reductions in budgerary allocations on this area of expenditure and on institutional services.</P>
      <P>However, the question of the specific measures necessary to contain expenditure within the approved levels is a matter for each health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that the main thrust of the Government's recommendation to the health boards was a reduction in the payroll costs.  Does the Minister accept that a number of <Col N="2259" /> vacancies will be left unfilled as a result of that during the coming year?  At the meeting he had with the CEOs and chairmen of the health boards in Newbridge in November, a number of areas where there could be staff reductions were suggested to the health boards, for example, a reduction in overtime and locum cover. Does the Minister accept that this will have the effect of reducing the level of services which will be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came to office I found that, going back to 1980-82 &mdash;in 1979 the situation was out of hand altogether &mdash; massive sums of money were spent on overtime and on the employment of temporary and locum staff, payments for weekend working and other premium payments.  It is in those areas that reductions have occurred.  One was talking about an expenditure of millions of pounds at that time.  The number of vacancies which have been left unfilled are very few despite the embargo.  By and large, the health boards, with the possible exception of two where we have residual difficulties &mdash; the Southern and Western Health Boards &mdash; they are all in line with their expenditure targets for 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the health boards were told to leave two-thirds of the vacancies unfilled unless they could find the money to fund the filling of those vacancies?  In view of the fact that they received a reduced allocation, the health boards are not able to do that.  When the Minister talks about overtime in the health boards, does he not accept that the average working week is 40 hours and that the health services operate on a 24 hour a day basis, that is 168 hours a week?  In the health services, 128 hours of the working week is overtime and for the Minister to suggest that they should be able to do away with overtime is a red herring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, by and large, the health services operate on a 24 hour basis.  I have encouraged health boards not to admit patients on a Friday <Col N="2260" /> afternoon, keep them through Friday night and all day Saturday.  Apart from assisting them in their religious services on a Sunday, nothing happens to them apart from perhaps looking at the Match of the Day on television.  Some tests are then done on Monday and Tuesday.  That kind of practice was rampant but it has been stopped as far as possible.  We now have five day week beds and there is nothing wrong with that.  Procedures will be done between Monday and Friday except in cases of emergency.  In some places there were two or three hospitals providing emergency services over the weekend but that, too has been rationalised. In fairness to the health boards, the bulk of the measures required have been taken and the budgets are now on target. Through the seventies, the health boards did not believe what successive Ministers said and in September or October they demanded and received more money. Since I came to office there have been no supplementary estimates.  Between 1976 and 1982 Ministers for Health came into this House and looked for money from the Oireachtas.  We are talking about £40 or £50 million.  However, all that has now stopped.  People are settling down.  I want to thank the 60,000 people who are providing the health services.  Some of them are not very happy, but they are doing it. They are doing a good job.</P>

      <P>Some hospitals are practically halving the time patients stay in hospital.  The Minister is trying to establish the practice of patients not staying in hospitals over the week end.  We have to agree to that.  Would the Minister agree that the hospitalisation of patients in the general hospitals needs to be re-examined in view of all the changes the Minister has proposed regarding bed requirements and so on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems my Department have at national level is that we are a small Department with a small staff.  Only 350 people work in the Department of Health.  We had great difficulty in finding out what was going on. We have begun to find out.  The data <Col N="2261" /> are now coming in.  We have got the information from the health agencies.  It is very difficult to know what is going on in some of the voluntary hospitals.  I am not sure some of them know themselves. That is the way things are, and much money is spent.  Now that we know, I can assure the Deputy that the services are being provided on a more rational basis. Expenditure is at a reasonable level.  No one is suffering due to lack of hospital services.</P>

Unfortunately in some instances exaggerated statements have been made concerning the implications of the budgetary situation for patient care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that a number of health boards have developed a strategy for 1985 which has as one of its main <Col N="2262" /> objectives the containment of expenditure within approved allocation levels while at the same time preserving the essential fabric of the services.

      <P>I asked the Minister would there be a reduction in the level of services.  The Minister did not say whether or not there would be a reduction on the level of services.  In reply to the last question he told us he had advised hospitals not to admit patients on Friday. He said the budgets were on targets.  I wonder if a deficit of £5.6 million in the Southern Health Board is on target.  Does the Minister believe it is something to boast about that there was no supplementary estimate when services are being curtailed?  If wards are closing down, the sight testing scheme is being abolished and elderly people who live alone and watch television or read newspapers cannot get their glasses repaired or their eyes tested, and the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme is being abolished in a number of areas does the Minister accept that there is a reduction in the level of services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The last people on earth who would want to reduce the level of services are the health boards.  The latest position I have is that the Midland Health Board are well within target now that we have approved of their package. It is within the improved allocation for 1985.  In the North Eastern Health Board area the budget within the allocation was approved on 28 January.  The North Western Health Board have approved their budget which reconciles with the allocation.  The Western Health Board <Col N="2263" /> approved measures which would allow expenditure to be contained within the allocation.  We had a problem with the Southern Health Board.  I had proposals from the South Eastern Health Board. By and large we have had no great difficulty. There is nothing particularly wrong with a hospital saying they do not need to have a certain number of beds filled, for example, in July and August when staff go on holidays or during the Christmas period.  As the Deputy knows as a member of the medical profession, if we had 50,000 beds they would be filled by the medical profession.  They would be filled anyway.  This is one of the realities of acute medical beds.  Provide the beds and they will be filled.  We have a limited number of beds.  There is nothing wrong with a health board saying there is no need to fill all those beds.  For anybody who has acute medical or surgical or psychiatric needs, there are lashings of beds. They do not all have to be filled.</P>

      <P>Is there a reduction in the level of service?  The Minister has told us if there is no need to have a ward open in July it can be closed.  A number of wards have been closed as a result of cutbacks even though the medical board believed they should not have been closed.  Does the Minister believe the abolition of the sight testing scheme means a reduction in the level of services?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the extra funds being made available to the Southern Health Board to provide cardio-thoracic services at the Cork Regional Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted that cardiac surgery should be established in Cork Regional Hospital as soon as possible in the current year and I am committed to providing the funding for this service.  My Department are at present in discussion with the Southern Health Board with a view to establishing in detail the facilities required and level of resource necessary to enable this service to commence as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the requisite finance both on the capital side &mdash; and in this instance there is intensive capital expenditure required &mdash; and the estimated staff costs are provided for this year.  I expect that the consultant who was appointed by the Southern Health Board as a cardiac-thoracic surgeon will return permanently to Cork &mdash; he is currently on sabbatical &mdash; on 1 July 1985 and will then commence <Col N="2266" /> practice.  It will take some time before that service gets fully off the ground but it is well under way.  We did receive an injection of capital funds on a private basis as well towards the centre.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state in respect of the years 1982 and 1983 the number of: (a) public patients and (b) private patients treated (i) by each consultant and (ii) in total, in Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available to my Department.  I am taking steps to ensure that the information will be collected in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that no records are being kept by the Southern Health Board?  If that is the case would the Minister agree that it constitutes a serious omission on their part, that there is inadequate financial management on the part of the board when they cannot identify the level of practice within the different hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Southern Health Board do not keep records of the numbers of such patients treated in particular departments of the hospital or indeed treated by individual consultants.  If patients in category (1) and category (2) ask to be treated as private patients of course they become liable for fees, as in the case of category (3) patients, and they are then regarded as private patients of the consultant concerned. The information has not been collated to date.  I have now directed that the information be collected in future so that we have all of that type of information available to us in relation to the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister intend that this information will be collected in view of the fact that all patients are entitled to free maintenance in hospital? If patients opt for public ward accommodation and then decide to make an arrangement with their consultant to be <Col N="2267" /> treated as a private patient, how does the Minister envisage that this information will be collected or what power has he to ensure that the information will be forthcoming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the level of in-patient and out-patient attendances at the Cork Regional Hospital. I hold the view very strongly that where a patient goes in for in-patient or out-patient facilities he or she is registered as category (1) or category (2) and, if he or she opts out and goes private, the health board and the hospital should record the fact that he has gone private, when we would then know who was treating whom.  We would then have fundamental information necessary in that regard.  As we well know, the very large number of persons eligible for free consultancy services as category (1) or category (2) patients who opt for private care, is a matter of concern.  I am always interested why they opt or feel they should opt.  That information should be available to the Department of Health on a computerised basis particularly in the case of a regional hospital spending £26 million of taxpayers' money every year.</P>

      <P>We have a situation whereby consultants are entitled to provide private care for 15 per cent of the population&mdash;currently it is about 18 per cent.  That is part of the common contract agreement.  If somebody opts from category (1) or category (2), such as a medical card holder, and wants to receive private treatment &mdash; some do, strange as it may seem &mdash; on that basis I want to know (a) who they are, (b) how many there are and (c) what proportion of a consultant's work is devoted to categories (1) and (2).  That is all.  It is a matter of particular interest and also of importance in terms of the common contract agreement, which is a very unusual contract.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, together.  Under revised eligibility <Col N="2269" /> arrangements introduced in 1979 all persons in the State are entitled to accommodation and treatment in a public ward of health board or public voluntary hospitals without charge.  However, persons with an annual income in excess of £12,500 are liable to pay fees to their consultants.  Many of those entitled to treatment without charge opt to become the private patients of consultants and so become liable to pay fees to the consultants. As the hospital does not collect the private fees of consultants or charge for the use of hospital equipment in treating private patients the Cork Regional Hospital does not at present keep records of the number of private patients treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I do not have statutory power at present to enable me to collect information regarding such matters, particularly payments made by the VHI.  I do not have statutory power. That Act was implemented in 1957.  I am contemplating whether or not I should have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that everybody in the State is entitled to free maintenance in a public ward, that some of these people may opt for private treatment by a consultant and that the Cork Regional Hospital, to which this question refers, do not have a record of the people who are treated as private patients.  The Minister said it was not possible to collect that information.  Does he intend to get that information and what power has he to obtain such information, because it would appear to me that that would then constitute the answer to Question No 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have powers to obtain full information regarding the number of persons who opt.  As of now it appears I do not have power to find out <Col N="2270" /> the precise payment made by each person to a consultant.  That is a matter of a private contract between the individual patient and the consultant.  The only other source of information in that regard would be payments made by the VHI. A number of category (2) persons with income under £12,500 a year are members of the VHI and their payments would be made through that board.  The information, therefore, should be available from the VHI.  I do not have the information regarding payment in excess of VHI charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statements made, is the Minister considering a review of the common contract with consultants? Did I also detect that the Minister is considering some form of control on professional fees charged by consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should appreciate that there is nothing to prevent a private citizen from contracting with an independent contractor &mdash; a medical consultant &mdash; to perform a medical procedure provided it is done in accordance with professional registration procedures.  Therefore, there will always be an element of private practice but, where it impinges on public facilities and where such facilities are used, the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Department of Health and the health boards are entitled to full information as to what occurs and to be paid for the use of those facilities. It is within that framework that I will be reviewing the common contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the fact that Tallaght, County Dublin, will not be provided with a hospital until 1992, he will consider providing a 24-hour accident centre there as an interim measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of an accident centre of the type suggested by the Deputy would require back-up services which are only available in an acute hospital setting.  It would not, therefore, be feasible to establish such a centre in Tallaght pending the provision of the new hospital there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not given a satisfactory reply.  Is he aware of the enormous problems in this new city of 75,000 people due to the lack of private and public telephones?  Indeed, public telephones are now being withdrawn from the area and there is great difficulty in contacting ambulances in emergencies.  Is the Minister satisfied that he is fulfilling his responsibility to Tallaght over the next seven years until a hospital is provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government intend to go ahead as quickly as possible with the construction of the new hospital in Tallaght as one of the six major general hospitals serving the Dublin area.  The architectural competition has been completed in relation to the construction of the hospital and the planning board have been doing excellent work.  The results of the architectural competition will be known in July or August of this year and I hope to see the first phase of this hospital built within a few years.  Meanwhile, emergency accident provision for the area will have to be dealt with by the rota of other Dublin hospitals such as Saint James's or the Children's Hospital in relation to accidents involving children. The new hospital will be a very big facility, it will have 450 beds and will take a number of years to build and be fully operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into the whole complexity of major and complex operation rooms and all the detailed facilities which I accept are part of the panoply of a major hospital, I should like the Minister to look into the question of providing at least a basic first aid facility there which could conceivably save lives. <Col N="2272" /> Simple medical procedures could be carried out on the spot although it would not cater for badly injured or seriously ill people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to provide, as quickly as possible, temporary out-patient facilities at Tallaght.  These would be provided by the Meath, Adelaide and the National Children's Hospital liaison committee.  A casualty out-patient facility is an impossibility because if a person comes in with a suspected broken finger, basic radiology facilities would have to be provided to carry out an X-ray and that would mean providing a consultant also.  Otherwise, you would be providing a GP service only which would not be satisfactory.  A casualty unit would have to be staffed 24 hours a day which would involve employing nurses and so on.  Inevitably, we would also have to provide an ambulance for moving people to other hospitals in the event of a serious accident.  I do not think the proposition is feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás MacGiolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the rapidity with which the population is growing in Tallaght.  There will be 100,000 people there by the time the new hospital is scheduled to be completed in 1992.  The Minister said he hoped to speed up the building of the hospital.  Could he say when he expects the first stage of the hospital to be completed and if it will be in a shorter period than seven years assuming that the first stage will be able to provide a temporary accident centre?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The architectural competition results will be out in July or August and it will take at least three years to have the hospital under way.  One cannot spend something in the region of £70 million without a time span of three years.  The hospital board were appointed in 1981 to plan, build, equip and commission the hospital and it took a couple of years to get the agreement of the planning brief for the hospital.  However, as the Deputy knows, it takes three or four years to build a hospital.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive out-patient department is being planned as part of the proposed new hospital for Tallaght.</P>
      <P>In the meanwhile, discussions have been taking place regarding the provision of an out-patient service in Tallaght pending the provision of the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These discussions have been going on for a long time and they should now be finalised.  The outpatients' facility should now be provided especially as the Adelaide Hospital is not only willing but anxious to provide this service in Tallaght.  What has been the delay in making this available and can he say when we will have this facility in Tallaght which is so sorely needed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department and the Eastern Health Board have now received very detailed proposals regarding the specialist clinics to be provided in the Tallaght area in paediatric medicines, paediatric orthopaedics, paediatric surgery, medicine cardiology orthopaedics, urology, surgery, gynaecology, dermatology and psychiatry.  All the sessions are agreed now and the staffing is proposed. One of the conditions laid down by the hospital is that there should be no transfer of resources from the existing hospitals to Tallaght.  That matter has to be resolved, but I am very hopeful that a very early decision will be made on setting up the service.  The site for the new hospital should be in my possession very soon.  I can assure the Deputy that I will not delay on this matter and that neither are the Eastern Health Board delaying it.  They have been very much involved in this whole question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in that regard because if a temporary outpatients' unit is built in advance of the main hospital the work of the clinics would be hampered by a major building programme being in progress around them.  The Eastern Health Board, who are involved in discussions with the hospitals concerned, have identified a possible site in the centre of the old village of Tallaght and that possibility is being pursued. I have a comprehensive brief in regard to the approximate date of operation but I will communicate with the Deputy on that matter.  I assure him there will be no undue delay so far as I am concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-capital allocation which has been approved for health boards and voluntary hospitals for 1985 reflects in appropriate cases the estimated financial benefit of a charge for the use by consultants of public facilities in the treatment of their private patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 February last a letter was sent to the health agencies specifying the amount to be collected from consultants in their employment and asking them to include in their action plan for budget management, 1985 details of the arrangements to collect the moneys.  I am asking the agencies to pursue this matter in the ordinary course of events.  Individual levies were notified to each of the agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the levies amount to £1.4 million, as outlined by the Minister, and would he not accept that this charge, if collected, will be passed on to the patient so that he, and not the consultant, will be paying?  The equipment has been paid for already by the patients as taxpayers and through their health contributions. Would the Minister accept also that, if implemented, this levy will result in patients in categories (1) and (2) opting for public hospital services, and that in that way a large number of patients will be transferred into an already overcrowded public service?  Did the Minister not meet with the medical organisations on a number of occasions in an effort to negotiate this charge with them and, having failed in that respect, has now instructed the health boards to collect the money?  In effect this is asking the health boards to enter into confrontation with the consultants at a time when we should all be grateful that the health boards and all their staffs have ensured that the health services will continue despite reduced allocations.  A serious confrontation would be detrimental to the interest of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage any such confrontation.  I have indicated that the levy &mdash; and the use of that word is for want of a better term &mdash; is on the basis that a reasonable contribution would be made by medical consultants for the use of public facilities in respect of the treatment of their private patients.  In a number of hospitals &mdash; for instance, in the voluntary hospitals in the Dublin area &mdash; the consultants pay over to the hospitals anything from 15 to 33 per cent of <Col N="2276" /> their income for the use of facilities for private patients.  That has been the practice for a number of years.  I am reflecting that procedure by introducing it into those areas where it has not been the practice.  The amount concerned is relatively low.</P>

      <P>Increases in charges for private accommodation in public hospitals are a regular annual occurrence and do not introduce any new element which has not been experienced and dealt with in the context of Voluntary Health Insurance arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the increases in those charges as from 1 January, 1985, the increase in VHI premiums has been restricted to 7½ <Col N="2278" /> per cent with effect from 1 March, 1985. Furthermore, income tax relief will continue to apply to premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that a private bed in a public hospital is now more expensive than a private bed in such places as St. Vincent's Private Nursing Home and that this is the first time that has happened?  Because of the massive increase in the past number of years, the cost of insuring with the VHI has increased by 137 per cent in the past five years.  Much of this is as a result of the increase in the cost of accommodation for private patients in public hospitals.  Is the Minister not concerned about the effects on the VHI and the fact that 60,000 persons per annum are leaving the VHI and coming back into an already overcrowded public health service which is under financed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that people are leaving the VHI.  Last year there were 323,000 subscribers, an increase of 4,000 or 5,000 over the previous year.  There is an inflow in and out of the scheme each year.  The VHI have kept up their subscribers remarkably well.  They cater for 1,013,000 people at the moment.  There have been regular increases of 20 per cent or 25 per cent and I admit these were high but they did no more than reflect to some degree the economic cost of providing a bed in such a hospital.  Taking public hospitals as a whole, the average daily cost of a bed is estimated at £100 at least and, in that context, £83 per private bed is not exorbitant.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment I was attempting to outline the support the Government are giving to the handicapped and the 35 per cent who are dependents.  I said the Government had matters in hand and were awaiting the <Col N="2308" /> report of the commission who are examining the social welfare system.  The Minister said the objective was to maintain long term payments in line with inflation and that short term unemployment benefit and disability payments would be considered in line with take home pay.  He said that the objective also was to channel expenditure to those in need instead of having generalised measures that would help rich and poor alike. The Minister also pointed out that proper and rigorous enforcement of the social welfare code would be undertaken to ensure increased efficiency and cost effectiveness.  He said he would abandon structures and services that are no longer appropriate to current needs.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare have fulfilled many of those objectives. They have given aid and back-up by way of well illustrated explanatory leaflets and documents showing the rates and entitlements of people.  Deputies on the other side pointed out anomalies.  Everyone can suggest improvements that might be made but the question is, where are the resources?  The Exchequer is providing £1.3 billion and I am surprised when I hear people on the other side say that the Government are not making a substantial effort to combat poverty.  The Government are doing all they can in the current depressed climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement the Minister said he was appreciative of the work of the voluntary bodies.  In particular he spoke about assisting day care centres for the old, about providing meals on wheels, services for the physically handicapped, youth club facilities, day care for the homeless and help for unmarried mothers.  In my constituency the Department are assisted by voluntary bodies as well as those who are professionally involved in social services.  Many groups of people work in the evenings and nights and also during the day to provide meals on wheels and many other services.  In Ennis there are many facilities available for the aged and the downtrodden and I suggest that in the coming years the Minister might give more assistance to this kind of work.  The public appreciate <Col N="2309" /> how the Department look after the elderly and handicapped people.</P>
    <P>A certain breakdown seems to occur in the area of administration where communication is very slow.  Some replies from the Department of Social Welfare are delayed inordinately.  In some cases it has taken eight months to send a reply to my representations.  I am not happy about this and I appeal to the Minister to ask the officers in his Department at least to acknowledge representations.  It would expedite matters if the Department of Social Welfare set up computer links in the main employment exchanges, perhaps in the capital towns of each county. Such a link would be of great assistance to the social welfare officers who are doing a very good job.  It would also be of help to applicants who do not know what is happening to their applications.  For instance, if a reference figure is given in error the officers in Dublin seem to ignore the application.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there is greater efficiency in dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the review of smallholders.  I believe the officers were handed a major task when, following the High Court case which disallowed the poor law valuation system, all the applicants for unemployment assistance had to be means tested.  The social welfare officers have got through a considerable amount of work, but many people were very unhappy when their means had been assessed.  I want the social welfare officer to show a lot of the income and expenditure he is going to charge when assessing an applicant.  Because of the cumbersome system which has grown up in the Department, the Minister should provide appeals officers in each western county to hear oral appeals.  Many applicants do not have a rigid book-keeping system and are unable to tell the social welfare officer their total expenditure and income, or lack of income in many cases.  These people deserve to have this system explained properly.  There is no point sending out the present note which is couched in very complicated language saying that an applicant's income has been assessed at £X thousand and his <Col N="2310" /> expenditure at £Y thousand and consequently, according to the Social Welfare Acts, his application is disallowed.  There should be an itemised list.  Since this matter was re-examined, the Minister has sent out a list of expenditure items which are allowed, but I am not sure if the list provided by the Minister is the same as the list used by the social welfare officers. For that reason I ask the Minister to accede to my appeal to have an itemised list so that the applicants would know nothing had been left out.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about old people who have applied for the old age pension but were disallowed because they did not have sufficient credits.  I refer in particular to people who between 1953 and 1974 lost a number of credits because of an income bar.  There is an anomaly here because people who joined the system since 1974 and retired in 1984 and 1985 can get an old age pension but those who contributed from 1953 to 1974 can be debarred.  The Ombudsman made a statement the other day supporting this claim.  He said that he has received most correspondence from old age pensioners who have suffered because of this anomaly. Surely the Minister could have included in this Bill a number of old age pensioners, perhaps those who have 146 or 144 contributions instead of the required 156 or those who had a good average number of contribution because the number involved would be very small. I would like the Minister to explain why this small number of people were not included in this Bill especially since the Ombudsman recommended their inclusion, as did the Commission on Old Age Pensions.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare are doing a very good job under very difficult circumstances.  Over one million people, or 35 per cent, depend on the Department for unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or some form of financial aid.  They are doing a great job in a time of scarce resources.  The declining income will probably lead to a cut-back in services and the Government's objective of maintaining long term payments in line with inflation is meeting the challenge. <Col N="2311" /> Many people do not appreciate the strenuous efforts being made in this area and those who want extra assistance to be given by the Department should say where the resources will come from.</P>
    <P>The new EC Commission set targets for the improvement of the European social dimension and are setting up a new combat poverty programme.  They say in their report that as far as their social policy measures are concerned, they will launch the implementation of the second poverty action programme.  In this House Deputies say instant solutions can be provided for all social welfare problems, but I believe this Government and the Minister are reaching the great majority of our people who are suffering from unemployment, sickness, old age and so on.  I believe the Minister is providing sufficient aid for these people and if Deputies criticise what is being done, it should be constructive criticism, pointing out where the money will come from.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his work.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom dá dtiocfadh liom, an méid atá a dhéanamh ag an Aire a mholadh, ach faraor ní mar sin atá an cás.  Is léir nach dtuigeann an tAire féin chomh dona agus atá cúrsaí sa tír agus nach dtuigeann sé na fadhbanna atá ag daoine i láthair na huaire.  Tá sé soiléir chomh maith nach dtuigeann an tAire fiú amháin an chaoi a n-oibríonn an Roinn atá faoin a chúram féin agus is bocht an rud é go gcaithfidh mise teacht isteach anseo agus na rudaí seo a rá.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the introduction of this Bill and in the glowing terms in which the Minister presented it to the House, and referring to the work of the Department, it is quite clear that he is entirely removed from reality.  The Minister does not seem to understand the hardships endured by people in benefit and he does not understand the working of his Department. Surely the Minister cannot congratulate himself about the fact that he is giving an annual increase of 3 per cent to social welfare recipients when we consider the increases that have come about as a result of the removal of food subsidies, the <Col N="2312" /> increases in the cost of electricity, gas and fuel charges and when one considers the introduction of VAT on clothing and footwear and on household goods generally. Surely the Minister cannot be serious when he says that the increases are sufficient to meet the needs of poor people.</P>
    <P>The method of assessment for unemployment assistance and for pensions has changed drastically since this Minister took office and it is obvious that the officials who do this job are under tremendous pressure from the Department to try to cut everything to the bone.  People tell me about the severe questioning, the harassment and the personal details sought by social welfare officers and this indicates that the pressure is on to try to save every penny.  Other Deputies can confirm that people are sometimes terrified at the prospect of a call from the social welfare officer.  Old people particularly have come to me inquiring about pensions and the possibility of an increase, but at the end of the day when told that it would be necessary for the same official to call to re-investigate their case they invariably opted to leave it alone and to accept what they were getting rather than put up with the harassment and questioning.  These officials are tied to a role in which they have to carry out these investigations in this manner and it is unfortunate that the Department are subjecting their officers to this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to efficiency in his Department.  I cannot agree with him. The experience we as public representatives have with the Department has been verified by a Government Deputy.  We have to wait a long time before even getting an acknowledgment to a query. The people who apply for unemployment assistance and benefits often have to wait long periods for payment.  In the case of sick benefit payments, that situation is the worst of all.  I receive representations almost every week in relation to these matters.  Certificates seem to get lost in the Department and the only one who suffers at the end of the day is the unfortunate applicant, who must seek credit <Col N="2313" /> from the local grocer while waiting for payment.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to appeals on behalf of people who applied for unemployment assistance?  My experience is that there does not seem to be any result.  People make their appeals or they go through public representatives and we never seem to get a reply from the Department as to the outcome of the appeal.  The House, and perhaps the Minister, will be amazed to hear that a person came to me in October 1983 in relation to a cut in his unemployment assistance and yesterday morning I received the final notice from the Department as to the outcome of the investigation. That is a deplorable situation.  I am not sure if the person involved received notification of the position.  This sort of thing treats the House and the Members of the Oireachtas with contempt.</P>
    <P>In relation to sick benefit, when a person has been deemed no longer eligible by the Department they are left waiting for a long time for any decision and in the interim they do not know what to do.  If they apply for supplementary welfare from the health board they cannot get payment until a final decision comes from the Department of Social Welfare.  The supplementary welfare allowance is not back dated so in many instances they must wait several weeks for a decision and lose out in the meantime. Recently, I have noticed that people on long term benefit such as invalidity benefit who were declared by the Department to be eligible for long term invalidity payments are now being called before medical referees.  This has been unheard of in the Department up to now. It proves the point that the Government are scouring the bottom of the pot to save money.  It is both callous and cruel to demand that persons already in receipt of invalidity benefit and who were declared eligible for it by the Department now have to go before a medical referee.  It is terrible that this situation should occur under a so-called Labour Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In the assessment of young single <Col N="2314" /> people living with parents it is past time when the regulation governing their assessment should be changed.  The amount paid to a single person who applies for unemployment assistance in those circumstances depends on the income of his parents.  This is most unfair. There may be a young 19 year old student who finds himself without a job.  He has no hope but to apply for unemployment assistance or to emigrate.  The amount he will get is determined by the parents' income.  He has already been a burden on the parents and it is an embarrassment to find that he will become a further burden on them.</P>
    <P>I know the case of a young fellow who worked in a factory.  His father is a teacher.  The factory closed down and the young man did not have a sufficient number of contributions to qualify for unemployment benefit.  The assessor decided that he would be entitled to 35p per week.  In this day and age that kind of thing is intolerable.  The regulation governing it, which has been there for a long time, must be changed so that young people who apply for unemployment assistance will at least be left with a certain degree of pride.  It is bad enough for them to have to go to the dole office but it is intolerable to be told that they will get only a few pounds a week.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a set figure of £5 or £7.50 per week for young farmers living at home with their parents.  I do not think we can go on in this way and tolerate this. It is rendered worse because no explanation is given about how the assessement was arrived at.  A round figure is assessed for board and lodgings but the person concerned is not given an explanation of how the figure was arrived at.</P>
    <P>In relation to the small farmers' dole, as it is commonly called, the Government have achieved their ambition and have taken £5 million or £6 million out of the pockets of those farmers.  The Government's approach shows scant regard for social justice.  Up to 1966 many of those smallholders did not enjoy any security and had to go to England or Scotland to do seasonal work.  When the notional system of assessment was introduced they were assessed on the land <Col N="2315" /> value and they could produce on their smallholdings without interference from the social welfare officers.  It was most encouraging to see people who heretofore had to emigrate staying on in their holdings with their families.  However, with the abolition of the notional system they are back where they were in the fifties and the ugly term emigration has begun to raise its head again because people are going off day by day, having been left without any income by the social welfare people.  Parents of such families nowadays have to prepare for secondary education and many of the children have to pay bus fares and buy textbooks.  Then we had the reduction in the food subsidies and VAT was imposed on footwear and clothing.  Other difficulties were imposed by the Government, making things impossible for those people.  I do not think there is any other group in our society who would accept that on one day their entire income from social welfare had been taken away, in some cases £40 or £50 a week.  They cannot do without it.  They are forced to keep their children from school.</P>
    <P>Many such smallholders tried to do something to improve their farms and availed of the various schemes, like the AI, the lime subsidy and the farm improvement scheme.  They are the people who have been got at by the social welfare people.  The fellow who sits down or sleeps all day and who will not do anything on his holding will get full benefits while the person who tried to do something over the years is regarded as a fool by his neighbour.  That does not help honest persons to have hope for the future.</P>
    <P>I know people who wanted to get into milk and who got nine or ten cows.  The social welfare people cut them off benefit and all such people could do was to sell off their cows.  If was an evil stroke to cut off the notional assessment system because it made small farmers productive and it gave their owners a pride in themselves. It reminds me of Father McDyer, with whom I was on a deputation before I entered politics.  It is too depressing <Col N="2316" /> to recall what has happened since the notional method of assessment was abolished.</P>
    <P>The two farming organisations, the IFA and the ICMSA, made representations to the Minister and the Government on this issue and two promises were made.  One was that a farmer could list items of expenditure and they would be considered in calculating assessment for entitlement to unemployment assistance and, two, a detailed account as to how the assessment had been arrived at would be given to the applicants by the Department. I am not aware of any constituent of mine having been accommodated in this way by the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the work of the voluntary organisations and help being made available to them.  These organisations are doing a tremendous job and they deserve as much help as possible from the Department and the State.  I do not think that the State could afford to carry out the various jobs they are doing and it would be impossible to provide the services they are giving but for the fact that these services are given voluntarily. Here I compliment the social workers and those involved with the health boards on the wonderful job they are doing in this respect.  If one were to draw a parallel with the officials from the Department of Social Welfare and the people working for the health boards one would find a vast difference.  The officials and the social workers from the health boards are received with open arms everywhere and regarded as guiding lights in the community where they are always prepared to listen and to help, and they show genuine concern for the poor people in our society.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the budget a certain figure was made available to meet the needs of the voluntary organisations employed in the social services.  I would like to mention a project in my constituency. An amount in the region of £73,000 has been decided upon by the Westport Social Service Council to provide facilities for the old, the poor and the disabled in Westport.  Already they have spent £23,796 on a building.  Phase 2 will cost <Col N="2317" /> £24,000, and furnishings and other overheads including the provision of a car park will amount to about £22,000. While local contributions will be sought, the fact that new schools are being built in the area &mdash; and all due credit to the Government for providing these schools &mdash; means that the drain on the resources of the people there is heavy and they have been in contact with the Minister regarding the possibility of getting a substantial grant.  I do not know what criteria the Minister has for providing these grants, but we hope that this effort will be rewarded and that a substantial grant will be forthcoming for the project I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>When it is fully operational, meals on wheels, a laundry service for aged and disabled people, an information and advice centre, counselling rooms, dining facilities for the aged, meeting rooms for voluntary and caring organisations affiliated to the Westport Social Service Centre, a kitchen and other facilities will be provided.  In this International Youth Year it is proposed to include a large multi-purpose room in the new building which will provide facilities for youth and also as a public meeting room.  That kind of work deserves the full support of the Department and I hope that, when the Minister decides on his priorities this will rate highly on the list.</P>
    <P>We must do something soon about the self-employed.  They have absolutely no protection.  I am sure that many people here know of instances of small builders and other people who now find themselves going to the wall and are no longer able to continue with work they have been doing.  These people never bothered to go to the labour exchange to look for unemployment assistance and now they find themselves with no option but to do so in order to support their families.  Here again the long standing policy seems to be that a person must give an account of his earnings for the previous year.</P>
    <P>A person who earned £X in 1984 is supposed to live on that for almost the rest of his life when it comes to the method of assessment for unemployment assistance.  Such people have no protection, <Col N="2318" /> no way of getting assistance except by getting unemployment assistance, and very often their application for that is turned down.  They are forced to emigrate, and these are really fine, great people who were making an honest effort to do something worth while.  Generally speaking, in my experience they are treated very badly when it comes to applying for unemployment assistance.  Very often what is worse is the delay they experience before they get the decision.  They must wait several months before they are told of the final outcome of the investigations. This is most unfair.  I do not know exactly how the problem can be tackled, but some arrangement should be made for perhaps some kind of interim payment to people of this kind, or some allowance that would help to tide them over a difficult period when they are genuinely in need of help and make their application for unemployment assistance.  A more flexible approach should be adopted.  I ask the Minister to examine this with a view to doing something positive in that direction.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Minister's speech deals with the increases I have mentioned. After that, referring to the social welfare code, he said: &ldquo;I now turn to the second main element of this Bill.&rdquo;  We all accept that there is a need and we owe it to the taxpayer to try to ensure that there is no question of fraud or that people will not get away with making any declaration to enable themselves to benefit unfairly from social welfare payments.  Nevertheless, listening to the media last night one would get the impression that everybody looking for social welfare was some kind of rogue or trickster.  We accept that there are irregularities but it is most unfair to people to give that impression. Even the figures that the Minister gave when he referred to the extent of fraud &mdash; unemployment benefit, disability benefit and pay-related benefit, 4,300; unemployment assistance, 1,000; old age non-contributory pension, 270, and social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers, 500 &mdash; are all round figures, but I question them.  If there are irregularities surely the Minister must have the exact <Col N="2319" /> figure.  Why does he not give the exact figure rather than the round figure?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in the case of old age pensioners many of the abuses were discovered after the pensioner died. He said that the bulk of the sums which were overpaid were due to the non-disclosure of means which came to light generally on the death of the pensioner. There is an underlying tone in his speech which verifies what I said earlier that the Department and the Minister have just one objective in mind, knock, knock. This is the case in relation to old age pensioners at present.  In the past when farmers handed over their holding to a member of their family they had no problem in drawing the old age pension.  That is not true any more.  Now they do not automatically qualify for the old age pension. It is annoying for old people to be subjected to the degree of harassment they have to face in relation to their application for their rights.  The old age pension is something they look forward to.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's assessment of the improved efficiency of his Department.  On today's Order Paper there are 37 questions to the Minister and yesterday there were 76 questions.  That is ample proof of what Deputies have to put up with from the Department and of the way the Department does its work.</P>
    <P>The way the family income supplement scheme has been implemented is a joke. The Department do not want anyone to know anything about it.  We were told that applications would be in the region of 35,000 but we know that the figure is much lower than that.  People are entitled to be informed about how the scheme operates.  This information should be made available to them at their place of employment so that they can gain from the benefit which many of them would like to have at this time with prices rising as they are.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I could make in relation to the Bill but I have already taken up too much of the time of the House.  We will be opposing the Bill vigorously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not surprising to hear that Deputy Gallagher is opposing an increase of this nature.  That is to be expected from that side of the House. The Bill provides for increases in the payments of social insurance, social assistance and occupational injuries in line with inflation and, in some cases, in excess of it.  If one looks at the total expenditure on social welfare since the middle sixties it has grown from approximately £60 million then &mdash; the £ had a much higher purchasing power at that time &mdash; to around £1,133 million in 1981. That is an exceptional increase.  When we look at the bureaucracy which has been created in the social welfare system we see that it is one area, apart from the taxation area, that begs considerable investigation.</P>
      <P>There are improvements in the family income supplement scheme.  The thinking and principle behind the scheme is good but it is a scheme which will allow people to think about defrauding the State of moneys which they are not entitled. It has been suggested by a variety of newspaper commentators that the level of fraud in the social welfare area this year will be somewhere around £12 million.  The construction industry were extremely critical of the provisions in the budget.  I know we cannot blame legitimate registered builders as they are not party to the form of employment which lends itself to people earning a wage of £100 a week and also earning £100 per week through the social welfare system. That kind of abuse is widespread but who is paying for it?  When we look at the over-burdened taxpayer we must conclude that the whole thing is a national scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the fraud is extremely serious.  I am not referring to the unemployed person who has tried desperately to get a job and cannot do so.  Such a person might get work for a day or two but because of the cumbersome way the social welfare system deals with that there are serious problems.  I am not talking about those people but about professionals who perhaps are registered for unemployment assistance several times. <Col N="2321" /> I read one newspaper comment which highlighted this very serious practice.  It is no harm to mention it in this House.</P>
    <P>The scale and extent of welfare fraud is a national scandal particularly when viewed against the background of the number of people who are contributing through the PAYE taxation system, which is extremely penal and is seen to be such, and we are making very little headway towards improving that system. We will not improve it until we improve the other areas which are making additional and excessive demands on the PAYE taxpayers' money.  We also have the PRSI system which is, too, a considerable burden.  I had hoped that in the budget some attempt would have been made to lessen that burden on employers and employees.  About 700,000 people are deriving support from it.</P>
    <P>Benefits totalling millions of pounds are going astray and being handed out to what I regard as locusts who are feeding on the system and making every attempt to find their way around the system and to abuse it.  At present the unemployment figure is around 225,000.  There are pressures on the level of taxation which can be raised.  It is very important that families should not be left on the breadline and that genuine people in need are looked after.  I would not wish to undermine a system which attempted to provide for the needy and underprivileged.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there are sufficient personnel in his Department to see that the abuse of the system is diminished to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>We have conmen with a long string of names and addresses drawing weekly benefit from as many as a dozen exchanges.  They dress well.  They live comfortably.  Generally they have a life style which is totally incompatible with their jobless status.  That problem needs to be addressed in our society.  In the debate on the Private Members' Motion on the construction industry and on other motions, Deputies shed crocodile tears about the situation which exists in the Border towns.  They are not prepared to address themselves to the problem which is perhaps far worse than trading across <Col N="2322" /> the Border, that is, abuse by unscrupulous people in the building trade who are uninsured.  The Department of the Environment have a responsibility here. We are paying out taxpayers' money in the form of grant aid and grant assistance for new houses and in other spheres. There should be some monitoring in many cases to ensure that people are not abusing the system.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be over critical of people who are forced by circumstances to work an extra day.  I am not concerned about those people.  I believe there should be a guaranteed minimum wage. We have those unscrupulous employers. I do not know what type of system they think we are operating.  They allow their workers a half a day off or a few hours in the morning to go and sign on and then to go and collect their allowances.  That is happening on a wide scale.  It must be tackled.</P>
    <P>We have the &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; men who are referred to as moonlighters in some parts of the country.  They do all sorts of handy jobs such as plumbing, wallpapering and painting.  They pay no tax and they draw their social welfare.  While we may have 225,000 on the unemployment register, the figure may be far less.  We have a high level of unemployment in Dublin and in some of the major cities and the urban areas.  We have a scandalous level of unemployment, and we appear to be doing very little about it.  Some attempt was made in the budget to try to redress that situation and, however feeble it is, it has to be applauded.  People in the urban areas have not got the same level of opportunity as people in the rural areas.  We are trying to administer a system of social welfare from Dublin when it could be done far more effectively from central localised areas where everybody would have a fair idea of who was and who was not on the fiddle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It throws one off one's line of thought.  I suppose one cannot be over critical of the Deputy.  This is not the first time he has made a nuisance of himself in the House.  Prosecutions are expected in a dole fraud worth more than £500,000 which was uncovered by the Department of Social Welfare in a market gardening centre in North County Dublin this year.  All these people were drawing social welfare and drawing pay as well.  Any of those people could have come into our consultation clinics as we call them.  We would expect the Department almost to bend over backwards to accommodate them.  The measure of dishonesty on the part of the politician in this regard is that we attempt to get more and more out of the system.  It has been added to piecemeal over the years and has now become a type of albatross around our necks in that we find it exceedingly difficult to provide for genuine beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>There is another type of dishonest or fraudulent person who creates for himself a number of phantom families, who is able to give a variety of addresses around the country.  One such person who disguised himself as a Presbyterian Minister, when he left the country, was able to say we had the easiest system in the world to defraud.  It is to those types of cases I would hope the provisions of the Bill would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been mention of the family income supplement.  Here the principle was right but it is another benefit which will lend itself to fraudulent behaviour; the employer will find a way around it.  The situation now obtaining means that a person in receipt of an average wage in excess of £125 depending on the number of his dependants gets nothing. I have no doubt but that some workers will succeed, in the case of certain types of employers, in reducing the level of certified wages so that they will appear <Col N="2325" /> eligible for benefits and then reach under the counter to compensate for anything else.  Some people may contend that does not happen.  When a social welfare system must provide for needy people against that type of background it is exceedingly difficult to implement it in a fair and equitable fashion.  I should like to see a localised system promoted which would eliminate many of the abuses at present perpetrated within the system.</P>
    <P>I want to deal also with sickness benefit.  Deputy Gallagher was right in contending that a person who finds himself or herself cut off from this benefit for one reason or another may not always be the person who is guilty or who should be penalised.  I have had experience of unmarried mothers losing their allowance because of slanderous statements made against them or accusations of a wife against a husband who had left her and so on when, without any concrete or substantive proof, the social welfare officer has cut off the appropriate allowance. Were it not for the system operated under the various health boards some families would find themselves destitute.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the embargo on recruitment and how it affects the social welfare area, that there are now insufficient personnel to examine complaints. So much duplication exists at county council level, health board level, the planning level, the environmental level and at the social welfare level surely it should be possible to co-ordinate most of these systems having them operate in a way fair to all concerned.  I want to see employers penalised just as much as others who abuse the system because the millions of pounds saved could be of additional benefit to beneficiaries.  We are all concerned about people in receipt of long term unemployment assistance.  Under the schemes being promoted under the current budgetary provisions there is scope to deal with such beneficiaries. Now if such applicants get work for a year or 15 months &mdash; giving them some degree of dignity &mdash; they can afterwards revert to the level of assistance they were on beforehand, a provision to be lauded.</P>
    <P>The basic increases being given are in <Col N="2326" /> line with inflation.  During the term of office of the Opposition they introduced budgets giving a 10 per cent increase across the board when inflation was running at 20 per cent, which meant there was no real benefit to recipients.  It is hypocritical and dishonest to oppose the Bill because one contends it does not provide sufficient funds.  But if one opposes it because one contends it does not provide the necessary structures, power and wherewithal to the Minister to eliminate abuses of the system such opposition is much more acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the debate we have had concerns the minimal increases granted under the provisions of this Bill and the publicity concerning the amount of fraud prevalent in the social welfare system.  I should like to say something about both matters.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing to note that the small increases will not be paid until 11 July next which contrasts with the provisions of previous Bills introduced when there were increases of 10 per cent and 12 per cent under Fianna Fáil Governments and when the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Cluskey, granted increases of over 20 per cent.  Over the whole year these increases amount to 3 per cent only and are very disappointing.  When one takes into account these miserly increases, the 7 per cent increase in ESB charges effected last November, the withdrawal of food subsidies and the fact that there was no increase granted in children's allowances it will be seen quite readily that these constitute hardship for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much discussion of the elderly in recent weeks.  I was disappointed to note the savings of £2 million on non-contributory old age pensions, which must mean that there have been lower rates of non-contributory old age pensions paid to applicants.  Talking about the progress report on social welfare last year the Minister said that the payment of old age pensions would now be expedited because the old age pension committees were to be abolished.  I should like to know from the Minister if <Col N="2327" /> there is any evidence that is happening. Most pensioners who come to me with problems tell me that they must wait a long time for a decision to be taken in respect of their old age pension.  They do not now have an opportunity of seeing the social welfare officer to discuss their claims.  It is regrettable that the social welfare officers are now so busy they do not have time to talk to a pensioner about his or her claim.  Because of the publicity about attacks on the elderly I am glad that many old age pensioners have put some of their moneys into savings accounts with lending institutions.  I would hope that the Minister for Social Welfare would intervene with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to allow greater interest rate limits in respect of such savings.</P>
    <P>The prescribed relative allowance is related closely to the old age pension.  A review of this scheme is warranted.  I would hope that its outcome would benefit more pensioners.  As that scheme operates at present it appears that many pensioners lose benefit because they may have a son or daughter looking after the farm and they are not regarded as a suitable prescribed relative.  The merits of the prescribed relative allowance are that people are looked after in their homes, thereby minimising the amount of hospitalisation. I hope that review will be a positive one.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned fraud in the social welfare system and I am disappointed that the hardships endured are not highlighted in the same way as fraud in which organised criminals are involved.  One reason why the Minister could not give the precise amount drawn unlawfully is that we have only 30 officers in the whole country investigating incidents of fraud. That is not sufficient to deal with the problem.  The Minister said in the House yesterday that he estimated there was something in the region of a sum of £6.4 million saved in unemployment payments because of interviews conducted by the Department which resulted in people signing themselves off the register.  We welcome any investigations, especially in <Col N="2328" /> regard to unscrupulous employers which were referred to, which will wipe out fraud but we are forgetting the hardships endured by many people who are signing themselves off the register because they are so frustrated at the long delays in having their claims and appeals dealt with.  Let us have no more nonsense about this.  More officers must be appointed to deal with allegations of fraud which would result in appeals being dealt with much more quickly.</P>
    <P>Young people in particular have to wait for a considerable length of time to have their claims dealt with.  When the young person is living at home, the means test is too rigid.  Perhaps the Department feel that school leavers will get jobs but they should be realistic about their chances of finding employment.  Some Deputies said that the figure of 234,000 unemployed is not accurate.  I suggest that it is much higher as many people do not sign on because their claims have been disallowed and they are not included in the figures.  Married women especially have great difficulty in having their claims dealt with even when they clearly state that they have someone to look after their children and that they are available for work.  They are questioned time and time again about their application and may, with difficulty, receive benefits.</P>
    <P>What the Department refer to as people of no fixed abode are discriminated against although they do not receive much publicity.  In my constituency, they are referred to as the travelling people living in caravans or tents and who, because of Department regulations, have to go to a particular exchange on a certain day of the week to sign on for their social welfare entitlements.  These people often have to travel 20 miles or more to an exchange and I cannot see why they should not be allowed to sign on like everybody else at the local Garda station.  I ask the Minister to end this discrimination because there is considerable hardship involved in very cold weather.</P>
    <P>We should be talking about the social welfare appeals system because smallholders have to wait many months <Col N="2329" /> to have their claims dealt with.  The Minister told us two years ago that there were over 14,000 farmers to be investigated and I understand that appeals have been decided for 9,000 of them.  However, I received a reply today from the Department of Social Welfare stating that there are still 6,876 farmers who got no increase in payment of unemployment assistance or whose payments were reduced or terminated.</P>
    <P>There is very little information given when a claim is refused by the Department of Social Welfare and yet one is expected to state in writing on an official form the grounds on which one wishes to appeal.  How can you answer a case against you if you do not know what the case is?  The claimant is not given details of the decision on appeal; he or she is merely told if it is favourable or not favourable.  Naturally, people feel that the appeals officer will always uphold the deciding officer's decision in each case. The appeals officer can decide on the basis of the deciding officer's report and, even on the rare occasions when an oral hearing is granted, the deciding officer does not even have to attend.  It is difficult to see the appeals officer as an independent adjudicator between the claimant and the Department.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about lost certificates in relation to disability benefit and we must ask whether an appeals officer with no medical background is a suitable person to deal with these claims.  When an appeals officer has conflicting reports from the applicant's doctor and the medical referee, what does he do in those circumstances? I imagine he would lean towards the Department's evidence.  I cannot understand why part of the administration of the Department of Social Welfare should not be taken out of Dublin.  At present there is a merry-go-round whereby people apply to local exchanges, forms are sent to regional offices and eventually to Dublin.  After a long process, they come back to the local exchange.  Why not have an appeals officer in Galway, for example, which is <Col N="2330" /> the largest county in the western region? If the Government had gone ahead with the decentralisation programme, there would be more sanity in the social welfare system.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to put pressure on the Minister to have appeals dealt with more quickly than at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for that information. I hope that the family income supplement scheme will be improved. The progress report on social welfare mentioned giving it more publicity but, with all due respect, more is needed.  I am glad that the amounts are raised in the Bill but the scheme should be extended to the unemployed.  There is hardship on families where the bread winner loses a job and it would not take any great ingenuity on the part of the Minister to improve and extend the scheme.  I understand that originally the scheme was intended to operate for only 12 months but I hope it can be continued next year.</P>
      <P>In the past number of years there have been many innovations in the form of new schemes in the social welfare system. One thinks particularly of those introduced by Fianna Fáil Governments such as the free fuel, free electricity and free travel schemes.  I am disappointed that none of those schemes is being extended by way of this Bill.  I was interested to hear Dr. Solan of the Western Health Board speak recently about these schemes.  He made an interesting point in regard to certain parts of the country &mdash; namely, isolated areas &mdash; where the free travel scheme may not be of much benefit.  He suggested that in those cases it would be preferable that the Department increase the pension instead of providing free transport which might never be availed of.  I trust the Minister will keep this in mind in any review of the scheme.  There are anomalies in the social welfare system that should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2331" /> The Government should be concentrating more on improving the economy and creating jobs in order to bring about a reduction in the numbers unemployed and thereby reducing the numbers requiring social welfare payments.  This in turn would bring about a reduction in the many problems in the administration of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I should like to have more details on the social welfare employment scheme.  I note from the information booklet supplied to us that local authorities will be the biggest sponsors of the scheme but many of these bodies are in financial difficulties so they will need to know what will be the cost of operating the scheme. One can only hope that the scheme will be successful and that even more than the anticipated 10,000 jobs will be provided as a result of it.</P>
    <P>There are problems regarding consistency in assessing entitlement to social welfare payments and in the levels of assistance to be paid.  This is one of the main complaints brought to our attention. Obviously, if a person who has been refused a certain benefit or assistance learns that another in the same circumstances has got payment, he will ask questions. There should be standardisation in these matters so as to prevent anomalies from arising.  I have always been amazed that health boards, after applying a means test to an applicant for a social welfare payment, can arrive at a level of payment that is totally different from that recommended by the social welfare officer.  Surely a person who is in receipt of old age pension, for example, should be entitled automatically to a medical card, but that is not always the case.  This is one example of where standardisation is necessary.</P>
    <P>In 1984 there have been many factory closures, especially in the Cork area, and there have been complaints that the redundancy payments have been used very unfairly in assessing people for social welfare benefits.  We have heard of people who have been out of work for more than a year and who suffer some hardship when their social welfare payments <Col N="2332" /> are reduced.  The Minister should investigate such areas and endeavour to have a fair method of assessment.</P>
    <P>Both the IFA and the ICMSA have made a strong application to the Department for help for farmers who find themselves in financial difficulty because of their herds being locked up as a result of an outbreak of disease, especially bovine TB.  It has been suggested that some type of supplementary social welfare payment might be paid in such circumstances.  I would support that case because of the hardship suffered by farmers while their herds are locked up.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare scheme, as it applies in the Western Health Board area is not financed equitably <i>vis-à-vis</i> the manner in which other health boards are treated.  Special allocations should be made to help people who are experiencing difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if anyone here would seriously oppose this measure which seeks to implement the budgetary provisions in the area of social welfare. The sheer scale of the problem is extraordinary, but the Bill is designed to try to ensure that those in the social welfare categories do not fall further behind in living standards.  I prefer to deal with the Bill in the context of its being a symptom of some deeper problem with which perhaps we should deal at some stage.  First, we should remind ourselves of the enormity of the difficulties being experienced. This can be gauged from the figures in respect of social welfare.  For instance, each day of the year about £6 million is spent on social welfare, while there are about 1.4 million people, or some 30 per cent of the population, in receipt of some form of social welfare benefit.  Expended in that way is 25 per cent of gross current expenditure or 15 per cent of GNP. Between 1974 and 1984 there was an increase of about 30 per cent in the number of people in that unfortunate category. This presents an enormous challenge to our economy and to our society. Any attempt to try to help those in need must have the approval of all sides of the House.  However, the problem is not as <Col N="2333" /> simple as that.  The scale of social welfare expenditure is a very potent reminder of the level of poverty in our community. That is not to say that one should accept glibly the figures presented as an indicator of the real level of poverty or deprivation, but they are a barometer in this respect.  If one considers what is happening in society one must realise that the whole area must be dealt with on two levels.</P>
      <P>As in the case of his predecessors, the Minister seeks to deal with the Bill compassionately to the extent that resources permit in trying to ensure the people depending on social welfare receive at least enough to enable them sustain life. But in many cases those subsistence levels are extremely low.  In some cases people are expected to live on weekly incomes that would not buy them a good pair of shoes.  It is not easy to overturn that situation suddenly, but it is the reality.  Sometimes we hear people who are outside the social welfare categories speak glibly about those out of work being better off than those who are employed.  I do not know of anyone in this House, for instance, who would volunteer to give up his job and live on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I appeal to those who might take the line that one is better off unemployed not to engage in that type of propaganda but instead to make an effort to meet with those who are depending on social welfare payments.  Then, they would soon realise that, in terms of human dignity and potential, it is a tragic situation to be unemployed.  In most cases the unemployed are people who had set out with a desire to live useful lives but who through no fault of their own became dependent on social welfare, finishing up at a level of poverty and disadvantage which is debilitating them in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document produced by the Department of Social Welfare entitled <i>Statistical Information on Social Welfare Services</i>, the most recent edition of which is 1983, is an interesting and graphic indicator of the sheer burden this area of expenditure places on the State.  This is obvious when one sees that there are 1,189,530 <Col N="2334" /> people in insured categories in receipt of various kinds of benefit and that there are 283,516 people with old age, retirement or blind persons' pensions.  There is a whole litany of people of various categories all of whom are living at a standard far inferior to what any of us would want for them.  We should remind ourselves regularly that those who sometimes influence or shape public opinion live at standards that are far in excess of these categories.  Sometimes we do not take into account the real tragedy of the statistics because we can be overcome by the sheer statistical data and not realise that every unit can mask a human tragedy.  Despite the new-found affluence that apparently abounds at present, there is also an enormous poverty problem. The Bill deals with that at one level.  I should like to quote from a book entitled <i>One Million Poor</i> edited by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy and which contains an article by Tony Brown.  It states, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>For those who believe that poverty is a function of inequality and that inequality is an inherent part of the socio-economic system inherited by the modern nations of Europe, the battle against poverty must take on a two-fold aspect &mdash; with the firm understanding that the two elements are closely linked and that one without the other must be futile.  The battle must be fought to alleviate the affects of poverty and to bring about the changes in structures essential to the elimination of the scourge of poverty.  Only in the context of a commitment to the long term goal of elimination can even the most enlightened and far-reaching programme of alleviation through the social services and income-maintenance be of any real service.  That is the lesson of the welfare state experience of the past thirty years and it is only being learned with the greatest reluctance. </P>
    <P>The programme of alleviation of poverty which is the kernel of the Bill deals with the planned application of resources to a wide range of social welfare schemes. However, the one that concerns me, and <Col N="2335" /> which I ask the Minister to consider, is the more fundamental one, namely, the need for a systematic programme for the elimination of the fundamental structural problems that give rise to the symptom contained in the horrifying figure of £6 million every day that goes to assist people in the social welfare categories. That is the real challenge, and the ultimate test of our political system will be if it can cope with it.  If the system cannot cope it will be overcome.  The ultimate test of our quality as a society will be whether we have sufficient compassion and willingness to give to ensure a systematic redistribution of resources to those in need.  That will mean stresses and strains. I am not convinced the present political system is capable of delivering that service because it will have to take from those who usually underpin the political system.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed in the Bill will help to sustain people against the rising tide of inflation and prices but they will not alter anything fundamentally and are not designed to do that.  At some stage there should be a fundamental re-assessment of the basic reasons why such levels of the various social welfare benefits arise.  In my view the Bill deals competently with the first level of that two-tier challenge which is to keep people at least slightly above the subsistance level.  However, that is not really what Parliament should be about and it is not what the job of leadership and government is about. It is ultimately about changing the shape of society so that we do not have to consign people to some kind of wastebin of subsistence.  That is the ultimate goal. There is no great merit or thanks due to anybody for continually topping up schemes simply to allow people to keep body and soul together.  I hope that does not sound churlish or ungracious but that is the reality.  That is the easy part.  The hard bit is when one decides that large sections of the population should not have to put up with what they are being asked to accept at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that there are limitations here and there are difficulties <Col N="2336" /> facing a Government which we must accept.  In an article by J.C. Kincaid entitled &ldquo;Poverty and Equality in Britain&rdquo; he outlined the reality that poverty will always be with us.  He said:</P>
    <P>So long as society is organised on a deeply competitive basis, it appears as indispensable that social failure should exist for individuals as a visible and possible fate.  Poverty is such a fate, just as mental illness is another. Poverty cannot be considered as a residual, historically determined defect of an otherwise fair society but as an integral element that helps to support competitive social order.  It follows, therefore, that proposals to reduce poverty often involve very much more than technical and administrative problems.  They tend rather to raise issues of principle about the whole structure of society. </P>
    <P>In its own way the Bill points to the fundamental problem.  I do not necessarily accept Mr. Kincaid's analysis of poverty as a healthy feature of an organised competitive society, the extension of which would be that a large grouping of permanently unemployed people would be good for market place conditions.  It is a feature Governments have to confront and we have to recognise that difficulty.</P>
    <P>If we are even to begin a structural assault on poverty we have to be realistic. We have to accept that the present parliamentary and party system is competitive in its own way.  Irrespective of whatever party are there, one always gets calls for more expenditure from the opposite side of the House, for more people to be employed and for higher social welfare benefits.  When the need for structural change is about taking from many of those who support the administration in power and when it is clear that it may remove from office those responsible for introducing such an initiative, it cannot be denied that is a major challenge and I cannot see it being dealt with very easily. However, I have three suggestions to make in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is one area where the somewhat tarnished image of Parliament in the eyes <Col N="2337" /> of people as a place that is not relevant and responsive could triumph.  Is it not conceivable that all parties here could decide to create a demilitarised zone within which the problem of poverty could be dealt with effectively, to set up if necessary a parliamentary committee and to try to ensure that there is a pact between the parties?  This would mean that we agree poverty is a fundamental problem which can only be dealt with in a structural way and that we should rule out of order an electoral approach to the problem of poverty, which is simply that we are going to spend more money than the other party on certain people.  I do not know if to suggest such a pact is naive but if we could somehow defuse the problem of poverty we might begin to deal with the long and tedious problem of redistribution of resources.  This is a major challenge for each of us, but especially for the hierarchy in our respective parties.  May I respectfully suggest that such a dialogue might take place so that we might begin to change things fundamentally?</P>
    <P>I note that in the budget there is money available for further research by a combat poverty group.  I wish them every success in their work and I know that individual schemes run by combat poverty agencies have been successful, although everyone has not perceived it in that way.  My view is that they have contributed a net gain to the problems they were dealing with but I do not believe there is any need for new research.  There is a library of material on the problems of and reasons for poverty and there is a library of human experience which testifies to it. What is necessary now is a sense of realism and a capacity to accept that the present structures may not allow us, because of our party political nature, to deal with these problems in an infrastructural or structural way and the realignment of those structures in order to cope. I need to be convinced that there is need for further research or enlightenment in that respect.</P>
    <P>My next suggestion was made by previous speakers and also in a publication by the Institute for Public Administration, <Col N="2338" /> written by John D. Roche, called <i>Poverty and Income Maintenance Policies in Ireland, 1973-80.</i>  On page 237 it was suggested that further research be undertaken to develop a minimum income on the lines outlined in order to establish a basic amount of income related to personal and family needs as a guideline to income maintenance policy for combating financial poverty.  What I am suggesting is that if the capitalist system means that poverty will be always there as a natural outgrowth of the way the marketplace operates, then perhaps the kind of target for the discussion groups I suggested earlier could be a minimum wage.  It would be commonly agreed that there are minimal standards to which everybody is entitled and that nothing should stand in their way, even if that means telling people at the top of the scale, people in this House or even our best supporters, that we are very sorry but for the next five years their situation will be worsened because there are other people who are part of a cycle and culture of poverty in parts of our cities, especially young people, who do not have any hope and who believe that nobody in this House cares whether things change for them or not.  Some consideration along the lines of minimum standards and wages would be appropriate for these discussion groups.</P>
    <P>We have risen to the challenge in relation to people in employment.  We have introduced minimum conditions for people in jobs and in other areas and we are very good at introducing regulatory Bills, but the one area in which we do not seem to be concerned is in the area of poverty, people on the breadline and those on the lower end of the social welfare scale.  We throw them a few bob and hope everything works out.  I represent a constituency which has a higher than average number in that category and I want to tell them that we have come to the stage at which people are not just being stripped of financial and material wellbeing, but are also losing a sense of hope and purpose as well as a sense of their own dignity.  This is particularly true among young people and we are seeing <Col N="2339" /> the result of that.  They believe that any thrill, any excitement or any vicarious outlet for experimentation is better than a humdrum existence at the end of which there seems to be no hope and no reason to go on.</P>
    <P>The assertions of certain figures in the Bill tell us a lot about the way we think. This is not essentially a fiscal document, it is philosophic in its core.  It tells us the order of priorities.  It tells us what is most important, what is important and what is least important, but I am not convinced that we have ever reassessed the whole area of social welfare expenditure to ascertain if we should be spending more money in some categories and less in others.</P>
    <P>I will give two examples of the way we could use our resources better but I am not suggesting these are a definite point of view.  I think it is ludicrous that I get children's allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's wife gets the children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear me out and the Deputy will understand the point I am making.  If the wives unfortunately have to be sustained by children's allowances that in itself is a problem but the problem may not necessarily be dealt with exclusively, or even at its best by sustaining a system which might be an improvement because it would ensure that those who needed the money got more and those who did not need it did not get it.  That is one suggestion.  I also suggested some years ago that unemployed people might be helped if we allowed them free transport at certain times so that they could attend interviews.  Transport fares are a great impediment for people who are trying to get to interviews.  A simplistic, blinkered approach would not see that as an option to helping the unemployed; they would see it simply as a question of how much money one gives in unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the tome issued by the Department giving statistical information of social welfare services we see the incredible amount of money being spent <Col N="2340" /> on this Department.  There is a case to be made for this money to be reassessed to see if we can do better and give more to those who need most and ensure that the wanton abuse stops.  I want to make a suggestion which might sound draconian, but if we are serious about this then we should consider the possibility of introducing mandatory jail sentences for people who steal from others, which is what social welfare fraud is.  We should not subscribe to the hypocritical theory which applies in this country that if you can get away with it is all right. This is theft and the reason why these limits are relatively low is that there is not enough money to go round.  Yet we all know of numerous cases of people who are engaged in fraud, day in and day out.  We hear of the odd case coming up in court, but if we are serious about this we could introduce this very effective deterrent.  If people realised they could suffer such tough action if caught, there would be an immediate cessation of abuse by many people at present engaged in fraud.  I do not think we should be distracted by this question of fraud.  It is highlighted up and down the country and is doing a great disservice to many people who have to live off social welfare, the majority of whom are very decent and honourable and would prefer not to be dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but hope that at some stage in this House we will have a series of measures which will try to point towards a structured assault on the basic problem of poverty in our society, which is the real challenge and which these figures in a way mask.  If we keep topping up the figures and keep people subsidised to a certain limit, to the extent that most of them are not hungry or are reasonably able to get by, it will help to keep the problem at day.</P>
    <P>We have enormous problems.  If we develop the projection on social welfare expenditure over the next four or five years there are staggering implications and it is an enormous challenge to society.  The Government of the day are the people who must make the running and the only way to do that is to take a <Col N="2341" /> deep breath, grit one's teeth and decide that at long last we will make that sustained assault on ingrained structured predictable poverty in society.  That assault has not happened to date though many Members of this House in positions of authority have promised such an approach.  On behalf of the kids in my constituency I emphasise that their time is now.  We understandably got into an hysterical debate about crime but there is no alternative and there will be no alternative except a crimeridden degenerating urban society unless we tackle the root problems in a genuine positive way.  I would suggest some sort of inter-party pact to begin that process rather than our pulling political strokes coming up to elections, pretending that each of us has a monopoly on wisdom when we know that all that each of us has is a corner of truth and a little wisdom. We should put that problem right in the forefront as there is nothing more crucial or fundamental than the stability and wellbeing of our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Keating with a certain interest. As a former constituency colleague of Deputy Keating I have always found his contributions rather stimulating though a bit hard-hitting at times.  Nevertheless I know Deputy Keating well enough to accept that his contribution is normally made in a genuine spirit and that he is well meaning and so on.  I imagine that all Deputies in this House share his views. We are all seriously concerned about the plight of many people living on social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past few years it appears that the policies being pursued by this Government have reduced the living standards of people on social welfare benefits.  The situation has been going downwards, particularly during the last two years.  It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the less well-off sections are reasonably well looked after.  I do not intend to cite individual social welfare cases.  Nonetheless the Minister must be aware of the consequences <Col N="2342" /> of the harsh decisions on the old, the weak and the defenceless.  These decisions are imposed, I have no doubt, on the direct instruction of the Minister's office.  They have caused countless problems for thousands of people.  For example a non-contributory old age pensioner has to go before what is almost like a grand jury and have every detail of his life examined.  It is wrong to subject people who have been thrifty during their working lifetimes and who have saved for their retirement, in the post office, the bank or building society, when they come to retirement age, to disqualification from a non-contributory pension and not to qualify for a contributory pension, simply because they have some savings.  In the case of a widow whose husband may not have paid sufficient contributions through to fault of his own, when the State should be giving her some comfort she finds that her application for non-contributory widow's pension is turned down because of some savings or because he contributed to a pension scheme which will give her a small pension from a private source not sufficient to live on.  The social welfare officer will consider that her income is above the qualifying limit.  This is a wrong situation and it should be remedied by the Government.  Unfortunately too many people are finding themselves in those circumstances.  It is happening more and more at the moment because many workers are retiring who have not sufficient contributions to meet their requirements.  During the sixties and early seventies many people were not covered to contribute to the social welfare system because their income was in excess of a limit set at that time.  Unfortunately they went through a number of years in employment not making contributions through no fault of their own.  I have discovered from a large number of representations in such cases that at no time were these people advised by the Department that if they did not continue contributions on a voluntary basis they would not qualify for pensions on retirement or for any other benefits upon reaching the age of 66.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system has been <Col N="2343" /> standing still during the past number of years.  In fact it has been going backwards. Every year should see a further progression in the streamlining of social welfare policies geared to meet the requirements of the years ahead.  We are falling behind our European partners in this regard.  The Government despite many promises have so far failed to introduce any national pension scheme which would apply not only to those employed but to the self-employed.  This is very necessary.  In all the EC countries except Ireland there is a national pension scheme covering the whole population for basic pensions and there is a second level of income or earnings-related pension scheme provided under the social security system.  In other European countries the generally accepted retirement age is 65 although in France and Italy it is as low as 60.  Most countries also have provision for flexibility in pensionable age by allowing pensions to be drawn earlier than the normal age or to be deferred for a period beyond pensionable age. This type of facility affords the individual some choice concerning the date of retirement and also contributes to creating employment for younger people.  There is a bonus for a person retiring early but wishing to defer payment of the pension to a later age.  In the UK in those circumstances the pension is increased by 7½ per cent for each year of deferment.  Another aspect of the social welfare system in European countries is the fact that there is no single policy governing retirement conditions which would discourage those seeking pensions from undertaking further remunerative work after their official retirement.</P>
    <P>In my view that type of situation should be allowed only where there is full employment, and in the present climate here and in the foreseeable future I cannot see this arising.  In the past ten years, for example, the real value of social welfare benefits have increased.  It will be recalled that Fianna Fáil Governments were most sincere in granting increases of up to 25 per cent in three successive years.  That was a contribution <Col N="2344" /> which in real terms raised the standards of living of those in receipt of benefits.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, that has been eroded particularly in the past three years.  Both the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare are responsible because the increases given were not sufficient to cushion welfare recipients from price increases and the general increase in the cost of living.  In their document the Government pledged that overall Exchequer provision for social welfare in the following three years would be increased by 25 per cent on the 1984 figures.  Unfortunately, it is inevitable that inflation will be much higher than 25 per cent between 1984 and 1987.  The document was published in October last and it brings us up to 1987, a four year period.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Estimate for this year was prepared when we had 215,000 unemployed.  Within two months unemployment increased by almost 19,000 to the present figure of 234,000.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance indicated that there would be a saving of £7.3 million on social welfare, and it is now very clear that the Minister for Social Welfare will be faced with real difficulties. He will have to make the harsh decision to cut back even further in more drastic fashion than he has done so far or he will have to persuade the Minister for Finance to bring in a mini budget later in the year solely to cover social welfare for 1985.</P>
    <P>The indicators at present do not augur very well for the prospects of an improvement in the unemployment figures between now and the end of December. Therefore it becomes obvious that the Minister will be faced with the difficulties I have spoken about &mdash; the alternative of cutting back or of introducing a mini-budget. We have had so many cutbacks in the past couple of years that it is hard to imagine there is any room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>Already the Minister for Social Welfare is sitting on the EC equality directive in regard to social welfare.  According to figures produced by the Department that will cost the Exchequer a further £17.5 <Col N="2345" /> million.  Of course, the reason the Minister is sitting on the directive is a shortage of funds, and legislation along the lines of the directive would worsen an already bad situation.  I am sure Deputy Barnes will be very interested in this.  The sooner the Minister comes to the House with his plan in regard to this document the better.  He will be only facing up to the promises he gave to many associations.</P>
    <P>We face a real crisis later this year in regard to social welfare.  One can only shudder at the thought and the consequences of unemployment continuing at its present level.  There is no evidence to suggest that this will not be the case. Economic circumstances here will lead to many more enforced redundancies and older workers unable to compete with the increasing skills of younger workers will suffer disproportionately.  Many employers have encouraged early retirement through various incentives in order to reduce the size of the work force.  Such voluntary redundancies have increased the number of the younger elderly workers who have retired &mdash; I mean those in their forties and fifties.</P>
    <P>Though there has been a noticeable decline in the proportion of elderly workers in the work force here, our rate still remains far higher than in the EC as a whole.  In an interesting survey on the incomes of the elderly in Ireland recently it was noted that in 1980 29.6 per cent of men and 5.1 per cent of women aged 65 and older were still in the labour force here.  In other EC countries the percentages were as low as 8.6 and 2.8 respectively. The vast bulk of the elderly employed here are in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries with a few other areas.</P>
    <P>One of the sad features of our unemployment figures is the huge percentage of persons aged 40 years who have been made redundant through no fault of their own.  In the present economic climate we must admit that their chances of finding alternative employment are very slim. That points to the huge numbers of younger people &mdash; I refer to people in their thirties, forties and early fifties &mdash; who have become disemployed.  None of these has much hope of ever being <Col N="2346" /> employed.  They will become a burden on the State through no fault of their own. All Deputies have people coming to their clinics, comparatively young men, who have lost their jobs.  Nowadays one is too old to obtain alternative employment at 40 years.  There is very little hope nowadays for a man with a young family and a mortgage.  Living standards of social welfare recipients are very low.  In many cases they are well below the poverty line because they have had to bear the sacrifices imposed by the Government in the past three years.  Increased prices, for example, and many other aspects of everyday life cost everybody more money.  While those in employment may grumble and complain, at least they have jobs although their financial circumstances are becoming increasingly difficult. But those difficulties also affect the unemployed man or woman far more seriously and detrimentally.</P>
    <P>A national plan must be prepared including a definite commitment to continue to increase living standards, particularly for our pensioners, those who are ill and unable to work and the handicapped. That plan must provide for the extension of social insurance to the self-employed. This would ensure that self-employed persons would contribute fairly to the financing of the social welfare system.  In our economy we must be determined to eliminate poverty where it exists and also to ensure that we do not penalise our old age pensioners and those in retirement who have contributed handsomely to the State's finances and to the economy over the years during their working lifetime.  An old age or retirement pension, particularly that of a person who has contributed during a working lifetime, should be tax free and should not be part of any assessment if the recipient has another income by way of a small pension from a private fund or from a previous employer.</P>
    <P>The increase granted this year by the Minister to social welfare recipients is derisory and all the more pathetic in the light of the fact that it will not come into effect until July next.  In the meantime our old age pensioners, widows, unemployed, <Col N="2347" /> disabled and all the weaker sections of our community are penalised even further following the various increases imposed in the budget on VAT, fuel prices, lighting, gas, clothing, footwear, rents and accommodation.  To meet these increases many of these people will have to eat less and will sink even deeper into poverty.  Already literally thousands of families and people living alone would consider it a treat to have even one small piece of meat once a week.  To be able to put meat on the table once a week is a luxury to many people today.  That is a dreadful indictment of society in 1985.  These people are living on tea, bread and butter as their staple diet.  It is a tragedy that the Ireland of 1985, following the tremendous growth and real prosperity of the sixties and seventies, has reached the stage where a large percentage of our population struggle to exist from day to day.</P>
    <P>The policies pursued by this Government must be seen for what they are.  Not since the fifties has this country endured so much poverty as we have today.  There is a feeling of hopelessness.  It is shocking that any Minister, particularly a Labour Minister, should continue to pursue such policies that have caused such misery and hardship to all our people on a scale not experienced here since the war.  It is time for the Minister to be at least honest with himself and the country and to admit that he and his Government have been an utter failure.</P>
    <P>This Bill before us only reflects the miserable pittance of increases granted in this year's budget.  It is a shame and a tragedy that the weaker sections of our community should be treated so shabbily. It is time that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and his partisan Government decided that now is the time to go before the people.  Instead they are bringing in this type of Social Welfare Bill to the detriment of the situation of the less well off.</P>
    <P>We will have other opportunities of discussing the Social Welfare Bill in this House.  We are finishing Second Stage today.  Many Deputies are anxious to get <Col N="2348" /> in on this debate, but unfortunately many of them will be unsuccessful because of the time limit.  I had intended to make a few brief comments.  I believe that every Deputy, irrespective of what side of the House he or she may sit on, should ask himself or herself if we are doing enough for the poor and the less well off.  We on this side know that we are not.  It is time for the Government to be honest and admit to that and make some effort to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have problems, one of them as a result of the dramatic increase in our population.  The Minister when introducing Second Stage told the House that about 41 per cent of our total population are in the dependent age groups, that is, either under 15 years or over 65 years, and that about 35 per cent are dependent on social welfare payments of various kinds.  The problem that confronts us is almost unique in that it is not to be challenged in quite the same way as in other member states of the EC and other western democracies.  Therefore, we have all the more reason to be creative and imaginative in our handling of the money we are expending on social welfare, the amount of which is considerable. Ten years ago 10 per cent of GNP was devoted to social welfare, but in 1985 that figure will approach 15 per cent. How we handle that money and how we as legislators and taxpayers perceive, not alone its allocations in the fairest way but the recipients of social welfare, is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two principal areas we must look at.  I welcome the fact that the Minister increased social welfare payments across the board. We are extremely conscious that, although these payments are ahead of the expected inflation rate, they are not what we want.  We are conscious that a great number of people living on social welfare payments are living barely above the poverty line.  Those of us who strive for a just society must constantly seek to increase those payments so that people will not be caught up in a relentless, joyless cycle of knowing that they can only <Col N="2349" /> survive without ever having the luxuries or perks which people, particularly in higher income brackets, enjoy.  This must be the thrust of our social welfare policy.</P>
    <P>We must look at how our social welfare payments came about in the first place. They were introduced at a time when it was recognised that there was a male head of the household and that everyone else, women and children, within the family unit were dependants.  As certain sections of the community became more vulnerable or vocal and were able to ask for special consideration &mdash; I am thinking of deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers &mdash; they were tacked on in a patchwork fashion without the central foundation ever being examined. When we, as legislators, talk about social welfare we must realise that when the system was set up we lived in a different society with different values and a far greater sense of accepting injustice.  One of the things that makes me optimistic today is that we know that everything is not perfect and we know of the deprivation and suffering of people in society. We are conscious that we should be doing something about it.</P>
    <P>In the forties, fifties and sixties it was considered that the poor would be always with us and that God would help them. We did not seem to have any social policy or social responsibility of distributing wealth.  We did not ensure that they lived on anything other than a pittance.  Unfortunately, that feeling still prevails in some sections of the community, but it is fast disappearing as more and more middle income groups depend on social welfare payments as a result of redundancy. There was an innate feeling that to be poor was one's own fault and that if they had only made the same attempt at improving themselves as everyone else did they would not be dependent on the State.  A great sense of guilt was passed on to those who were recipients of social welfare.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister addressed himself to the selfishness and lack of justice of those who would defraud a system that desperately needs all the assets it has to give to the more deprived. <Col N="2350" /> In saying that I am conscious that we should not in any way add to the guilt or the feeling of humiliation felt by those who are entitled to receive social welfare payments.  We are only addressing ourselves to those who set out consciously to defraud.</P>
    <P>Sometimes when we talk about spongers and social welfare recipients we tend to focus only on people who defraud the system.  We do not focus on, to quote the Minister, the fact that:</P>
    <P>Abuse also occurs where employers fail to pay or delay in paying insurance contributions in respect of their employees.  The practice of some employers of avoiding or holding off remittances of PRSI for as long as possible is simply not acceptable &mdash; arrears outstanding at 31 May 1984 amounted to some £58 million which represented only actual underpayments established and does not include demands made on the basis of amounts estimated to be due. </P>
    <P>We must keep in mind the fact that the figure of £58 million is not the full figure and that there is responsibility on that section of society to ensure that they do not seek to defraud a system which, in the last analysis, harms our most vulnerable and poorest section.  In that context I hope to welcome into the House shortly the Companies Bill, which will deal with fly by night companies and firms which would do a disservice to their employees in that way.</P>
    <P>It is not realised that until relatively recently we did not analyse poverty or the lines of poverty above or below which people were living.  Deputy Brady said he was talking about poverty now as compared with poverty after the war in the fifties.  We ensure that people have a support system now which they did not have then, particularly groups like widows, unmarried mothers, prisoners and deserted wives.  They could sink or swim, but did not get any payment from the State.</P>
    <P>We are going through serious times with high unemployment.  Hopefully that is bottoming out and we are beginning to <Col N="2351" /> recover.  According to the latest OECD listing we are the twenty-second richest country.  If we cannot look after our poor and unemployed what level of poverty are other countries surviving?  We cannot skate forever around the fact that we are a poverty stricken country.  It is a matter of political will and it is demanded of us that we distribute our wealth more fairly than we do at present.</P>
    <P>In other countries they are looking at ways of removing the kind of dependency which is built into the social welfare system.  We should be examining the concept of a basic family income for every family regardless of whether they are employed in gainful employment, which is leaving out all the unpaid, underpaid, and voluntary work done in this and in every other country.  We should cut out all the bureaucracy &mdash; our patchwork system is an incredibly wasteful and ineffectual way of using money &mdash; and create a basic family income through a central computer system.  There is a research group in Britain examining this.  They are called the Basic Family Income Group and hope to report soon.  Young Fine Gael have put this forward in their latest document as the only fair and just way to remove the unfairness and concept of dependency from social welfare.</P>
    <P>We must be open to ideas.  All our structures have changed and we have a more just concept of people's rights and entitlements.  There are no longer handouts. We are moving towards the year 2000, with technology overwhelming us every day.  We know from today's technical experts that our work structures will be such that we will be working far shorter hours.  We will have to have some concept of job sharing.  We will be working more from the home.  People will be working through computers from their own homes into central computers. People may be retiring earlier.  The old constraints and rigidities of the social welfare system, which never answered our problems fully, will be totally outdated. This is one of the big challenges facing us.  With full imagination and full openness we should take on a complete <Col N="2352" /> restructuring of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I come now to one to one of my pet claims on behalf of the parent in the home, but particularly the mother.  Quite sincerely and with great honesty people ask why should higher income families be paid children's allowances in exactly the same way as lower income families or families with almost no income.  That is a perception of people who did not have the experience of being parents in the home, rearing children and being totally unacknowledged and undervalued for doing what is glibly called the most important job in the world.  I have been part of that experience.</P>
    <P>Because this world, rightly or wrongly, is based on an economic value being placed on people and their work, and their status being measured on that economic value, women in the home, and particularly mothers rearing children while innately realising how important their work is, feel very disillusioned and very cynical about the fact that it is not recognised by anybody else.  We cannot know the internal problems or relationships between a husband and wife in the home.  From talking to people I know the parent in the home must depend totally on the goodwill and generosity and the sharing of the income of the breadwinner. Having regard to the frailty of relationships, no wife is guaranteed a rightful share of the family income to run the house.  Of course we must consider that higher income groups should not be paid at the same level out of the small kitty we have.  We must not underestimate or undervalue even the small payment we make to the parent in the home because that is the only economic value put on that work.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the child benefit scheme which is to be introduced next year.  All the patchwork bits of family income supplement and assistance will be centralised and paid directly for each child to the parent in the home.  There will be a clawback from the higher income groups who are paying high tax.  That is the fair and rightful way to do it.  It will go part of the way to give some economic acknowledgement to the parent in the <Col N="2353" /> home and give them a psychological sense of independence.  It will be a much increased sum from next year onwards.</P>
    <P>I regret that we have not got a Social Welfare Bill which concentrates on ensuring equal treatment in social security for women.  I look forward to such a Bill being introduced at a very early stage.  In 1978 it was signalled to all of us by the EC that we should prepare to remove discrimination against women in social security.  No side of the House is blameless in this matter.  We created a social welfare code discriminatory against women.  This year over £17 million would be needed to give them equality in social security.  It will cost us that much to begin to provide equality.  How many millions do we owe the women who paid their contributions over the years and did not get their full share in benefit? Because of the interdependence we wrote into our social welfare code, if we introduced it immediately, social welfare families living on allowances could find themselves living on less than they have now.  I look forward to the Minister telling us soon that he has been able to cope with that problem.  Equality of treatment has been due to women by law since 22 December last and I hope it will be implemented quickly.</P>
    <P>I recognise the stringencies and constraints which did not permit full dental and ophthalmic treatment to be extended to all women in the home.  I welcome its introduction for pregnant women but I expect that is for this year only.  I and others in this House will continue to fight right down the line for its extension to the wives of all insured workers who have given up their own economic independence and social welfare entitlements in order to do work in the home for which they are given so little economic recompense in other areas.  I have already put down a marker for the Minister for Finance in his 1986 Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barnes for having curtailed her contribution to allow other Members an opportunity of contributing.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the social welfare increases announced by the Minister in his recent budget.  For the third consecutive budget we have seen the real income of those dependent on State support under the various social welfare headings decline in real terms.  By a succession of repressive social welfare decisions the Minister has succeeded in widening the gap between the rich and the poor, with now a greater percentage of our population than ever before below the poverty line.  Indeed, I was pleased to hear Deputy Barnes, in her thoughtful contribution, acknowledge that fact.  The Minister must be aware of this and, if he is not, then he should open his eyes and ears to the views of organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Simon Community and of those people who operate the various social councils under the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 6 per cent increase announced in the budget does not come into effect until July next.  In effect this constitutes a 3 per cent increase over the whole year 1985 when one takes into account an approximate inflation rate of 9 per cent. This, in turn, means that social welfare recipients are being asked to accept a reduction in their social welfare benefits. The social conscience of a Government is judged by how they treat the old, the unemployed and those who, through illness <Col N="2355" /> and injury, are unable to cater for their needs.  It is a shame that the Minister for Finance has been so successful in extending his monetarist views into such a sensitive and deserving area of our economy.</P>
    <P>Apart from the concern expressed by many Members of this House at the Social Welfare increases announced in the budget, the House must be even more concerned at their administration, the lengthy delays in dealing with claims, the disgraceful delays occasioned in the processing of appeals, the almost automatic ritual with which so many unemployment assistance claims are refused, all of which amounts to a complete breakdown in the Department's operations.  I do not blame individual officers who operate the scheme on the ground, who must work under extremely difficult conditions and under difficult regulations imposed by the Department.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why so many unemployed assistance claims are at present being refused, the reason always advanced being that a person is not available for work.  There must be no public representative who does not daily receive complaints about decisions made by the Department based on that one disqualification &mdash;&ldquo;We regret to inform you that your application has been refused as you are unavailable for work.&rdquo;  How in the name of God does one prove that one is available for work?  I have heard of people who have gone to prospective employers, who have furnished letters in an endeavour to convince the Department that they are available for work. Yet they get that almost automatic reply, that because one is not available for work one's claim is disallowed.  This is not good enough and many such people find these decisions most frustrating.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister if he has issued instructions to his Department to go slow in the processing of claims in the hopeful expectation that by ignoring an application long enough an applicant will grow weary and give up?  I know of cases where that has happened, when unfortunate applicants reconciled themselves <Col N="2356" /> to a standard of living that place them on the poverty line or forced them to emigrate.  How can the Minister in conscience stand over delays in dealing with unemployment assistance appeals, particularly those in the non-contributory class &mdash; widows' pensions, old age pensions or unemployment assistance claims?  Indeed delays of 12 weeks are frequent.  It is even more disgraceful that many applicants cannot discuss appeals with an appeals officer.  When an unsuccessful unemployment assistance application is referred to the appeals section of the Department I, as a Deputy, find it very frustrating that I am not in a position to discuss such cases, or not in a position to refute some of the reasons put forward in respect of the refusal.  I know of cases of husbands who prior to their deaths were in receipt of the maximum non-contributory old age pension.  Following their deaths their widows applied to the Department for a pension, but this was refused.  How can there be any sense of fair play in that regard?  These cases are well documented and I can give the Minister ample evidence of them at any time.  It is a most unfair system which discriminates against widows.</P>
    <P>I know of many cases of small landowners assessed for income they do not have, again resulting in refusal of unemployment assistance claims.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at what his Department are doing to these small landowners.  From experience I know that, while it is easy to tot up their income, it is not always as easy for an applicant to have maintained a full account of his or her expenses or to prove them when the case is being assessed. Indeed in some cases social welfare officers are not qualified to interpret what is real farm income.  Will the Minister say why his Department will not accept as evidence the credible authentic statements of ACOT officers?  I have seen cases of unemployment assistance claims being refused, even though applicants have gone to their agricultural advisers who have put forward credible submissions to the Department.  Yet, at the end of the day the appeals officer's decision <Col N="2357" /> overrides such authentic statements submitted by ACOT officers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain also why parents' income is taken into account in assessing unemployment assistance claims of young people, why in very few cases applicants from young, single girls are accepted.  Indeed, the level of payment offered to young boys is a disgrace.  This places an impossible imposition on parents of such unemployed young people.  There have been many cases of young boys and girls moving away from their homes because their parents' income has been taken into account in assessing their means.  The fact that that happens undermines the family as a unit of society.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I want to talk about abuses in the structure of the social welfare system.  Why does the Minister not take the bull by the horns and decentralise his Department?  It would be cheaper and more efficient if the entire operation were localised.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us, when replying, if he has any such plans in mind. In my county an applicant goes first to his local employment exchange, from there to the central office in Portlaoise, his application is then tranferred from there to a regional office, then back to the Department and lastly to the local office again.  That is a totally unsatisfactory and inefficient way of dealing with such claims.  I have no doubt that it is costing the taxpayer millions of pounds which need not be spent if the system was streamlined and reorganised.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister sit in the same Cabinet as the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, because several hundreds of workers are being made redundant at present in organisations for which those Departments are responsible?  Yet the Department of Social Welfare seem to have an endless supply available to pay a rapidly growing, unemployed population.  Why is it not possible, through the inter-management of Government Departments, to transfer resources from the Department of Social Welfare to the Departments of the Environment and Fisheries <Col N="2358" /> and Forestry where much needed jobs could be created?  Our road network is collapsing because there is no money to repair it.  I cannot understand why the Government cannot co-ordinate the efforts of various Government Departments and use for the purpose of job creation the money available to the Department of Social Welfare.  Surely that is what Government and economic management are all about?  The country would benefit from that kind of reorganisation which could be implemented with a little effort and co-ordination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare area is a maze of myriad legislative byways which all end up on the desk of the Minister for Finance and are paid for by the public purse.  Any Minister attempting to grapple with the complexities of these problems has an enormous administrative and social task.  When you have a smaller number of employees, a greater number drawing social welfare and a smaller number paying PRSI there is a greater follow-through from the Revenue Commissioners in terms of taxation, claims and charges.  This leads to a very inefficient system which does not lend itself to support of Government.  The Government are caught in a vicious circle and, from their point of view, social welfare is a crucifixion.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with all these schemes is that, if you attempt to tamper with them in order to give greater benefits to those in genuine need, you end up discriminating against everybody concerned, because you probably radically alter many of the schemes.</P>
      <P>In many cases social welfare is an incentive to do less work.  Pensioners often have difficulty, because of personal or legal reasons, in transferring their holdings of land to members of their family.  Some who are able to work find that the implementation of a means test ensures that they often get less than they would if they got rid of stock and so on which would entitle them to a pension. However, in many cases, they would prefer to continue working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to disability benefit claims, <Col N="2359" /> doctors' certificates are submitted to the effect that people are unable to work. Subsequently, these claims are often refuted by officials and medical referees of the Department.  Is this not an indictment of the medical profession?  PRSI and the Redundancy Act are a disincentive to the creation of employment.  The management ethos is to shed labour and to take on more machinery, which cannot answer back or go on strike.</P>
    <P>The absenteeism rate in many plants has a rural connection.  Many people who have land wish to work it during the summer period, thus accounting for absenteeism.  In that context the concept of work-sharing should be looked at.  If people are forced to work on a full time basis they often decide to give up work in a factory or whatever and work on the land when the season necessitates it.  A specific analysis of the type of absenteeism related to that area would bear fruit.</P>
    <P>A pilot scheme should be introduced by the Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, the social employment scheme and ACOT, in regard to unemployment assistance. There is hardly a farm in the country which is realising its agricultural potential. There are gateposts to be hung, walls to be built, land to be drained, reploughed and seeded.  The average parish has about 100 men on unemployment assistance.  They should be divided up into small groups, paid more than they are getting at present in social welfare assistance and used in a pilot scheme. This would yield increased agricultural productivity immediately and would be of benefit to them, their neighbours and the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to check the costings of the administration of the new scheme introduced after the Supreme Court decision which deemed PLV unconstitutional.  Fianna Fáil made great play of the fact that this Government introduced it, but that is not true.  However, due to the unrest and social upheaval caused and the abuse everybody gets in relation to this, I should like the Minister to carry out an analysis of <Col N="2360" /> the administrative cost increase of implementing it.</P>
    <P>It might be feasible to have this system changed.  The only farmer who will be forced to keep books after the land tax is introduced will be the crofter on ten or 20 acres.  The person with over 20 adjusted acres will not have to keep books but will pay a predetermined amount based on the rate per adjusted acre.  The farmer with over 80 adjusted acres will be paying income tax and will have to hire an accountant to do his books.  The worst off individual on less than 20 adjusted acres, who has no method of bookkeeping, will be forced to keep individual receipts on a regular basis.  I understand that the Department will appoint officers who will determine appeals and ensure that the claimants are given detailed, itemised accounts of how their incomes are assessed.  I welcome this move and I urge the Minister to see that this is done immediately. Those at the lower end of the scale are entitled to that and should be given it forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the operation of the unemployment assistance scheme which has now virtually broken down. There are long delays in considering and deciding applications for unemployment assistance.  Many cases take 14 weeks to decide and it is only when political pressure is brought to bear that decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>The Department should employ more social welfare officers and appeals officers.  The deciding and appeal process should be decentralised.  I should like to see a deciding officer in every town in the country who would decide on applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to see at least one if not two appeals officers in each county. The decision could be based on the number of applications being received and on the number of appeals in any area. It is most unfair that an applicant should have to wait for two, three or even up to six months before his appeal is decided. I have known of cases where appeals were decided favourably after delays of <Col N="2361" /> four months.  It is very difficult for applicants to seek supplementary welfare allowances while their applications are under consideration.  The Minister should pay particular attention to the unemployment assistance section of his Department with a view to employing more officers and also decentralising the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have expressed great concern about delays in processing social welfare claims and about delays also in the medical referee and appeals system.  The two Members from the benches opposite who have just spoken have underlined this aspect also. Some Deputies asked whether the embargo whereby only two in every three vacancies in the Civil Service are filled applies to the Department of Social Welfare and whether the staff of the Department had been reduced to a level at which they simply could not cope.  I make the point to the House &mdash; and I make it to my colleagues in Government and to all other Government Departments, notably the Department of the Public Service &mdash; that the Department of Social Welfare have never been exempt from that embargo which applies across the board to all Government Departments. Consequently, one in every three vacancies arising in the Department must remain vacant.</P>
      <P>I have strong reservations about that crude and blunt instrument known as the embargo and I trust that it will be the subject of intense review.  However, the Government have redeployed some staff from other Departments to the Department of Social Welfare. This has been done with considerable difficulty.  One can understand readily the reluctance of the head of any Department to surrender staff for any purpose.  This arrangement has been made in our case to help the Department deal with the increasing workload, and now the overall number of staff in the Department is 4 per cent higher than the June 1981 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may seem reasonable but let us consider what has happened in the meantime. <Col N="2362" /> The workload in the Department has increased enormously. In the unemployment payments area alone, there has been an increase of almost 70 per cent in the volume of claims since mid-1981. There has been an increase of 17 per cent in respect of claims for survivors and for related pensions while there has been an increase of 21 per cent in claims for the various free schemes.  There has been a 43 per cent increase in treatment benefit claims and an increase of more than 10 per cent in the general level of sickness benefit claims.  There have been increases in other areas also.</P>
    <P>This phenomenal increase in social welfare claims has arisen for a variety of reasons.  During the period 1981 to 1985 also a number of schemes have been introduced &mdash; for instance, the rent allowance scheme and the family income supplement scheme &mdash; while the work of the old age pension committees was transferred direct to the Department.  As a former trade union officer I have had a lot of contact with public service workers and I can say without fear of contradiction that the management of the Department of Social Welfare have endeavoured heroically to use every means at their disposal to cope with the unprecedented increase in the workload. The large computer development programme has yielded very considerable productivity gains.  Staff within the Department have been redeployed to cope with the most hard pressed areas, notably at counters in the employment exchanges.  That is where there are tremendous problems and pressures.  Working methods have been reviewed and changed in order to increase the throughput of claims.  But within our limited resources it has not been possible to prevent a deterioration in the quality of service and that is showing up by way of longer average times elapsing before claims are processed and in answering queries and representations.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have made available a proliferation of electric typewriters to Deputies in this House, to Senators and to ministerial offices.  There are now several hundred people who do <Col N="2363" /> nothing else but write to the Department of Social Welfare on behalf of public representatives. As a result, I receive no fewer than 34,000 representations each year in respect of claims.</P>

This means that about 4,000 parliamentary questions are addressed to me each year.  Again, this chokes the system with principal officers and assistant secretaries, and in the case of policy questions, the assistant secretary to the secretary all engaged in a frenzy of activity.</P>

      <P>We must examine the workload.  Last year the number of appeals totalled 22,000.  Some of our appeals officers suffered serious illnesses during 1984 but we took steps during the past year to deploy staff to the appeals area.  Now where it is possible for an appeals officer to decide a case summarily there is a delay of the best part of a month.  This worsens as other cases arise. In the Dublin area the delays are of about two months duration while outside this area delays are nearly twice as long. While there is great pressure on the system there is nothing like the chaos that existed in the old days when the disability benefit system and the computer system broke down.  At least we know what is wrong, that is, that we do not have sufficient staff to deal with the enormous volume of work.</P>

That applies whether it be appeals in the west of Ireland in respect of smallholders or persons in urban areas. <Col N="2365" /> The Deputies may be assured I welcome their observations on this issue I hope it will strengthen my hand in getting to grips with the issues that surround the matter.</P>
      <P>In that context I wish to pay tribute to the work of the social welfare officers in my Department.  I was very surprised that in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on 12 March Deputy Joe Walsh described some of the pension officers as &ldquo;being damn near as bad as criminals&rdquo;.  I have the greatest of respect for the Deputy: he is one of the finer Deputies here and his contributions, particularly on economic issues, are outstanding. However, he should not use that kind of pejorative observation about officers in the Department of Social Welfare because they have a particularly difficult task.  Their job is neither easy nor popular and there is also the propensity of Irish people to hide their means in one way or another when they are being investigated.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the officers in the Department of Social Welfare have the highest standards possible.  We must be very careful in what we say.  A number of such comments have been made by Deputies on both sides of the House and also by Senators.  The officers in question have a very difficult job to do.  If any Deputy wants to know what it is like I invite him to come with me to any employment exchange any morning and sit behind the counter for a few hours, or to sit in on any of the appeals and then he will know the reality of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy spoke about old people, particularly on the western seaboard, who hoard their savings because they fear their pensions might be affected adversely.  I should like to point out to all Deputies that, in conjunction with An Post, my Department issued a special-leaflet last January to all pensioners for the purpose of reassuring them about their savings and their social welfare pensions. The leaflet pointed out that contributory pensioners, of whom there are more than 200,000 in payment, are not affected in any way by any savings they may have.  I am also a voluntary contributor and I will be 50 years next May.  In 15 years time, provided the system has not <Col N="2366" /> collapsed, I hope to have a contributory pension.  I am quite sure I will have no resources then as I have no resources now, other than a bank overdraft.</P>

      <P>There are 140,000 such pensioners who are in payment at the moment.  They are means-tested and their savings are taken into account in calculating the amount of pension.  However, a pensioner can have a large amount of savings and still qualify for a pension. A person can get a full old age pension if he has no other means and still have savings of up to £2,987.  If he is married, with his wife he can have savings in the bank of £5,975 and still qualify for a pension. This is the most generous scheme in western Europe.</P>

      <P>A person may qualify for a minimum pension and still have savings amounting to £22,700 in the bank. If he is married he can have savings of £45,495.  These amounts will be increased next July arising from the increased rates provided for in the Bill and I am arranging for the issue of further updated literature through An Post.  I emphasise to the elderly that they can have substantial cash savings and still qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.  If I may support my colleague, the Minister for Finance, they should keep the money in the Post Office or in a trustee savings bank where they will get substantial interest. This would prevent the thuggery that is going on in rural areas where tragically a number of pensioners have been attacked.</P>

      <Col N="2367" /> Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the assessment of redundancy payments in calculating means for unemployment assistance.  Under the law any capital a person may have at the time of assessment for unemployment assistance is taken into account as means.  A lump sum payment is treated in the same way as any other form of capital.  The method of assessing capital for unemployment assistance is to take one-twentieth of the first £400 of the yearly value of the capital together with one-tenth of any amount in excess of £400.  The result is divided by 52 and weekly means are arrived at.  This method of assessing income from capital is much more favourable to the applicant than it would be if the income were linked to the actual interest rates payable by banks or other financial institutions.  For example, a person who puts the maximum statutory redundancy payment of £8,500 on deposit could expect to receive a return of about 15 per cent or £1,275 a year.  This compares with £830 assessed under the formula for unemployment assistance.  In Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom redundancy lump sum payments are taken into account in assessing unemployment assistance or supplementary benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is most concerned for his constituents.  The treatment of redundancy payments under the unemployment assistance scheme is being reviewed by the Department, but any suggestion of completely ignoring redundancy lump sums would be contrary to the general principle of means testing. I will be going to the Government about the matter in the near future and I will present a general report.  Personally I have strong views about lump sum payments: <Col N="2368" /> I believe in the continuity of weekly redundancy payments which is far better for people.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCarthy spoke about the £2 million savings in respect of non-contributory old age pensions. There was an overall reduction in the published Estimates of £7.638 million.  This reduction arose solely from estimating revisions based on the latest data available to my Department in respect of the number of pensioners and the trends in the number who will apply during the year.  It is very difficult to assess these matters.  On the basis of a revision of the anticipated number of claims in 1985 there was a saving of £2 million.</P>

This year whether the figure increases or decreases by 1,000 one has to make an estimate and these estimates are made early the preceding year.</P>

      <P>Finally, I want to deal with employers' arrears of PRSI contributions. As I said, £58 million PRSI is owed.  It is a gross misuse of the social welfare system that that money is not remitted in full to the Revenue Commissioners because employers are obliged by law to pay these contributions on a regular basis.  I want to stress that I have every intention of ensuring that all arrears are paid regularly because this money is collected from workers.  It is not the property of employers and it must be paid to enable us to fund the system.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate but I regret I only got 20 minutes to reply, but that was a matter for the Whips.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to this motion.  When I asked our spokesman, Deputy Leyden, for permission to speak on this motion I did so because I felt grave injustice was being done.  The decision of the Taoiseach and the team that surrounds him to directly interfere in the internal business of RTE poses a distinct threat to democracy.  Lest anyone think that that statement is going over the top I would confirm that it is the impression given to me from speaking to many people over the weekend when the affair had been aired for the first time and when people had time to reflect on the implications of the Government interference.  As we go about our lives we daily see events being manipulated and manoeuvred to present a different picture from the actuality.  It is mind boggling when one thinks about it.  We are told that a situation is at a certain stage when the opposite is actually happening. We are led to believe that the true situation is not what is happening.  Last week, on Thursday, 7 March we had a speech in the House from the Taoiseach from which I will quote directly:</P>
      <P>No Government of which I am a Leader will take any step that will weaken the independence of RTE. </P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>That means that any member we will appoint to the authority as a replacement to an existing member will be, and be seen to be, independent. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2373" /> How can the Taoiseach or anybody in public life stand over that statement &mdash; that anybody they will appoint will be and will be seen to be independent &mdash; when the person they appointed when the first vacancy came up is universally seen by writers and newspapers commentators as the chief electoral strategist of Fine Gael?</P>
    <P>Here we expect truth to be told.  We expect to be able to check and counter check the veracity of statements made here.  Somehow, because he said it, the Taoiseach believed that we would swallow it.  It is unbelievable.  The head of the Fine Gael strategy committee has been appointed to the RTE board.  In the light of that, how in future can we or anybody believe anything the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers say after a flagrant untruth &mdash; I do not use the other word because I am not allowed to say it &mdash; has been enunciated here by the country's leader? When the Minister of State replies I will be interested in his explanation of the Taoiseach's words.  I want him to explain to me so that I can go back to the many young people who have come to me.  I am particularly thinking of a young people's seminar I attended over the weekend and of a young woman standing up in the audience and quoting that speech by the Taoiseach.  She asked me to demand an explanation of how the leader of the country, of one of the main political parties, could come out with a statement like that.  George Orwells's book, 1984, is coming to fruition with chilling accuracy. I will quote from a paperback edition of that book:</P>
    <P>In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it.  The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. </P>
    <P>When George Orwell wrote that he was talking about another party, but it is particulary apt in these circumstances.  We are being told daily that two and two make five.  On the day before the announcement was to be made we had a statement by the Taoiseach that he would <Col N="2374" /> not interfere.  I will quote again George Orwell:</P>
    <P>Every quarter, every three months, an astronomical number of boots were produced on paper whilst perhaps half the population went barefoot. </P>
    <P>I am talking in a literary sense because frankly I am afraid of what will happen if this kind of behaviour, if these standards &mdash; low standards in high places &mdash; are to be continued.  The Taoiseach said he is not interfering in or influencing the appointment of a Director-General of RTE.  The exact opposite is the truth.  The aim of the Government is to perpetuate their command of the country.  They use mirages, machinations, plots and subterfuges. These have become the daily diet of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The RTE Authority went about this appointment in a completely open way. Independent consultants, MSL, were employed to go out, to interview them. Having interviewed the applicants they were to come up with a decision.  They did that, exactly according to their brief and they came up with a person who in their view was the ideal candidate.  He was not the ideal candidate for the Government.  Again I say, the words of George Orwell are coming true and the words of the Taoiseach should not have been uttered or listened to in this House because of their untrue nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>So far in the debate we have got much fulmination, indignation and so forth and it would be tempting to go back to the files to cite examples against each other.  That does not get us very far.  I enjoyed the literary exercise of Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; I always enjoy her literary allusions &mdash; but I did not see the relevance.  I doubt if she could, either. I believe that at the end of the process RTE will not only be a more efficient organisation but much better geared to meet the needs of Irish broadcasting in the eighties and nineties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If for a moment I thought there was a ploy by the Minister to put the Government's man or woman into RTE as Director-General, very emphatically I <Col N="2375" /> say I would not be speaking here tonight in defence of what the Minister and the Government have done.  The integrity of the national broadcasting service must be beyond question.  I believe there is no question of an attack on that.  The behaviour of the Government has been open and above board.  They made their request and they gave their reasons openly and in public.  There were no behind the scenes pressures.  The Government made their case to the House and to RTE.  There has been no hidden agenda, no hidden motives.</P>
    <P>Any party in Government or Opposition who tried to impose or insinuate a favoured candidate into the position of Director-General of RTE would be not just wrong but suicidally foolish to attempt such a move.  It would be counterproductive and would damage the public credibility of RTE.  Quite rightly it would lead to resentment if not mutiny within RTE.  It would put the new Director-General into an impossible situation within the Authority.  It would visit disrepute on the heads of politicians, be they Government or Opposition, who would try to do such a thing.</P>
    <P>We all here know something about RTE and how they work.  We know their many faults and shortcomings.  RTE have also very substantial virtues, among them their very prickly sense of independence. Now many people who work in RTE may be prima donnas.  Many of them may be obsessed with themselves, embroiled in their internal politics.  RTE, like our political parliamentary parties, tend to leak their disputes into public print and most of us know what is happening there.  RTE internal politics can be manipulative and dirty.  It is sometimes said that academic politics are dirty because the stakes are so low, and that may be true of some of the rows in RTE.  We all know that RTE contain factions, but balance exists there also and any attempt by outside politicians to manipulate the public politics of RTE will be spotted very quickly by those who work within the station and will bring together the various factions to oppose such attempt.  Only a politician who <Col N="2376" /> wants to have his or her name day in and day out on the front pages of the newspapers in a most unpleasant way, who wants to invite all sorts of investigations into his or her motives, who has kamikaze urgings would embark on such a course.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that RTE are on the brink of greater changes than have happened in their entire existence so far.  The Minister has spelt them out and they are clear to anybody who has been following developments in broadcasting over the years.  Anybody who looks at what is happening can see very clearly how extensive and exciting are the challenges that face RTE at present and how great are the possibilities.  RTE must become a very different organisation if they are not to be just adequate in the face of these changes but to turn them to their and the nation's advantage.</P>
    <P>Politicians tend to be very critical of many aspects of RTE, the extent to which duplication appears to exist in the station, the extent to which some people are over-worked or underworked while others appear to have no real function.  RTE contain many titles, and I wonder what this or that person does when he or she comes in in the morning, what appears on that person's desk and so on.  We are all aware of areas of inefficiency in RTE. The growth and development of RTE in recent years has in many ways been haphazard and unstructured.  There are areas of top-heavy management and so forth.  Nobody in this House would deny that there is a very strong case at present for a detailed study of RTE's past performance, present problems and future possibilities.  RTE need to become not just more efficient.  Fundamental restructuring and reorganisation are imminent, probably overdue in some cases.  What could be more reasonable or sensible at a time like this, than that the issues be sorted out or clarified before the appointment of the new Director-General who will have the responsibility over five or ten years of seeing these changes through, before the job description is made clear, open and public, before the person is selected to take office?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2377" /> The opposite side of the House has shown a great deal of unction about the question of the Authority.  Ever since the founding of RTE 25 years ago we have been extremely fortunate in the calibre and integrity of those who have agreed to serve as members of the Authority. All of them have been characterised by integrity and commitment to public broadcasting.  The political views of some were well known, but once they became members of the Authority their political party allegiances were subsumed into the greater good of broadcasting and of RTE as a whole.  We have heard a great deal of talk tonight about people with political allegiance who are members of the RTE Authority.  We are on dangerous ground here and not because I can give one list of names and somebody else can give another.  We in political parties need all the expertise, advice and help we can get from different sections of our community. If these people are available they should not be debarred from serving on semi-State bodies which are a part of the public service simply because they are members of political parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more than members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy and I have only two minutes left. All political parties need these people.  I see nothing wrong in any party appointing people to a semi-State authority if those people are competent.  Two names have been flung around in this debate, Paul Kavanagh and Frank Flannery, both of whom are superbly qualified to serve on any semi-State body.  Any member of any party, The Workers' Party, the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, who is capable of giving public service should not be debarred from serving on a semi-State authority simply because of membership of a political party.  We could make it almost unrespectable for a person to be voluntarily associated with a political party.  I am far more concerned with the person whose views are not known.  We should have a little sense on that point.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2378" /> The Government have been totally and utterly above board in what they have done.  They have asked that they be judged on the basis of their known public actions.  The Government have promised that the next RTE Authority will be of the highest integrity and seen to be such. In doing so they are casting no reflection on the very fine people who are serving in the present Authority.  They have made public the reasons why they do not want the appointment made yet.  The calibre and integrity of the Authority will be such that the person chosen to guide RTE into its next quarter century will manifestly have the full confidence of this House and the country.  Nothing else will be acceptable, and the Government do not want or expect anything else.</P>

      <P>It is extremely unfortunate that a Private Members' motion regarding the appointment of a Director-General of RTE should be discussed in the House.  It can only rebound on the people who have come forward in good faith seeking this position.  I am concerned that the Labour Party have taken no active part in this discussion, especially because of the suggestion that the person chosen was a member of the Labour Party.  I suppose I am flattered to some extent and a little surprised that the Opposition party should take up the cudgels on behalf of a member of the Labour Party.  The accusation in this discussion of political interference must be clarified.  All the Opposition speakers so far have made reference to this interference. The attack on the Minister is unjustified.  The proposal is that the Minister for Communications may not make recommendations to the RTE Authority, a body of personnel over whom he has statutory powers.  These powers are enshrined in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  The relevant section states that from time to time the Authority shall appoint a person to be <Col N="2379" /> chief executive officer of the Authority and such a person shall be known as the Director-General.  Does this Act give the Minister the statutory power to appoint members of the Authority?  The Minister has the right to keep abreast of the business of the Authority and to make recommendations whenever he feels the need to do so.  That is quite legitimate.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that questions are continually asked by the Opposition spokesman on Communications as to whether things are right between Fine Gael and Labour regarding the local broadcasting Bill.  The fact is that discussions are ongoing but there are areas where we are putting our respective points of view across.  We will no doubt come to a decision in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable, at a time when we are likely to witness a great breakthrough in satellite and cable television, that this motion should divert attention from that kind of work.  Over the last few weeks the Minister has entered into legitimate communication with the present Director-General. He asked the Authority to defer the appointment of a new Director-General until he had an opportunity to make a major comprehensive statement on broadcasting.  Doubts have been cast about the reason why the Minister should investigate the affairs of RTE.  As everyone knows, RTE have suffered in recent times due to a shortage of finance.  It has been stated openly that RTE are inefficient and over-staffed.  However, the real problem stems from a shortage of money which compelled them to cut back in their programming.  As a result we have had more than our fair share of imported material.  This does not reflect the true character of the station.  I hope that as a result of this investigation RTE will be in a position to embark on more ambitious programmes which will reflect the Irish way of life and things of important cultural value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the rí-rá of recent days, the Minister and the Authority have come to an agreement regarding the appointment of an interim Director-General.  The honourable <Col N="2380" /> course for Fianna Fáil to adopt would have been not to table this motion, which no doubt is causing embarrassment to those who were short listed for this appointment.  It could damage the body politic.  Doubts have been cast about the motives of various political parties regarding the appointment of people to State agencies.  The long term damage it will do will be quite serious.  People will be reluctant to carry out the work requested of them not only in RTE but in other State boards lest they be charged with being political hacks and so on.  That would be most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The quotations given by Deputy O'Rourke were not relevant.  The year 1984 has come and gone and, thankfully, there are no people walking around barefoot despite what the statistics say.  Big Brother is not putting his hand on RTE in any undemocratic way.  The Minister has the right to intervene where he thinks necessary.  He has done no more than that on this occasion.  I do not know what it is hoped to achieve from this discussion.</P>
    <P>We heard contributions last night from Opposition Members which were quite disturbing.  One person indulged in what could be termed as character assassination. He named two people who are professionals in the field of broadcasting and cast doubts on their ability and on their person.  That is not desirable.  There is an element of sour grapes involved here. In the past when Fianna Fáil appointed people to these positions there was little or no opposition from the other parties. Since the establishment of RTE 25 years ago it was a Labour Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, who introduced amendments to the Act which safeguarded the rights of broadcasters.  There is a rather hollow ring to what we hear from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There was a meeting held last Friday at which agreement was reached.  Deputy Molloy stated that the actions of the Government at that meeting were ham fisted.  I do not agree.  I am heartened by Deputy Leyden's support for RTE in recent days because in other discussions he was not so forthcoming in this regard. He gave the impression that RTE, <Col N="2381" /> without a Director-General, was like a rudderless ship.  There is a management structure composed of intelligent and competent people who will ensure that the station will function until such time as a full time Director-General or an interim Director-General is appointed. To suggest that they are not capable of managing their own affairs is less than fair.  I support the amendment but regret that this debate is taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion.  For the last two weeks this matter has been the subject of major debate inside and outside the house.  Many questions must be answered.  The Minister and the Government knew that a Director-General would have to be appointed because the present Director-General gave notice of his resignation.</P>
      <P>In January last the chairman of RTE was told by the Minister for Communications that it was in order to advertise and when the applications were received to go ahead with the interviews.  These interviews were taking their normal course.  How did it come about that on 1 March there was a letter from the Minister for Communications saying that they were to proceed no further with the appointment.  I do not want to wrong anybody but the Minister for Communications is called Jim'll Fix It.  He is branded with that name again when he is seen to be scuttling this appointment.  I presume there was Government approval. I have no doubt there was.  Where does this leave the management people in RTE?  They are very competent people.  It appears to me and to the public that the proper people were not in the final shake up for the filling of the position. It smells badly.  It all depends on how you scuttle something.  The Government did not do a good job this time.  The handlers let them down.</P>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Government of which I am leader will take any step that will weaken the independence of RTE. That means that any members we will <Col N="2382" /> appoint to the Authority in replacement of existing members will be, and be seen to be, independent. </P>
    <P>An appointment was made and I do not want to wrong the man in any shape or form.  He is very well-known not only as a member of the Fine Gael Party but also as a professional media handler to the hilt.  He glosses over things and makes them look well.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, made a statement some weeks ago that all members appointed to State and semi-State bodies would have no political affiliations and would be seen to be impartial.  In other words, they would not be tainted.  That has not happened.  This smells very badly.  There was Government interference in top management in RTE.  That is the way the public read it.</P>
    <P>The Director-General of RTE was appointed by Fianna Fáil.  The Authority had been appointed by the Coalition.  A name was put forward for appointment as Director-General and, without hesitation, our Government agreed to make that appointment.</P>
    <P>Over the years RTE have been subjected to all kinds of reports and investigations. They were investigated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial semi-State Bodies and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  They were questioned very severely about the running of their affairs.  Now another commission are to be appointed to look into RTE.  This is a delaying tactic and it is intended to divert attention from the person who was to be the Director-General. Immediately after the present Director-General announced his resignation, if the Government had stated clearly that they were setting up a commission to investigate RTE, the people would have believed them.  They do not believe them now.  They believe this is skullduggery.  The Government decided they did not like the final three or four people involved and that they would scrub them.  That throws some doubt on the integrity and ability of the persons in the final interviews for that position.  I do not like saying that but that is the way it reads.  That is the way people accept it. <Col N="2383" /> RTE are to be left without a Director-General for some time.  If the appointment is made in the near future by the Minister or the RTE Authority, he will be known as a caretaker.  Caretakers are not very much respected.  They are there for a purpose.  I want to put it on the record that the independence of RTE has been undermined.  There are many questions to be answered.  The public like to know that RTE will give a balanced view when reporting the various issues at national and other levels.  We expect that from all the people employed in RTE.  Politicians may not like some of the reports but, by and large, over the years they have been doing a good job.  That has now been undermined.  A suspicion has been cast upon their integrity.  There is no way the Government can get out from under that. I regret that a shadow has been cast on the independence of RTE.  That is regrettable and must be very damaging in the long run.  Deputy O'Sullivan was rather vague on many matters.  He did not refer to the bungling between Fine Gael and Labour in regard to the local radio Bill, but that is another day's work. I regret very much that the independence of RTE has been badly shaken.  I hope their confidence can be restored but for some time it will be shaken and I regret to have to say that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Connolly said, many questions arise which have not been answered, certainly to my satisfaction. The fundamental reality is this: that for the first, and I hope the last, time in the history of this State the Minister for Communications has not accepted the appointment of a Director-General nominated by the Authority.  There are two factors which render that even more peculiar.  First, it is in direct contravention of the Minister's several statements over the past couple of months, the last being as late as one month ago.  The second peculiar factor about this is that the argument the Minister used to justify his position is so weak, transparent and cynical it tends to bring the Oireachtas <Col N="2384" /> into even further disrepute.  What the Minister is asking us to accept is an evil now for a good at some indeterminate time in the future.  We are asked to assume that the future good will outweigh the present evil.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated publicly on a number of occasions that his aim is to remove political intervention from RTE. In order to do that he asks us to accept a greater level of political interference in RTE at present.  That argument is so absurd that it only has to be stated to be refuted; in effect, it refutes itself.</P>
      <P>If the Minister felt that the appointment of a new Director-General for RTE should be preceded by a major review of broadcasting why then, as Deputy Connoly pointed out, did he not move last December when the job of Director-General was advertised?  That is one question the Minister has not answered inside or outside this House and I still await a proper answer.  I hope the Minister will make some less transparent attempt to answer that question when concluding.</P>
      <P>Certain Government spokesmen have advanced a number of other arguments to justify the Minister's position.  Those arguments are so far removed from the reality of the situation that either the people advocating them are in a total state of confusion or they wish to sow confusion in everybody else's minds.  If I may I shall briefly dispose of two of those arguments.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the fact that the RTE Authority has been politicised since its inception.  Of course there is a political dimension to the RTE Authority. Nobody on this side of the House has denied that.  The RTE Authority are appointed by the Government of the day which consists of politicians.  Therefore, in that sense alone there is a political dimension to it.  Perhaps the problem with which we are now dealing could be solved if we had a situation in which the RTE Authority went out of office along with the Government that appointed them.  But that is not the position obtaining and that is what makes the Government's position so indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2385" /> There has been reference also to the statement of the late Seán Lemass that RTE should be an instrument of public policy.  What one thinks of that statement is dependent on one's interpretation of it.  It would be curious, to say the least, if our national broadcasting service constantly refuted public policy, or was seen to be an organ which was there not to support or promulgate public policy but rather to undermine it.  That would be a very curious situation.  The difficulty arises when I ask myself: how can the Minister justify his position from a statement of a former Taoiseach that RTE should be an instrument of public policy? How can that statement lead one to the Minister's present position in which clearly he regards RTE as the personal property of the Government who happen to be in power?  The consequences of this whole situation will be grim and will have long term consequences both for democracy and our national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>I accept that people outside this House reading this debate and reading the statements and comments in the media over the past few weeks could imagine that the post of Director-General impinges constantly on the day to day operations of broadcasting when we know that is not the truth.  Paradoxically that renders the Minister's position even more indefensible. The entire affair carries an atmosphere of puppeteering, of manipulation, of deliberate Government intervention on the management side of RTE.  It has always been accepted that there must be a politcal dimension to the relationship between the RTE Authority and the Government of the day but that is now being extended.  Politics have been removed from the administration block of RTE into the working area, which is bound to have profound, long term political consequences.  The political interference, manipulation in the working area of RTE, has commenced with its top executive, but where will that lead and where will it end?  The isolation of the Minister's position can be seen quite clearly from the fact that not one responsible political commentator over the weekend <Col N="2386" /> sought to defend or do other than trenchantly criticise the Minister's present activities.  I have a number of quotations from weekend newspapers but time does not permit me to read them.</P>
    <P>The advancement of politics from the administration side into the working area of RTE has profound consequences for democracy, because a free media, a media perceived as being free, forms an integral part if not the cornerstone of democracy.  It will have another long term consequence, not referred to much in the course of this debate, that is that in order to create a quick smokescreen for his activities the Minister patched together a hasty, ill-conceived review of broadcasting.  Of course the sad reality is that a review of broadcasting is necessary but a much more fundamental, far-reaching review than that announced by the Minister.  In announcing that review the Minister referred to such things as satellite television, cable systems and broadcasting bands.  It is significant that none of those has been included in the terms of reference of the study the Minister has initiated.  If proof were needed, that proves once and for all that this whole charade operation is one of hypocrisy of the highest order.</P>
    <P>There are also some short-term consequences. I was going to mention consequences damaging to the Minister's reputation, but unfortunately I must conclude that this Minister has acquired the type of reputation which could not easily be further damaged.  It will have short and long term consequences for Mr. John Sorahan, who was appointed by the appointing sub-committee of the RTE Authority as Director-General of RTE. His career has been badly, if not irreparably damaged.  He has been tarnished with a political brush.  He has been convicted and sentenced without a semblance of a trial or without having been given any opportunity to speak on his own behalf. That is the treatment meted out to him by a Government and a Taoiseach who pride themselves on their pluralism and their tolerance of minorities, or so-called minorities, and the views of Unionists in <Col N="2387" /> another part of this country.  What about tolerance for Mr. John Sorahan, because, like charity, tolerance begins at home?</P>
    <P>I find this whole debate somewhat distasteful.  The problems confronting democracy at present are great.  One could plausibly argue that democracy in this country has never been so weak since the foundation of the State.  Have we not come to a sorry state when the Government are seen to be damaging democracy before our very eyes?  Have we not reached a sorry state when the Government charged with the protection of democracy are the very people undermining it, and seen to be undermining it, in this fundamental respect?</P>
    <P>I have come into this House for many Private Members' motions and other debates, when people on this side of the House appealed to the Labour Party.  The Labour Party have now demonstrated that they have been bought to such an extent that appeals to them have the quality of a ritual.  I do not intend to engage in rituals but I shall appeal directly to the Taoiseach to change his mind even at this late stage because the consequences of what the Minister is doing and the long term fall-out will be grim and grave.</P>

      <P>I regret that the time allowed is so short although it is the second debate we have had on the subject and we also had a prolonged Question Time dealing with the matter. <Col N="2388" /> I wish to reiterate that, in so far as there were any political considerations in the Government's decision, it was to reduce and not to increase interference in RTE.  The points made by Opposition speakers lack credibility, coherence and conviction.  If they feel so strongly about political interference in RTE, could they assure us that they would deprecate interference from the Opposition as well as from the Government if that happened? I do not wish to say anything more on that point.  The Government made their decision to reduce political interference and not to increase it.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy O'Dea referring to the consultants.  Regardless of whether a vacancy was about to arise for the post of Director-General, consultants were being considered in my Department because of the very substantial developments in broadcasting.  I accept that it is a pity that these two matters have become confused.  I see the consultancy as an arrangement to organise RTE so that they are best equipped to seize whatever opportunities arise in broadcasting.  It is not to do with RTE, as has been alleged by some people.  It is an attempt to reorganise RTE so that they are geared to maximise the opportunities and the challenges in relation to broadcasting in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Given the framework in which they operate, RTE do a good job, within the finances available to them, by an international comparison, although I know many people do not agree with that point of view.  However, if people had the experience of television and radio services outside these islands they would agree that RTE do a very good job.  We must reorganise RTE so that they can and will grow with the opportunities which will arise.</P>
      <P>The Opposition did not make any points of substance; they were just a repetition of the shibboleths of last week without substance.  Therefore, maybe it is as well that I do not have that much time to reply.</P>

      <P>Considering the assurance given, there was never any need for it in any event.  I want to dwell for a few minutes on the legal and constitutional implications of what we are discussing.  The first responsibility of a Government is to uphold the Constitution and the laws enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This Government, the Taoiseach in particular, are undermining the Constitution and the laws enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They compound the offence by asking Dáil Éireann to approve the consistent objective of the Minister for Communications and the Government to prevent political interference in RTE.  I do not want to argue on a personal level but the record of the Minister for Communications on political interference is widely known&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is guilty of blatant cynicism in asking Dáil Eireann to approve that record.  The executive power of the State is vested in the Government under Article 28 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.  In stipulating that, it says that the Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any way repugnant to the Constitution.  It is assumed in the Constitution that the Oireachtas or any House of the Oireachtas will not be asked by the Government to approve a breach of the law passed by the Oireachtas which is the case here in terms of the Broadcasting Act.  This is precisely what the Dáil is <Col N="2390" /> being asked to do this evening by the Taoiseach.  It is clear that he not only approved but, in fairness to the Minister, directed the breach of the law by the Minister for Communications.  In a statement to the Dáil on Thursday, 7 March 1985, the Taoiseach asserted, &ldquo;We shall expect the Authority&rdquo; a subjective interpretation by the Government &mdash;&ldquo;to make appointments in a manner that will satisfy the criteria laid down by the Government.&rdquo;  He completely ignored the statutory independence and obligation of the Authority to act according to their own criteria, not those determined by the Government of the day.  I contend that, by doing so, the Taoiseach has already undermined the statutory independence of the Authority and any succeding Authority.</P>
      <P>The Constitution specifically provides for the preservation of the rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, by the organs of public opinion such as the radio, although television of course did not exist in 1937 when the Constitution was drawn up.  It is to avoid the possibility of any such criticism which would be unacceptable to the Government that the Taoiseach directed this blatant infringement of the rights and obligations under statute of RTE when the law which we passed said that the Authority shall appoint a Director-General. It is for that reason that the Taoiseach has directed this blatant infringement of these rights which were established by law.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister's mercifully short reply and he has been put in an indefensible position by the Taoiseach.  Not even the most committed supporter of the Government accepts their cynical reasons for infringing the law which were advanced by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach has invested more time and taxpayers' money in manipulating public opinion than all his predecessors, going back to the late W. T. Cosgrave down to Deputy L.T.Cosgrave.  None of them did anything like as much to manipulate public opinion as the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this propaganda campaign is to set the Taoiseach above <Col N="2391" /> the rest of us as a man of vision and integrity.  I am not suggesting that he has not his own standards but the Taoiseach is not the public.  He seems to have been persuaded by his own campaign because he told us here last week, in the rather modest assessment of himself which is characteristic of him, that no Government of which he is leader will take any step that will weaken the independence of RTE.  The inference about other leaders of other Governments is clear but equally he is telling us that we may rely on his personal assurance.  The laws and the Constitution are the only guarantee we require.  A personal guarantee from the Taoiseach that he will protect us against the kind of action he is undertaking should be dismissed with ridicule.  For that reason the House can not be expected to approve of such actions as the Government are asking us to approve this evening.</P>

      <P>Deputies, considering the events of the last fortnight, might be forgiven for thinking that 1984 instead of being the year that has passed, has only just arrived.</P>
      <P>The attempt by the Minister for Communications to prevent the RTE Authority from appointing a Director-General was the most blatant act of political interference since the station was founded. What is of even greater concern is the way in which the Taoiseach and the Minister have sought to justify their actions.  It is the type of statement they are prepared to make without even a hint of embarrassment that makes us so perturbed about the future integrity and independence of RTE.</P>
      <P>This Government have developed a propaganda machine unparalleled in the history of the State.  Because this Government are absolutely devoid of positive achievement and indeed have presided over a whole series of fiascos and disasters, the lies and distortions and subterfuges resorted to by them to cover up are something unique in Irish political history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> To bend RTE to their purposes, to make it a servile tool of Government propaganda, would represent a great step forward in their plan to gain total control of the Irish media and insulate them from the political consequences of their ineptitude.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach said last week, after the most blatant act of political interference, that the Government's policy was to have less political interference in RTE, it was the authentic voice of Big Brother speaking.  If Government Buildings were to be named the ministry of truth, one of the handler's slogans would be &ldquo;more political interference is less political interference&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement is a classic example of double think.  As Orwell said of the party intellectual, and the Taoiseach would certainly fit the definition, &ldquo;he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality, but by the exercise of double think he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The system of double think is defined by Orwell as &ldquo;a vast system of mental cheating&rdquo;.  Newspeak is &ldquo;the habit of impudently claiming that black is white in contradiction of the plain facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister were certainly engaging in mental cheating last week.  Our concern about RTE is that the Government want the double think, the mental cheat to become the political norm in our society.  They want to propagate the double think and the mental cheat in our news broadcasts and in our current affairs programmes.</P>
    <P>Many examples exist of the type of statement the Taoiseach made in Sligo last week.  We all recall the disastrous humiliation at Chequers.  We also recall the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Mullingar on 30 November that at the Summit there was &ldquo;nonetheless real and unprecedented movement&rdquo;.  He has made many similar statements since. An unprecedented setback is in Coalition &ldquo;newspeak&rdquo; unprecedented progress. The Taoiseach's speech on Monday to the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and <Col N="2393" /> Administrators is another political statement in the Big Brother style.  He spoke of coming &ldquo;a long way from the dark days of the early eighties&rdquo; and said that &ldquo;today we can present a far brighter picture&rdquo;. Yet we know unemployment has doubled since December 1980, that taxation has become crushing, and that living standards have fallen drastically.  The message the Taoiseach wants RTE to carry effectively involves a complete rewriting of the economic history of the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach makes outrageous statistical claims.  He claimed in an interview in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 16 December 1983 that, &ldquo;Government overspending on the current account has been effectively halved&rdquo;.  There never was a current budget deficit of 13, 14 or 15 per cent of GNP.  It has never been higher than 8½ per cent.  The Taoiseach boasts about growth in industrial output and exports, without taking any account of the black hole phenomenon or the distortions of transfer pricing.  The Taoiseach speaks of bringing the public finances under control, when his Minister for Finance has just introduced the highest current budget deficit ever brought before Dáil Éireann for approval.  As Orwell said of the figures produced by the ministry of plenty, &ldquo;It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another.  Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world... statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A completely Government controlled RTE would tell the nation as the Taoiseach told the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 16 December that, &ldquo;the collapse of employment has been halted and is in the process of being reversed.&rdquo;.  Yet unemployment in December and January increased by an all-time record.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on multiplying examples, but the Government and the Taoiseach have been rightly indicted of engaging in the politics of the big lie.  The heart of the issue is whether RTE are to become a docile medium for the <Col N="2394" /> transmission of the big lie.  As Orwell pointed out, the big lie allied to total Government control of the media is subversive both of democracy and of society.</P>
    <P>An article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Thursday 7 March by Eoghan Harris, a producer with RTE, and a confessed member of The Workers' Party showed the direction.  He argued that notwithstanding the obligation of impartiality and objectivity imposed on RTE by the 1960 Broadcasting Act, RTE should become totally politicised and that this was a good thing.  Members of Fine Gael and Labour are very foolish if they believe that politicisation will only be of benefit to them.  They are setting the precedent and the example which will be taken advantage of by others.  A coach and horses can now be driven by anyone so inclined through the objectivity and impartiality requirements under the broadcasting Act.  Mr. Harris argued also that RTE should only present what is euphemistically called &ldquo;the pluralist view&rdquo;.  Undermine all moral authority, all private and public ethics, and you are then well advanced towards the overthrow of Irish democracy.  One will not hear much talk of pluralism on Radio Moscow.  Similarily the tendency behind the Minister's and the Taoiseach's intervention, to have one of the national handlers made Chairman of the RTE Authority, and to put one of their proteges into the slot of Director-General is designed to curtail the expression of a plurality of opinions on RTE.  Putting forward only one point of view has nothing to do with a true pluralist democracy.</P>
    <P>Let me put it to the other side of the House.  Do you want us when we return to office to brush aside the nomination of the next RTE Authority and appoint a party activist without other qualifications as Chairman of the RTE Authority?  Do the Government now accept the principle that in future when Fianna Fáil are in Government RTE should express only Fianna Fáil views?</P>
    <P>That is the example this Government are setting.  It is a sign of their desperation caused by their low standing in the opinion <Col N="2395" /> polls that the Government have made their cynical and unprincipled grab for control of RTE.  They know they cannot persuade the Irish public by fair and free <Col N="2396" /> means of their own political merits.  They hope now to be able to do it by systematic brainwashing.</P>

      <P>Deputy Joe Walsh has been given permission to raise on the adjournment of the House the arrangement between the Minister for Agriculture, the Revenue Commissioners, AIB, and Bank of Ireland in relation to the waiving of corporation tax in certain circumstances.  He has ten minutes and the Minister has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission I should like to divide my time with Deputy Noonan.  We will take five minutes each.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise the plight of a large number of farmers who are in severe financial difficulties. I want to make a case for the extension of the rescue package for these farmers.  This scheme was initiated three years ago under a Fianna Fáil Government and it was one of the most outstanding agricultural schemes.  There are 5,228 farmers participating in this scheme and in a recent survey carried out by ACOT it was established that at least 2,500 of our best developing farmers would go out of business if the scheme was terminated as proposed by the present administration.</P>
      <P>The funding of the scheme is of a peculiar type &mdash; a very sensible arrangement where Revenue waive corporation profits tax and tax credits in relation to some of the financial institutions, and the banks contribute 25 per cent of the cost of this scheme.  The banks have gone on record as saying that they are in favour of the continuation of the scheme.  Now it is up to the Minister and his Department to facilitate the staying in business of several thousand of our very best farmers.</P>
      <P>In the present acute situation, because the milk quota has been foisted on them by blunders in the estimated amount of milk, the farmers are unable to meet their quotas and their repayments without the aid of this scheme.  As the Minister knows, this scheme reduces the rate of interest to 10.5 per cent so that farmers can programme their repayments and know exactly how much they have to pay at the end of the day rather than fluctuating interest rates and not knowing what they will have to pay at the end of any particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to contrast the situation with industry.  Industrial firms which run into financial difficulties are restructured with the aid of Fóir Teoranta, a State body which in 1983 spent £21 million and in 1984 £25 million as against the cost of this scheme, which in 1983 cost £1.7 million and in 1984 £4.5 million.  The farming and agricultural industries are entitled to the same type of arrangement as industry.  I want to strongly put the case for the farming community that this scheme be extended.  The cost of the <Col N="2399" /> scheme as outlined in the original budget will not be any more if it is extended for a further two years because of the decrease in interest rates over the last two years.  I want to give a commitment on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that when we are returned we will continue this scheme and have a permanent structure to restructure the best of our developing farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Like my colleague Deputy Walsh, I ask the Minister to continue this rescue package.  I want to reiterate on behalf of Fianna Fáil our total commitment to the continuation of this rescue package when we are back in Government.  Farmers are now facing greater interest rates than they faced last year.  This is due to excessive Government borrowing in the domestic market. The increase of 2 per cent in interest rates last December occurred against a background of falling international interest rates and declining inflation rates.  The farm sector is currently operating in an extremely difficult economic environment despite the fact that international rates are falling.  The Government's lack of commitment to agricultural development has created a barrier to increased output by farmers who participated in the rescue package and farmers who were pioneers of agricultural development. The unwillingness of the Government to continue this rescue package is another way of pulling the plug and ending any prospects of future agricultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should extend the reduced interest rates subsidy scheme to enable farmers to regain economic viability. We know the Government underspent the original allocation for this scheme by close on £12 million, so the extension of the scheme will not cost additional money.  Farmers will face a most difficult year in 1985 and by extending this scheme the Government can display some willingness to restore farmer confidence in the future.  The scheme, which was originally introduced by Fianna Fáil, has helped quite a number <Col N="2400" /> of farmers to get back on the rails.  It is vital to extend the scheme to ensure the survival of many more farmers.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to continue this scheme to ensure that more farmers reach viability.  Fianna Fáil have a commitment to continue that scheme when back in Government.</P>

      <P>The reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty had its genesis in the five year period from 1976 to 1980, inclusive, when farm incomes were rising and the outlook for Irish agriculture was very promising. Consequently many farmers undertook a considerable volume of developmental work and were indeed encouraged to do so by various official agencies.  However, quite a number of them were forced to borrow quite heavily to finance this development work.  At the time the repayment of borrowings presented no major problems, but in subsequent years the position deteriorated partly because of the more difficult economic climate generally and partly because the development of farm incomes was not favourable as seemed probable earlier on.  In particular, a sharp increase in interest rates posed very serious problems for farmers who had substantial borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1981 it was clear that a substantial number of farmers would be unable to cope without special assistance.  Protracted negotiations were entered into between the Government Departments concerned &mdash; Agriculture and Finance &mdash; on the one hand and on the other hand the four associated banks and the ACC, who between them are the major sources of capital borrowed by farmers.  As a result, the reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty was introduced on 1 April 1982 by the then Minister for Agriculture in association with the associated banks and the Agricultural <Col N="2401" /> Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which was to apply for a three year period, had as its objective the aim of providing funds at a reduced interest to full-time farmers who were in severe financial difficulty but who could over the three year period of the scheme be brought to viability with the aid of the reduced interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are obviously a few things Deputies did not know.  The level of the subsidy provided varied according to prevailing interest rates but it was provided that the maximum subsidy would be 8¾ per cent and that the participating farmer would bear a minimum interest rate of 10½ per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it is necessary to go in detail into the rather complicated conditions relating to the scheme but I must say a few words about the way the scheme was operated and how the financial cost was shared between the Exchequer and the lending institutions involved.  First of all, the scheme was unique in my experience of schemes financed or partly financed by the State in that it was operated not by the Department of Agriculture but by the lending institutions concerned.  This was necessary because only the institutions from which a farmer borrowed would have the full facts about a farmer's level of indebtedness, his record of servicing his debts and so on and consequently only they could decide, in accordance with guidelines agreed between the lending institutions and the Department of Agriculture, whether a farmer was in severe financial difficulty and whether a financial reconstruction plan to restore that farm to viability could be drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the sharing of the financial cost, the agreement was that the State would bear 75 per cent of the cost of the scheme, the remaining 25 per cent being borne by the lending institutions concerned. <Col N="2402" /> In practice, what happens is that the lending institution concerned gives a participating farmer the benefit of a reduced interest on his eligible borrowings and submits a claim to the Department of Agriculture for a refund of the part of the cost to be borne by the State. In fact, the State contribution is made by a combination of direct cash payments, loss of corporation profits tax because of a reduction in the profits liable for this tax and tax credits against corporation profits tax.  I shall have to return to this matter later on in more detail.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the scheme was to last for three years and the intention was that the participants would be made viable by the end of the three year period. This period ends on 1 April 1985 for bank borrowings and 1 May 1985 for borrowings for the Agricultural Credit Corporation. However, it seems that not all participants have made as much progress as anticipated.  This is due to a number of circumstances.  The anticipated pickup in the economy generally has not been as strong as at one time seemed possible; interest rates have not dropped as much as anticipated and factors such as the milk super-levy have imposed constraints on the development of agricultural incomes. I am sure most of the Deputies present are familiar with the ACOT survey on the progress of participants in the reduced interest schemes.  This survey shows that about 50 per cent of participants can be made viable without further assistance while 15 per cent of participants are unlikely to recover viability even if the scheme is extended.  An extension of the scheme would be needed by 35 per cent of participants who would not have achieved viability by the end of the scheme.  I am of course deeply concerned at this development and I have been examining the possibility of continuing the scheme for a further period for those who need it. The problem is of course, lack of finance. Deputies are aware of the need to curb growth in Government expenditure.  We cannot take measures which would reduce the amount of money accruing to the State to meet financial commitments.</P>
    <P>As far as this scheme is concerned, I <Col N="2403" /> acknowledge that there are 35 per cent of the people involved who would have severe problems in regaining viability if the scheme is not prolonged or if some other scheme is not introduced.  The lending agencies and farm organisations agree that there are other ways in which people with heavy borrowings can be helped. My Department are looking at various options open to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>His case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the claimant was incapable of work within the meaning of Social Welfare Acts during the period from 19 July 1984 to 22 January 1985, and is entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of that period.  All arrears payable will be issued when details of supplementary welfare allowance already advanced to the person concerned have been ascertained.  The claimant submitted an intermediate medical certificate <Col N="2280" /> dated 23 January 1985, showing a different incapacity and payment of benefit was, accordingly, restored from that date.  All benefit payable up to 5 March 1985 the date of the latest medical certificate received, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced in the period has been issued.</P>

She claimed unemployment benefit but her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she did not fulfil the condition of being available for work.  In notifying her of the decision in her case it was inadvertently omitted to advise her that she also failed to satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit.  She appealed against the disallowance of her unemployment benefit claim but before her appeal is referred to an appeals officer her case has been referred to a social welfare to investigate her employment history with the objective of verifying the class of contribution applicable to her particular employment.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the inquiries and she will be advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 377,378 and 379 together.  As Minister for Energy my responsibility is to ensure development of the natural gas grid in accordance with sound commercial principles, In this context proposals for the supply of natural gas to Kilkenny Gas Company and to a substantial industry in the area have been under consideration for some time. Up to now it has not been possible to reach agreement with either of them on supply terms consistent with Government policy.  Recently they decided to resume negotiations with BGE but I am not in a position to forecast what the outcome may be.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to increases in the total amount of the grants which have been paid to the local authority in lieu of both domestic rates and rates on land in each year over the corresponding total paid in the preceding year.  The increases were as follows:&mdash; 1980, 12.83 per cent; 1981, 37.61 per cent; 1982, 56.09 per cent; 1983, 36.79 per cent; 1984, 1.05 per cent.  These increases reflect changes in the reliefs available in respect of rates on land over the period and accordingly are not an indication of the net increase in the local authority's current income over the period.</P>

Her yearly average was calculated on the basis of her total of 795 contributions in the period from 5 <Col N="2290" /> July 1960 to 5 April 1982.  A yearly average of at least 48 reckonable contributions is required to qualify for the pension at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has stated that she was not insured before 1967.  The Department's records show, however, that she entered insurance on 12 September 1960 and had five paid contributions in the 1960-61 contribution year.  She was also awarded ten pre-entry credits in respect of that year.  There are no further contributions, paid or credited, on her record from that time until 1967.</P>

His means are derived from the value of board and lodgings on his aunt's holdings.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 512 and 513 together.  Payments to CIE and private transport companies in respect of the provision of free travel facilities are calculated by reference to periodic surveys of usage on the respective services.  The rates of payment are also adjusted in line with increases in fares and the inclusion of additional categories in the free travel scheme.  The amount paid to CIE in 1984 in respect of the provision of free travel facilities was £21,568,000.  The corresponding figure for private transport companies was £461,000.  It is estimated that £24,033,000 and £551,000 will be paid to CIE and private transport companies respectively in 1985.</P>

All decisions on appeals are made by appeals officers who deal with cases as quickly as possible.

Responsibility for the administration of that scheme, including the eligibility conditions, is a matter for the Minister for Labour.  One of the conditions for participation in the scheme is that a person must be in receipt of unemployment assistance which has different eligibility conditions for men and women.  The Social Welfare (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 1984 circulated on 13 December 1984 contains proposals which will enable women to apply for unemployment assistance on the same basis as other unemployed persons.  It is not possible to state the date of implementation of these provisions in advance of their enactment by the Oireachtas.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 532 and 533 together.  The tabular statement hereunder sets out particulars in relation to the number of candidates who qualified at the competitive interview in the 1983 recruitment competition; the highest placed candidate called for medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish test; and the number appointed to date.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 681 of 15 May 1984 candidates who qualify at the competitive interview conducted by the Civil Service Commission are placed in order of merit by the commission and are considered for appointment in that order.  Candidates might not necessarily be appointed strictly in that order, however, because various other requirements have to be satisfied, in particular a medical examination and where appropriate an oral Irish test.  Administrative arrangements in connection with these matters &mdash; including the availability of the candidates themselves for the tests &mdash; can result in appointments being made in an order different from the strict order of merit.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Garda Commissioner must be satisfied as to a candidate's general suitability for appointment to the Force.  Subject to the foregoing, candidates who are successful at the medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish test, and who are otherwise suitable, are offered appointment in order of merit.  No decision has been made at this stage as to the total number to be appointed from 1983 competition or the length of time the lists of qualified candidates will last.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, I have not had an adequate opportunity to consider whether, if there are in fact any such records, it would be appropriate for me, in the context of a parliamentary question or otherwise, to disclose information about what they do or do not contain, in view of the fact that, <i>prima facie</i> at all events, they would not be concerned with any issues of current administration but only with matters of historical interest to which the rules or practices governing the publication of State papers might have a relevance.  I am not aware that it has been the practice to publish material of this kind in the context of parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to communicate with the Deputy when I have considered these issues further or, alternatively, I would invite him to repeat the question in a few weeks time.</P>
