      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the substance of what the Deputy wishes to raise and I will communicate with him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I do not think you are fully aware of what I wish to raise.  There are three questions involved in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to allow Deputies to develop their reasons for wishing to raise various issues we would have a series of speeches each morning on the Order of Business, so that instead of matters improving they would deteriorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, surely your decision as to whether to allow a matter on the Adjournment would be influenced to some extent by the extent of the problem concerned and that, therefore, the Deputy would be entitled to elaborate so that you would be in a better position to judge whether to allow it on the Adjournment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To carry that to its logical conclusion we would have the Deputy making a long speech and then in the afternoon saying to someone else who would be contributing that he could cover some points the original Deputy had not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing that.  I simply wish to refer to the further attempted outbreak from Spike Island and to such matters as the safety of the <Col N="2463" /> families on the island and also the disturbances at Arbour Hill Prison last night. These matters are all relevant to the question I am putting to the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the proceedings here on 22 January in regard to the Social Welfare (Amendment) (No.2) Bill which <Col N="2464" /> is a Bill entitled an Act to provide for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare and for that purpose to amend the Social Welfare Acts, 1981?  On that date the Minister for Health and Social Welfare moved that the Second Stage be ordered for Tuesday, 29 January 1985.  What has occurred in the four intervening months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the imminent closure of an industry in County Mayo which would result in the loss of approximately 38 jobs.  The problem arises because of unfair competition and because of restrictive clauses imposed by the IDA.  These clauses stand in the way of a rescue package being put into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Labour or the Taoiseach what the position is with regard to the dangerous substance regulations as they apply to industrial activity?  Draft regulations have been available for about nine months and what is the up-to-date position on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>There are two divisions this evening between 8.30 p.m. and 9.p.m..  It is certain that there will not be time for an Adjournment debate. If there is a long list of requests, each and every one of them will have to be processed.  It is my duty to explain to the House that it will take time and will cost money to process those requests.  Each Department will be in a tizzy getting ready for a debate that will never happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are sitting on the one I asked since last November and neither Department seem to be in much of a tizzy.  With respect, as a Member of the House elected by the people in north County Dublin and with St. Ita's Hospital in the area, I am entitled to have the Department look at the question which I asked for on the Adjournment.  I make no apology for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair lectured us on our rights with regard to raising a matter on the Adjournment and said it <Col N="2468" /> was a costly matter from the point of view of the State.  It is a costly matter for the citizens of the State when the Government are not doing their job properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please resume your seat.  I am here to see that the business of the House is conducted in an orderly and effective manner.  If I hear requests made which I know cannot be acceded to because of orders which have already been made I consider it my duty to explain that to the House.  I did nothing more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have already suggested that the Chair bring before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges the suggestion that whatever other business is on, one half an hour be specifically allocated for the Adjournment Debate, even if it means sitting later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the business of the Chair to bring matters before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges. On the Committee on Procedures and Privileges I am the presiding chairman. It is the business of the Whips or any member of the committee to bring matters before it and if notice is given that it is desired to raise something there, I see if that can be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since, as Deputy Burke pointed out, the Chair has drawn attention to the anomalous situation we find ourselves in this evening, in your capacity as chairman of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges I suggest that it would be in order for the Chair to raise this matter and see what the committee think about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of being told that this too is not my concern, it would lead to a better use of the time of the House if parties would agree between themselves on what they want raised on the Adjournment.  It would save processing as many as 15 different items only one of which can be dealt with.</P>

However, I do not think that a period of three years is sufficient, there should be at least a five year period.  The situation could be reviewed then as we all know that if bulls of a high quality breed are acceptable for three years they must be acceptable for five years.  Everything depends on the ability of a farmer in a disadvantaged area to purchase a pure bred bull and that is why I ask for a review of the situation.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister has gone a little way towards meeting our case but I am still not happy with his proposal.  He should take into account district electoral divisions instead of sizes of herds.  Sneem, Kenmare, south-west Kerry and pockets in the west and north should be exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  The <Col N="2473" /> Minister will find it very difficult to draw a line in regard to the size of herds because in one district 95 per cent of farmers could have 20 cattle or fewer and the remainder might have 30, 40 or 50 cattle.  Once the principle is accepted that quality non-pedigree bulls for beef breeding purposes should be allowed, the Minister should go the whole way in this matter.  I understand that in Australia and New Zealand they are insisting on farmers using pure bred bulls and farmers are being given a discretion under licence. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to exempt from the provisions of this Bill certain areas of the country.</P>

This is a way out for the Minister.  He can say it is laid down in legislation that for a prescribed period a person in a particular area would be allowed to keep a quality non-pedigree bull of the beef breed.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Even Deputy Sheehan might be sitting in that seat one day, and he could have a different interpretation.  I am not necessarily talking about a change of Government but a Cabinet reshuffle.  The Minister's successor may have a totally different interpretation and this Minister's suggestion may not be accepted by him.  If the Minister is in favour of strengthening this Bill and giving a period of adjustment to the small farmers along the western seaboard and in the disadvantaged areas, here is the ideal solution to be written into the Bill.  The Minister of the day can at any time repeal that section when the desired result is achieved.  I am suggesting that, irrespective of what might happen subsequently, this amendment is acceptable having regard to the great concern about this aspect of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In future years we must look to those disadvantaged areas for an increase in our beef cow numbers.  If we are now going to have a restriction on the breeding of beef cattle in those areas by the imposition of this legislation, we will not have this increase.  The Minister also desires this increase, although his party were converted late to the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask him to accept amendment No. 9 which meets the demands of those concerned.  We on this side of the House have accepted the need for this legislation and have agreed the Second Reading of the Bill.  The Minister can accept our sincerity and general interest. I know that he realises the necessity for strengthening this section to achieve the desired results in operation &mdash; and in legislation, which is important.  The people in the disadvantaged areas will have the transition period for building up their herds.  Our other amendment was ruled out of order, but we must insist that <Col N="2476" /> this amendment be accepted and written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>Most farmers I have met have expressed serious concern about the introduction of this Bill.  They consider it a result of antiquated thinking within the Department of Agriculture. Animal breeding in this country has improved enormously in the last 20 or 30 years, but now this utterly ridiculous restriction is proposed.  New Zealand, which our President visited recently, have moved away totally from licensing bulls and accept half breds and three quarter breds.  We have some fine half breds and three quarter breds in this country, in both dairy and beef.  The section as it stands would set up a rich man's club with which nobody else could compete and which few could join.  Who is advising the Minister on this legislation?

      <P>I support this very reasonable amendment.  It recognises the difficulty of small farmers with small suckler herds in isolated, disadvantaged areas.  It is unrealistic to expect such people to be able to afford the services of a pedigree premium bull for their herds.  If the Minister is serious, he should accept our amendment.  It would facilitate the issuing of a regulation under the Bill.  It would be important to have this <Col N="2477" /> amendment written into the Bill itself. Our view is supported by eminent people in animal breeding circles both here and in other countries.  Quality beef type bulls, subject to inspection, should satisfy the conditions laid down by the Minister and his Department.  I join with the other speakers who complimented the Minister for softening in his attitude towards this problem.  However, I insist that this amendment be accepted as part of the Bill, the regulation to be introduced as a consequence of that.</P>

      <P>It is debatable here.  This can be provided for in the regulation.  If the matter is not clarified, it will lead to all kinds of difficulties for the Minister. Our suggestion is much stronger and clearer and will satisfy Deputy Sheehan who acknowledges, as we all do, that the Minister has come part of the way since we last debated this issue.  However, the Minister could come fully along the lines suggested and do something sensible by accepting our amendment.  This is a very definite way of dealing with the problem as against the vague and undefined way in which the Minister is proceeding, which will not be satisfactory.  It would be open to all kinds of abuse and irregularities.</P>

      <P>I fully support amendment No. 9.  This asks that a new section <Col N="2478" /> be inserted before section 4.  The phrase &ldquo;subject to inspection&rdquo; is the important part.  The Minister wants licences to be issued in relation to the size of the herd. This could not possibly work in the disadvantaged areas, where the size of one herd is not always a reflection of profitability. That is an important point.  Further, granting concessions to farmers with small herds is the next best thing to creating a monopoly and would appear to be totally impractical.  In view of these points, I ask the Minister to agree with our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument about the content of what we are doing, only about the cosmetics of how it is done.  I am advised that the way I am proposing is the most efficient.  In the case of the amendment put down by Deputies Noonan and Walsh, there is nothing to stop the Minister at any time from putting before the House legislation removing that item from the Bill.  We must not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about something which is not a permanent institution. That is not my wish.  I doubt if there is anyone in the House who is more adamant than I am about quality.  I gave this concession very reluctantly after listening to Members on all sides of the House who thought something was needed. When this Bill goes through this House and the Seanad, immediately we will put before this House a simple regulation spelling out exactly what the Opposition Deputies are saying.  There is no basic difference between us on the matter.  We are talking about the use for a limited period &mdash; I suggest three years &mdash; of pedigree or non-pedigree beef-type bulls for suckler herds.  We will have to charge inspection fees where an inspection is carried out by an inspector from the Department.  The, when the animal in question passes the inspection the owner will get a permit.  All of that will be spelled out in the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulation will stand for a three year period.  If at the end of that period the Minister of the day sees fit to extend the regulation he can do so.  He can lay the regulation before the House and tell <Col N="2479" /> the House that as we have not progressed as much as we would have liked with regard to beef cattle a further period is deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing is a more tidy way of dealing with the matter.  By putting something into a Bill one gives it an air of permanence and I would not be in favour of that.  However, a regulation can be in operation for a period of, say, three years and if the Minister of the day wishes to continue that regulation he may do so. If at the end of three years the Minister wishes to repeal it he will have to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He cannot do it off his own bat.  My advice from the Attorney General's office is that while complying with what Deputy Noonan, Deputy Walsh and my colleagues on this side of the House want, the way I am proposing to deal with the matter is more effective.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If the amendment is accepted the provision will be consolidated in legislation.  At any time the Minister may repeal that section of the Bill if it is thought desirable and necessary.  The Minister of State is just giving us his word here today that the regulation will be introduced.  We are giving him the opportunity in the new section to introduce regulations within that section with regard to implementing the measure in any part of the country. All these decisions can be made under regulation.  We want to meet the genuine needs of those concerned.  The Minister of State said he was giving a concession. Far from it.  Under this legislation he had the right to introduce a regulation with <Col N="2480" /> regard to any aspect and he can do so at any time.  Irrespective of what Deputy Sheehan or Deputy Begley may say, this is not an advance with regard to the Minister's original thoughts on the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I cannot see what objection the Attorney General could have because it is within the ambit of the Bill to use section 4 to overcome the difficulty.  Fianna Fáil are concerned about small farmers to ensure that they will get a concession.  We have no guarantee that this regulation will ever be introduced because in the final analysis it is not the decision of the Minister of State.  It can be the decision of the Government, of the Secretary of the Department, or the decision of the principal officer in the livestock section of the Department.  The commitment the Minister of State is giving here today means nothing.  We are asking him to have it written into the legislation.  Then the small farmers in County Kerry and elsewhere will know the Minister is doing something worthwhile for them while upholding the principles of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to accept our amendment and I ask his colleagues on the other benches to consider what has been said here.  We are asking that the concession to enable people in the transitional period to have a non-pedigree quality beef bull should be written into the legislation.  We are asking for this because this proposed legislation will <Col N="2481" /> confine farmers to using pure bred bulls. We cannot accept the word of the Minister of State that a regulation will be introduced because, as I have pointed out, in the final analysis it is not his decision. The Bill means that small farmers will have to keep pure bred registered bulls. I presume the Minister of State is interested in seeing that when the Bill becomes law all its provisions will be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is not a serious monopoly situation in so far as small farmers are concerned. It will have serious implications for a huge number of farmers with, say, less than 20 cows who, because of their income, would not be in a position to purchase, maintain or indeed insure a pedigree bull.  It will force small farmers to rely totally on AI and the Minister and Deputy Sheehan know how ineffective AI can be in such circumstances.  It will lead to a huge reduction in calf numbers, especially in suckler herds, with obvious implications for the beef industry and create a monopoly of pure bred bulls.  We are all interested in having top quality bulls.  We are asking for a prescribed period of time to be decided by regulation. We want this strengthening of the provisions written into legislation so that it becomes part and parcel of our laws on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I still believe we are arguing about nothing because section 3 (1) reads almost word for word with the Deputy's amendment, the former reading:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, in prescribed circumstances and on payment of the prescribed fee, grant to a person a permit authorising the person to have in his possession an unregistered bull subject to and in accordance with such conditions as may be specified in the permit.</P>
      <P>Whereas the Deputy's amendment on section 9 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 2 and 3, the Minister may, for a prescribed period and subject to inspection, grant a licence to a person, <Col N="2482" /> authorising him to keep in his possession a quality non-pedigree bull of the beef breed.</P>
    <P>Under the Deputy's amendment regulations will still have to be introduced.  The Deputy will still have to take my word for it.  I am promising this House today that immediately this Bill passes through both Houses the relevant, clearly spelled out, regulation will be laid before both Houses.  It should be remembered that, under the Deputy's amendment, I would still have to do the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because one could become a small farmer overnight on account of disease, as the House is well aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a financial motion moved here this morning, No. 2, on the Order Paper in which there was mention of charges. Could the Minister elaborate and tell us what would be the charge of a departmental inspector to a smallholder or farmer in the west for inspecting a non-pedigree bull?  Could the Minister give some idea of what charges would be imposed; for example, would it be a fixed charge?  I could not go along with Deputy Noonan when he says that he could not take the Minister's or his officials' word. Speaking as one who dealt with Ministers and officials in the past I found that their <Col N="2483" /> word was their bond in a commitment to this House and its spirit has always been acceptable.  I would suggest that perhaps Deputy Noonan should rephrase what he has said because it tends to cast an aspersion on all Departments and Ministers. I am not normally an officials man but when a Minister gives the House an undertaking it has been found that the spirit of that undertaking has been honoured throughout the years.</P>
    <P>On the lighter side of things, the way we are proceeding this morning one might well say that at one time we had the Lindsay Gaeltacht whereas this morning we have the Hegarty bulls.  That is the way it appears to me.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that there is certain merit in what Deputy Noonan and his colleagues are saying. The Minister has given this House a solemn undertaking that this regulation will obtain for three years and that should be sufficient for all of us.  Certainly I am prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of inspections will be clearly spelled out in the regulation. Originally I had envisaged that it could be as high as £50.  We have worked on it and we envisage &mdash; through the proper assembly of bulls and so on in prescribed places, such as marts &mdash; the possibility is that such charge would be nearer to £20 per inspection.</P>
      <P>I have asked for suggestions with regard to size of suckler herds.  The average suckler herd at present is 6.5.  I thought that perhaps a herd of 15 cows downwards would be reasonable with regard to &ldquo;small&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Begley, I should like to assure Deputy Noonan that our Minister's commitment here this morning does not by any means create a precedent.  He is not the first Minister who has given his word and nobody doubts the wisdom or confidentiality of the Minister's word.  I am wondering if the Minister could include all herd owners who wished to participate in disadvantaged areas rather than confine <Col N="2484" /> participation to a number.  If it must be confined to a number I would appeal that he make it 25 downwards instead of 15.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We strongly support the general thrust of this Bill in that we want to improve the breed of cattle in the country but we recognise that there is perhaps a short term difficulty.  That is why we have an amendment down.  It is a reasonable one.  We are not specifying disadvantaged area or size because there are disadvantaged people in many parts of the country, as every Deputy is aware. As the House is aware those boundaries create much difficulty and we do not want to create even more boundaries.  We are saying, in regard to section 3, that an inspection would be necessary because we are insisting on the highest possible quality without putting people with small suckler herds in different parts of the country to the expense of placing pedigree premium bulls on a register of a society.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about recognising the difficulties with smaller suckler herds he should not have any great problem about accepting our amendment.  He said there was no argument about the content of the amendment and I am sure all Members agree with that but it is simply a question of how to implement its terms.  The provision should be written into the Bill and the licence fee and other details spelled out in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Will the Minister outline the reason why the Attorney General considered our amendment unacceptable?  I find it difficult to understand that.  The Minister has said that there is a difference between what we propose and what is in section 3.  In my view the only difference is that our amendment seeks to strengthen the position by having the provision written into the legislation leaving the Minister <Col N="2485" /> of the day no option but to make the regulation under the section while section 3 states that the Minister may make regulations.</P>
      <P>Like all Members I am concerned about the need to accelerate the disease eradication programme.  If we are to have a number of bulls assembled in a public place for inspection, such as a mart, surely that is contrary to our common aim, the speedy eradication of disease.  If that is not possible the inspection will have to be carried out on the farmer's premises.  The Minister should announce to the House the amount of the inspection fee.  In our amendment we did not use the words &ldquo;small&rdquo; or &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo; but the Minister described a herd of 15 cows as a small herd.  That is a matter of interpretation and if it is the Minister's view that such a number represents a &ldquo;small&rdquo; herd I am prepared to accept it. As the regulations will be made by the Minister I suggest to him that the figure of 15 should not be a rigid number.  There should be some flexibility.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that it is important we give advantages to farmers who live in the less advantaged areas. Those farmers may not be living in the disadvantaged areas as specified by the EC Commission but it is accepted that we will have to look to them in the future for an increase in our beef cow numbers. It is in those areas that the calves and store cattle are reared.  If the Minister places those farmers at a disadvantage we will not achieve our aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has tried to imply that there is little difference between section 3 and our amendment but while the underlying principle may be the same, it is my view that there is a vast difference. The regulation should be made in accordance with out amendment.  It should be part of our law that for a prescribed period licences will be issued to farmers. Section 3 states that the regulations may be made but we want it written into the legislation that the regulations will be made.  If our amendment is accepted the Minister, or any future Minister, will not have any option but to ensure that for a <Col N="2486" /> prescribed period, and subject to inspection, licences are granted authorising a set category of farmers to keep in their possession a quality non-pedigree bull of the beef breed.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the regulation may or may not be introduced but our proposal is that it will have to be introduced after which a decision will be made as to the farmers to be given a licence.  Our amendment introducing a new section strengthens the Minister's hand and it gives the advantage to the category of farmer about which we are talking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Our advice from the Attorney General's Office is that doing it by regulation is a tidier way of doing it.  For instance, section 3 (1) states: &ldquo;the Minister may, in prescribed circumstances&rdquo;. That will include inspection. The words &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; mean that it is also possible that the Minister may not.  The option is there for the Minister.</P>

That will be done in a matter of days after this legislation is put through the Houses.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan was also concerned about the movement of animals.  I assure the Deputy that we will be giving adequate notice to people with regard to inspections if animals are being inspected at a central place and the ordinary health regulations will apply.  The 30 day premovement test will apply for bringing bulls to centres.</P>

If the Minister wishes to ensure that the law is strengthened he can ensure that it is written into the legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept the point raised by the Minister about the assembly of bulls at one point but I am concerned about disease eradication.  It could happen that it would not be possible to have these bulls assembled at one point and the inspection may have to be carried out on the premises. This might be more desirable provided the inspection fee is not excessive.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that aspect of it.  That is a matter for regulation by the Minister of the day.  I do not doubt the Minister's word in relation to &ldquo;may&rdquo; but the Minister's word is not final.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to spell out the regulation which would have to be introduced at any rate under the Bill.  What exactly has he in mind?  In different measures in this House we are promised addenda to Bills and that they will be put through in a very short time and so on, but these things are slow enough and the regulation which finally appears may be quite different from what may be suggested.  I accept the Minister's personal assurances regarding the matter.  We all want to see the same objective achieved at the end of the day, but I would like the Minister to give more detail about the regulation he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speakers.  I accept the Minister's commitment, but it would be better to have it done legislatively and have it in as legislation.  This is very important because with the restrictions in milk production we are looking to beef production more than ever to take up the slack in farming.  It is the only area of production on the western seaboard for the small farmer.  There is no other way to utilise his grassland in many areas where the land is substandard.  We are looking to beef because there does not seem to be any other hope in the foreseeable future. I think a mistake was made in not recognising the difficulties in that area as far as milk levies were concerned, but that is another story.  I know that the Department are laying great emphasis on quality bulls, and that is only right.  Anyone in slaughter in the factories seeing the conformation of the carcases would realise <Col N="2491" /> what the people disposing of those carcases are facing now and in the future as far as a quality carcase and a proper conformation of the animal are concerned. It is important that the best type of beef bull, be it by permit or by licence, be ensured.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of assembling at points for inspection.  I have grave doubts about this assembling of animals.  I would do that as little as possible at present. One feature of our disease eradication scheme was that we had too many animals going to marts, too many farmers going to marts on a continuing basis and disease seemed to become rampant in areas.  Seeing that brucellosis and TB especially have become manageable, the less assembling the better.  I favour inspections.  Admittedly, these are costly in individual cases and examinations, but I favour that rather than assembling large numbers from the point of view of the danger of disease spread.</P>
      <P>Seemingly, what is at stake is either a regulation or legislation.  I accept the Minister's view.  He is a man of honour but another Minister of State might be more shifty as far as regulations go.  We must look to the future.  That is why I say that if it is possible at all it is preferable to have it in legislation.</P>

      <P>In order to remove any doubts that Deputy Noonan has about the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 3 (1), will the Minister consider changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the circumstances?  Deputy Noonan stated that &ldquo;circumstances alter cases&rdquo; is an old saying, and so also do broken noses alter faces, but I have no doubt that the Minister is a man of his word but maybe he could clear up the matter amicably if he introduced the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Also I would like a commitment from the Minister once and for all as to the size of the herd that he would include in the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will spell out, as requested by Deputy Walsh, the exact <Col N="2492" /> terms of the regulation.  This is a derogation for a piece of legislation, and the whole thrust of the legislation is to improve the quality of our animals.  I am doing this with reluctance.  I might as well tell the truth.  I have grave reservations about this derogation.  I am not at all sure that in the long term derogation would be desirable, considering the sort of competition that this country will face from our competitors in the market place and also that we have always aimed and will continue to aim at the top end of the market, the German butchers and the British supermarkets, and that is the general thrust of our total beef production. From day one in beef production our costs have been quite high and our quality must be right.  The point must be made that if we are to compete the first prerequisite is to have a good quality animal.</P>
      <P>There is a further point.  We are talking about high quality non-pedigree bulls. Where will that mysterious animal keep coming from if we have not got pedigrees? That is a worry I have.  Very reluctantly we are bringing in regulations which will be quite specific.  Beef suckler herds will be defined by the scheme of premiums for maintaining suckler cows. We will allow them to keep quality non-pedigree beef bulls for breeding purposes. I suggest that the maximum eligible herd should be 15.  Non-pedigree bulls proposed for breeding must be inspected and passed by the Department's inspectors.  I know Deputies are worried about disease.  The pre-movement regulations will be strictly adhered to and I suggest that marts would be proper assembly points where standards of hygiene are maintained.  Those inspections will take place during the spring and the autumn.  The full cost of the inspection will be borne by the owner of the bull.  Following the approval of the bull for breeding purposes, the farmer will apply for a permit to keep the bull.  On payment of the prescribed fee a permit will be issued.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> What the Minister has said raises a doubt in my mind.  He said he is suggesting the introduction of this regulation with reluctance.  Eventually we might find that no such regulation was being introduced. We can only deal with the facts as they arise.  We have accepted the principle of this Bill and the Minister should give us credit for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Bill neglects the problem in small farm areas and in remote and disadvantaged areas. We are putting forward a positive and progressive proposal to eliminate this <Col N="2494" /> problem.  The Minister seems to be reluctant to accept our amendment No. 9 which proposes the introduction of a new section 4.  We are suggesting a positive way in which the Minister could help these people.  Earlier in another amendment which was ruled out of order we suggested that the headage grant could be doubled.  The Opposition are not allowed to introduce an amendment which would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  We are giving the Minister an opportunity to allow these farmers to keep a top quality non-pedigree beef bull. We suggested the alternative of providing a financial incentive to these farmers to give them access to pedigree bulls, but that was ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>The problem which exists in these areas is peculiar to this country and does not arise in any other country in the EC. There is nothing wrong in writing into our Statute Book legislation to meet our own needs.  We are an independent sovereign State and we are entitled to make our own laws, bearing in mind the fact that we are a member of the EC.  The Minister is continually raising doubts in my mind because he posed the question: What is a non-pedigree beef bull of top quality?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Now the Minister says it is not.  He said that the Attorney General said it was a tidy way of doing it.  I have also said that extenuating circumstances could be found for the Minister not to bring in the regulation and there would be nothing we could do about it.  The only thing we are saying this morning is that irrespective of the advice from the Government, from the Minister in charge of the Department and irrespective of the advice from the departmental officials, if this is written into the Statute Book it becomes part and parcel of this legislation so the Minister must introduce the regulations because it is laid down by statute that permits will be issued to the farmers concerned. Surely the Minister can see reason in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State has had representations as I have had from the <Col N="2496" /> people concerned that we should do something for them.  The limited period can be done by regulation.  I feel we are adopting a very compromising approach. Both of us are upholding the principles outlined in this particular Bill, to uphold at all times the importance of having top quality pedigree bulls.  At the same time we are laying down by statute the opportunity to the farmers concerned, who are very important to our agriculture, to get over the transitional period.  Those people are very badly affected by the recession in agriculture.  They are affected because of the introduction of the super-levy.  There is no problem with regard to the big producers but the Minister knows that if the small producer exceeds his quota he is badly hit.  Those small farmers are being hit twice by the provisions in this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister, in fairness to those people, to give them an opportunity to get over the difficult transitional period and not let them be hit a second time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a point about the inspection fee and the permit.  I know the Minister said that the fee will be as low as possible.  I admit that it is important that the scheme be self-financing. I hope we will not be looking for an opportunity to get extra money in. That seems to be the inclination in many areas in relation to Department officials. They do everything possible to take that little bit extra and use it as a revenue collector.  It is important that those people would not have to carry the can for something else.  I agree with the increase from 15 to 20 suckler cows.  Many of the small farmers on the western seaboard have herds of fewer than 15.  All farmers are anticipating increased production.  No matter how one relates the reduction in the overall price it is important that those people look to higher production and reduce the overall cost of production.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;I am concerned about the serious difficulty that will arise in this area.  Because of the isolation of the area and because of other circumstances, AI is not a solution.  On Second Stage I asked the Minister about the possibility of introducing a scheme for the location of bulls on special terms and so far I have not had any response. Under that scheme pedigree bulls would be placed in congested districts in March or April each year at reduced prices which would be payable by instalment. The custodians would be required to maintain the bulls in good healthy breeding conditions for four breeding seasons. The bulls would have to be available to service cows and heifers in the neighbourhood. The latter requirement might cause difficulty with regard to disease eradication but if we are talking about herds of 20 to 25 cows we should consider the possibility of such a scheme.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister has not made any reference to this aspect because the scheme was highly successful in the areas I am referring to as also was the scheme operated by the ACOT committees where premiums were allocated more or less for the same purpose and were very successful in their day. Those schemes, with some modification and bearing in mind the question of disease eradication, could be re-introduced. All sorts of suggestions have been put to the Minister but he seems to be persistent in his pigheadedness not to accept any worthwhile suggestion.  In other words, he is saying that we have nothing worth-while to offer.</P>

Subsection (2) provides that a demand for the production of a certificate or permit can be considered to have been made to the holder of such a certificate or permit if the demand is made <Col N="2504" /> verbally to any of his employees, at the place where the bull covered by the certificate or permit is normally kept and who, for the time being, is in charge of the bull.

      <P>This is a long section and I will briefly run through it.  This section confers on the Minister power to order castration or slaughter of a bull which is unregistered or a bull without a valid permit.  Under subsection (1), where a person is believed to have an unregistered bull or a bull without a valid permit, the Minister may serve notice on the owner, the reputed owner or the person having possession of the bull, requiring that person, within a specified time which cannot be less than 28 days, to have the bull castrated or slaughtered or to apply for a permit for the bull.  Under subsection (2) if the person on whom a notice is served ignores it, this subsection gives the Minister power to order the castration or slaughter of the bull at the owner's expense.  Subsection (3) requires the Minister to serve notice of his direction that a bull be castrated or slaughtered and to allow the person on whom the notice has been served 14 days in which to have made on his behalf a written appeal to consider the appeal.  Subsection (4) sets out the means by which officers authorised by the Minister may carry out his direction to castrate or slaughter a bull.  Subsection (5) provides for furnishing authorised officers with warrants of appointment and for the production of these by the officers concerned on request.  Subsection (6) provides that any expenses incurred by the Minister in having a bull slaughtered, castrated or removed for slaughter shall be the liability of the owner of the bull and can be recovered in the civil court if the owner refuses to pay on demand.  However, these expenses would not be the liability of the stockmen workmen of the owner <Col N="2506" /> of the bull or the person who owns the land on which the bull is found, if he is not the owner of the bull.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (5) makes it an offence to obstruct or impede an inspector in the exercise of his powers.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised the Deputy asked that question because I raised it myself.  This has been done regularly. Subsection (1) deals with the serving of notice on known persons by delivering by hand or by sending it by pre-paid post.  That is standard.  Subsection (2) deals with the service of notices in circumstances where the name of the owner of the bull is unknown but the place where the bull is normally kept is known.  We know the townland, the farm and the house but we do not know the owner.  This extraordinary phraseology is standard and is taken from the Town Planning Act and about 20 other Acts. <Col N="2507" /> Thus, it is established that the letter was posted and the service of the notice is proved in this way.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move amendment No. 21:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2508" /> In page 5, lines 32 to 38, to delete subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) reads:</P>
    <P>Every person who, knowing the name and address of the owner of a bull or of the person by whom a bull is kept refuses, when required pursuant to section 4 (3) of this Act by an inspector or a member of the Garda Síochána so to do, to give to such inspector or such member, as the case may be, the name and address required shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about this subsection because a neighbour would be compelled to inform on the owner of the bull if the bull was not registered or if he did not have a permit or a licence to keep the bull.  The bull in question may not be registered or may not be the class of bull required under the Bill.  If a person was not prepared to inform on the owner of such animal he would be guilty of an offence on conviction of which he would be subject to a fine not exceeding £250. Sufficient information should be available from the registration books of the different breed societies for the inspector or the Garda Síochána, as the case may be, to ascertain this knowledge without having to go to a neighbour and compel him to inform under threat of being guilty of an offence.  In the old days people looked on informing very seriously and were not prepared to do this on their neighbours.  This should not be written into legislation.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on his reasons for its inclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speaker.  There is here an element of compulsion to inform.  &ldquo;Informer&rdquo; is a very dirty word in this country and always has been, especially with regard to the political scene.  I do not like the aspect of neighbour involvement.  It reminds me of Paddy Kavanagh's book <i>The Green Fool</i> in which he talks about every person in his area of south Monaghan not being on speaking terms with three or four of the <Col N="2509" /> neighbours.  That is still the attitude in rural Ireland and on the west coast. Things have not changed.  There must be other means of establishing the facts rather than having neighbour involvement. Also, how could one establish if the neighbour were telling the truth?  This is a loose phrase and I express concern at its inclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Noonan and Leonard.  I am extremely concerned about this subsection.  I would go so far as to say that it is ridiculous to include it. The neighbours will say that they heard nothing, saw nothing and will say nothing. The Minister said earlier that he was seeking co-operation in putting this legislation into practice, but this is the wrong way to go about it.  I hope this subsection will be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reasons behind the points made by Deputies on this.  This has always been part of legislation and did not cause any great hassle in the past.  I give one example where it may be essential.  Take the case concerning the owner of land on which a bull is found.  He would be obliged to say who was the owner of the bull.  In the case of the Garda Síochána, this is meant to cover extreme cases.  To make the position quite clear, there is no obligation on anybody to come forward and squeal on his neighbour.</P>

There should be sufficient information in the Department rather than compelling a person to be an informer.  Will the Minister of State not accept that point?

      <P>It is not as easy as the Deputy makes it appear.  For instance, there is the case of young animals not yet tested.  There would not be a record of them in the DVO.

      <P>I hate to see this note creeping into the debate.  We are very serious in our wish to improve the Bill. For Deputy Sheehan to introduce a red herring at this stage is not advantageous to anybody.  I said earlier, and I have heard nothing since to change my mind, that it is a characteristic of an Irishman to go against compulsion but if he is asked civilly for co-operation I believe that will be given.  To say that a similar provision exists in other legislation is no justification for including it in this case.  As far as I know there are no cattle up to one year and a half in Wexford that are not tested. However, if there are cattle in other areas that are not tested it is a reflection of the way TB testing is being done.  That is something that will have to be taken seriously.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will outline the action that both he and the Government propose to take on the report on worksharing submitted to him by the Federated Union of Employers; and how the action taken as a result of this report will contribute to easing the unemployment situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a report on &ldquo;Employment and Worksharing&rdquo; submitted to me by the Federated Union of Employers in June 1984.  The report was one of a number of submissions made to the Government at the time on how the employment situation might be improved that were considered in the context of the preparation of the national plan: <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> The Deputy will be aware of the wide range of measures contained in the plan to improve the employment situation over the period to 1987.</P>
      <P>While it is clear that it can represent only a limited element in the resolution of the unemployment problem, the Government, under the national plan, are committed to the promotion of worksharing and to the introduction of measures and guidelines which will enhance the prospect of securing a more widespread distribution of employment opportunities for particular groups among the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us the reason the report submitted to this Government in June 1984 has not been published or made available?  Can he outline any practical suggestions the <Col N="2516" /> Government have for operating a worksharing programme?  We are all committed to worksharing.  It is easy to say we are committed but we must see its practical application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the reason for not publishing the document is that it was a strictly private and confidential submission from the Federated Union of Employers.  With regard to action, I have mentioned various actions the Government have taken, one being the Government social employment scheme, which is designed to achieve a participation level of 10,000 within a year and which will provide part time employment for that number of people.  Even though it is not yet fully operational some 100 projects will be started within the next few weeks and a total of 350 projects with employment potential of 2,500 have been received to date.</P>
      <P>As mentioned in the plan, the Government have also been pursuing the question of worksharing in the Civil Service itself.  Between jobsharing and career breaks there are already almost 700 cases in the Civil Service where, as a result of one or the other, we have been able to create additional employment and an additional almost 200 new staff will be recruited on a jobsharing basis in 1985. Therefore, within the public service itself the Government are taking these actions. In the private sector, of course, developments are a matter for consideration within our voluntary collective bargaining system on a case by case basis at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not accept that the social employment scheme could be regarded as jobsharing.  Would the Taoiseach give the reasons he has not put proposals to all sectors of the Civil Service, particularly the health services where there are many young married nurses with children anxious to be involved in job sharing?  Can the Taoiseach give us any indication of any proposals he might put forward to the various sectors of the public service to ensure that more people are given permanent <Col N="2517" /> employment for at least four days per week within the public service in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure where the four days come from; it does not quite fit into the concept of worksharing.  In fact schemes have also been introduced in the health and local authority areas and in An Post and Bord Telecom in respect of career breaks.  We would certainly encourage jobsharing as in the Civil Service in the other sections of the public service also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions 2 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> Civil Legal Aid is governed by the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice which, in its amended form, was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in May 1983.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that the Government have authorised, following proposals of the Legal Aid Board, the establishment in 1985 of law centres under the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice in Tallaght, Tralee and Athlone, and of a second law centre in Cork, to be financed to the end of 1987 from moneys available for civil legal aid under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, at an estimated cost of £450,000.  The Tallaght Law Centre will have two solicitors, and the other centres will have one each.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to open further law centres during 1986 and 1987 at Dundalk, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Letterkenny if sufficient additional funds are available under the Funds of Suitors Act &mdash; the availability of further funds will depend on the cost of the new Children's Court for Dublin, which is also to be funded under the Act.</P>
    <P>The current position about services at the board's existing law centres is that there is a waiting period of about three to four weeks to see a solicitor for non-emergency cases in Dublin.  In Cork, where there is at present one centre, there is a delay of about two weeks, in Limerick there is a delay of four weeks, in Sligo one week, and in Waterford applicants can be seen by a solicitor within two to three days.  Emergency cases at all of these centres are dealt with without delay.</P>
    <P>The Galway centre has been closed to all new cases since 11 April last.  I understand from the board that a second solicitor was assigned to that centre on 22 April to replace a solicitor who is on maternity leave, and this should improve the position there.  The total number of cases which the centre dealt with between its establishment in September 1980 and the end of 1983, which is the latest year for which figures are available, was 1,608.</P>
    <P>The expansion of services now approved <Col N="2522" /> is also expected to improve the position at Galway and Limerick because at present solicitors from these centres provide part time services under the scheme at Athlone and Tralee respectively and that will cease when centres are established in these towns.</P>
    <P>The board's proposals do not include a centre at Trim.  The board feel that that area can be serviced from Dublin but it would be a matter for the board whether further facilities, including part time facilities, should be provided at Trim, depending on resources available and other relevant circumstances.</P>
    <P>A complete exemption for the board from the terms of the Government's staffing embargo is not a realistic proposition. However, as a result of discussions which I had with the Minister for the Public Service last year, the Legal Aid Board obtained a partial exemption from the terms of the embargo to enable three solicitors' vacancies to be filled, and of course the expansion I have just mentioned will involve further recruitment of solicitors and ancillary staff.</P>
    <P>The means test provisions under the civil legal aid scheme, which were last revised in May 1983, are under review.</P>
    <P>As regards questions about the adequacy of the existing scheme, the demands that are being made on the scheme are so great that, having regard to the limited resources available, any consideration of major changes in the scope of the scheme must be deferred.</P>
    <P>As regards voluntary organisations involved in providing legal services, such as FLAC and the Coolock Community Law Centre, the position is that funding for such organisations by my Department ceased shortly after the official civil legal aid scheme came into operation.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Taylor's question concerning the disposition of funds under the Funds of Suitors Act, the information I have given covers the disposition of these funds in so far as the matter comes within my area of responsibility.  Any question of the disposition of such funds in other areas would be a matter to be dealt with by the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2523" /> It has always been the intention that the civil legal aid scheme will be placed on a statutory footing when adequate experience has been gained of its operation. The board have submitted proposals for legislation to me.  I intend to have them examined as soon as priorities in other areas have been dealt with.  I can say that the absence of legislation has not inhibited the operation of the scheme nor will it inhibit the further expansion now approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply covered a wide and varied range of questions. Will the Minister accept that the increasing demand for aid under the scheme is a symptom of the deteriorating economic climate and that there should be a commitment from the Government to increase the availability of aid under the scheme?  Would the Minister also accept that because of the serious limitation to the scheme which the Minister admitted in part of his reply, the standard of representation available is inferior to the extent that solicitors involved in the scheme are not able to give the amount of time which the client deserves and which the cases require?  Would the Minister agree that the scheme could be seen, as it is operating now, to discriminate between those with financial resources and those without?  I know this is not the fault of the excellent solicitors involved in the scheme but the failure of the Government and the Minister to appoint sufficient people or make sufficient resources available to the board. From my observations on the operation of the scheme I know that clients do not get that high&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;standard of service which could be available if there were fewer demands on the scheme.  I put it to the Minister that enough solicitors are not involved in the scheme and that the standard of representation is not as good as it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not agree with the relationship between the workload of the Legal Aid Board and the economic situation as outlined by the Deputy.  Many of the cases that come to the board, in fact three quarters of them, are in the area of family law and there is no indication of a strong relationship between these and the economic climate. On the question of whether or not the service is inferior to what one would get if one could pay for the best legal brains of the country, the service given is very good.  I take the point that they have a very big workload.  Where there are emergency cases, especially cases involving family violence they give an immediate and excellent service.  In other cases there is a delay before people can make an appointment.  I hope the steps I have announced will reduce that delay. Obviously the opening of an advice centre in Tallaght with two solicitors will take some of the pressure off the other Dublin offices.  The opening of a service in Tralee will take pressure off the Limerick office because Tralee is being serviced as a kind of substation of Limerick at the moment, and the two legal aid solicitors will be able to stay in Limerick fulltime now.  The same applies to Athlone.  When the centre is opened there, the two people in Galway will be able to work exclusively for Galway and will not have to travel to Athlone to service that area.  The second law centre in Cork will help the situation there.  The steps I have outlined will meet the problem but I also hope that the Legal Aid Board will open, as they have in the past, clinics in other towns so that the service can truly be a national service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Coolock Community Law Centre in the course of his reply.  Will the Minister repeat what he said about that because I did not catch it in the reply?  What is the position in regard to this centre and about providing an adequate level of funding for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In considering the terms of the civil legal aid <Col N="2525" /> scheme the Government decided that payments to voluntary bodies providing a legal service should cease when the State scheme was introduced.  When the State scheme came into operation in August 1980 FLAC announced the closure of 15 part time centres.  The Coolock Community Law Centre announced that it was continuing in operation and received a final grant in 1982.  It was made a specific condition on paying that grant that it was the final one payable by the Minister for Justice.  Then a submission was made to the Minister for Social Welfare, and his Department have been funding the Coolock centre since 1983. There is no intention by that Department to discontinue the help to the Coolock Community Centre which does such excellent work but whose work is of a wider nature than the facilities supplied by the law centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it provides a very beneficial service and that its position is very unsatisfactory as there is no certainty about it?  Is the Minister aware that this centre must exist from year to year hoping that it will continue to get funds and that it was really only as an ad hoc emergency measure that I, as Minister for Social Welfare, provided this aid for the centre?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am responsible for the funding of the centres that operate under the civil Legal Aid Board.  A decision was taken by the previous administration in 1980 that contributions to voluntary bodies should end once the Legal Aid Board scheme was set up but funding was continued to Coolock for a number of years up to 1983. Then it passed to the Minister for Social Welfare from the Minister for Justice. The Minister intends to provide funds again this year.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that they are providing a very good service.  There is also a provision in paragraph 632 of the Legal Aid Board's scheme whereby the board can aid centres that have a community involvement. That would be another avenue worth exploring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 14, will the Minister clarify his reference to the funds of suitors money and the disbursement of that?  Will money be made available from that fund for the Coolock Community Law Centre?  Question No. 21 relates to the three vacancies the Minister said had been filled.  Will the Minister indicate where those three vacancies have been filled?  To which law centres were solicitors appointed?  Question No. 22 asked the Minister to indicate what law centres have waiting lists or are not in a position to deal with cases as they come?  I am aware that a number of law centres refuse to accept cases because they are not in a position to deal with them.  In one case I know of, people have been told to come back in six weeks time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister for the Public Service agreed that I could appoint those three solicitors outside of the embargoed posts.  One was appointed to Gardiner Street on 24 January 1985 and two were appointed to Cork Law Centre in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the funds of suitors, the Government have decided to allocate the money available from the residue of the funds of suitors to the Legal Aid Board to fund the expansion of the legal aid <Col N="2527" /> services, as I have outlined, in Cork, Dublin, Tallaght, Tralee and Athlone. The amount of money required to do that until 1987 is £450,000.  That will not be the total residue, but it is not possible for me to calculate the total residue until the Board of Works have accepted tenders for the new children's court in Dublin. Then I will know what remains and the remaining portion of the residue will be used again for legal aid purposes to fund centres at Dundalk, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Letterkenny.  At the moment I am not in a position to quantify that because it depends on the cost of the children's court in Dublin which has priority under the funds of suitors.  However, I know that there is at least a residue of £450,000 which is being used for the four centres I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As I said in my reply, there is a waiting period of three to four weeks for non-emergency cases in Dublin.  In Cork, where there is one centre at present, it is about two weeks; in Limerick the delay is about four weeks; in Sligo one week; and in Waterford there is no waiting period and applicants can see a solicitor in two or three days.  The new centres should cut into that waiting list a great deal and, of course, anybody who has an emergency problem is dealt with without delay.  Emergency cases are still being dealt with in all centres without delay. One could give various examples of emergency cases, but generally family law cases where violence is involved and there is a necessity for a barring order quickly is the kind of emergency case one would meet most often and there is no waiting period for them.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister answered 29 questions together I hope that you, Sir, will bear with me if I ask a number of supplementaries to a number of the questions.

The situation is most unsatisfactory, particularly if the two parties to a dispute cannot attend the <Col N="2530" /> same centre.  Will the Minister agree that the best way of solving the situation as far as Tallaght is concerned would be by providing funds from the Funds of Suitors Bill for the opening of a proper law centre which could be staffed by the many excellent people who have staffed FLAC centres around the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not too sure where to begin.  I am sorry that the Deputy is disappointed.  I hope that the centre being opened in Tallaght will be very beneficial in the constituency.  It will involve the service of two solicitors and ancillary staff.  It will provide a much needed service in Tallaght.  Deputies who represent that constituency have pressed for this facility for some time and I am glad to be in a position to provide the money from the Funds of Suitors to the Legal Aid Board to enable them to provide that service.  It will also help the situation in other centres in Dublin because it will reduce the pressure on them.  As Deputy Harney has pointed out, quite a number of cases come from the Tallaght area and are being dealt with by the other centres at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Funds of Suitors Bill was debated fully here and it was decided to spend money in a certain way.  I reminded Deputy Harney that her side of the House put down an amendment to provide extra funds for one category which would have made the residue for legal aid smaller than it is now.  More credit is due to the Seanad than to the House for twisting the arm of the Minister and getting a commitment that it would be used for legal aid rather than spent at the Minister's discretion.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely sure of the £450,000 at the moment but I hope that at least another £0.25 million will be available for legal aid centres in the other places that I have outlined.  Because of the uncertainty of the cost of the Children's Court I cannot quantify the residue, but it will be sizeable, and £450,000 is by no means the end of the story.  Whatever the residue is, the bulk of it is to be spent on the provision of legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2531" /> The only other point, apart from aspirational points and expressions of concern with which we all agree, is the question of tribunals.  The Pringle Committee report in 1974 recommended that legal aid should be available for appearances before all courts and tribunals.  However, the Government decided in setting up the scheme that tribunals should be excluded, though it is possible for an applicant to receive legal aid in connection with a tribunal hearing.  A previous administration made that decision because the tribunals are intended to provide simplified, inexpensive procedures for dealing with administrative disputes without the expense of legal representation. For example, persons are frequently represented or assisted by a trade union official in presenting their case before a labour tribunal.  As a matter of fact, the ICTU made representations for the exclusion of tribunals from the scope of the scheme.  In that context, when people debate matters such as the abolition of juries and setting up tribunals to decide the level of, say, injury in places of work, the argument is always that it would reduce legal representation and that the tribunal would deal with the thing more efficiently because of the exclusion to a large extent of legal representation.  That is the policy decision on tribunals.  It was a sensible decision at the time and we should not go away from that course.</P>
    <P>On the question of the nature of a law centre which should have been provided in Tallaght, the scheme that operates in conjunction with my Department is the civil Legal Aid Board set up by the Government, and I think it appropriate that our Minister for Justice in extending the scheme would extend it through the Government's sponsored scheme rather than in any other way.  As I have pointed out, there is provision in the document which set up the Legal Aid Board for the board to become involved in a situation where there is community involvement in the running of centres.  I refer the Deputy to paragraph 6.3.2 of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister let me know the number of cases dealt with by the service in 1984 and the number of people on the waiting list in Cork at present?  How many solicitors will be working in the Cork centres with the opening of the second centre in Cork? How many solicitors are working in the service nationwide?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have not got some of the information to hand but I will get it for the Deputy.  On the question of the number of solicitors employed in each law centre, in Aston Place on 1 January 1985 they had three; Gardiner Street had four; Ormonde Quay had eight; Limerick had two; Waterford had three; Sligo had one; Cork had five; and Galway had two.  It is intended to have one solicitor and one clerical assistant immediately in the new law centre in Cork.  It will be a question of developing after that.  There are already five solicitors in the existing law centre.  The total vote is £1.372 million. The Deputy asked about the number of cases processed in each centre.  I have not that information immediately to hand.  I am sure it is available to the Legal Aid Board and I will get it for the Deputy.  I do not think there was any other point.</P>

They were appointed in late 1984.  They are reducing the waiting list.  This new law centre with an extra solicitor will mean that the service in Cork will be very good indeed.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The decision taken by the Government is that the money is now available to the Legal Aid Board and they can go ahead immediately with the Tallaght centre and the other centres I mentioned.  It is a question of the Legal Aid Board getting a premises. I understand they have a premises in mind.  They will be employing two solicitors and clerical assistance.  It is an administrative matter now and it is up to the Legal Aid Board to put it into effect. The money is there under the funds of suitors and can be drawn on immediately they make their arrangements.  It should be done very quickly.</P>
      <P>There is one point which is relevant to Cork.  I saw a number of eyebrows raised about the number of solicitors in Cork. In a large area like Cork or Dublin you need more than one centre.  Frequently both sides of the house are involved in the case.  It can be inappropriate to have the same office representing both husband and wife in family law cases.  In Cork the other spouse had to go to Waterford for representation.  Even a small unit with one solicitor provides representation for the other party in a family law case. This eases the position considerably.</P>

I am disappointed that only one solicitor will be operating in the new centre.  I do not see any immediate improvement.  They are understaffed at the moment.  The Minister mentioned a delay of three or four weeks, but there are major delays in Cork and many complaints.</P>

There were four solicitors in Aston Place and now there are three because of the embargo.  In Gardiner Street they started with three and have gone up to four. Ormonde Quay did not start until 1 January 1983.  They started with eight and still have eight.  It is working out pretty much on par.  They are one down in Aston Place and they are one up in Gardiner Street from their start up position.  I will continue to assess the position and, without breaching the principle of the embargo, fill the vacancies.  Coolock will not be funded from the Legal Aid Board. Money from the funds of suitors is being provided to the Legal Aid Board.

Sometimes problems go away if people have to wait a fortnight for an appointment.  That is another aspect of it.  I do not mean to be facetious.</P>
      <P>The expansion suggested will certainly cut down the waiting period to what one would expect if one were making an appointment privately with a solicitor. Obviously none of us can waltz into a solicitor's office and see him on the spot. We would make an appointment.  That is the kind of situation I envisage.

      <P>With regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the Garda Síochána I would like to ask the Minister a few brief questions.  Has he any plans to extend the training period for Garda recruits in the training centre at Templemore?  Will he increase the level of in force training for existing gardaí, because I believe it is vitally important that the level of training and expertise be reviewed on an ongoing basis within the force?  Has the Minister any plans to remove from the duty roster of gardaí irrelevant duties like collecting dog licences, collecting statistics and other duties which are not at all relevant to the operation of the Garda so that gardaí may be released for the more important task of policing?  I consider these questions to be relevant in terms of the question tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As Deputy Hyland is aware, the Commissioner, with my approval, has set up an expert committee of educationalists and personnel people to advise him on Garda training.  It is my intention that a new Garda recruitment campaign will begin some time in the autumn and the new training scheme will apply to those recruited at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the duration of the training period, I am informed that the committee are dealing with the question of what the appropriate training requirements of the Garda would be and that when they have established the range of skills considered appropriate they will incorporate that into the appropriate module of time. Obviously, an extension of time will be involved, but until such time as I receive the committee's report I cannot say what extra time will be involved.  I agree that there should be an increase in the level of service training.  That is another aspect the committee are considering.  The matter is ongoing and Deputies should not be under the impression that there is not a large amount of in-service training. Only two weeks ago I presented certificates to 30 members of the Garda, the Army and the Revenue staff who had completed a course set up by the US agency who are responsible for drug regulations enforcement.  The course, which was of a number of weeks' duration, was provided by the American Government in their international campaign in <Col N="2544" /> the fight against drug abuse.  A whole range of in-service courses are in progress all the time at Templemore, but that is another matter being examined by the committee.</P>
    <P>Regarding the third question, sometimes there is an argument about what irrelevant duties are in the context of the Garda.  I agree with the general thrust of the question and I should be happier if some of the duties undertaken by the Garda could be passed on to someone else; but in the absence of that someone else to undertake these duties, they will remain the responsibility of the Garda. So far as dog licences, for instances, are concerned, I suspect that only a small proportion of the dog population is licensed, so the Garda are not involved very much in collecting the fees.  However if, say, a child is attacked by a dog, the matter becomes very much the responsibility of the Garda.  The focus of attention changes.  It has been said that the Garda should be involved more in the fight against crime and involved less in traffic related duties.  Last year about 27 murders were committed in the country while almost 500 people were killed on the roads.  Very often the question is one of where the public focus is at any time but I agree with the spirit of the suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating that the area is very broad and obviously not one that could be dealt with satisfactorily at Question Time, I will concentrate on one aspect.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a great need to improve that element of Garda training that relates to rules of evidence and to court procedures?  This is a view held widely even among the training staff at Templemore.  By bringing about an improvement in this area we would be ensuring that gardaí are not at a disadvantage when faced with professionally qualified people.  In view of that and of many examples also, would the Minister not agree that, pending the completion of the present investigation, there are many such improvements that could be implemented as a matter of urgency?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes. There is no inhibition on the Garda in that respect, either in their preliminary recruit training or during the two year probation period when in-service training is provided or subsequently by way of a series of seminars.  The Garda have discretion in such matters.  I do not think we will ever have a situation where the recruit garda will be on an equal footing with the barrister who has spent several years studying law and who has years of experience.  Neither would that be necessary. But gardaí can become competent in the rules of evidence so that cases do not fall for reasons of technicalities.  I expect that is what the Deputy has in mind.</P>

      <P>The Government are concerned for the safety and welfare of Fr. John Kingston, the Holy Ghost priest missing in Angola.</P>
      <P>At present our information on the events surrounding the disappearance is incomplete but the Government are making every effort to establish the facts and the whereabouts of Fr. Kingston. In this connection we have learned with deep regret that the body of Fr. Jean Wozniak, a French Holy Ghost priest travelling with Fr. Kingston, has been recovered.</P>
      <P>My Department have been in direct contact with the Angolan authorities to make known our concern for Fr. Kingston's safety and to request their assistance in establishing his whereabouts.  As Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Angola we have also been in contact with the British and French authorities and inquiries are proceeding through their embassies in Luanda.  We have also asked the International Committee of the Red Cross, which operates in Angola, for their help and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and take all possible <Col N="2551" /> steps to find out what has happened to Fr. Kingston and to ensure his safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some brief comments in relation to this Bill which is not of earth-shattering proportions in relation to the amendments which are proposed.  Nevertheless, I am not here to criticise but to encourage the line taken in regard to reforming or amending the law.  A journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step and I take the point in the Minister's speech when when he said that, if they did not start somewhere, we would not get very far this session.</P>
      <P>Previous Members, particularly Deputy Andrews, have spoken of the enormous task facing us in updating procedures in all the courts.  Many injustices take place because of out of date procedures and Acts, and perhaps we can encourage the Minister and his Department to make further and more drastic changes which are necessary.  I know that we are dealing mainly with the intoxicating liquor laws, a subject not dear to my heart.  I do not think we need spend a great deal of time discussing it because most of what is envisaged in this Bill is to be welcomed.  This gives us an opportunity to make further changes in procedure which will benefit those who work in the courts and those unfortunate enough to be called before the courts. When updating reform procedures are brought before this House, it is very tempting to make a meal of it but I do not intend doing that because this legislation is technical and restricted.  It is not earth shattering and I am not here to criticise the contents of the Bill.  I welcome these measures and encourage the Minister to continue this reform through the other courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the judgment debt it is very sensible to reduce the number of hearings to one.  That move is to be welcomed. I would like to comment on the reduction from the maximum period of one year to 90 days under section 2.  This section deals with periods of imprisonment which may be imposed on summary conviction in default of payment of a fine and any associated cost, compensation or expenses.  It is unusual to see sentences being reduced.  In a sense this is a social reform and, recognising the time we are <Col N="2614" /> in, it is to be welcomed.  This is an outdated and unjust situation under nineteenth century law.  At that time the property classes controlled the parliaments in Ireland and in Britain and the poorer classes were unable to pay even small fines and were very heavily penalised by their masters.  These laws have been left on the Statute Book for far too long and I welcome this reduction.</P>
    <P>Very of often the fines were not related to criminal offences and the perpetrators did not intend commiting a crime but because they were unable to pay the fine, they had to serve an alternative term of imprisionment.  Very often this resulted in a form of justice which was never intended.  These Bills are drafted by individuals in the Department in consultation with the Minister but I often wonder how much thought is given to the sentences imposed.  For example if a person gets a £100 fine or six months in jail, £1,000 fine or nine months in jail and so, I often wonder if the people who decide on this alternative term of imprisonment appreciate and understand the difference between the two punishments.  If one has money and can afford to pay the fine, it is no real punishment but if one does not have the money and ends up in jail that can be a terrible punishment.  It can be a traumatic experience to have to spend, one week, one month or two months, or even 24 hours in such an environment. This can be devastating for somebody who tried to stay within the law.  Perhaps this reduction is a recognition of the possibility of such injustices happening.  If this is just a start in reforming procedures, it means we could end up with very enlightened legislation.</P>
    <P>Without affecting the power of the district justice, I would like to comment on some of the fines and the alternative prison sentences imposed.  For example, in the case of motor taxation, if a fine is not paid a prison sentence automatically follows.  I do not suppose a great deal of thought has been given to this problem but there may be another alternative method of punishment as we have seen in recent legislation, community orders. I suggest that there should be more than <Col N="2615" /> one alternative if a person does not pay a fine, not in every case but in some cases. I am sure justices would often welcome the opportunity not to send a person to prison because he disobeyed a ruling.  I recognise that it is essential that the court powers should not be impugned.</P>
    <P>For some reason there is a great number of motor taxation fines with alternative prison sentences imposed in Ireland.  The main reason is that at one time we were able to tax our cars for three months, six months or nine months and people advertising their car for sale said it was taxed for the rest of the year. This was an attraction.  If we had the same system as other countries, we could remove this difficulty in one fell swoop by taxing all cars for a minimum of one year on a certain date.  This is done very effectively in many other countries.  For example, in Canada on 31 March all cars have to be taxed.  They have a very simple method of alternating the colour of the number plates.  If this year's background is blue, next year's will be white and so on.  On 1 April the police go out on the roads and if any car has the wrong number plates the driver is waved off the road.  Everybody buys these very cheap plates, fixes them to the cars and no longer does anyone have to use a flash light in the middle of the night to see if a car has a blue, pink, yellow, gold or rose coloured tax disc, whether it is taxed for three months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>For the last 25 years I have watched the ridiculous situation where the motor taxation office in Coleraine Street has to tax over one million cars in <Col N="2616" /> the city of Dublin and the people have to queue there or pay people to queue for them.  This nonsensical, ridiculous, out of date, silly, frustrating, stupid, crazy system drives everybody crackers.  My suggestion would remove that anomaly from the system.  As we become more technologically conscious and advanced, we begin to think we are either very stupid or we have very backward people working in certain sections of our administration.</P>
      <P>The substitute of the fines is not always just.  The most important thing in this Bill is the application for renewal procedure in the case of intoxicating liquor licences.  The proposed procedure will liberalise the system and, with the exceptions mentioned in the Bill, appears to be a sensible procedure.  It changes the onus on to the applicant for renewal of a licence.  He or she must inform the commissioners of structural alterations to the premises since the last licence was granted or renewed.  Would that the planning laws had had such sensible precautions included in them.  We might then have had a lot less flouting of those laws. However, the record in the licensing trade is not bad.  Flouting of the laws is more inclined to happen in the property area.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has set out on the road to reform, could I appeal to him and his officials to look very urgently into the higher court system?  I am just going to make a passing reference.  I am a qualified barrister but never have and never will understand why we have such a tortuous and unfair system, putting such hardship on members of the community who have cause to take actions in the higher courts. These people are suffering physically, waiting for as long as five or six years for justice to be administered.  Very often this seems to occur for want of an extra judge or two, the paraphernalia and administrative back-up and the necessary premises.  I have heard that the reason is the extra cost involved.  I could give innumerable examples&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am also sure a lot has to do with inertia and lack of will to get this done.  Judging by the performance of this Minister since he came into office, even if there are complications to stop him from solving the problem, he will overcome them.

They take approximately 20 seconds.

      <P>The two sections relate to the renewal of a publican's licence and the fact that one can go to the District Court clerk for examination orders.  It makes little or no difference whether the District Court clerk or the district justice makes an examination order.  At the moment one simply gets up in court, moves an examination order, the district justice asks what date is required and that is the end of the story.  To say that the two sections simplify the procedures in the District Court is a nonsense.</P>
      <P>With regard to the renewal of a publican's licence, when one applies for a certificate of competence in the District Court, as I understand it one also applies to the Customs and Excise for the licence. They give the licence automatically once a person has the certificate from the court.  In the event of the 99 per cent of licensees who do not have to apply to the District Court because there is no objection from a citizen or from a superintendent of the Garda to the renewal of the licence, the Bill is saying that the Revenue Commissioners &ldquo;may&rdquo; renew the licence.  In my opinion they must renew the licence: there should be no &ldquo;may&rdquo; about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2619" /> An objection to the renewal of a publican's licence can be only on the basis of the character of the applicant and on whether he runs a good house.  If there is no objection in the District Court the Revenue Commissioners should be given no discretionary powers with regard to renewal of the licence.  The section seeks to give an additional power to the Revenue Commissioners but there is no need for that.  They have enough powers as it is.  I do not see any reason why they should have a competence to determine whether a person should have a publican's licence when members of the public in the area should be the people to decide if there is to be an objection.  The fact that a publican may not have his income tax or VAT returns up-to-date is irrelevant in relation to the renewal of his licence.  It has not been clarified to me whether this roundabout way of bringing in the Revenue Commissioners might not, by implication, expand the grounds under which a publican's licence might be renewed.  The section gives the Revenue Commissioners a discretion but there is no need for that.  Even if the Minister can give an assurance to the House on this matter, I suggest that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be replaced by the word &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that this Bill is designed to simplify procedures in the District Court.  The fact that one will go to the District Court clerk instead of the district justice for an examination order is irrelevant.  It is not a reform of the procedure: it may even result in a more inefficient procedure. When one goes to the District Court one has all examination orders together and it does not take ten minutes to go through them.  The district justice gives his ruling on the matter.  If one goes to the District Court clerk he might have to wait for the district justice to come back to the area to stamp the examination order.  I do not know if that will be the case; we will have to wait and see.  I presume the district justice will have to sign the examination order or perhaps the District Court clerk might get that power.  In any event it is a minor, trivial change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2620" /> The real problem with regard to debt collection is not whether one goes to the district justice for an examination order or to the District Court clerk.  The real problem is to get the decree enforced.  At the moment the person who is owed the money cannot get anybody to collect it for him.  The situation in the sheriff's office is farcical.</P>
    <P>Apart from the introduction of the District Court rules, what is proposed in the Bill is minor.  If the Minister had told us that the Bill was simply to enable him to bring in the District Court rules that would be fair enough, but to put in the other two sections under the guise of court reform and of simplifying court procedures is a totally different matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that. What I am opposed to is the presentation of this Bill as a major effort at court reform.  All legal practitioners welcome the introduction of the District Court rules.</P>
      <P>With regard to court reform, the main problem is that the sittings of the District Court are held at times of the day that have not changed to cope with the needs of people.  The courts are there to serve the people.  In many cases up to 40 gardaí have to wait in the courts to proceed with summonses and there can be up to 80 people who have to take the morning off from work to be present on a charge of driving at 46 mph in a 30-mile zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not arrange that the District Court sit in the evening or on a Saturday to suit people generally?  At present the civil list is taken first, with those people on road traffic offences and instalment orders perhaps getting out before dinner time, or they might have to return at 2 o'clock.  Many district justices, recognising the fact that defendants arrive at the court on the day, apply the provisions of the Probation Act to them on the basis that they will have lost sufficient money already by taking a day off work whereas, had they not arrived, they might have <Col N="2621" /> been fined £10 or £15 only.  Being honourable and answering the summons, therefore, costs more.  When we talk about reform and rendering the courts more accessible to people, why then not have such cases heard on a Saturday when most people are free from work?</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the new District Court rules, which do not constitute an achievement of this Minister only. The contention that the additional provisions contained in this Bill will minimise delay in District Court procedures is fallacious because there is at present no delay in those procedures with regard to renewal of publicans' licences and examination orders.  In regard to publicans' licences, as I see the position we are giving greater power to the Revenue Commissioners which they have no right to have, and is an area in which they have no competence.  I would ask the Minister to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;must&rdquo; in section 4(2).  In the case of individual publicans not having to get a certificate of competence from the District Court, they being exempted from the provisions of the subsequent section because they are not changing the nature of their licence, which would cover 95 per cent of cases annually anyway, the Customs and Excise and the Revenue Commissioners should automatically grant that licence.</P>
    <P>The grounds on which licences are renewed have been set out in Woods' <i>District Court Guide</i> for anybody to read. The discretion being given the Revenue Commissioners under section 4(2) could in certain circumstances allow them to take into account other aspects of a publican's affairs, his character or business, which are at present totally irrelevant to the renewal of his licence.  Suppose such a publican was in arrears with income tax returns or whatever, then the Revenue Commissioners could use that as a lever for delaying the renewal of his publican's licence.  In law they have no such power at present and I contend that that subsection affords them such power. If the provisions of this Bill propose that one does not have to go to the District Court for one's certificate of competence and in the same Bill it is said that the <Col N="2622" /> Revenue Commissioners may renew one's licence, then the Revenue can take their time renewing a licence if a publican has not submitted his VAT or income tax returns.  That would be an abhorrent situation.  It should be remembered that the Revenue Commissioners have their machinery for proceeding against people in arrears of income tax and there should be no way in which they could use that fact as a lever against renewal of a publican's licence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in that it introduces the new District Court rules, but until such time as that subsection to which I referred is amended I would have to oppose it on the basis that, whatever about the intentions of the Minister, given a directive from Government or elsewhere the Revenue Commissioners would be enabled to slow down the process by which a publican's licence is renewed and do so on grounds totally irrelevant at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the introduction of this Bill, which is essentially a technical one.  One would hope that the changes in relation to the licensing laws and the applications for renewal of licences would constitute a rationalisation procedure rather than what was outlined by Deputy Cowen.  I would hope that the provisions of this Bill would short-circuit procedures while giving interested parties ample time to make their case whether by way of objection or time in which to present their case properly.  The whole purpose of the Bill in relation to the licensing laws should and must be to improve the situation, ensuring that less time is wasted with less public money spent on the duplication of administration or administrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether there is provision for all licences to be renewed simultaneously. Probably this is catered for under the provisions of the Bill.  In that respect one must concede that owners of licensed premises are responsible people, they themselves being anxious to ensure that the procedures are to the advantage of all concerned, and that includes the <Col N="2623" /> procedures with which they must comply in order to renew their licences.</P>
    <P>This Bill constitutes the first step towards the introduction of the new rules of the District Court.  While not a legal person myself, having spoken to people involved in the profession I gather there is anxiety that the new District Court rules be introduced.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The main change that would be brought about by section 1 of the Bill is that, where enforcement of a judgement debt is being sought, a single sitting of the District Court will normally suffice to settle the matter.</P>
    <P>One would hope that this would simplify and/or speed up matters in relation to problems that arise increasingly in times of recession with regard to judgement debts.  Here I would be somewhat reticent in that I would not like to see a situation develop in which it would be too simple to allow latitude to a creditor on the basis that a simplified method of obtaining a judgment debt would automatically follow.  A certain amount of responsibility falls on the debtor and the creditor in the initial stages in the sense that there is always great anxiety &mdash; I am making passing reference here only &mdash; to ensure that debts are collected once incurred.  That is acceptable and laudable. On the creation of the debt in the first place, people should be made aware that at the end of the day they will be liable.  From dealing with constituents problems I know of people who got themselves into difficulties in relation to debts and they ultimately ended up in judgments where unfortunately the person purchasing the service or the product would present a very acceptable case that he could not live without the service or the product and little regard was had to explaining to them at the time of purchase the consequence of the liability. That should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to the new scale in relation to the period of imprisonment <Col N="2624" /> that may be imposed on summary convinction in default of payment of the fine and associated costs, compensation and expenses.  Does that apply to maintenance orders?  My experience with maintenance orders normally relates to representations on behalf of deserted wives and occasionally a wife may bring her estranged husband repeatedly to court because of his defaulting on a maintenance order.  In some cases there appears to be a little doubt as to the validity of the repetition of these returns to court.</P>
    <P>Section 4(2) with regard to the application for renewal of a licence sets out very clearly the criterion under which the Revenue Commissioners will be able to operate.  If things were to proceed as Deputy Cowen suggests we would have some difficulties in relation to the operation of the section.  If a publican in a small country town were not up to date in relation to the affairs of the Revenue Commissioners, if he could not renew his licence until such time as he could regularise his affairs it could mean that he would be out of business as a result of the delay in issuing the renewed licence. Generally publicans are concerned to comply with the regulations and if they fall behind they are the first to accept their responsibilities and to try to put matters right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>One significant change proposed in the First Schedule is the amendment of the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 which will ensure that all club certificates will be renewable on a common date, in practice the date of the annual licensing District Court.</P>
    <P>Will this apply to ordinary publicans in their applications for renewal of their licences?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill which is only a first step towards doing a major job which needs to be done in relation to updating legislation dealing with the courts generally. I hope the new licensing laws which have been promised will come before the House in the not to distant future and that <Col N="2625" /> all parties will have ample opportunity to make their submissions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, like most Deputies who spoke on this Bill with the exception of my good friend and colleague, Deputy Hyland.  We are all talking about how we might reform the District Court but it seems that we might seriously consider how we might reform our activities in this House.  We have spent so much time dealing with a measure which is so technical and simple in what it seeks to do.  It is extraordinary that this House should spend nearly two full days dealing with something as simple and straightforward as this.  I would urge anybody who reads the Official Report or who has any interest in Dáil reform to keep this sort of thing in mind.  It is a great pity that something as simple as this should be drawing such fire and that we should be wasting such time on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has three provisions.  The first provision is to expedite the debt collection process.  The second is the alteration of the penalty structures bringing the existing law into line with the practical realities of the District Court.  The third is to improve the efficiency of the licensing applications for publicans at least.  In relation to improving the efficiency of the debt collection process speaker after speaker from the Opposition has made the point that this will do very little and that examination orders are dealt with in the District Courts in a matter of ten minutes. This is generally the case but there are more people than district justices involved. The staff of the District Court have to deal with every examination order application as if it were a full application. It must be recorded, it must be issued by the court, stamp duty has to be paid and the receipt of that money has to be recorded and accounted for at a later stage.  The solicitor processing the application must deal with it as one application and his staff are concerned with it also. Finally the person waiting for the debt to be repaid has to wait because at the moment most District Courts outside Dublin sit monthly or in some cases <Col N="2626" /> bimonthly and the creditor has to wait an additional month or two to begin to collect his debt because of the system.</P>
    <P>I assure Members of the Opposition or anybody else who sees no point in changing this part of our debt collection process, that it is eminently sensible, that it will do no harm, it offends nobody, it is not unfair to either creditor or debtor and it will certainly speed up our District Courts.  It will assist the District Court staff in that they will have more time in which to deal with other more pressing matters and it will leave the whole system more efficient.  I welcome this provision without reservation.  As somebody with some limited experience in the area I do not believe that a single solicitor would not welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with fines does not require any discussion.  The law being changed is antiquated and the proposals simply bring into line the ordinary practice of district justices and the fines being imposed in the District Court in debt collection default cases.  As a matter of tidying up the law it is a good idea and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the applications for publicans licences, I am surprised at the level of intrigue and excitement that this provision has engendered on the opposite side.  I must pay a special compliment to Deputy Hyland for his tremendous response to duty when it called here last week, when he spoke for a couple of hours on this Bill and dwelt at great length on the hidden purpose of section 4.  Of course, any observer of the goings on in this House, particularly at this time of the year, who heard what Deputy David Andrews said afterwards is well aware that the reason Deputy Hyland had to speak for two hours last week was that no other Fianna Fáil speakers were willing or able to speak on the measure or were around to do so.  The proceedings of this House were delayed for two hours for that reason.  The same thing happened here a couple of weeks ago with Deputy O'Kennedy on the Finance Bill.  There was one person only on the Fianna Fáil side and on this side several Deputies <Col N="2627" /> were waiting to speak last week but we could not do so.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil cannot get their act a little more together on this, or perhaps we should take Bills such as this out of the House altogether and discuss them in the committee room where nobody will notice whether Fianna Fáil Deputies are present.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil to stop abusing the Second Stage arrangement that we have in this House.  It was not fair even to Deputy Hyland who performed extremely well by reading sections in detail to the House and imagining and prognosticating what intrigue or mischief the Government might be up to in what is effectively a very simple provision in this Bill.  My sympathies go to Deputy Hyland for being put in that position.  It is not fair to a Deputy to ask him to go into the House and waste the time of the House on his own time for two hours engaging in that type of exercise.  The only reason we had that performance last week was that Deputy Hyland was instructed to come into the House and speak.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether Fianna Fáil are opposing this Bill.  Last week Deputy Hyland in one paragraph would give the impression that they were opposing it tooth and nail and in another paragraph would give the impression that it was probably sensible enough in certain ways. One point that has emerged from contributions from the other side of the House was referred to by Deputy Hyland and later by Deputy Cowen.  It is section 4(2) where in the instance of the publican's certification being removed from the District Court procedures, the Revenue Commissioners would now not require this certificate and would have the right to issue licences to applicant publicans without the certificate of the court.  There is concern that, because section 4 (2) provides that the Revenue Commissioners, may, subject to other sections of the Act, grant a renewal of a licence for premises which have been licensed in the immediately preceding year, the Revenue Commissioners may have a discretion which they do not now have.  As I <Col N="2628" /> understand it, the proposal from members of the Opposition is that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be taken out and the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; be inserted in its place.</P>
    <P>On my reading of the Bill as drafted it is simply an enabling section.  At the moment it is the Revenue Commissioners who issue the intoxicating liquor licence to the publican in any event, and at the moment the Revenue Commissioners have not the power to issue such a licence unless they get the appropriate certificate from the District Court.  This provision is simply allowing the Revenue Commissioners to issue an intoxicating liquor licence to a publican notwithstanding the fact that a certificate from the District Court is not produced.  On my understanding of the English language the proper word to be used in these circumstances is &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather then &ldquo;will&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; implies simply that the Revenue Commissioners in the past did not have the power to issue a licence without production of a certificate from the District Court.  Now because of this law they may so do.</P>
    <P>The section as proposed by Fianna Fáil would read: &ldquo;An officer of the Revenue Commissioners empowered to grant a renewal of a licence for premises which have been licensed in the immediately preceding year will grant such a renewal.&rdquo;  If that provision were in, for example would the Revenue Commissioners be obliged to issue an intoxicating liquor licence to somebody who refused to pay the cost of the licence?  At the moment there is a charge.  I do not know what it is but let us say it is £20 or £50 and that a publican writes in and refers to section 4(2) of the Bill as drafted <i>à la</i> Fianna Fáil's proposal and that there is an obligation, a compulsion on the Revenue Commissioners to grant the licence.  The publican could tell them to stuff their £50, that he was not going to give it to them this year, that the law says they must give him the licence.  I am sure the Minister will take another careful, close look at this but on my reading of it there is nothing at all to worry about in this section. The sole purpose of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4 (2) is to permit the Revenue <Col N="2629" /> Commissioners to do something that they did not have the power to do previously, and &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;will&rdquo; is the appropriate word in those circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used.  If it is used in that section as it stands then a publican would not be obliged to make the payment that he has to make to the Revenue Commissioners at the moment for the issue of a licence.  I have very little doubt about the construction of the section as proposed by Fianna Fáil.  To anybody who looks at this carefully, particularly in the context of the powers the Revenue Commissioners have at the moment, the point I am making will be seen to be correct.  I am absolutely satisfied that there is no mischief or intrigue behind this section and I am quite convinced that when the Minister replies to the debate he will be willing to look at it very carefully.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies made the point that when they viewed the District Court in action they were astonished at the number of gardaí within the district court whose time seems to be wasted.  I have considerable sympathy for that point of view.  We could be engaged in a good deal more reform of the District Court. Let me give a couple of examples.  Most of the cases that the Garda are directly involved in in the District Court are what I would call trifling traffic summonses and petty crime.  In most road traffic offences, for example people driving without tax or with bald tyres or without proper lights or indicators, it is ludicrous that they should be served with a summons, should have to go into the District Court and go through this process that must cost the State a couple of hundred pounds per summons I suppose, and at the end of the day &mdash; I have seen this in people whom I have represented in court &mdash; they go out and get into the same car that had the same bald tyres or is still missing the indicator light and nothing has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fine imposed for such trifling things might be £10.  The cost to the State in <Col N="2630" /> processing the whole case might be a couple of hundred pounds or a good deal more if it comes to the time of gardaí and everybody involved in it.  Surely the purpose of all of these sanctions and sections in the Road Traffic Acts is not to charge somebody £10 if that person has a broken tail light but rather to ensure that if a tail light is broken it is fixed.  If somebody is caught with a broken tail light or a bald tyre or whatever, the car should be produced a week later at a Garda station with whatever defect it has cured.  Charge £10, have a nominal fine that is collectable on the spot, and if the person fails to produce the car in proper condition, then by all means prosecute that person.  At the moment the system is crazy.  I have suggested this previously in both this House and the Seanad and it has never been taken up.  I cannot understand why so much time must be wasted in the District Court on such petty things as broken tail lights, bald tyres and the like.</P>
    <P>I believe I am totally within the competence of this Bill in talking about a hobby horse of mine in relation to reform of the District Court.  I listened this morning on the radio to somebody whose name escapes me and who is representing the insurance industry in this country at the moment.  He complained that district justices, notwithstanding the fact that they now have the right to fine up to £1,000 for no insurance, are still fining only between £50 and £100 for the offence. Sometimes demands are made of the courts, of the judicial system or legislators that are silly and impossible to deliver on.  I have tried to make this point. We seem to be of the view that if somebody is to be fined £1,000 there will be no problem; every district justice in every case he meets will fine persons £1,000. Many of the people who come before the District Court on no insurance charges are there because they did not have the money to pay £1,000 for their insurance. That is what young people are required to pay.</P>
    <P>District justices do not impose a fine of £1,000 on a person who is unemployed, or somebody with a job that puts him in <Col N="2631" /> a low income category.  There is no point in fining somebody earning £100 or £120 a week £1,000.  They have not got the money.  If they have not got the money, they must go to jail to discharge their debt to society.  We know the problems we have in jails already.  People in the insurance industry should think very carefully before they place these demands on our courts system.  District justices have to deal with the realities of the cases presented to them.  By and large they do a very good job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen speaks from time to time about the legal profession.  He expressed surprise about his visit to the District Court.  He went there as a prosecution witness.  As a man who takes such a close interest in the legal profession he should attend courts regularly to see what happens there.  If he did he would not be surprised when he went to court under the obligation of a summons to give evidence for the prosecution.  We who come in here and make pithy and worthy contributions on Bills like this have an obligation to look at the operations of our District Court.  The reason we do not go there is that there are precious few votes in the District Court.</P>
    <P>For donkeys' years we were quite happy to let the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court trundle along in their own way without giving a whit or a damn about whether the system we imposed on them was operating properly. We imposed the system.  We pass the legislation which determines how our court system is to run.  Deputies complain about delays in our court system.  The reason for those delays is the legislation we have imposed on the courts and the manner in which we have insisted the courts should be run.  We have been waiting for years for the District Court rules, which this legislation provides for.  The legal profession have been shouting for years for that, but there are no votes in it.</P>
    <P>Much reform is necessary.  Reforms could be introduced which would be most desirable.  There is not a will to bring about those reforms.  We could reform <Col N="2632" /> our own manner of operating here and divide the House into a committee system related to Departments.  A committee of the House concerned with the activities of the Department of Justice could even occasionally look at the operations of the court system.  We should think a little more clearly about the needs of the District Court and other courts.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years a great deal has been done to speed up delays in other courts.  There was never a major problem of delays in the District Court. Delays in the Circuit Court and the High Court are being tackled.  I want to compliment all those responsible.  We have passed legislation from time to time relating to family law matters and other matters in which we have imposed extra duties on the District Court.  Deputy Allen went into the District Court in Cork and was very distressed at the lack of comfort in his surroundings, and the fact that people did not tell him when he would be called, that everything would be all right, holding his hand, and so on. He was a State witness in a prosecution in the District Court in Cork.</P>
    <P>Think of the position of spouses with family difficulties and matrimonial differences hanging around outside the court waiting for their case to be called.  Some of these cases are dealt with in a little room off the court which is used perhaps once a month and is draughty and damp. Sometimes they are dealt with in the ordinary chamber of the court just before lunch, or before the court starts in the morning.  We provided in legislation that all these cases should be heard <i>in camera.</i> We had some vision that the couples involved would never be seen by members of the community and the fact that they were having marital differences and family difficulties would not be displayed to the whole local community.  Our views about that are completely wrong.</P>
    <P>In some courts I practise in the District Court clerk comes out at 10.30 a.m. and calls Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So who have to parade through the open court to go into the little room off the court to have their difficulties sorted out.  Everybody is well aware of what is happening.  They <Col N="2633" /> had to wait outside without proper facilities. The absence of those facilities means that, whatever little hope there might be of reconciling differences, there is nothing conductive to an atmosphere in which parties can talk out their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of the Seanad in 1977 I have not come across any Deputy or any Senator who was not in favour of a family court.  This shows that we are very caring and socially concerned, but no Government have ever taken the step required to introduce a proper system of family courts.</P>

The facilities are not there for those cases to be handled.  I regret that frequently district justices have to deal with these cases, although I have to pay tribute to many district justices who go to great lengths to provide facilities which the State does not provide, and to provide concern where the State seems to provide very little concern.</P>
      <P>We have paid lip service to that over the years on all sides of the House.  Little of substance has ever been done and the reason is that there are no votes in it.  We do not give two hoots about it for that reason.  I will not be in the next Dáil but I predict that for the remainder of this Dáil and all of the next Dáil any time the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; is mentioned, caring voices will come from all sides of the House: &ldquo;I Deputy So-and-So or I Senator So-and-So want to see a family court provided&rdquo;.

      <P>I will not engage in that sort of thing.  I listened to Deputy Hyland making this point.  I made it myself before.  Too much old party bickering goes on in this place.  It is all cod.  I will not go further than that.  If the will were there, the change would have been made. Fianna Fáil had very little difficulty in changing their mind about the local services charges when they went out canvassing. It took them a couple of years to get around to it.  There is real political will in action.  I know Deputy Hyland and Deputy Cowan are socially concerned. If we were serious we would go to our parliamentary parties and push it.  I am tired of listening to nice words in debates.</P>
      <P>I want to change tack.  Deputy Hyland and Deputy Allen referred to the legal mumbo-jumbo lawyers love to engage in. That is absolutely the case.  The legal profession did not father the legal mumbo-jumbo.  The legislators are the true fathers of legal mumbo-jumbo.  If we look at much of our legislation we can see quite clearly why and how the lawyers use it.  I am sure parliamentary draftsmen are in short supply, like everybody else in a specialised scene.  From inquiring about delays in different areas of legislation coming before the House, I know that people who are charged with this task are overburdened with the amount of work they have to do.  A lot of our legislation is badly drafted and is doing more than we imagine for the legal profession in trying to interpret what the legislature meant.  Perhaps we could concern outselves more often with reviewing legislation and updating and bringing the language up to date, making it more sane, sensible and regularly understandable to the ordinary members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made that the District Court is far removed from society. That is a popular view.  It could be said that the Circuit Court is further removed from society and the High Court is still <Col N="2635" /> further removed from society.  That is perhaps an unfair view in relation to the District Court.  I am not defending the legal profession, the Garda, District Court justices or District Court clerks. This fact has been borne out by journalists who have taken trouble to spend time in the District Courts.  For a long time <i>The Irish Times</i> published a daily article on the goings on in the District Court.  If Deputies honestly believe that the District Court is removed from society I believe there is a real danger that those Deputies are removed from society.  All of the horrors and all of the difficulties we see in society, particularly in difficult times, are reflected on a daily basis in the District Court.  I believe Deputies could do a lot worse with their time than to spend an hour in any District Court in Dublin or in their various constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I see it as a minimal reform in a couple of areas which need to be tackled.  In the context of the enforcement of debts, the provisions contained in the Bill are translating into statute what has been happening in practice for some time in the District Court.  It is welcome so far as it makes the enforcement of debts easier and requires fewer court applications to be made.  I feel that in dealing with that issue, as we do in relation to other issues, we are tinkering with problems and are not really coming to terms with the basic structural problems relating to our court system and, in particular, in relation to the type of problems that come before the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe anybody could have any valid objection to the reforms provided for in this Bill relating to the examination of a debtor in relation to his means and the amendments made to the Enforcement of Court Orders Act.  We are in fact tinkering with a system which takes considerable time in operation and does not necessarily meet modern needs. To take up the line that my colleague, Deputy Molony, was developing, whenever elections are about to take place <Col N="2636" /> there are two reforms in the context of courts, particularly the District Court, that everybody is massively in favour of. One is the provision of family courts &mdash; I will come back to them in a moment &mdash; which Deputy Molony and other Deputies referred to and the other is the provision of small claims courts to deal with the non-payment of small debts or where consumers have problems in relation to purchases valued £50 or £100 and seek to enforce their rights against shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>We lack a traditional tribunal system which enables people to litigate their problems where necessary, resolve them by a judicial official making a decision between two contesting parties in a way which does not incur a great deal of expense and in a way which takes the minimum of time.  My view is that the whole area of small debts should be taken out entirely from District Court jurisdiction, and we should provide small claims courts like those that have been provided in other countries and have been successfully provided in a number of states in the United States.  The reason always given for not doing this is that, if we provide a small claims tribunal or a small claims court, it will be massively expensive and increase public expenditure over and beyond what it currently is, particularly in relation to the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>That is a fallacious argument because nobody knows how wasteful the current court structure is.  District Courts are overburdened with increasing work and, in many cases, archaic procedures which give rise not merely to expenditure in the context of public expenditure but which frequently give rise to unnecessary expenditure by having to employ lawyers to make simple court applications.  The person who brings any civil action in the District Court for the enforcement of a debt or proceedings in relation to consumer goods without being represented by a lawyer is at a distinct disadvantage and is extremely unlikely to succeed.  We need to look at a way of minimising the financial impact not merely on public expenditure but on the individuals concerned who need some judicial figure to <Col N="2637" /> resolve simple disputes relating to small debts.  We do not have that, I can recall Government and Opposition election manifestoes going back to 1977 talking about small claims courts.  Everybody repeated it again in 1981.  We did not have time to repeat it in February 1982, but we certainly got round to it in November 1982.  These are fine sounding things at election time but they are never really translated into reality in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony made the point, which is worth repeating, that the legal profession deserve to be criticised for all sorts of reasons on occasion, but a portion of the criticism directed at the legal profession is the fault of this House.  It is the fault of politicians and legislators, who are unwilling to reform laws and legal structures, and then they blame the lawyers who have to administer those structures for the faults contained in them.  I am saying that as someone who has been fairly critical over the years of certain aspects of the legal profession, albeit I am a member of that profession.  Nevertheless, they provide great targets for Members of this House to throw missiles at.  If Members of this House got on with reforming basic legal structures, court systems and updating legislation they would alleviate many of the current problems that relate to the administration of justice.  In the context of the enforcement of debts procedures at the moment, the whole procedure whereby the sheriff can distrain goods, the whole operation of the city and county sheriff in various parts of the country needs to be examined. That system is not working and usually it does not recoup money due to people on foot of court judgments.  Serious questions must be asked as to whether it is worth retaining at all.</P>
    <P>I always fail to understand why when we discover ways of resolving problems in one area we do not try to translate them into another.  In the context of talking about judgments in relation to small sums of money obtained in the District Court that are not paid and where there is difficulty in enforcement, I have always found it curious that we cannot provide for a system of attachment of earnings <Col N="2638" /> to require people to comply with court judgments in the same way that we provide a system of attachment of earnings in the family law area.  Take the case of a person who has a judgment registered against him or her for £100, £150 or £200. There are elaborate proceedings provided for applications to be made for examination of the debtor's means and for the courts to make an instalment order.  Possibly that instalment order is not paid and the only thing that can then be done then is to make an application to have that person imprisoned.  Instead of that could there not be a process, if somebody is in employment, for the courts to make an attachment of earnings order, in the same way they can do in relation to maintenance proceedings, to require that an employer deduct by instalments a portion of the sum due under a court judgment and pay this money directly to the courts who then pass it on to the person entitled to the money.  That would seem to me to be a relatively simple procedure which could be implemented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony talked about the District Court facilities.  It should be said that many district justices have to tolerate, in trying to administer justice, facilities that render it virtually impossible for them to perform their functions.  In sensitive areas of law, such as family law, as they operate in the District Court, the type of court facility provided creates major difficulties and greatly exacerbates the problems of the people concerned. The other problem in this area is simply not a problem of court facilities but of the inadequacy of the law as it applies in the District Court.  Perhaps the Minister would use this Bill to reform other aspects of the District Court jurisdiction that need to be dealt with and that would require relatively simple amendments.  I wish to refer in particular to the area of family law and difficulties being experienced in this area in the District Court jurisdiction on the basis presumably that such matters will continue to be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1981, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil extended the <Col N="2639" /> District Court jurisdiction in the area of family law matters.  It is ironic that Deputy Hyland should express concern about the capacity of the District Court to deal with some of these matters, though I would share some of that concern, in the light of the fact that Fianna Fáil in Government extended the court jurisdiction in this area.  There are a number of problems arising currently in this regard but there is one in particular which I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister and his Department.  This relates to the powers vested in the District Court to determine court proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, to make custody orders in relation to children and to grant access orders in respect of children.</P>
    <P>If I am wrong the Minister may correct me at a later stage but it appears to me that if the District Court makes a custody order or an access order or any other order under the Guardianship of Infants Act and that if the husband and wife in respect of whom the proceedings are heard or either of them fails to comply with the order there is no means within the District Court of enforcing the order. In my legal experience I have not had occasion to bring applications of this kind but such cases do arise.  The situation is different in either the Circuit Court or the High Court because if orders made by either of those courts are not complied with the mechanism of contempt of court may be invoked.  Apparently that mechanism cannot be applied in the District Court, so if that represents a lacuna in the system I urge the Minister to give it consideration so that an appropriate amendment could be made to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal also with another issue to which I shall be devoting much more time later during the debate on the children legislation which will be before us tomorrow and presumably next week or the following week.  The District Court deals currently with a large number of court cases relating both to the care of children and to children who come into contact with the criminal law.  There are special sittings of the courts, in particular <Col N="2640" /> the Dublin Metropolitan Children's Court in which many of the child offenders are dealt with and in which also care proceedings are brought.  In dealing with care proceedings before those courts, the courts on occasion will require back-up assistance and this is provided by the various health boards and sometimes by the court welfare service.</P>
    <P>It may not be appropriate to explore this matter on this Bill but I am asking the Minister to consider legislation to amend and expand the powers of the probation service, to turn it into a statutory welfare service as opposed to simply calling it a welfare service.  It is really a probation service.  I have made this request on every occasion on which the opportunity has presented itself since I spoke here first in 1981.  The probation service should provide background reports to the courts dealing both with cases of children and of family law.  In many family law cases district justices rely on the probation service for the provision of back-up reports or for some assistance from social workers in dealing with couples experiencing marital difficulties. Very often family law cases are adjourned to allow for the provision of such reports.  The problem is that the probation and welfare service has no statutory responsibility in this area.  It is extraordinary that this service has provided a service to the courts on and off and I emphasise, &ldquo;on and off&rdquo; because on occasions the service is so stretched as to be incapable of providing the type of service reqired or can only provide it unevenly.  The service is not available in all district courts throughout the country. It is provided occasionally in some of them and more regularly in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Regularly we voice our theoretical compassion and concern in respect of these areas of law but with about 2,000 family law cases being dealt with eachyear in our District Court system, it is extraordinary that we do not provide the basic back-up service to district justices to enable them to obtain welfare reports in respect of children who are the subject of custody disputes, or that there is the inability to obtain welfare and social work <Col N="2641" /> reports in respect of couples who are experiencing marital difficulties and who seek the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>In the criminal area the probation service would have formal statutory involvement. It is time we stopped talking about these matters and did something to rectify them.  In the context of family law as such, there is one very simple amendment I would ask the Minister to bring before the House.  This is the first Courts Bill to be before the House since 1981. The Act passed then increased the financial jurisdiction of the District Court in respect of family law cases from £50 to £100 per week in respect of the maintenance of a spouse and from £15 to £30 per week in respect of a child.</P>
    <P>Money has devalued greatly in the meantime and I presume we will not have another courts Bills for some time. Therefore, would it not make a great deal of sense at this point to extend the financial powers of the District Court in relation to maintenance orders?  In order to avoid the financial limits of maintenance orders being eroded too quickly, I suggest that the courts be empowered to order maintenance of anything up to £200 per week for the support of a spouse and up to £75 or £100 per week in respect of a child.  In many instances orders of that nature would not be made because the necessary financial means would not be available to the paying spouse.  We should not force people into the Circuit Court to get maintenance orders.  For example, wives may require £120 a week for support and if they want to get something beyond the District Court maximum they must to into the Circuit Court.  There may be difficulty getting access to circuit courts outside of city areas.  It could be once every four or five months that one would have the possibility of getting into those courts to make an application.  It is a more expensive exercise than going into the District Court.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to amend the financial jurisdiction to deal with maintenance orders for spouses, maintenance orders for children and affiliation orders.  The maximum order an unmarried mother can get from the father of the child for <Col N="2642" /> its support is £30 a week in the District Court.  Some weeks ago a colleague of mine asked if unmarried mothers could get affiliation payments or have the fathers of their children contribute towards their support.  It seemed that my colleague and the Minister answering the question were oblivious of the fact that since 1931 the District Court has had jurisdiction to make affiliation orders but the maximum amount an unmarried mother can obtain at present is £30 a week in the District Court.  In the Circuit Court there is no financial limitation but, for the sake of minimising the legal expenses and for the sake of speed in getting into court the District Court jurisdiction should be extended and people should not be forced to go into the Circuit Court.  I see no reason why the financial limit should not be increased.  It is four years since it was increased and it would make sense to deal with it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the need to change the structures and to revitalise the legal system.  They are all fine-sounding phrases but we never seem to get down to the specifics of what we are talking about.  Deputy Molony paid tribute to the work done by district justices.  Anyone who observes what takes place in the District Court can only marvel at the diversity of legal problems that a justice might have to deal with on any one day stretching from family law cases to criminal law cases, to consumer law cases, to rental disputes.  There is a whole panoply of law that comes before the District Court and more law cases come before them than before any other division of our court system.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the system functions at all because, with the best will in the world, no lawyer in practice can be an expert in all areas of law.  The vast majority of District Court justices were solicitors before they became justices.  An increasing number of solicitors are specialising in particular areas of law and may be expert in labour law or family law or conveyancing law but there are few solicitors who would acknowledge that they have legal expertise in all areas of law.  Despite that, what happens in the <Col N="2643" /> context of appointments to the District Court?  Since the foundation of the State the practice has been that if a vacancy occurs an appointment is made by the person who is being appointed being told one day: &ldquo;You are being made a district justice&rdquo; and the following morning that person can be required to go anywhere from Skibbereen to Dundalk, to Dublin, to Tralee, and sit in a district court.  The morning after an appointment a solicitor who might have had nothing but a conveyancing practice suddenly finds he is elevated to the position of district justice and has to sit on a bench in a district court in some far flung corner of the country and adjudicate in all areas of law which he or she may never have practised in as a solicitor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It might happen to the Deputy yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>God forbid.  In that context, it is extraordinary that the system functions at all.  In an increasingly complex society where degrees of expertise and speciality are necessary, we should not appoint district justices in this way. On the continent where there is a different type of judicial system, before someone becomes a magistrate or examining or investigating magistrate within the lower court structures, there is specific training which they have to go through.  In some countries practising lawyers do not become judges in that way but must go through third level education and at the end of that qualify as a magistrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to re-examine the criteria applicable in appointing members of the Judiciary and look seriously at the need for some form of basic training for those lawyers who find themselves elevated to district court justice or member of any other court.  Someone who is an expert in conveyancing law or criminal law does not necessarily make a good district justice to adjudicate on family law problems.  A person who is an expert on family law cannot necessarily turn into a good district justice to cope with criminal <Col N="2644" /> law.  The time has come to recognise that. This is a particular problem for example, in the area of family law.  There are many justices who deal with family law problems with a great deal of sensitivity, understanding and compassion and who not only know the law but apply basic common sense in adjudicating on problems. There are others who have no insight into how to deal with cases of this nature and very often exacerbate the family conflict by the manner in which they deal with the cases which come before them and by the decisions they deliver.</P>
    <P>It is not popular for a practising lawyer to make a comment like that.  One of the problems we have in the House is that those who are not lawyers are unaware of the problems and the lawyers do not want to speak about them in case it is taken badly by some members of the Judiciary before whom they may appear some day.  There is a problem in the District Court system as to how family law is dealt with and administered.  In some courts it is dealt with very expertly and well and in other courts it is appalling. That is added to by the facilities available in district courts around the country.  In some district courts, consultation rooms have been made available and the buildings have been modernised. Other district courts can best be described as Dickensian.  The conditions which married couples, the unfortunate victims of a broken marriage, have to tolerate can accurately be described as degrading and humiliating.</P>
    <P>I wish Members of the House who talk about law reform, social reform, the Judiciary or the legal system would go into the courts and see how they operate. It is surprising that Deputy Allen had his first experience of a court only a few weeks ago having regard to all the comments he has made about it.  I would love Deputies to visit the Circuit Court in Dublin on a Monday morning when family law cases come before it.  They would see the manner in which we treat family life and marital problems.  They could see in one morning something like 36 different married couples with family <Col N="2645" /> law disputes coming before the Circuit Court, all of them having to hang around in a draughty hall with their lawyers and with no possibility of any privacy in consultation rooms, with criminal cases being heard in adjacent courts, with gardaí pulling people in and out of the hallway in handcuffs and court criers calling out at the top of their voices the names of the poor unfortunate individuals who will next have a case determined in that court.  I believe that if people saw what was happening in those courts they would be outraged, but of course the only people affected are those unfortunates caught up in the heartache and distress of a broken marriage.  They are anxious to solve their problems and they have no time to politically agitate for change.  We should be dealing with that area and it is a classical example of how badly we deal with that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony and other Members referred to the question of family courts. In asking that there should be amendments made to the Bill to deal with an updating of the financial limits in the District Court to deal with family matters, I am doing so because I presume that the District Court will be dealing with these matters for many years to come, certainly for the next couple of years at any rate.  I repeat the plea made in the House to make political decisions to provide a family court structure to deal with family law problems.  Like Deputy Molony, I have no tolerance for people seeking newspaper headlines by promising that they will examine the need for family court structures.  On appropriate occasions, at the right public meeting, politicians are inclined to confirm, hand over heart, that of course they recognise the need for change and for family courts and that things must be done differently. This is seen by some Members and the public as irrelevant political waffle, because if we are serious about change and implementing reform there is a very simple remedy.  We merely have to introduce legislation here &mdash; and on this issue we do not need any more reports.</P>
    <P>We have had the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown and <Col N="2646" /> others from a whole series of voluntary agencies about the need to change the court structure in this area.  It has been clearly spelt out that having the District Court, Circuit Court and High Court dealing with family cases in an overlapping and sometimes contradictory court structure is not merely wasteful but, due to the absence of specialist knowledge in areas of family law and the lack of facilities, can create major additional traumas during a very difficult phase in people's lives when their marriages are collapsing.  I do not understand why there is a lack of political will to introduce legislation to tackle this problem.  The usual response from Governments in the past is that they cannot do anything because of the cost involved.  I have no doubt that if somebody did research into the current system, its operation and how different types of family law problems end up being dealt with in different parts of the judicial hierarchy, whether the District, Circuit or High courts, it would be discovered that the current system is massively financially wasteful and not only exacerbates problems but deals with them in an extraordinarily inefficient and inappropriate way.</P>
    <P>I suspect, if we provided a unified system of family courts, that in the long term it would save money; but, even if that was the only reason, it could still be justified.  However, there are more basic reasons for dealing with matters in this way.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Bill is before the House.  It is not a major but a minor law reforming measure which could provide the vehicle to deal with some of the matters I raised.  But it cannot be instrumental in providing small claims courts or family courts.  However, I hope that in the not too distant future, especially in the area of family courts, we will move away from the waffle and political rhetoric and get down to providing a decent and proper family court structure, with judges fully and properly trained and relevant back-up welfare and support services to provide a more humane, efficient and sensitive court system to deal with family problems, which is something we <Col N="2647" /> do not have at present.  In the short term I hope that steps can be taken to remedy the structural problems in some of our courts which result in many people, especially in the area of family law, having to suffer Dickensian facilities which shame this House, because they are a clear indication of the lack of real concern beyond the rhetoric to provide the type of facilities which are so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter very correctly pointed out that the measure before us is relatively minor legislation, a tidying up which affects a few matters, basically in regard to debts that are due and changes in the methods of hearing those cases, changes in regard to conviction or payment of fines, changes in regard to intoxicating liquor laws and changes in criminal procedure.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have attended many sittings of the District Court and one of the most unsatisfactory things about it is that one does not know when one's case is to be heard.  There may be anything from 50 to 200 cases to be heard in the day and the local superintendent, inspector sergeant and in a number of gardaí are all gathered in the courthouse without the faintest idea whether the case in which they are involved will be heard. They do not even know if the family law cases will be held <i>in camera.</i> They do not know which case will come first, a case concerning a boundary fence or a civil matter in relation to a debt collection. Cases could also relate to the renewal of an intoxicating liquor licence or a bingo licence.  Solicitors and witnesses are there at considerable expense.  It should be possible to ensure, at least three days before the court is due to sit, that the solicitors and the Garda in the area should know exactly what way the court will operate that day and in what order the cases will be heard.  There should be a list which the district justice can follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Circuit and High Courts lists are published setting out the order in which cases will be heard.  This means that people know approximately when their <Col N="2648" /> cases will be heard.  This would be a simple improvement to make.  I am sure it would not change the administrative system of the District Courts if introduced. It could be done by circulating solicitors practising in the area or by publishing in the Four Courts the lists of cases to be heard in rotation a few days ahead.  This would be much fairer to the Garda Síochána because the superintendent and the station sergeant would know with a certain degree of accuracy which garda will be required to attend the court on a particular day.  That is the way matters are ordered in the Circuit and High Courts and it should be possible to do it in the District Courts as well.  My only reservation about displaying the lists in the Four Courts would be in the area of family law and cases where young people are involved, because it would be wrong to have these names published.  A procedure could be adopted where the people concerned would be notified of when their cases were likely to be heard.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why say, in the Bridewell, at Court No. 1,200 people attend for their case to be heard at 10.30 a.m. on a Monday.  I cannot understand why everbody should arrive at any court in any town at the same time to have their cases heard.  Admittedly, there has been a little improvement in Dublin because some cases are listed for 10.30 a.m. and others for 2.30 p.m.  As I know from experience, the position is most unsatisfactory and we should try to streamline the system.</P>
    <P>I have been in courthouses which were filled with heavy smoke because a boiler was not working properly, where the rooms were cold and draughty and it was impossible for anybody to understand what was happening in the courtroom. Cases are heard in bingo halls, dance halls and even in hotel bars.  It is not right that cases should be heard in such unsuitable places.  In my view the local authorities should consult with the Department of Justice and the Office of Public Works when libraries are being built and courthouses should be attached to the public libraries.  This would mean a great saving for the Department and <Col N="2649" /> the local authorities.  When these buildings are being provided there does not seem to be any consultation between the interested parties.  I strongly recommend that the Department of Justice take the initiative and have urgent discussions with local authorities and other interested bodies about the provision of courthouses. It is unfair and improper to allow cases to be heard in unsatisfactory centres. Again I ask that this be looked at urgently.</P>
    <P>I have seen many family law cases &mdash; husbands and wives separating, the wife looking for a barring order against her husband or perhaps the custody of children is involved.  It is very distressing to see many of these cases being discussed in hotel lobbies, in draughty corridors or in derelict courthouses.  When decisions on a family or custody of children are being taken by district justices it is important that the proper atmosphere should prevail to enable them to make the right decision.  The courthouses should also be such that the advocates for the parties concerned should be in a position to make reasonable, fair and proper cases for their clients.  At present that is not possible.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal very briefly with the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  I am pleased to see the inclusion of section 4.  It has been a ludicrous and unnecessary practice for all these cases to be called out annually in court.  There was one famous case concerning a person who had been refused a pint of Guinness in a particular part of a bar and who opposed renewal of the licence in the District Court some time later.  I gather that there was serious concern on the part of the proprietors. This amendment will mean that that situation cannot arise because notice must be furnished beforehand.</P>
    <P>All these Intoxicating Liqour Acts need to be codified into one Act.  The present situation is not satisfactory.  A person of any age can buy a large quantity of wine in a licensed supermarket.  It is wrong that there should be such a loophole.  The Vintners' Association are concerned about this situation.  This is a serious matter and it is necessary to bring <Col N="2650" /> in an amendment to prevent this continuing. I have been informed that quite a number of youths are going into licensed supermarkets and purchasing unlimited quantities of wine.  If a publican were knowingly to sell intoxicating liquor to person under age he would be prosecuted, and quite rightly.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter which has caused me some concern for some time. I want to draw the attention of the House to this important matter.</P>

      <P>Looking through the Courts Bill and the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it, I want to make reference to section 2, which proposes new lower limits on the period of imprisonment which may be imposed on the summary conviction for failure to pay fines, together with any associated compensation costs or expenses awarded.  I am one of those Members of the House who have a serious question mark to place over the propriety of people being imprisoned in this way for this type of civil offence.</P>
      <P>I had occasion recently to visit Cork prison and saw a prisoner who had defaulted on a loan to a finance house. He was imprisoned in a multi-occupied cell, sharing that accommodation with hardened criminals, some imprisoned for violent crimes.  This man was in prison because he was not in a position to make repayments to this finance company.  I do not believe the State should have to act as guarantor for banking institutions.  As one Deputy put it &ldquo;They want your soul wrapped up in a box for a grant&rdquo;.  If they have that kind of security I do not see why the State should imprison people who cannot make repayments.  Two weeks ago a man in Cork prison was sharing accomomodation with hardened criminals.  I recommend to the Minister to look again at the whole question of the State acting as a guarantor in cases like this.  This is particularly appropriate when we consider that the banks and finance houses are falling over themselves to give money to poor individuals, some of whom can barely sign their names, at exorbitant interest rates, and then when the people cannot make the repayments the bank or the finance company asks the State to put these people in jail for the sake of a few hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have serious misgivings about this section.  I have serious misgivings about the State acting in this way.  It is not the <Col N="2655" /> person who owes £500,000 who is sent to jail: it is the poor person who cannot make the few pounds repayments on his television set.  He finds himself sharing a cell with others, perhaps thieves, so-called joyriders and violent criminals.  I recommend the Minister to look closely at section 2 to consider if it is the function of the State to act in this way.</P>
    <P>With regard to simplifying the procedures in the District Court, it would help greatly if the courts were allowed to hold their sessions in public, which is provided for in our Constitution.  Putting people in a room that is filthy and overcrowded and where it is impossible to hear the prosecution, the defence or any of the witnesses is not holding a case in public. Perhaps the Minister or his officials would visit some of the District Courts to see the scruffy, dirty state of premises where our district justices are expected to hand out justice.  They should see the inaudible way in which cases are conducted.  We cannot say we are discharging our responsibilities to hold cases in public when such conditions prevail.  At the moment people are brought into court, many of whom cannot read or write.  Somebody holds up their hand, says a few words and he is then taken down without knowing what has happened.  While we allow these conditions to operate we cannot ensure that people see that justice is being done. Seeing that justice is being done is as important as ensuring that justice is done. In addition to ensuring that adequate equipment is installed in the courts so that people may hear what is going on, many of the premises could do with a good wash and a coat of paint.  It is my view that many of the locations should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a passing reference to the matter of simplification of procedures in the District Court.  We spend a lot of time talking about local government and Dáil reform.  How long is it since we had court reform?</P>

      <P>Yes.  I am talking about court reform of any kind, but specifically the reform of the District Court. Would it not be a simplified procedure to appoint magistrates who are living in the communities concerned and who could be advised by lawyers?  For instance, people in Crumlin who are pestered morning, noon and night by so called joyriders and by drug pushers are the appropriate people to mete out sentences on those who are making life a hell for them.  I realise that our district justices have served the State well and I do not wish to attack them or to be unfair to or critical of them.  However, some of them do not live in areas that suffer from the problems of drugs, stolen cars, burglaries, handbag snatching and so on.  Therefore, they do not understand the effect this has on communities.  It would simplify procedures in the District Court if we were to have a magistrates system in areas such as Crumlin, Drimnagh, Kimmage or Walkinstown.  In this way we would have magistrates who live in the areas, who were advised by lawyers and who would have power to mete out sentences up to a certain level for crimes dealt with in the District Court.</P>

      <P>With regard to the application for intoxicating liquor licences and their renewal, one could have a sporting amenity in an area where the local publican objects to the granting of licence.  This is not because it is not in the interest of the public but because he is fearful there will be a bar in the premises and that will mean competition for him. When objections to such applications are being considered the bona fides of the objector should be established.  We should write into the measure that the law does not have any right to protect or uphold the share of the market for any person.  Competition is the spice of life and the Intoxicating Liquor Act should not make provision for all objectors just because they do not want competition <Col N="2657" /> on their doorstep.  We live in an open democracy.  If a competitor thinks he can provide an attractive facility, objectors should have to prove their bona fides in the matter before they go to the District Court and state their objections.  For instance, a community association would have a good case if under other proposals that have been put forward licensing laws were to be extended to 1 a.m.  I do not think there is any case for that in most of the urban areas in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing to do would be to extend the normal closing time on Sunday night and give drinking hours up to 12 o'clock.  We should forget this business about late night drinking.  In the case of intoxicating liquor licences and extensions generally, where residents' associations and community groups have a genuine worry they should be given an opportunity to voice their objections.  However, objectors should have to establish their bona fides.  Just because a person owns a public house within a mile of the premises should not entitle him to object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome any provisions that will simplify procedures in the District Court.  All courts, but particularly the District Court because people come into contact with it in their daily lives, need to be reformed. It is time we took on the reformation of the courts including the way junior and senior counsel are allocated in the higher courts and the way barristers and solicitors &mdash; having to brief barristers &mdash; are used in the District Court.  The whole area of court procedure is one that very badly needs to be overhauled and reformed. While these simplifying measures are to be welcomed there is a major undertaking to be carried out in the courts generally to ensure that they are reformed, so that when we examine areas affecting society, such as local government and Dáil reform, we do not omit the courts.  It must be remembered that the courts have not been properly reformed since the 1937 Constitution.  All of <Col N="2658" /> the courts procedure must be examined in order to ensure that the public receive the best possible service.  The Dáil and Deputies are often criticised for the hours worked.  As a Deputy who works seven days a week, from early in the morning until late at night, I can assure critics of the Dáil system that Deputies do not work an 80-day year &mdash; this nonsense that appears in the paper &mdash; for three days of the week.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that when Deputies leave this House they must work in their constituences and have much other work to do in the House whether or not the Dáil is sitting.  Can the same be said of the District Court?  I doubt if it can.  By and large when district justices finish in the courtroom they are finished.  They do not have to work in constituencies like TDs during the summer, at night time or over weekends. In this day and age one must ask if it is acceptable that the District Court should sit for the number of hours it does and the number of days in the year that it does.  It begs examination.  I suppose that district justices, like everybody else, would have the attitude that what they have they hold and lawyers in the Law Library would not want their lot upset, but it is something that warrants examination. I very much doubt if the hours kept by our district justices and our judges generally can be justified while there is a backlog of cases obtaining in many areas.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give consideration particularly to my comments on section 2.  I look forward to the introduction of a major Bill on reformation of the courts in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I said at the outset of this debate, this Bill is designed to facilitate the introduction of revised comprehensive rules for the District Court that have been in preparation for some time and whose promulgation must be preceded by the changes in the law the Bill proposes.  They are quite extensive and, as a number of Deputies have said, they have been around for some time but <Col N="2659" /> they cannot be brought into being until this small Bill is passed.  Therefore the Bill has merit in its own right, as debated by Deputies.  Because the statutory changes which are made in the legislation can be incorporated in this, and a whole lot of other changes can be made administratively, it is vitally important that we free the process so that the new rules for the District Court can be introduced. They are long overdue.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies of their contributions. Deputy Hyland was concerned at the importance of the role that is played in the operation of the District Court by the District Court clerk, that it should be acknowledged.  I am glad to do so.  I can assure the Deputy that their role is in no danger of being forgotten or overlooked. The Deputy also referred to the provisions of section 2 in relation to the payment of fines and other payments that may be ordered in connection with fines, such as costs and expenses.  He was concerned about the ability of certain persons to pay fines.  The position there is that the court already has the power to direct how and when fines shall be paid and is already required to have regard to ability to pay when fixing the amount of fines.  Since that is the case the question of imprisonment can arise only in connection with wilful refusal to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked for greater use of such sanctions as community service orders instead of fines.  A community service order may be applied as an alternative to a custodial sentence but not as an alternative to a fine.  Since the Act introducing community service orders has been scarcely two years on the Statute Book I could not engage in another debate on it even if one was to come within the ambit of this Bill.  The scheme itself is working very well and over 100 people are now engaged on community service.  It was introduced as an alternative to imprisonment.  It was deliberately decided that the courts could use it as an alternative to imprisonment only rather than an alternative to fines.  I was afraid of the situation in which the probation and welfare officers would be tied up <Col N="2660" /> supervising a whole lot of people on community work who could be dealt with quite easily through the fines or probation system, as it obtains at present, and that it would not achieve the dual objective I sought, that is, to reduce pressure on prison space and provide alternative sanctions to the courts to enable them to deal with people who came before them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland mentioned the amount of Garda time devoted to attendance in the District Court.  I can assure him that this is a matter which is already receiving careful attention and action is already in hand in that regard.  Section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, already includes one important provision relevant to that question, that is, the provision of proof by written statement.  This enables the need for oral evidence to be dispensed with in criminal proceedings in so far as it concerns matters that are not in dispute. Certainly that will reduce the amount of time the Garda have to spend in court because many of the matters about which they give evidence are not in dispute.  The same applies to engineers, when we are talking about the width of the road or whatever, and frequently also to medical evidence, which is not in dispute at all and it is simply a question of a doctor having to appear in court.  Since the implementaiton of the Criminal Justice Act, those portions of it which were brought into law on 1 March last, this can now be done.  That will meet to some degree the problem in the District Court the Deputy identified.</P>
    <P>The question of the service of summons by the Garda was raised also by more than one Deputy.  This question is having active attention.  However, the matter is one that would take us too far outside the scope of this Bill.  Obviously there is a problem of proof that a summons was actually served.  It would be important to distinguish between serious and less serious offences but we are giving that careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The administration of family law also falls outside the scope of the Bill, though many Deputies referred to it.  I might point out that the district justices are <Col N="2661" /> already free to make their own arrangements on the hearing of such cases in consultation, where appropriate, with the President of the District Court.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 4, Deputy Hyland questioned the desirability of giving the Revenue Commissioners the power to renew a liquor licence without the production of a District Court certificate in every case.  As I said in my opening remarks, the new procedure is being introduced on the recommendation of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and the District Court Rules Committee.  Experience has shown that the present system is wasteful of the time of court clerks since in the great majority of cases there is no objection to renewal. In effect, under the present system there is duplication of effort between the court clerks and the Revenue Commissioners. The considerable amount of office time which will be saved when this new streamlining provision becomes law can be put to more effective use by the District Court clerks.  So far as licensees are concerned, there will also be a saving of time since in most cases they will now be able to apply directly to the Revenue Commissioners without having to apply first to the court.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland mentioned some specific points in section 4.  He referred in particular to the wording of subsection (5), which subsection lists the circumstances in which a District Court certificate will be required, including cases where objection to renewal has been made.  Clearly there is a continuing need for a decision by the court in such cases to guard against possible abuse.  So far as the wording of the subsection is concerned, it is as recommended by the draftsman and is quite straightforward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland also referred to section 4 (2) and said that the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in that subsection was a cause of concern and suggested that the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; should be used instead.  What this subsection does is remove one of the conditions for the renewal of a liquor licence. It enables officers of the Revenue Commissioners to renew licences without the production of a District Court certificate. <Col N="2662" /> In that sense subsection (2) is merely an enabling provision and the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is accordingly appropriate. Beyond that the provision does not give a new discretion to the Revenue Commissioners so that under existing law they will be required to renew licences where the relevant conditions are fulfilled.  This includes the requirement that the duty applicable to licence renewal must be paid to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not appropriate to replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; as suggested by a number of Deputies.  I can look at it again but as far as I am concerned there is not a need to change it.  When Deputy Molony was speaking he put it rather well by saying that in effect what it is doing is saying now the Revenue Commissioners may issue a licence without a certificate from the District Court.  This gives no further discretion.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The problem about using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is that other conditions such as paying a subscription must be fulfilled.  If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; were used it might enable people to demand a licence on that basis.  I will have another look at it.  There is not an intention to introduce a more restrictive regime.  This is to introduce a less restrictive regime so that the licensee to whom there is not an objection may get his licence directly from the Revenue Commissioners rather than having to go to the courts first and then to the Revenue Commissioners with the court order.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 4, Deputy Hyland asked how the public are to be made aware of the fact that an application has been made to the Revenue Commissioners for the renewal of a liquor licence. There will not be a change from the present position.  Liquor licences are granted year after year and must be renewed at the end of September each year.  Interested parties will be aware of this and the right to object to the renewal of a licence will continue as before.  The Deputy suggested that under the Bill unless there is an application before the court in connection with the renewal of the licence there will not be a basis on which anybody can object to the renewal. This is incorrect.  I refer the Deputy to section 4 (6).</P>
      <P>In relation to the renewal of liquor licences, Deputy Hyland mentioned that the old system was more accommodating to the views of fire officers.  The amendment to the Fire Service Act, 1981, on the First Schedule ensures that the same notice of intention to renew a licence must be given to the fire authorities as under the old system.  Deputy Hyland also raised the question of the licensing laws generally and referred to some of the abuses.  The liquor licensing laws are under continuing review with a view to deciding what amendments are required to counteract abuses and any legislation necessary will be brought before the House in due course.  In relation to section 4 and the associated amendments and appeals listed in the Schedule.  I am satisfied that these provision will effect a useful improvement of procedure which will facilitate licensees, courts and clerks alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen was concerned about what he called legal jargon in the Bill. Any discussion of this question would take us far beyond what this Bill seeks to do.  Wording in a statute must be as certain as possible in regard to its meaning and it is inevitable that this involves what some people might call jargon.  The <Col N="2664" /> Deputy spoke about the amount of Garda time being spent in court and I have already referred to that.  The Deputy also raised larger questions in relation to court administration and the cost of litigation. That is a matter for another day and another place.  This Bill is aimed at clearing the way for the introduction of the new District Court rules.</P>
    <P>The same observations apply to what Deputy Andrews had to say about the scope of the Bill.  The Deputy descended upon us here late one afternoon and, if he was misled about the scope of the Bill, he misled himself because I presented this Bill as the measure that it is and in the context of it enabling me to introduce District Court rules, which are very important.  I thought that the Deputy would have appreciated that.  Nobody suggested that this was a major piece of law reform and I did not present it in such a way.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Skelly for his contribution. Deputy Skelly talked about the possibility of a further Bill that would reform procedures in the Circuit Court and the Superior Courts.  I will have a Bill to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also talked about delays in the courts which are caused largely by lack of space.  It is over 12 months ago since two new full jury courts were provided in the Four Courts.  Also the Government decided to appoint an extra Circuit Court judge and the President of the High Court says that he is allocating that judge to Cork.  Provision is also being made to appoint an extra High Court judge.  The Government have already made these decisions and they will require legislation to implement.  The Bill will be published some time next week. The lists now are cut back dramatically. Civil cases which do not require juries must wait only two or three months.  The waiting period in jury cases in Dublin, where most of the work is done, is down to 12 months.  Talking in terms of personal injury cases it would be very difficult to have a waiting period for less than nine or ten months unless one tried to evaluate the level of the injury to someone who was still in plaster.  The medical <Col N="2665" /> process must be gone through and the injured person must recuperate before one can assess the level of personal injury.</P>
    <P>For jury trials the minimum waiting period that one could achieve would be nine or ten months, and it is now down to 12 months, with the exception of cases in Cork where there is a particular problem. The fact that the President of the High Court has decided to appoint the extra Circuit Court judge to Cork and the fact that the president intends to clear the lists in Cork very rapidly next winter should be helpful there.  I would like the profession in Cork to be aware of the problem and to facilitate the courts.  In Cork there are too few practitioners taking on too much work and frequently when the court is ready the practitioners are not.  That is in hand.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested legislation and I have legislation in mind apart from the legislation which enables the Government to appoint extra judges, which will help in the pre-trial stages and will facilitate in cutting down the delays.  The Deputy also referred to where imprisonment can follow failure to pay a fine only where there is wilful refusal to pay the amount and taking into account the time and the circumstances of the person ordered to pay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen welcomed the District Court rules which will be implemented. As a member of the legal profession the Deputy knows the benefit of that.  The Deputy also referred to using the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and I have already dealt with that.  The Deputy also raised a question on section 1 (b) which amends the 1926 Act.  The issue of the examinations summons is proposed to be made by the District Court clerk and it will not require the intervention of the district justice.  The Deputy had some idea that both would be involved all the time and that there would not be any gain in the new procedures.  The changes are being made at the instigation of the District Court Rules Committee.  We are drawing on the recommendations of the District Court Rules Committee in what we are doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2666" /> Deputy Shatter asked for the introduction of an attachment of earnings to secure payment of debts instead of relying on the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts of 1926 and 1940.  I hope when resources permit, with Government approval, to bring in new legislation along those lines; but it is some way off yet because other things take priority and it would be premature to go into it in detail at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also asked for a further extension of the family law jurisdiction limits of the District Court beyond the limits set down by the 1981 Courts Act. That jurisdiction was very substantially increased by that Act and has been in operation for only three years.  As a matter of priority a re-examination of it at this stage does not arise, but it is something we must keep in mind.  We must constantly review the area of jurisdiction both of the District Court and of the Circuit Court and if an extension of the jurisdiction makes them more efficient we should be prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell raised a point about section 2 which was not to preclude from imprisonment on foot of non-payment of civil debts.  That can happen for wilful failure to pay under the Enforcement of Courts Orders Act.  Section 2 deals only with non-payment of fines and any associated levies such as cost and expenses.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies very much for their contributions.  This is useful legislation. As I said when I introduced this, it is not a major Bill in its own right but the sections in it contain soundly based, sensible provisions which are recommended by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure and the District Court Rules Committee, and we are implementing those.  The major advantage then is that we will be in a position once this is passed through both Houses finally to introduce the District Court Rules which have been going around for so long.  I understand that this is the second printing of the District Court Rules and the date on it is 1978.  While I was being belaboured by people opposite to bring in more significant legislation <Col N="2667" /> and being asked why I was bringing in such a footling Bill, it is significant because, apart from what it does itself, it clears the way to bring in the District Court Rules which are very important and long overdue.  In particular I thank Deputy Hyland who has carried a bigger burden than I have on this.  He was longer in the House and made a major contribution when the Bill was introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I had reached the stage of summarising my contribution, and I would not like to leave Second Stage of this Bill without putting on record some of the recommendations that have been made by certain professionals. The Society of Chartered Surveyors in their analysis of the Bill and <Col N="2668" /> of the rating system made some points which should be noted.  They were concerned mainly with the system as it exists and they and the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute, who I believe have written to the Minister, generally welcome the Bill.  They have made recommendations some of which are more suitable to Committee Stage and some could be taken on board by the Minister if he thinks them worthy of inclusion. The society said that they thought that the local taxation system had been criticised on numerous points but most of all as a system which had little regard to the ability of individuals to pay.  The shortcomings could be corrected by allowing for rebates, reliefs and phased payments of rates.  This seems to be a criticism, whether justified I do not know, of the staffing in the Valuation Office, which probably is an administrative problem.</P>
      <P>When last I spoke on this I was seeking some information relating to the amount of money collected for non-domestic rates so that one could assess the impact they had in a local authority area, the help they might be and the justification for them.  The societies I have mentioned seem to welcome the rating system and would favour an increase in the number of situations which would be liable for rates.  That is an answer to a question I asked.  They make a number of points in that regard, firstly that the rates as a local tax have much to commend them, secondly they are a difficult tax to avoid, thirdly they are easy to collect and they are estimated in advance.  They say that they enable a community to recoup in some small way part of the value which that community create.  That gives much food for thought.  If the community create the wealth or value, then they should get something of it back in order to embellish further the same community, except where that would be a penalty on the success of any venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the situations mentioned in the Bill any form of taxation is a penalty on any type of business that is trying to survive, particularly in a recession.  Such concerns do not welcome having to pay arbitrarily imposed, unnecessary or unjustifiable <Col N="2669" /> rates, but the point is made that expenditure on property raises its value as a base for taxation.  I am not convinced of that. An argument that a person who spends money on his property does not find easy to follow is that if you improve your property you will have to pay more rates for it.  I can understand that from a domestic rating point of view but not from an industrial point of view.  One can get satisfaction, pleasure and enjoyment from one's own property but from a commercial or industrial point of view one is doing it for the purpose of expanding the business base or because it is absolutely necessary.  Therefore, the only basis or reason for doing it is that one expects to get something back, in this case from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Domestic rates were phased out under the local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978, which also extended the rates relief for secondary schools and bona fide community halls.  The Irish Auctioners and Valuers Institute suggested that profitmaking organisations who provide sports grounds, community facilities or lands developed for sport should achieve nil rating; they should get the same relief as non-profitmaking organisations. In the submission made by the institute &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will receive a copy of it &mdash; they say that the percentage of local authority revenue from rates in 1965 was 34.  By 1981 that figure had dropped to 16 per cent.  I am not sure whether that includes domestic rates.  I should like to know that.</P>
    <P>Generally there is a welcome for the Bill.  It is felt that the legislation is outdated and that there has been a neglect of the system.  There has been a reduction in the rates assessment base.  It is suggested that existing legislation should be repealed and new consolidating legislation introduced.  One major point made is that the existing system of annual revisions has proved to be inflexible and it can take two years to effect an alteration of a rateable valuation.  The existing annual revisions, being cyclical, create tremendous pressures at one period of the year.  That is true of any annual charges falling due.  It is true also in the case <Col N="2670" /> of insurance where employer's liability or public liability insurance is falling due.  It is equally true in the case of rating.  It has been suggested that a revaluation should be carried out in an updating period, that it need not be done immediately, and that it could be done over a phased period of a number of years.  That is a constructive suggestion.</P>
    <P>Both institutes and professions seem to agree on a continuous revision and say that is an essential element of a modern rating system.  A continuous revision can go up or down depending on the state of the economy and whether or not we are in a recessionary period.  Apart from the past few years, this would have meant that for a considerable number of years the trend would have been upward.  They agree that it would provide a more fluid system for carrying out revisions.  I can see the merit in that.  If there is an arbitrary decision on a particular date and the appeals system is cumbersome, you have to wait until the next time and carry the cost in the meantime.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty in adjusting that, except that there could be considerable costs involved in creating an administrative system which would be able to cater for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record the fact that the society recommended three things.  One is the reform of the existing rating legislation to provide a modern base for the assessment of rateable valuations, that is, the current rental values. The second is the revaluation of all properties.  Probably that is a more difficult, bigger and very costly task to undertake. Everybody in the commercial field would welcome an updated and fair system of rateable valuation.  They would also like a system under which they could estimate any further costs involved from the point of view of business planning. This might affect smaller scale industrial or business ventures because of the critical nature of its costing.  The third thing that seems to be desired is a continuous revision system.  That could be to the advantage of the incumbent in the case of an appeal or a change of circumstances.  It could also be a disadvantage in a change <Col N="2671" /> of climate.  If the rating system was revalued from the date of its updating, it would be fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Skelly talked about establishing a modern base for valuation and having a fair base.  We would all like to see those as the fundamental criteria applied.  This Bill is an amendment of the Valuation Act, 1852, specifically, and other Acts going back to 1860 and in one case 1850.  Much has changed between 1852 and 1985.  It is appropriate that, when we are talking about a Valuation Bill which deals with some aspects of valuation practice, and the legislation which governs it, we should take a broad look and see if the Bill goes far enough.</P>
      <P>I doubt that I will be able to conclude all my comments in the time available to me.  Any comments I make will not be a criticism of the Commissioners of Valuation. They are charged by legislation to undertake certain tasks.  Irrespective of decisions taken by the Government, such as the decision taken some time ago to derate residential houses, the commissioners and their staff are still obliged, in the absence of amending legislation, to spend a considerable amount of time inspecting residential houses for the purpose of making valuations which now have no relevance having regard to the decision on rates taken some time ago.  It is important that legislation should be introduced to enable the commissioners to apply the resources and time of their staff effectively, as distinct from undertaking work which has no relevance at this point.  I will come back to that in greater detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told the purpose of the Bill is twofold: first, to deal with the consequence of the court decision in relation to valuation of plant and machinery and to include plant and machinery for valuation purposes of business premises and, secondly, to give legislative effect to what has been in some cases and for some time the practice of maintaining the tone of the valuation list, namely, the comparative <Col N="2672" /> valuation practice.  Those are the two main points.</P>
    <P>On the question of the valuation of plant and machinery I want to make two points.  We are dealing with a narrow base in terms of rates at this point.  As a consequence of a Government decision and as a consequence of the Supreme Court decision, only business properties are liable to rating charges.  For that reason we should ensure, in all we do in respect of those properties which are liable, that the law, which is the base on which the practices and procedures are implemented, is fair.  I should like to raise the question of whether or not it is fair in the circumstances at a time when we are said to be promoting, or trying to promote, industrial development modernisation of plant and equipment and giving some considerable grants through public expenditure for that purpose, to bring in a Bill of this nature to get around a court decision which effectively excluded plant and machinery.  If we are now going to include plant and machinery we should at least consider the effect it is having.  I have had representations from numerous business interests and from very representative groups, such as the Confederation of Irish Industry, expressing very grave concern about this Bill in that, as we all know, the overheads of Irish industry are very onerous.  We are aware of the liquidation of companies. Therefore, each new cost factor becomes a matter of major importance.  For that reason a cost factor of this nature should be very seriously weighed by the Government before they proceed with all Stages of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I know that money must come from such sources as can afford to bear it on a basis of equity.  However, I believe we have reached the point that, applying equity or the capacity to bear this tax, the business community, particularly those who have considerable plant and equipment which is for the purpose of productive activity in employment, should have this plant excluded.  Is it fair and reasonable and in the interests of economic development to include it as if it were hereditament as a permanent fixed <Col N="2673" /> physical building, ratable for valuation purposes?  I leave that for the Minister to consider, and also for the Minister for Finance, who has particular responsibility here.  I believe in fact that this is more a matter for the Minister for Finance. The Commissioners of Valuation will implement whatever decisions in respect of legislation which the Government propose, but it is a matter that the Government should reconsider before bringing it in.  I would like during Committee Stage to raise some questions about the cost involved in this and the impact it is having on manufacturing industry in particular.  I would like to ask how many of those companies who have gone into liquidation owed the money due in respect of plant and machinery or in respect of rates generally?</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make is in my view much more related to the main purpose of this Bill.  We are told in the explanatory memorandum that the Bill is:</P>
    <P>to provide statutory authority for the long established practice of fixing valuations of rateable hereditaments by reference to the valuation of similar hereditaments already valued.</P>
    <P>That may be all right as a practice but it will now be a matter of law, not practice. If it is to be introduced as a matter of law, which is binding as distinct from practice, which is something which can be changed according to procedure, it is essential that we raise some fundamental questions on what we are now being asked to introduce into our law.</P>
    <P>The first thing is in relation to the equity of it.  Let us say we have two properties, property (A) with a rental value of £20,000 on which the rateable valuation might be of the order of £200 and we have property (B) with a rental value of £10,000 of which the rateable valuation might be £100 according to the scales being applied.  In many cases what can happen is that where you have properties of different value, because of the nature of the business being conducted and because of the state of the building, and you apply the comparative base of <Col N="2674" /> valuation to two properties in the same location, let it be &ldquo;Pana&rdquo; in Cork, O'Connell Street, Dublin or Main Street, Nenagh.  If property (A) has been valued at such an amount per square foot and you now find the square footage in property (B) on the same street, are we now to give legislative effect to a position that might mean that, irrespective of the real rental value of the two properties, which is how the original Valuation Act was drawn up, irrespective of the business going on in the property and of the resale value of the property, that we now fix the rateable valuation on property (B) on the basis of what is already fixed in respect of property (A) which has already been valued?  That is a matter which in the course of practice in the Office of the Commissioners of Valuation one would hope they would allow for.  If we are going to build it into legislation the commissioners and the staff will be in a very different position.  If we have a legislative position giving effect here to providing statutory authority&mdash;this is the important thing&mdash;for the basis of fixing valuation of rateable hereditaments by reference to the valuation of similar hereditaments already valued, what in the circumstances are similar hereditaments? I know there can be a general idea of what that is, but will it affect the actual value of the property?</P>
    <P>I would like to point out some other anomalies.  There is not a great deal of evidence of rental value of business properties around this city.  We have of rateable valuation but not of real rental value.  We have a fair amount of evidence of sale valuation of pubs and hotels.  If we take a pub worth £500,000 one would expect to get a rateable valuation of £500. On a similar basis if it was worth £400,000 we would expect to get a rateable valuation of £400.  It could happen that the rateable valuation will not relate to the actual sale value or the rental value if we fix in here in permanent legislation what is called as a rule of what has been a practice.  I want to make it quite clear in all of this that one would rely on the expertise and fair play of the Commissioners of Valuation and their staff.  That <Col N="2675" /> is fine when they are allowed to be free in terms of practice.  I suggest even then that if they were adequately staffed to do the job they are best equipped to do they might be in a better position to fix the rateable valuation even before this Bill is passed.  I am very concerned that this Bill will make it a statutory obligation or will be interpreted as such.  We must be very careful about this before we give legal effect to it.</P>

      <P>I was speaking last evening about the main Government argument, namely, the risk factor involved in this project.  Of course there was some element of risk involved in a project of this nature.  The reality of international commerce is that there is fierce competition between competing countries for these kinds of projects particularly when they are of a labour-intensive nature, as admittedly this one was.  Against that background of cut-throat international competition, do the Government seriously expect to be able to bring 800 well paid and secure jobs to Limerick without incurring any risk?  If that is what they think, they are very far divorced from the real world.</P>
      <P>When the late Deputy Seán Lemass was developing this economy and industrialising it in the late fifties and early sixties, he had to take risks.  He had to offer something for what the people were to get.  The strategy worked and within a decade the industrial face of the country was transformed.  It seems that we have come a long way from the spirit of adventure and calculated intelligent risk taking of those days to today's era of penny pinching, book-keeping and paper-clip economics.  The projected operation at Annacotty was phase two of a two phase operation.  Everyone admits that phase one was the phase to which the greatest risk attached but that phase has been extremely successful and profitable.  In saying that I am relying not only on my own information but on objective publicised reports by respected commentators.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating the IDA for pursuing that project assiduously and on their success in persuading Hyster to come to Limerick but it is regrettable that that success has been marred by the practice of 17th century economics.</P>

What does the Minister take us on this side of the House for?  What does he take the people of Limerick and in particular the people of Annacotty for?  They will give him his answer on 20 June.  The Minister said that his decision copperfastened the principle that the ultimate responsibility for those projects rested with the Government of the day.  Has anybody on this side of the House, either inside or outside, ever denied that?  Not only do we not deny it but we accept it and have put it into practice.  We refused projects such as the De Lorean project when it was right to do so.  The Government have turned down the Hyster project when according to all the independent economic analysts, it was wrong to turn it down.  The Minister said also that the IDA did not know what finance would be available to them because the national plan was only being drafted at the time.  What an insult to the House and to the people.  Does that mean that regardless of what project might have come to the country at that time and no matter how good the offer or how stable or permanent the jobs involved, it could not have been taken on simply because the IDA were not aware of what finance they would have by reason of the national plan only being in the process of being drafted?  If the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism had no better argument to put across the Floor of the House, would he not have <Col N="2678" /> been better to admit that he was wrong? Had he done so the people would have more respect for the Government and for the House.  Deputy William O'Brien said that I was in some way afraid of the Minister for Justice.  I think it is a question of the Minister for Justice being afraid of me and afraid of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I have fought three elections in Limerick East with the Minister for Justice and on each occasion I not only beat him on first preferences but increased my majority over him.  On the last occasion, as anyone who checks the facts whether from <i>Magill</i> magazine or elsewhere will find, I beat the Minister by more than 2,000 first preferences and I will beat him by double that number on the next occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is very concerned about me because he sent his local handler around to various news media in Limerick to denigrate me personally and to slander me.  This was because I revealed a story to the media.  In that context I wish to congratulate the <i>Limerick Leader</i> for their fair, objective and unbiased reporting of this scandal.  The Minister for Justice sent around his local handler to undermine me because I had had the courage to reveal these facts, facts that should have been made clear to the public by the Government.  I will name the man concerned.  He is Mr. Tony Brazil, the Chairman of Limerick Tourism and the local handler of the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Government came into power there has been an antiLimerick bias in all decisions of substance taken by them.  They reneged on a commitment by the previous Government to send 800 civil servants to Limerick. The disgraceful ideological wrangling between the left wing and the right wing of the Government led to our being deprived of natural gas and now we have been deprived of 800 jobs.  When a decision had to be made between Limerick and Tralee for the establishment of the Burlington industry, Tralee won hands down, thanks to the Tánaiste.  The left wing of the Government in the form of the Tánaiste has deprived us of natural gas, while the right wing in the form of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has deprived us of 800 jobs.  Again, I must ask where our own Minister, the <Col N="2680" /> Minister for Justice, is this evening.  The political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> Mr. Joseph O'Malley, predicted in last Sunday's edition of that paper that the Taoiseach &mdash; obviously in an effort to distance the Government from the sort of decisions being made by the Minister for Finance &mdash; is prepared to shift that Minister aside in September next and to give the Finance portfolio to the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I am no admirer of the Minister for Finance but if the Taoiseach decides to replace him by the Minister for Justice and if that Minister's performance on behalf of Ireland equates with his performance on behalf of my constituency, all I can say is God help us because he is easily the most worthless and useless representative we have ever had from Limerick at Cabinet level in terms of tangible economic achievement.  I include Deputies from the Minister's party such as Deputy O'Donnell who would not have run away and tried to cloak this scandal.  However, we found out what happened and all credit is due to the <i>Limerick Leader</i> for publishing the story.  They have maintained their honourable tradition of fair and objective reporting.  Long may they continue.</P>

      <P>Clearly the Government are pursuing a policy of abandoning regional economic development.  Even before the Hyster decision up to 80 per cent of the IDA proposals sanctioned by the Government were for the greater Dublin region but the mid-western region about which we are particularly concerned this evening was always the local point of expansion under Fianna Fáil not just for its own sake but for the sake of national economic expansion having regard to the educational and other infrastructure built up there and the link between that and industrial activity.  That mid-western region as Deputy O'Dea pointed out very effectively has been decimated under this Government by factory closures, unemployment and in this instance by a Government who reneged on their obligation and agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2681" /> Looking at the Front Bench and comparing it with the Minister who is not here, the Minister who represents Limerick, it can be confidently said that the next Fianna Fáil administration, soon to come into office, will have a very strong representation from the mid-western region as has this Fianna Fáil administration as is evident from my colleagues here this evening.  That has been the way and will continue to be the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and will continue on that basis.  Unemployment has more than doubled since this Government came into office.  This is particularly so in the mid-western region and Deputies present could tell of the same experience from their part of the constituency. The truth is that not only have the Government no concern for regional economic development but they have no concern for the mid-western region in which we took great pride and invested very considerably in terms of educational and industrial infrastructure.  That is going back more than ten years and indeed has been the case in the 20 years in which I have been a Member of the Oireachtas.  The disastrous unemployment figures would have been considerably higher were it not for emigration which stands at 30,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to scrap the Hyster project undermined the credibility of the IDA.  The Government distorted the figures agreed between the IDA and Hyster to convey the impression that the <Col N="2682" /> Government funding was on a ratio of 11:1.  They then gave another figure of 14:1.  That was a distortion of the agreement entered into between the IDA and Hyster.  While in Government I and other colleagues had some experience of dealing with the IDA and it is clear that they would never have contemplated such an unacceptable package.  Of course the truth is they never did.  The State investment of £10.7 million like the Hyster investment of £10.6 million was to be made available in four instalments over a period of ten years.  That is a standard practice in the IDA and it was built into the Hyster operation.  The agreement entered into ensured that at no stage would the Government investment be forthcoming unless matched by the agreed contribution, at the same stage, by the Hyster company.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to cut the State grant by £1 million effectively repudiated the agreement already reached. The Government action in changing their decision at the last minute was unprecedented and cast a serious doubt on the authority and bona fides of the IDA in all negotiations with potential investors. Unilateral variations on agreed terms is understandably regarded as sharp practice in the commercial world, it is sharp practice in the commercial world, it is very sharp practice indeed when it is done by a Government.  When it is done by a Government in respect of a major international company of the status of Hyster the reverberations in the international business community are obviously enormous and far-reaching because the contacts which a company of that status would have with others who might be contemplating investment in Ireland will be such as to raise very serious doubts in the minds of some of their associates and potential investors in this nation.</P>
    <P>What major company would now be willing to undertake detailed and time-consuming negotiations in the knowledge that at the last minute the Government might unilaterally attempt to alter the terms of the agreement?  What company of any consequence would enter into all <Col N="2683" /> the detailed, painstaking, time-consuming procedures in the knowledge that there is a Government who at the last minute could change the proposed agreement and not only that but would try to distort what was agreed between them and the IDA, which has always been regarded as a bona fide organisation? The only precedent was the action of the De Lorean motor company in increasing their demand when the IDA proposal was already before the Government for consideration.  Not surprisingly when that unilateral action was attempted by the De Lorean company the then Fianna Fáil Government, of which a number of us present in the House were members, after full consultation with the IDA, which is essential, refused to condone any such practice and the Government withheld their approval from that project.</P>
    <P>That is different from what is happening here.  The difference is that in this case the Government are following the De Lorean practice and not that of successive Governments over the years. They tried to change the terms of the agreement at the last minute and this is sharp practice which one would not like to see from any Government.  We have paid the price and will continue to do so for a long time.  The Government have not only undermined the credibility of the IDA but the credibility of any Government in relation to agreements with international companies.  Unfortunately we have seen too many examples of that from this Government.  In abandoning the regions the Government are abandoning their own fate.  They recognise that their electoral fate is already well sealed in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I put it down to that and to lack of experience.  However, Deputy O'Dea at least recognised that there was an element of risk in the project.  That is a fair point and he is the first speaker from the Opposition to recognise it.  The so-called second phase carries with it a certain risk and there is no doubt that the stucture of the project was not without risk, possibly serious risk.</P>

      <Col N="2685" /> We have been negotiating with an international company but it should also be pointed out that it was their intention to establish an independent company to carry out their operations as proposed and there would not have been any inter-linking with the parent company.  We were looking at a stand alone operation which, if it failed, would have left the IDA without redress to the parent company.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on other points made by Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Reynolds.  It was interesting to see the Opposition quoting figures and statistics which they said were factual. Those figures gave a very distorted view of the State versus company exposure in the early years of the project.  They also gave the mistaken impression that 800 jobs would be provided in the first or early years of the project and that is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Members should listen to me as I listened to them last night.  They made a lot of noise but they did not make much sense.  There was no guarantee of profits, there never is in business and this project was not without risk.  The Government, representing the taxpayers, a group of people whom the Opposition do not seem to represent, were reluctant to put up so much State moneys against so little by the promoters. They were entitled to make that judgment on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds was inaccurate when he spoke of Hyster investment coming from bank guarantees.  There were no such guarantees and it is very misleading for a Front Bench spokesman in Opposition to make false allegations on such an important issue.  Any further cash injection or commitent to the project had to come from profits.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of jobs, the figure of around 800 being touted was the projected employment figure for the tenth year of the operation, should the project successfully run its course.  It should be clearly understood, however, that there were to be only 48 people employed after the first year, rising to 140 after three years.  This was at a time when the Government would have been exposed to spending £7 million in investment. By the sixth year there were to be about 287 jobs, a good deal fewer than the figure of 800 bandied around here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds placed great stress on comments made by the chairman of Hyster, Mr. Kilkenny.  What else did he expect Mr. Kilkenny to say?  However, the Deputy conveniently neglected to point out that Mr. Kilkenny also stated that he harboured no resentment against the IDA or the Government and that he would not hesitate to come back to do a <Col N="2687" /> deal in Ireland again.  Indeed, he would be very welcome.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 26 May 1985 he said that the Government have the right to do what they thought best and that he accepted their decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kilkenny is a most astute businessman but, just as his priority is to get the best deal with the greatest profit for his shareholders, so must the Government's priority be to get the best deal for the Irish taxpayer.  It is not inevitable that the priorities of a company and the Government can never be reconciled.  In this particular case, however, the Government considered that there was too much of a gap between what the State would have been obliged to put forward and what the company were prepared to invest in what they claimed to be a sound venture.  Each project has to be considered on its own merits.  This does not mean that the Government's industrial policy has been changed in any way.  Both the IDA and the Government have consistently maintained the highest standards of evaluation of potential industrial projets. The decision on the Hyster proposal was taken in the light of the very particular circumstances of that case.  Just as Mr. Kilkenny would not hesitate to return to do another deal, I would urge all industrialists to examine the very great potential of Ireland as a profitable industrial location.</P>
    <P>The decision not to approve particular proposals for the Hyster package was taken by the Government after very careful consideration of all the facts.  Deputy Reynolds implied, mistakenly, last night the decision on this case may not have been taken by the whole Cabinet.  I would like to set him straight in this matter.  The view shared by the whole Government was that the input from the company was so light that the Government could not be satisfied that it was worth while putting money into a project which the company could pull out of very easily without losing too much of their own money.  Lest anyone be under any misapprehension, the Government have the power under the industrial development legislation to <Col N="2688" /> permit the making of grants in excess of certain statutory grant limits imposed on the IDA.  In this regard the Cabinet was concerned that the contributions of the State and the promotor were disproportionate and that greater financial input was required from the company.  That was surely a responsible and reasonable position for a Government to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>This Government decision does not cut across the autonomy and independance of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Government have a statutory role in decisions relating to industrial projects involving heavy Exchequer investment.  This is not a rubber stamping process and decisions are taken in the light of all available information. The IDA's position is not undermined by this since the authority are fully aware of the Government's statutory powers.  The fact remains that the Government makes policy and the IDA execute that policy.  This has always been the position and the IDA fully recognise it, and did so in their statement on 17 May last on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility to attract new projects and to create new jobs in Ireland, not only in Dublin but on a regional basis, and we are not neglecting our duty in this regard.  The Government also have a wider responsibility to the taxpayer and that is to ensure that taxpayers' money is not squandered.  In all respects, this Government have lived up to their responsibilities.  We look after <Col N="2689" /> the taxpayers' money and this is a reflection of good Government, not bad Government.  The IDA likewise perform a very valuable role recognised by all in attracting and promoting Ireland as a location for investment.</P>

Between 1980 and 1984, I might add, a total of £85 million in investment was approved towards the creation of new jobs for the Limerick area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Plessey Technological Park situated approximately 2.5 miles from Limerick city centre, has all the ingredients of a successful technological park of which Limerick can feel justifiably proud. <Col N="2690" /> This park incorporates the National Institute for Higher Education &mdash; Ireland's first technological university; the Thomond College of Education; the IDA's Business Park for International Service Industry, together with a site for the location of new manufacturing industry.  The IDA's and SFADCo's regional offices, the Micro Electronics Application Centre, the Innovation Centre and the IIRS are also located there.  All of these, while I am not necessarily taking credit for them on behalf of the Government, nevertheless provide further tangible proof of the Government's continued commitment to the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>I now want to make some general comments in relation to overall policy considerations as they relate to this debate.</P>
    <P>One of the important issues highlighted in the White Paper on Industrial Policy was the need to maximise value from the State resources allotted to industrial development.  In 1983 almost £750 million was devoted directly and indirectly towards the promotion of industry.  In view of existing budgetary constraints and the overall burden of taxation, the Government consider it to be of the utmost importance to ensure that we get the best value in terms of jobs, exports and spin-off benefits from this expenditure. It is inevitable that to be effective, such consideration will impact on grant applications from certain major overseas projects where the Oireachtas has already determined that the Government have a statutory responsibility.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, indicated clearly to this House last night, the industrial development legislation specifies that in the case of all industrial projects involving payments in excess of certain statutory grant limits imposed on the IDA, Government approval is necessary. Overseas promoters are well aware of this, and I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy is also aware of it.</P>
    <P>The White Paper and the national plan strongly reaffirm that there will be no alteration in our attractive promotion and incentive package for overseas companies. From now on, however, the emphasis will be on higher grants for <Col N="2691" /> projects which embody the key business functions and lower grants for less attractive projects.  But, in all cases, there must be a reasonable balance between the promoters' capital and IDA fixed asset grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And we will make sure that continues to be the case.  Such a balance is necessary to ensure not only that the venture has an adequate equity base, but that the promoter has a substantial stake in the enterprise and therefore will be concerned for its success and that the State's exposure in the event of failure is limited.</P>
      <P>The fact the Ireland is a profitable location for overseas investment is a major element of the IDA's promotion programme.  If this were not generally the case we would not attract these companies to Ireland in the first place.</P>
      <P>But the White Paper emphasises also the importance of selectivity in the use of State aids.  The concept will be enshrined in the new Industrial Development Bill which we will be shortly putting before the House.  In this regard the Government have the support of the Telesis and NESC analysis which forcibly argued for greater selectivity in the use of industrial incentives for the concentration on key cost disadvantages in logistics, product and process development, export marketing, linkages and skills.  As far as overseas investment is concerned, this means that increased attention will be paid to the overall quality of the project in terms of number and skill level of jobs, commercial viability, market potential and the likely return to the economy and the Exchequer on the State's investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial policies being pursued by this Government are the right ones. For the first time ever, they have been clearly set out and explained to native and overseas industrialists through the Government's White Paper and national plan.  Of underlying importance is the generation of an environment associated <Col N="2692" /> with an adequate supply of robust business entities.  Recent developments on this front have been &mdash; and this is a pleasant change from what prevailed under the regime in power in 1977-81 &mdash; a reduction in inflation, a key influence on risk and profitability of success, from 18 per cent in 1982 to a level of just over 6 per cent in 1985; steps are afoot to rationalise our cumbersome industrial relations procedures; the development of our telecommunications services has continued at an impressive pace; major road bottlenecks have been alleviated and further substantial developments are planned under the national plan; the expansion of key elements of our third level educational system designed to provide the appropriate skills and business acumen to industry has been escalated and imaginative tax incentives have been introduced, and subsequently improved, which are designed to encourage personal investment in industry and international services.</P>
    <P>As a result of these and other developments I believe that a substantive improvement in the environment for business has taken place and that this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>Another element of the Government's overall strategy is directly to influence, through the provision of appropriate incentives, the supply of entrepreneurs and companies willing to use Ireland as a base for the development of their businesses. Our range and level of incentive programmes are second to none and embrace small industry, enterprise development, technology transfer, company development, national linkage, feasibility, research and development and new industry.</P>
    <P>There is every indication now, I am glad to say, that this new strategy is paying off for the country, the Government are doing their job and the IDA are doing their job, and the business climate for new investment and new sustainable employment creation, has improved very substantially.</P>
    <P>I call on the House, therefore, to endorse fully the policies being pursued by the Government in line with their <Col N="2693" /> White Paper on Industrial Policy and the national plan.  Such endorsement will allow the Government to get on with the task they are already fully committed to, of promoting further investment and creating the economic and financial conditions in which sustainable new employment can be created throughout the country and, indeed, for the Limerick area.</P>

      <P>Last night I heard the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism try to defend what the Government had done in respect of this matter and I thought it was pretty feeble. I thought it could hardly be beaten for feebleness, but I heard something even feebler here tonight.  What we have just heard is the most pathetic performance that I have ever heard from anybody. This beleaguered Minister of State stands up and reads out for 25 minutes what somebody has handed to him.</P>
      <P>It was very interesting indeed to listen to him talk about how deeply concerned the Government are for Limerick and all that has happened in terms of industrial development in the past two and a half years.  He lowered his voice when he got to that, as well he might.  I did not catch the entire details.  I missed one of the names that he mentioned.  Unless you had the list in front of you, you could easily miss the names because what he is talking about are so small that you could be living in Limerick for a long time and not know that some of them were there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one industry of any significance was referred to as having been established in Limerick since 1982 &mdash; a company called El-Fab &mdash; which he says will ultimately have 300 jobs.  It certainly has an awful lot less than that now and I do not know if it will ever see that day. All the others that he listed, with one exception, are small industries and are on an IDA list that was handed to him <Col N="2694" /> only because they happened to be promoted from abroad.  If they were indigenous they would have been promoted in that region by the Shannon Development Company and would not be connected with the IDA.</P>
    <P>So bereft was the Minister of something to say that he said that a lot of other firms are expanding, including Mayo Data.  That firm have been in Limerick for the last ten years.</P>

Minister Collins went on to read out figures and he should think of the consequences of some of the figures before he reads them out, but he probably did not have an opportunity to read his speech before he came into the House.  He said that between 1980 and 1984 £85 million was committed to Limerick in industrial development.  It was &mdash; the figure is correct. Now he should go back and find out when it was committed, because 95 per cent of the money &mdash; in fact, slightly over 95 per cent &mdash; was committed before October 1982.</P>

      <P>The list of very minor undertakings that he is able to refer to since that date is proof of that.  We have had many factory openings in Limerick in the last few years, I am glad to say.  We have had very high powered Ministers coming down from Dublin.  Indeed, we have had a local Minister who turns up when things are good.  They arrive at these openings of which we have had many over the last few years.  Without exception every single one of these undertakings was started by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Every single one is an extension of plants that were put into that city and county while I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have become fairly used over the last few years to going to these openings.  It <Col N="2695" /> is almost getting to be a chore, especially when they are all expansions.  There is not one single new one, except one which is a service industry, if I remember, called VIP, in the Plessey Technological Park. It does not manufacture anything.  There was a terribly interesting photograph taken, Deputies might recall, of the Minister for Justice studying what was on show on that occasion.  The photograph was widely published, much to the interest of many people afterwards.  In his list of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Plessey Technological Park, one of the great jewels in the Limerick crown &mdash; everything that was in it, incidentally started about five years ago &mdash; he mentioned the IIRS being present.  It is.  There are two people employed in it.  It was proposed to move two sections of the IIRS, a new one and an existing one, to Limerick.  The Fianna Fáil Government of two and a half to three years ago made that decision.  It was stopped, as all other decentralisation was stopped, by this Government.  The Minister of State was a little unhappy in his choice of some of the institutions that were there.  There is a man and a typist and that is the extent of the IIRS presence in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This premises into which this Hyster project was to go had been vacant for seven and a half years, so it was an absolute godsend to have it occupied.  It is a difficult premises to fill because it was purpose built for a different purpose.  The risks involved here, as has been made abundantly clear, exist, because risks exist in every industrial undertaking. However, I know of few where the element of risk is less than here.  The effort of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to suggest that this was high risk is ridiculous.  This company, Hyster, have a very modern high technology plant now in production in Blanchardstown &mdash; something entirely new.  It was never tried, either by them or anybody <Col N="2696" /> else, before.  It was very high risk, but the risk was taken.</P>

Again, this was a very risky venture because it was new and it was not known whether it would work or not.  Here you have one of the most low risk projects ever to be offered to this country.  The IDA did not turn it down, they were very glad to see it.</P>
      <P>We have had such misleading figures given to us that they border on deliberate lies.  You would never think that in this country the IDA by law are precluded from offering more than 45 per cent grant aid of the capital cost.

      <P>It is again entirely misleading for the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice to seek to give the impression that because £1 million in equity is put up by this or any other company, that is the only risk at which the company stands.  I have seen many projects established where no cash <Col N="2698" /> equity was put up.  That is not uncommon and to have only £1 million put up in this instance is quite normal.  I have checked this out with many people.  In addition to the cash, which is only a small aspect, there is the question of leasing and parent company guarantees of bank loans which are regarded by the IDA and the banks as the same as equity, as they are.  By putting across this story to give a false impression the Government are carrying on in a disgraceful fashion.</P>
      <P>The capital grant does not take into account the value of the premises.  The IDA were fortunate in their agreement with the Hyster Corporation to have Hyster take an option on the premises which would have resulted in the purchase of the premises by Hyster from the IDA at a very attractive sum.  The IDA will find it very difficult to sell these premises at anything like their building cost.</P>

Idle rhetoric in other areas is no substitute for positive action in the creation of jobs and the encouragement to industrialists to invest in this country.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I condemn the Deputy for his absence from this debate last night and also this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government decided not to back the IDA on the siting of the De Lorean plant in Limerick there was a <Col N="2699" /> great deal of justification for it.  The amounts involved were enormous and there was no guarantee that the project would ever get off the ground.  As it turned out, that decision was sound and prudent.  We all know how the British Government invested in De Lorean's pipedream and the price they paid for it.</P>
    <P>There was a huge risk element in De Lorean but there was virtually no risk with Hyster.  The company are a reputable and long-established one, manufacturing a top quality product.  Their reasons for siting in Europe were sound business reasons and the money involved, in relation to the jobs to be provided, could hardly be regarded as excessive.</P>
    <P>The Government's penny-pinching demand for an extra £1 million investment by Hyster before committing IDA investment money in the proposed Limerick project was an insult to the American promoters, and it is not surprising that they chose to locate elsewhere. The Minister for Finance and the other Ministers, already gravely embarraised by their blatant failure to reach their own economic targets, treated Hyster as another De Lorean, and Limerick must pay the price for their misguided decision.</P>
    <P>The irony is, as the leader of this party, Deputy Haughey has pointed out, that the decision, which was supposed to save the country £1 million, will actually cost us at least £5 million.  Without Hyster there will be 800 people still on the dole queue in Limerick city costing the taxpayer £5 million a year in unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The same kind of penny-pinching attitude revealed itself in the recent announcement by the Minister for Energy regarding oil exploration.  Rather than make it attractive for the major oil companies to invest in oil exploration in our seas, he has set us at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> other potential oil producing nations who make it worth while to invest in exploration.  Nobody will thank the Government for leaving our natural resources in the sea.  Let us draw in the <Col N="2700" /> exploration investment, bring the oil ashore and then let us talk about how much return the State receives from it.</P>
    <P>Foreign investment in exploration, attracted by a favourable taxation climate, discovered our natural gas off Kinsale Head.  That gas is now producing valuable royalties for the State while, at the same time, providing competitively-priced native energy for homes and industries along the route of the gas pipeline. What good would that gas be doing for Ireland if it were still lying at the bottom of the sea?</P>
    <P>Ireland no longer has a monopoly on State-run industrial development boards, nor do we have an advantage from an incentive point of view.  Other countries are now offering industrialists a deal that is as good as if not better than ours.  In the circumstances, it does not make any sense to me that the Government should frighten away a genuine project like Hyster.  The people of Limerick in particular will want an honest explanation from the Minister and his Government as to why 800 jobs have been lost and what he proposes to do to replace them.</P>
    <P>The people of Limerick will also want an explanation as to why the Kinsale gas pipeline still has not come to the city, where the availability of natural gas could help generate jobs there.  Fianna Fáil in Government had prepared plans for a Limerick spur on the pipeline but still there is no move on it.  Must Limerick wait until Fianna Fáil return to office, for gas, for jobs and for a Government who really care for its welfare?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Government not to support the project is a most unusual and indeed incredible one.  This is at a time when there are few projects of this kind in the pipeline and it seems totally unbelievable that the Government should show such disregard for the unemployed. The Government have failed not only to create new employment opportunities but also to protect the jobs of hundreds of people in every area and particularly in the mid-west region. west region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few hundreds yards away from the <Col N="2701" /> Hyster project is the Burlington plant which closed recently with a loss of more than 400 jobs.  Here we have people skilled for this kind of industry and who could have obtained jobs had the decision been made to go ahead with the Hyster project.  The Government have shown a total lack of appreciation of the plight of the unemployed, a total lack of any knowledge of the present chaotic situation in every region in relation to employment.</P>
    <P>There is another reason that this plant was essential to the region, that is that in the mid-west region now there is a very high dependence on the electronics industry.  It is now recognised throughout the world that the electronics industry is in decline.  Therefore there is an urgent necessity in the mid-west region to balance employment opportunities in this heavy engineering, manufacturing industry which would ensure that in the event of any serious downturn in the electronics industry in future years we will have a sound manufacturing base in the region I believe that is why the IDA were so enthusiastic about that project and in ensuring that we got that project into the region.</P>
    <P>There is another reason we felt that project was essential and why we perceive a major loss because of its not being located there. It is well known that 800 jobs in manufacturing industry would create an additional 250 to 300 jobs in the servicing area.  It has been recognised that we would have had 300 additional jobs in the servicing area, which would have had a knock-on effect, especially in small high technology industries developing in the region and which have been very successful in many areas.  We are also aware that there would have been opportunities for storage, warehousing, freight handling, the transportation of goods and in traffic generally, which would have a knock-on effect right across the whole range of industry in this region which is in such a chaotic position at present.  Its location there would have introduced many new skills, new machine-intensive skills, in engineering and <Col N="2702" /> dye-casting, important areas for job creation. It would also have afforded small industries an opportunity, through that major international company, to operate on the export market in a way they would never be able to do within the limits of their resources.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there were a number of reasons the project was essential beyond the development of the economy of the mid-west region.  There were between 300 and 400 people made redundant in Burlington, with no further employment opportunities for them.  That project would have given an ideal opportunity to many of them already highly skilled, trained and unlikely to have any prospect of a job in that area in ensuing years.</P>
    <P>The Government would appear to be trying to confuse the issue at this stage by throwing out what I believe to be fictitious figures about possible grant aid and its cost to the Exchequer.  I challenge the Minister here, as he has been challenged on numerous occasions already, to put this proposal on the table so that we might see exactly what is involved, measuring for ourselves the implications for the taxpayer.  I believe they would be very little because such grant allocation would cover capital costs, fixed assets, plant, machinery and buildings and the training of young employees, with such training grants being paid out only as the people were trained and in employment. The Minister is foolish if he thinks that, by hiking up figures here, he will create the impression that there was an inherent risk that could not be taken or guaranteed. That is totally inaccurate.  There are many projects in the mid-west region, in every part of the country, where the costs per job have been far in excess of those in this venture.</P>

      <Col N="2703" /> The Government's policy in the whole industrial area is now in total disarray. The IDA have been stabbed in the back, damaged, and are not now sure what Government policy will be for future industrial development, whether the Government will turn on its head every decision they take if it does not suit them. On the same day the IDA said that wealth must now be created if sustainable jobs are to be created and the Tánaiste appeared on television saying wealth must be taxed.  Seven hundred million pounds left this economy into the black hole, sent away by the multinationals, that could be reinvested here.  Successive Irish business people are now concentrating their investments in the United States, at a time when there is so much investment needed here and so many opportunities that could be exploited if we could attract and retain such investment.</P>
    <P>There is now total confusion in relation to Government industrial development policy.  It is no wonder that Hyster have now located in Holland.  It is a disastrous state of affairs and one that the Government should never have allowed to happen.</P>

      <P>There has been enormous damage done by the Government to the morale and credibility of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, deliberately or otherwise, misled the House and the people by insinuating that the Government were being asked to invest £14 million in the Hyster project with an investment of only £1 million by the company.  That was misleading on the part of the Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that the Government considered this project totally unacceptable, a hare-brained scheme, which assumption on the part of the Government is bordering on the unparliamentary word I may not use but, in any language, it is an untruth and surely that is parliamentary enough to make it stick.  Can anyone recall this ever occurring before in this country?  I accept that the Minister gives final approval or otherwise to agreements made by the IDA, but in this case it has been shown conclusively that the Minister, the Government, the Cabinet and the Taoiseach, and possibly some of the national handlers, made an incorrect decision on this one.  I mention all of them because of the many statements that emanated from all these elements of responsibility, but the bottom line is that the Limerick region has lost 800 very badly needed jobs in manufacturing industry and many hundreds of supporting jobs that would have been created had this plant been located in Limerick.</P>
      <P>I might ask the Minister further: how many more such decisions have been taken of which we have not been made aware?  We were fortunate in being able to highlight this situation, having been made aware of its background.  It was against this background &mdash; that is, the IDA's effective absence of reply &mdash; that the Taoiseach said in Cork that he was a democrat and therefore did not object to the issue of a statement by the IDA. Would the Minister say when before did the IDA find it necessary to rebut statements by the Minister and the Government? These are facts we want related to the House and to the country at large.  Of course the Taoiseach could not object because he realised that the statement made by the IDA was much closer to the facts than those outlined by him and his Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to cover up their disastrous error of judgment, to mislead the general public, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Minister for <Col N="2705" /> Justice &mdash; who has been conspicuous by his absence over the last two evenings &mdash; and the Taoiseach issued a succession of statements in an effort to convince the taxpayer that they were being responsible in Government.  I ask the House: could anything have been more irresponsible than that decision of the Government? But no amount of propaganda, however well presented by the handlers or anybody else, will distort the facts.  As yet neither the Government, Ministers nor the Taoiseach have given the facts to the House and the country.  The questions posed by us in the course of this debate have not been answered and the House should now be told the facts of the matter, or else the false allegation that the deal was a straight £14 million or £11 million proposition should be withdrawn. I do not know which figure is correct as the figure was stated differently in different statements.  An apology should be issued to the IDA for the gross misrepresentation of their proposals.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should also apologise for the gratuitous insult to Fianna Fáil in a statement which he issued on the same occasion in Cork.  Is it not true that the Irish project was to supply an already proved market and that the project was lost to Holland at a higher price than Ireland was asked to pay for it in the first instance?  We want those facts on the table.  Is it not true that a sizeable number of the 117,000 people on unemployment assistance would have been employed in this project to manufacture component parts for the Hyster company to be distributed worldwide?  The statement of the Minister that this was a high risk project is lacking in credibility.  This is proved by the fact that the company were asked to contribute £1 million to enable the project to go ahead.  Surely a contribution of £1 million would not lower the risk in a high risk project? Surely there is a credibility gap that must be bridged?  This is the sort of double thinking and double talking that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government realised that maximum support should be given to industries where the greater number of <Col N="2706" /> jobs can be made available in an economic situation that can only be described as chaotic.  The Minister of State in his contribution referred to the White Paper issued last year and he talked about the £750 million that has been put into industry.  Yet in one fell swoop the Government does away with at least 800 jobs in manufacturing industry and many supporting jobs.  Did the Minister approve of the Hyster project for Limerick? If he did, what happened in the meantime at the Cabinet table?  We assert that the project was scuttled there and this has not been refuted by any statement from the Minister or the Taoiseach or the national handlers.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister must know that the volume of manufacturing industry dropped by 39 per cent in 1984. Surely the Minister is aware that over the last four years 28,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing industry.  What happened in Cork some time ago is now happening in Limerick and it will continue to happen throughout the country while this Government are in power. Cork has suffered on many occasions and now we are decimating the mid-west as well.  Is this an effort to dismantle the IDA to allow for the famous National Development Corporation about which we heard so much and for which we are still waiting?  We have been promised the NDC for the past two and a half years.</P>
      <P>The questions posed by us are not being answered.  The Government should come clean and should not continue to attempt deception.  Last night the Minister's edited, altered and less than complete contribution in the House was merely a further diversion from the truth. It is high time that the facts were made known, that the Minister's judgment was incorrect, that the decision will not save the taxpayer's money but will have the opposite effect.  Both Fianna Fáil and the general public are awaiting the truth and we require it immediately.</P>

      <P>I assume that I am the last speaker in the debate.  This is an exceptionally important debate.  The attitude of the Government to this debate is unbelievable in that time available to them for participation in this debate has not been taken up.  There were no members of the Labour Party present to participate in this debate either this evening or yesterday evening and no member of the Fine Gael Party from the constituency of East Limerick this evening or yesterday evening to debate a matter which is so seriously important that we in this party felt obliged to put down a Private Member's Motion to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the contributions this evening of the junior Minister, Deputy Collins, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, yesterday evening, I felt it was one of the weakest defences ever put forward by any Government in defence of a decision.  If Mark Twain were here this evening he surely with deep conviction would say &ldquo;there are lies, damned lies and statistics&rdquo;.  The rejection by this Government of a major job creating project is a bitter blow to the people of Limerick, especially the unemployed people in that city, but the implications of this bad decision are deeper than just that.  The real message coming from this debate tonight is that it puts into clear focus the startling fact that this Government in their policies put their book-keeping monetarism before jobs.  Jobs do not count, obviously.  It is Government policy not to invest in productive enterprises which produce jobs.  Because of the handlers, the national handlers in Dublin and the local handlers in Limerick to which Deputy O'Dea referred, and the monetarist economists, it is no wonder that we are here tonight debating a decision made by them and rubber stamped by the Government.  Is it not they who make the decisions?  Deputy Reynolds <Col N="2708" /> suggested here last evening &mdash; and is it not a fact &mdash; that the sequence of events is as follows: that the Government appointed an economist by profession based in Trinity College, who is now on the board of the IDA, who did his damnedest to stop the IDA from approving this project and when he did not get his way, when those sensible people in the IDA with a proper economic outlook and feeling for the unemployed, who know what a good investment project is when they see it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This economist, a Taoiseach appointee to the board of the IDA, when overruled by the other members of the board came by the back door to the Taoiseach and got working on him and insisted that this project would be vetoed at the Government table.  This is how it happened.  I say to those who feel that perhaps I am criticising some of these economists, these handlers, rather sharply this evening, that if they take on the role of handlers for the Government they will be identified as such and they will have to stand over their actions from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for the courtesy from the Minister of State which I extended to him.  During the course of this debate yesterday evening, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, did not give the facts to this House.  We did not get the truth from him last evening, nor did we get it this evening from the Minister of State, Deputy Collins.  The IDA tell us in their statement about the project, the first statement ever that I have seen from the IDA, that they were satisfied that the package recommended to the Government was the best deal which could be negotiated with the company, that it represented good value for money and that the project as negotiated was soundly based.  This is the IDA laying it on the line for the first time, contradicting the Taoiseach and the Minister.  Yet the <Col N="2710" /> Minister of State and others say that the Taoiseach, in the course of an interview in Cork the weekend before last, said that he believed in democracy, that the IDA were entitled to make a statement. On the other hand the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, who is not in this Chamber this evening, who was not here last evening but who is in the precincts, and I have no doubt is listening to us on the intercom, the same evening at 11 p.m. on a television programme from Cork said that he felt that this was an outrageous document issued by the IDA, implying by so saying that they were not entitled to do it, that they too should fall in line with what the handlers were handing out that night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, quoted very selectively from the IDA document.  He quoted the last sentence of the statement when he said that the authority admit that they recognise fully the Government's right to accept IDA recommendations on major projects.  We also recognise that.  That was never in question, but the Minister of State did not deny what the IDA said with regard to the viability of the project which they had recommended to the Government for approval and sanction. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, last evening told us what Mr. Kilkenny of Hyster said.  Tonight the Minister of State read into the record a statement made by Mr. Kilkenny, but again it was such a selective statement that I will, for the record and for the sake of clarification and guidance for the public at large, read from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 May.  Mr. Kilkenny had told <i>The Irish Times</i> the previous day that the spare parts project was not high risk as had been suggested by the Minister. Mr. Kilkenny is saying that the Minister is not telling the truth when he says that, and to suggest, as the Minister did, that it marked a new departure for Hyster was untrue.  Again this is Mr. Kilkenny telling us that what we had from the Minister is untrue, and the Minister did not deny that last evening, neither did the Minister of State deny it tonight.  Mr. Kilkenny went on to say that the company saw the total project of providing spare parts of <Col N="2711" /> competitors' equipment as being in two phases: establishing a presence in the market place through buying in components and selling through dealers in the US and Europe.  Again this is in total contradiction of what was said by the Minister and must be placed on the record as another untruth.  Mr. Kilkenny went on to say that his company were active and had been profitable for some time, that the lower risk second phase manufacturing of the components was what had been offered to Ireland and was rejected.  He said that they would not be going into the project if they thought it risky.  Yet the Government and their handlers at every opportunity try to denigrate the project and imply that Mr. Kilkenny and Hyster are not going to succeed, that it is high risk.  That is what the Government say in the many statements issuing from them.  On the other hand, if they could have screwed another £1 million out of Hyster they were going to forget that it was a high risk project and they were going to take it.</P>
    <P>What is the value of the high risk?  The Minister and the Minister of State both were asked from this side of the House to put the facts up before us and the people for examination, but we did not get those facts.  We have asked so many questions.  We have asked the average price per job.  We did not get the cost of creating each of these jobs with Hyster in the old Ferenka building in Limerick. We have estimated that the cost would be £14,000 per job, and this is well in line with the average cost of job creation coming from the IDA at present.  This is fact, and if the Minister of State does not know it he should consult with somebody who does.  He could consult with a Deputy from Wicklow and compare the cost of the Hyster jobs with the cost of jobs recently announced in Wicklow, in Greystones, which was working out at £30,000 per job.  The Government failed to come clean and give us the information that we are entitled to.  A bad political decision was made by the Taoiseach seemingly off the top of his head to satisfy <Col N="2712" /> the whims of his appointee, the economist from Trinity College, to the board of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>This decision was not based on sound economic and financial considerations.  It was a political decision which we will rue for a long time.  The blame was put on the IDA but they defended themselves, and rightly so.  Blaming the IDA was a major blow which will affect the success of their operations.  It was a blow to the confidentiality which they always maintained in dealing with people who wanted to establish an industrial project here. That confidentiality is now blown with the wind.</P>
    <P>People who want to make inquiries about the possibility of setting up an industry in this country will be fearful that political considerations will count rather than the economic or financial feasibility of a project.  They will wonder whether some handler has the private ear of the Taoiseach behind the door.  There was an all Government membership agreement to veto a worth-while project which would have given employment to 800 people in a region where employment is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, quoted figures <i>sotto voce</i> here this evening. With difficulty we heard one or two of them.  He talked about investment in the Limerick region and about jobs created there.  Deputy O'Malley scotched much of what the Minister of State said. The £85 million he said was invested in the area created far fewer jobs than the extra £1 million in the Hyster deal would have created.  We would have had more jobs for that £1 million.  That must be understood clearly.</P>
    <P>We have heard a number of misleading statements.  There were massive efforts by the handlers to confuse the issue.  When the chief handler, the Press secretary, was asked by Press correspondents for a comment on this issue he said: &ldquo;That is old news.  That decision was made months ago.  There is no story in that&rdquo;.  If Deputies doubt me they should ask the political correspondents.  That is the answer the chief handler gave to them.  I will go <Col N="2713" /> further and say that a campaign of vilification was carried out against Deputy O'Dea in Limerick by the local handlers over the weekend.  These people went to the journalists in the local media and tried to take away politically and personally from Deputy O'Dea because he broke the story in the <i>Limerick Leader.</i> I gather that the handlers are to be well rewarded with public appointments in the near future.  The chief handler failed, because the truth will out.  Their efforts to conceal the facts from the people have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast was late in arriving here tonight.  If I did not know him better I would say he timed it well.  He need not have rushed back from Cork. He could have got his Cabinet colleague from the same constituency to tell us why he agreed with the Government's decision that Hyster was to be hoisted out of the constituency they were elected to represent.  I saw the Minister of State in the House yesterday.  I did not know where Deputy Prendergast was.  I presume he was trying to win back his seat on the corporation.  Good luck to him.  I hope the people will forgive him for his absence.  Both Deputy Prendergast and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, were elected to represent the people here in this Parliament, and not in Cork, or in their rooms listening to the debate on the intercoms, when an issue affecting employment opportunities for over 800 people is being discussed in this Chamber in time generously given for the discussion by members of this party because the Government failed to give time for it.  I understand Deputy O'Donnell is in Europe.  If he were here tonight he would be beside me standing up for the people who are unemployed in the city of Limerick and condemning the Government for the decision they took.</P>
    <P>Last evening speakers from this side of the House gave the facts and the figures. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, spoke after Deputy Reynolds and did not challenge any of the figures mentioned by Deputy Reynolds.  The Minister of State had a figure of his own this evening and obviously, with no disrespect to him on <Col N="2714" /> a personal basis, he did not understand it.  He confused himself while trying to read from a not very well prepared script. He confused Members of the House as well.  I challenge the Government to put the facts on the table so that we can see them.  Let us know exactly what they based their decision on and why they made that decision.  Was it made on economic and financial grounds rather than political grounds as I have suggested?  It was an extremely bad decision.  It will shatter the confidence of the IDA.  It will do terrific damage to the morale of the IDA.  I do not have to speak to anybody in the IDA to know that.  Michael Killeen said it all, a man above and beyond reproach, a man who was never a handler for anybody, a man who can stand on his own two feet at any time.</P>
    <P>There was a smart effort last night by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to wrong foot Members of the House and suggest that we were criticising the IDA.  We are not.  We are defending the IDA.  We have always defended the IDA and we will continue to defend them.  Many proposals were made when we were in Government. I remember the De Lorean project. We rejected it for very good reasons, and the time has proved that we were right.  We were not in there in the tangling stage trying to squeeze out the last ounce.  We saw that it was a project which would not succeed.  The Government rejected it.</P>

      <P>We want to see the draft agreement between the IDA and Hyster on the table.  People who are quoting Mr. Kilkenny of Hyster or the IDA selectively should quote them in full. They have done serious damage to their case this evening by trying to give a false impression.  We consider this one of the most important debates ever in the House.  It affects 800 people.  This is the biggest issue to be debated on behalf of the people of Limerick for a long time.  I regret that Deputy Prendergast was not <Col N="2715" /> here yesterday, because I would love to know whether he too defends the Government's decision to reject Hyster. If he defends that decision he will have to vote against us here tonight.  If he thinks we are right he should come through the lobby with us.  He should be a man or a mouse.</P>
      <P>At least he was man enough to come into the House, even if he came late.  He is a better man than his colleague from the same constituency who did not have the moral courage to participate in this debate.  When he got a soft run in a television interview on the night of the Fine Gael Ard Fheis contemptuously and callously he condemned the IDA document, the document of truth, as an outrageous document because it pegged his political ear to the back of his head for the first time.  I invite Deputy Prendergast to vote with us tonight.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to vote with us tonight. I invite people from the <i>Limerick Leader</i> who are here tonight to note carefully how they vote.</P>

      <P>President Chaim Herzog has been officially invited to visit Ireland.  President Herzog, born in Belfast and raised in Dublin and son of a former Chief Rabbi of Ireland, is a distinguished personality.  The Government believe that it is proper that we should welcome his return to Ireland.  The visit will take place from 17 to 21 June 1985.  Details of the programme will be available later.  I hope that nothing will occur in the coming weeks, particularly in the context of Lebanon and our soldiers serving with UNIFIL, which would mar the atmosphere for the visit.</P>
      <P>As regards the incidents which have occurred involving Irish and Israeli troops, my Department has maintained frequent contact with Israeli Embassy officials to convey the concern of the Government for the safety of our soldiers and we have made strong protests about a number of specific incidents.</P>

    <P>The bilateral aid programme of the Vote for international co-operation which is administered by my Department also involves the engagement of consultancy services for projects under the technical assistance programmes.  It is estimated that to elicit the information sought by the Deputy would require the detailed examination of files relating to some 200 projects and take up the time of two or more officers over five working days.  I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that the cost involved would be excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is sufficient promotion of the craft sector to ensure the retention of traditional crafts.</P>
      <P>In 1984 the Industrial Development Authority and Shannon Development approved a total of 68 craft projects with associated projected potential employment of 162.  In addition, a number of craft centres have been provided at seven strategic locations throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2562" /> An important aspect of the development of the sector is the marketing of craft products.  Córas Tráchtála provides marketing assistance to the Crafts Council and the ever increasing number of foreign buyers at the Crafts Council's annual trade fair is evidence of the close co-operation between the council and Córas Tráchtála.  At the 1985 fair total sales of craft products amounted to £5.65 million of which £3.1 million were accounted for by export orders.</P>
    <P>Recognising the importance of providing young crafts people with experience in both craft and business skills, the Crafts Council of Ireland has, since 1981, successfully operated a post graduate training course at Kilworth, County Cork.</P>
    <P>I have also taken other measures aimed at the promotion and development of the craft sector.  I have given Deputy Eddie Collins, Minister of State at my Department, special responsibility for the development of the sector, including responsibility for the Crafts Council of Ireland.  A central feature of the Minister of State's role is to ensure that the activities of all the State agencies concerned are co-ordinated to achieve maximum development of the craft industry.  I have also appointed to the management committee of the Crafts Council senior management from the State agencies concerned with the crafts sector.</P>

      <P>Before the by-law was made the matter was examined in depth by my Department and the views of all interested parties were considered.  The Central Fisheries Board and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board fully supported the introduction of the by-law.

It is considered that the premises are generally adequate to cater for the number of persons attending there and that the measures referred to will alleviate any particular problems that may have arisen.  The signing arrangements at the employment exchange are geared towards avoiding unnecessary queueing much of which could be avoided if claimants adhered to their allotted signing times.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  According to the Department's records the person concerned had only 25 weeks of insurable employment during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed entitlement to unemployment benefit on his claim of 6 May 1985.  However, following further inquiries to ascertain the exact number of weeks of insurable employment during the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, it has been confirmed that he had the required number of 26 contributions paid. Accordingly, his claim has been allowed at the appropriate weekly rate payable in his case from 6 May 1985 and all arrears of unemployment benefit due will be paid this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of pension in payment to the person concerned (£40.50 a week) is the maximum personal rate of widow's non-contributory pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age. To qualify for an old age pension, either contributory or non-contributory, a person must be at least 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>When she satisfies the age requirement (she will be 66 on 5 May 1986) a transfer from her existing widow's pension to old age non-contributory pension would be of no advantage to her because she will automatically qualify anyway for the over 66 rate of pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2579" /> An old age contributory pension is payable at a higher rate but to qualify for this pension it would be necessary for the person concerned to have been in insurable employment and to satisfy the necessary insurance contribution conditions. There is no evidence to show that she was ever insurably employed and she would not therefore qualify for this pension on reaching age 66.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, a claimant to unemployment benefit, is required to attend at the local employment exchange daily to sign the unemployment register.

      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a widow's contributory pension at the weekly rate of £52.75 from 11 January 1985, the Friday following her husband's death.  This is the rate appropriate to a widow under 66 years of age with one qualified child and whose yearly average number of insurance contributions is in the range 24 to 29.  For pension at the maximum rate (in her case £55.10) an average of at least 48 is required.  The claimant's average of 24 contributions is based on her own insurance record arising from her employment in the years 1948-49 to 1964 during which she had a total of 876 reckonable contributions. The number of years over which the average falls to be calculated is 36, i.e. from <Col N="2586" /> her entry into insurance (1948-49) up to the year prior to her husband's death, 1983-84.</P>
      <P>A pension book with orders payable from 22 March 1985 has been sent to the designated post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly. Arrears of pension for the period 11 January 1985 to 21 March 1985, which amount to £527.50, less a deduction of £238.20 in respect of her late husband's unemployment assistance (paid to her for six weeks after his death at the rate of £39.70) will be sent direct to her shortly by means of a payable order.</P>
      <P>The claim made by the widow in this case was for a non-contributory pension and this aspect was being investigated when it came to light that she might have title to a contributory pension.  There were however no insurance details given by the widow on her claim form and before an award of pension could be made it was necessary to trace an insurance number for her and then to obtain particulars of her employment in order to confirm that this number referred to her.  The rate of contributory pension payable to her (£52.75) is greater than the maximum rate of non-contributory pension (£51.05).</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in <Col N="2590" /> receipt of unemployment assistance since exhaustion of his entitlement to unemployment benefit on 5 February 1985. His means are assessed at £43.60 weekly derived from the value of capital.  A deduction of £5 weekly was made from his weekly unemployment assistance payment, up to last week, in respect of an overpayment made to him while he was claiming unemployment benefit.  Normal weekly payments of £57.85 are commencing this week being the appropriate rate £101.45 less means £43.</P>
      <P>He recently appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and arising from contentions made by him in support of his appeal his case was returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 653 and 654 together.  I am, of course, concerned at the extent to which imports of flour have increased over the past few years. The difficulties which these imports have caused for the Irish flourmilling industry have been brought to the notice of the EC Commission and the UK authorities. Under EC rules there is free trade in flour between member states and the imposition of restrictions on imports is not permitted. The Commission did not accept that the trading practices being followed by UK exporters are an abuse of a dominant position contrary to Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>Essentially what is required is that Irish bakers and other flour users should be aware of the consequences for the economy and for employment generally, arising from the use of imported flour.  I have stressed this aspect in the course of my dealings with all interested parties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> (a) £16,623 at 28 May 1985.  (b) In accordance with the practice relating to the secondment of civil servants to full time posts with unions catering for civil servants, the prison officer salaries of the general secretary and the deputy general secretary of the Prison Officers Association are paid to the officers concerned in the normal way and are recoupable to the Department in arrears from the association on a quarterly basis.  Facilities are also granted to duly authorised non full time association representatives to attend executive meetings and annual and special delegate conferences of their association subject to recoupment to the Department by the association of the sum calculated at half of the mean of the officer's scale or half of the officer's actual pay, whichever yields the lesser amount in respect of the periods involved.</P>
      <P>The sum due at any particular date is not made up of components but is the difference between the total payable and the amount received and accordingly it cannot be broken down further.  (c) Payments were not in arrears prior to the September 1981 quarter.  At the end of 1981 total arrears were £9,991; at the end of 1982, £17,227; at the end of 1983, £23,165 and at the end of 1984, £17,473. (d) The association has agreed to recoup the Department at the rate of £10,000 per quarter with effect from the March 1985 quarter until such time as the amount outstanding is cleared.  This amount will cover amounts falling due and arrears, and should clear the arrears within three years.</P>

    <P>The requirements of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice made it necessary for a developed administrative structure to be put in place from the outset in order to have a system for dealing with the assessment of applications, eligibility, accounts etc.  The cost of administration as a proportion of the overall cost of the scheme depends largely on the state of development of services under the scheme.  As the number of law centres and legal staff remain relatively small, expenditure on administration relative to total expenditure will be relatively high, but I am satisfied that the service could now expand considerably without any corresponding increase in administrative costs.  The expansion which the board have been authorised to implement in 1985 by establishing four new law centres will be achieved without any central administrative costs.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the proportions spent under various heads, it will, of course, be appreciated that the distinction made in Question No. 664, if it is intended to imply that only solicitors' salaries and barristers' fees are &ldquo;directly&rdquo; related to the delivery of legal aid services, is not one that would commend universal support.  Travelling and subsistence expenses of a solicitor, as well as the essential support services needed to enable that solicitor to provide legal advice &mdash; office rent, stationery etc. are inescapable costs of the service.</P>

    <P>In addition, a team of professional consultants comprising an architect, quantity surveyor, mechanical and electrical engineer and a structural engineer is appointed in respect of all post primary school building projects for the purpose of designing the building and supervising its erection.  In view of the very large number of building projects that were erected during the period since 1970 it is considered that the time and expense involved in ascertaining the amount of fees paid would not be warranted.</P>
    <P>Fees paid by Cospóir to public relations consultants in the year 1980-84 are included in the above statement.  In addition advertising agencies were employed by Cospóir from 1978 to 1983.  The fees were paid on the basis of service charges. It is not feasible to establish the extent of the charges in the time available.</P>
