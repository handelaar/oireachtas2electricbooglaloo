      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Electricity Supply Board to place any electric line above or below ground, across any land and to attach to any wall, house, or other building any bracket or other fixture required for the carrying or support of an electric line or any electrical apparatus are set out in section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exercising these powers the ESB makes every effort to ensure that it will <Col N="917" /> cause as little inconvenience as possible or disturbance to property and, indeed, it is an integral part of the board's procedures to visit landowners concerned to discuss with them the route of the electric line and the planned positions of masts. All suggestions for changes made by the landowners are then carefully and fully considered by the board in an effort to meet the wishes of the landowners and changes are made where this can be done within technical and economic limitations and without unreasonably affecting other landowners.  Finally, the board issue a wayleave notice in writing to the owner or occupier of the lands in accordance with section 53, subsection (3) of the 1927 Act.  If within seven days the owner or occupier of the lands gives consent, or fails to give consent, the ESB may place the electric line across the lands in question. The ESB do, however, pay compensation but on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis for the disturbance to farming or for the sterilisation of lands arising from the placing of the electric line over the lands.  The amount of compensation paid is based on guidelines agreed with the Irish Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>A problem has arisen for the ESB with regard specifically to subsection (5) of section 53 of the 1927 Act.  The ESB are erecting a 220 KV transmission line from the generating station at Great Island, Campile, County Wexford, to a transforming station at Arklow, County Wicklow.  The route of the line passed over particular lands in County Wexford where the owner has objected to the erection of the line and locked out the ESB workers when they attempted to erect the line across the property in accordance with a statutory notice served on the landowner under section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>The ESB sought and obtained an injunction against the landowner in the High Court in June, 1983 when all of the various grounds of the owner's case were rejected by the trial judge.  The landowner then appealed to the Supreme Court and that court, having heard the case in early February 1985, issued its judgment on Thursday, 21 March 1985. <Col N="918" /> The court acknowledged clearly the social benefits of electricity and its contribution to the economic welfare of the State and pointed out that the uncontradicted evidence adduced in the case of the necessity for and the value of the transmission line to the national supply system leads to an inescapable conclusion that the power to lay it compulsorily is a requirement of the common good.  The court did not, however, accept a contention that the payment of compensation <i>ex gratia</i> in an amount determined by the ESB is to be equated with a right to compensation, lacking as it does the essential ingredient of the ultimate right to have the amount assessed by an independent arbitrator or tribunal.  The court was, therefore, satisfied that the compulsory powers contained in section 53 (5) of the Act of 1927 are invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Legal advice is that the Supreme Court means that, while the erection of all electricity lines can continue where there are consents or negotiated agreements, the use of the power to enter under section 53 (5), where there is not consent, requires to be supported by a provision at law for compensation and for the determination of that, in the absence of agreement, by independent arbitration.  I do not have to underline for the House the disastrous effect which delays or inability to carry forward its work would have on the ESB's everyday operations in the extension of supply to all consumers whether industrial, commercial or domestic.  I am confident that the consent and negotiation procedures which the ESB have carried on with landowners and their representatives will continue to be successful in the vast majority of cases, but the court ruling requires an express statutory provision for compensation and on arbitration.</P>
    <P>The first 300 MW unit of the Moneypoint generating station is scheduled to come on stream on 1 October 1985.  The ESB have scheduled their weekly work programmes, including the erection of the transmission lines to Dublin, to meet this deadline.  The board have calculated <Col N="919" /> that every week's delay in meeting the 1 October 1985 deadline will cost the board £1 million in lost benefit through having to meet electricity demand from other higher cost generating capacity rather than from the Moneypoint station.  Any delay, therefore, in completing the erection of the 400 KV transmission lines will cost the ESB £1 million for each week's delay.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the paramount need that the ESB be not held up in proceeding with their work even in cases where consent is not forthcoming. Having regard to the implications for the ESB arising from the Supreme Court judgment, it is imperative that the board's wayleave powers be made constitutional as a matter of extreme urgency. The Bill before the House is designed to achieve that purpose by providing for the entitlement of landowners to compensation in respect of the exercise by the ESB of the powers conferred under section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, such compensation to be assessed, in default of agreement between the ESB and any landowner, under the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>This Bill will ensure that the ESB will be enabled to continue with the essential work of expanding the social benefits of electricity to the economic welfare of the State which, as I mentioned earlier, has been clearly acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its judgment.  At the same time it will provide for landowners a statutory right to compensation and to have the amount of that compensation settled, where necessary, by independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Bill to the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the urgent necessity for an amendment of the Electricity (Supply) Act and will accommodate the Minister and the Department in every way I can.  We are all too well aware of the high cost of electricity not only to the consumer but to industrialists and the lack of competitiveness in industry as a <Col N="920" /> result of the high cost of energy.  The report on the price of electricity has borne that out.  If the amendment to the Bill was not proceeded with I would understand the anxiety of the Minister and the ESB.  It could cause hold ups in the laying of power lines from Moneypoint which we have been told by the Minister and the ESB will provide some relief in the cost of electricity to consumers and industrialists.</P>
      <P>One would have to say that it was the courage of a lady in County Wexford who took on the ESB in the Supreme Court that led to this amendment.  She must be admired, because rarely do we see people prepared to risk taking on statutory bodies with the powers which have been vested in them.  We must recognise the rights of ordinary people.  We have to give the ESB power to get on with the job of supplying electricity but we also know that on occasion they approach ordinary citizens in a hamfisted manner. I am not saying that is a regular feature of the ESB but I have come across it as a public representative and I am sure the Minister has too and other Members of this House.  While we recognise that the ESB need those powers to make progress and get on with the job, we do not want to see those powers abused by the ESB trampling on ordinary citizens who have not got the financial wherewithal, which apparently this lady in Wexford had, to take them to the Supreme Court and have their rights recognised.  I hope this message will be brought home to the ESB when they are being given this extra power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court knocked down this section because of the lack of reference to statutory compensation and this legislation is intended to put that situation in order and to enshrine in legislation the statutory right of people to compensation. I understand that in most cases agreement is reached between the ESB and the landowners concerned. Obviously in this case in Wexford agreement could not be reached.  I see the need for this amendment.  We have to put right what the Supreme Court has struck down.  In their judgment they referred to <Col N="921" /> the powers the ESB were using and said the job they were trying to do could have been done under section 45 of the 1927 Act.  I am a bit puzzled about what they really mean.  I have not had recourse to the actual judgment.  I am relying on the newspaper reports.  Section 45 covers the area of land acquisition and provides machinery by which land can be acquired by the serving of compulsory notice, and the setting up of hearings or tribunals or whatever may be required under the particular Act.</P>
    <P>Because of the large work programme which the ESB have in hand, especially in Moneypoint, any delay costs £1 million a week.  If there was a delay of four weeks it would cost £4 million and if there was a delay of ten weeks it would cost £10 million.  The consumers, the industrialists and the economy could not afford to bear that cost.  We have to balance that against the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is a reference to seven days.  That is a very short time.  There may be a reason for it and that is why we are asking to adjourn Committee Stage until tomorrow morning.  We want to flesh this out.  The new section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>If the owner or occupier of such land or building fails within the seven days aforesaid to give his consent in accordance with the foregoing subsection, the Board or the authorised undertaker with the consent of the Board but not otherwise may place such line across such land or attach such fixture to such building in the position and manner stated in the said notice, subject to the entitlement of such owner or occupier to be paid compensation in respect of the exercise by the Board or authorised undertaker of the powers conferred by this subsection and of the powers conferred by subsection (9) of this section, such compensation to be assessed in default of agreement under the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, the Board for this purpose being deemed to be a public authority.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the reference to seven days.  Without very good reason I <Col N="922" /> would not be prepared to hand that type of power to the ESB.  It is too short for any ordinary citizen.  A citizen might not be at home when a statutory notice was issued.  His solicitor or his barrister could be on holiday.  Where will he get advice? I know the Minister would be available to give that advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be talking about a period of 28 days.  I hope we can get agreement on that during the day.  I hope the Minister will tell us his thinking on it, or what the real reason for it is.  We are all too well aware of how a power can be abused by public bodies against the ordinary citizen.  The common good must always be upheld.  I came up against the occasional objector when I was Minister for Energy and we were laying the pipeline from Cork.  There are always unreasonable people out there in the public arena who are prepared to hold up everybody.  We need power to deal with that type of situation, but we must not go overboard and crush the rights of ordinary citizens.  I needed such power to get that project under way and finished within time and within the budget.  It is for that reason that this sort of powers are conferred.  They are not conferred by this house to enable bodies such as the ESB to ride roughshod over the rights of the ordinary citizen.  That is the only reservation I have.  We support the reasons for bringing forward the Bill to correct a position which has existed since 1927.  I do not know whether it has been challenged before.  It has now been upheld by the Supreme Court and there is an onus and a responsibility on us to put the matter right.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the seven days.  As I indicated to the Minister's Department last night, I am prepared to go along with the Bill if we can agree on a reasonable period of notice to allow the ESB to get on with the job.  I want the message to go to the ESB that when we confer powers on them we expect them to be used in a reasonable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> An individual working for the ESB may decide to put a pole in your front garden irrespective of whether it destroys the appearance of your house.  Community amenities should form part of the forward planning of the ESB.  The huge pylons across the country are not very attractive.  I am not a technical expert or an engineer, but I know we all want to preserve our amenities and the beauty of the countryside.  At the same time we must have electricity.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the few points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why the Minister is bringing in the Bill at this time.  The experience in our constituency is that there have been differences between the ESB and landowners from time to time.  Problems have arisen about access and the manner in which approval was sought to go over the terrain.  I am glad the Minister is bringing in an amendment which will give the landowners a statutory right to compensation.  This was denied to them up to now and systems which the ESB operated left something to be desired.  This amendment will correct that position.</P>
      <P>On occasion there have been protests in our constituency about the quality of the lines and about the pylons being properly monitored from an engineering point of view.  In the Kilmihil area there was a collapse last year during a storm.  There was a great deal of concern about that collapse.  The advent of the powerline from Moneypoint will decrease the cost of electricity to the consumer.  I am sure the Minister and other people on this side of the House are glad to note that Fianna Fáil have finally discovered that the ESB station at Moneypoint will be of some value nationally and that it will contribute to the economic life of the country.  However, that is a little away from the matter in this Bill.  These power lines must be installed and the ESB have a tough job trying to do this in good time.  Delays are very costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> I know that some landowners have objected vehemently to, as they see it, their estates and lands being totally destroyed.  While the ESB have been very diplomatic with regard to installation in some cases, I must agree with Deputy Reynolds that they have been very hamfisted in their approach in others.  Farmers have been very irate at the way in which their estates have been broken up.  The ESB, in consultation with the planning authority, should have greater regard for the estates that will be damaged.  I am not satisfied that there is enough communication between the public, the planning authority and the ESB.  For instance, the notice sent out when a line is going to be installed is not given sufficient prominence in the newspapers and I am not satisfied that the media explain this matter properly.  Many of these announcements have escaped the attention of landowners who find themselves without any means of altering the direction of the line being worked upon.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the intention of the Bill, I would ask the Minister to get the ESB to give a reasonable amount of notice.  The seven days notice is a little short.  There should be more flexibility. With the nature of their work, sometimes landowners would not see the papers from one end of the week to the other.</P>

      <P>Deputies have made representations from time to time about these matters.  Not alone should there be a published notice, but there should be some flexibility about the return of the wayleave.  Seven days for acknowledgment is a very short time for proper legal <Col N="925" /> consultation.  Would the Minister please reconsider that limited time?</P>

      <P>We are supporting this Bill.  As one who has worked in the ESB for 30 years, I have a fair idea of what approach they have in this matter of wayleaves.  I must say that the ESB over the last 58 years have used this power very responsibly and they have a major power in this Bill in many other areas also.  The foresight of the people at the time meant that they saw the ESB got the powers which they needed if they were to do the job that they were given to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey is making the point that they do not give sufficient notice and that the notice may escape those concerned. I do not think that is so.  Apart from putting notices in the papers, they advise all farming organisations and everybody involved in farming and I am sure that those across whose land the line will go will know one way or the other.  Eventually, they send the notice to the individual farmer.  There is no question of their not knowing what is happening and what direction the line will be taking.  They also take a very responsible attitude, in so far as they can, concerning overhead lines.  These are visually unattractive but the ESB are very careful to try to avoid skylines and so forth and overhead lines appearing, especially in an amenity or visually attractive area.  They have always had these things in mind, although they have no need to under the Act.</P>
      <P>The ESB always gave compensation although I agree that the public did not have a statutory right to claim it and then go before arbitration with regard to the amount of that compensation.  The level of compensation given was always agreed with the IFA, the ICMSA, or the local farming or community groups.  The ESB have often been in touch with various people in the local area in order to agree the amount of compensation they would give.  It is an <i>ex gratia</i> payment and they have no statutory duty to give any compensation whatsoever, but they always did and always endeavoured to negotiate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that the right to compensation <Col N="926" /> under arbitration will not substantially increase the amount which the ESB had already been giving.  It will approach around the same amount.  The difference now will be that, whereas at the moment the vast majority of people accept the wayleaves, agree to access and accept the compensation given &mdash; usually by agreement with farming organisations &mdash; when this Act is passed they will probably all seek the statutory right to arbitration to decide this figure.  That could possibly lead to some delay.  We agree that people have that statutory right and that some are more inconvenienced than others and more damaged.  It depends on the type of farming carried on.  Tillage farmers would probably not be much more affected than beef farmers and so forth. In that area there is a need for arbitration to decide the level of compensation that would be required, and we agree with that.</P>
    <P>I would not agree at all with the use of the land acquisition powers in section 45. First, it would be a long and involved procedure and secondly, the ESB would be acquiring lands which they do not need once they have erected their pylons.  They would be giving that land back to the farmers from whom they acquired it. That would not be a suitable method of doing the job which this Act is allowing them to do.  It involves a slight addition to one subsection of the 1977 Act to enable the ESB to carry on the job they have been doing.</P>
    <P>It will be agreed by all Deputies that the farming community accepted the ESB, understood the importance of their contribution to development probably more than anybody else in the fifties and sixties when the rural electrfication scheme was being implemented and then there was enormous co-operation between farmers, rural groups generally and the ESB.  The ESB did much more than just instal electricity.  They initiated demonstrations of cooking, of horticultural uses of electricity, of its farming uses. There were also organised group water schemes with pumps being installed for their implementation.  They carried out all sorts of development in rural areas in <Col N="927" /> co-operation with local communities with whom they got on very well at all times. I do not believe that this case brought to the Supreme Court indicates in any way that farmers are taking a harsher line with the ESB because there has always been great co-operation between them, and I believe this will continue.  However, it is only right that farmers have the right to go to arbitration with regard to a claim for compensation if they are not satisfied with the suggested figure of the ESB, and we support that right.</P>

      <P>This Bill is of importance to many people who have felt unhappy in regard to the payment they have been offered, and in some cases they have been refused payment by the ESB where pylons crossed their lands.  People are concerned about the siting of these power lines and they have every reason to be so. They are concerned about them crossing their dwellinghouses and their potential effects.  Where such power lines are sited over dwellinghouses there should be adequate compensation paid to people.  I am glad to note that, instead of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, compensation will now be written into legislation.  This is a very good thing.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is acting on the advice he has received from the ESB. They have calculated that every week's delay in meeting the 1 October 1985 deadline will cost the board £1 million in lost benefit through having to meet electricity demand through other higher cost generating capacity rather than through the Moneypoint station.  I see in one of this morning's papers mention of the importation of coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the fallout from generating stations is having an effect.  I am reliably informed that the cost of installing equipment to offset the effects of acid rain is in the region of £500 million.  That type of cost is prohibitive. I would ask the Minister to ensure, in consultation with the ESB, that every effort be made to avoid the effects of acid rain.</P>
      <P>I might mention also the importation of coal to generate electricity.  In this respect I would ask the Minister to continue to exert influence on the ESB to discontinue such importation when there is native fuel available.  The Minister said himself last April, that he would be anxious to utilise and avail of all existing native fuel resources.  I doubt the calculations leading to the ESB statement that there will be £1 million a week lost through delays in installation of lines. Certainly they miscalculated in regard to many items relating to Moneypoint.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that there are vast quantities of native fuel available. There is a vast, untapped energy supply lying fallow which could be taken over by the Department of Energy.  Here I refer to our forests, which I believe should be the responsibility of Bord na Móna.  It is a scandal to see so much imported energy being used while one of our greatest assets, our forests, lie fallow. It should be remembered also that Bord na Móna have the necessary structures, factories and personnel.  This means that with very little additional cost our forests could be transferred from the Department of Forestry to the Department of Energy with responsibility for them being vested in Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that people will be compensated immediately under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I support this Bill.  There are just a few <Col N="929" /> points I should like to make.  At planning stage, when a line is being drawn upon the drawing board, I believe the ESB should be more flexible in their approach and enter into discussions with individual farmers.  This Bill concerns the agricultural community mainly.  It should be remembered that those lines can occasion great inconvenience to farming development, especially for tillage farmers and for people engaging in horse breeding, where such lines can be quite a nuisance. With proper discussion matters could be tidied up between both parties with pylons, poles and so on being sited in areas more convenient to everybody.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to compare the ESB problem with that of Bord Gáis Éireann because Bord Gáis traversed farmers' property probably once in a lifetime. They have an excellent way of dealing with the farming community and go to enormous trouble to satisfy the needs of the agricultural community generally.</P>
      <P>The period of seven days is too short and it should be at least 14 days.</P>
      <P>The ESB lines passing through farmyards can be quite dangerous.  Matters like these should be taken care of at the planning stage.  In many instances very large pylons are sited near homes and farmyards and they can cause annoyance because at times they are very noisy.  This can be quite upsetting if the farmer is engaged in the horse breeding industry. Generally farmers co-operate with the ESB and I recommend that the latter give greater consideration to dealing with the matters I have mentioned when they are at the planning stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is necessary legislation.  It is not an indication of friction between the farming community and the ESB but is merely regularising a situation that has been obvious for some time.  From my experience of dealing with the ESB they have been extremely co-operative and I know that they go out of their way to cause as little annoyance and discomfort as possible. However, there is a need to update the 1927 Act.  The seven days notice is not sufficient and neither is the notice <Col N="930" /> given to people other than landowners or farmers.  There have been many cases where people bought a site that was on the line of new ESB lines.  Because of the use of outdated ordnance survey maps the original owner is often served with the necessary notice even though the land may have been sold six or seven years ago and the present owners do not receive any notice other than the ordinary planning permission notice in the newspapers. There is a considerable grey area in the 1927 Act and I ask the Minister to update that Act as soon as possible to ensure that all property owners, both farming and non-farming, get adequate notice of the intentions of the ESB to seek a wayleave in relation to a power line.  This matter will have to be attended to in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their co-operation, particularly Deputy Reynolds on behalf of the Opposition party. This legislation is necessary and the House understands why it has to be done expeditiously.</P>
      <P>General remarks were made about the powers of the ESB in relation to showing respect for the wishes of the community and landowners and also for environmental interests.  Without opening a case on it, I think that in the past they have respected the rights of landowners and property owners, but obviously there will always be difficult situations and the same applies in respect of local authorities who have compulsory acquisition powers.  I think this is the exception rather than the rule in dealing with the ESB but I can assure the House that in my contacts with the board of the ESB the sentiments expressed here will be conveyed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the period of time, I wish to point out to the House that section 53 of the 1927 act provided for 14 days and the then Government saw fit to give 14 days to lodge objections on the service of notice by the ESB to place lines over land or to erect masts.  This was amended to seven days in 1945.  However, we should appreciate that before the notice is issued discussions will have <Col N="931" /> taken place with the landowners and the land will have been surveyed.  The seven days is a reasonable period in the circumstances because many discussions will have taken place before the notice is served.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds queried the necessity for this legislation and he wondered why we did not use section 45 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  Basically that deals with the compulsory acquisition powers of the board and, as a matter of practice, I think we are better off to avoid using compulsory acquisition powers for a number of reasons.  First, it is slow and cumbersome&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Carey expressed concern in relation to the collapse of the pylon at Kilmihil, County Clare, during last year.  I can assure him that the engineering standards applied by the ESB are of world standard and the ESB are a world leader in relation to erecting power lines.  Of course there will always be mishaps but I can assure the Deputy that the highest possible technical standards are implemented in the erection of power lines.  In relation to the serving of notice, discussions take place other than the formal notices which are published and served on landowners.  Adequate steps are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill Deputy Enright said that the question of compensation is desirable, and I agree with him.  The Supreme Court in its clear decision highlighted the weaknesses in the present <Col N="932" /> legislation.  With regard to his queries on acid rain, this is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  We are working in close co-operation with the Department of the Environment to ensure that appropriate measures will be introduced to protect the environment and also in regard to matters that are subject to the EC directive on environmental controls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>Time will tell.  In reply to Deputy Enright, I wish to say that the use of native fuels will continue at its present high level.  That was ensured by the decision last year.  Deputy O'Keeffe asked for flexibility.  I can assure him there is flexibility in discussions with the farming community in an effort to minimise inconvenience.  I agree with the sentiments in relation to co-operation from the community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan made a valid point that when land changes hands, the information may not be available from the older maps.  We will communicate with the ESB on that point so that information is updated and the minimum inconvenience is caused to landowners or site owners. As Deputy Reynolds pointed out, a pole in one's backyard can cause a lot of inconvenience. In most cases efforts are made by the ESB to avoid any conflict with landowners in the interests of harmonious community relations so that the ESB can continue to provide the necessary social service in relation to the provision of electricity and planning the position of masts and lines.</P>

      <P>The Ides of March have dealt a heavy blow to this country. I am not a member of the crazy Right as opposed to the crazy Left but I support the State's decision.  It was correct to isolate the Allied Irish Bank as quickly as possible from the difficulties it faced. We have to stop the double thinking in regard to whether or not Allied Irish Banks should be protected.  The Allied Irish Banks were correct to announce a maintained dividend.  Perhaps they did it too aggressively but it was financially essential that they announced that a dividend would be maintained.  If they did not, the share price would have tumbled. It has already tumbled considerably, but it would have tumbled to a nominal figure.  Who wants to hold shares that do not have a dividend?  It would have left the bank open to a run on the deposits and there were interesting signs that other banks were interested in a takeover bid if the share price tumbled to a very low level.  That would have been a take-over from EC based banks because non-EC based banks would not have been permitted to make such a bid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the AIB set up a crisis room monitoring the withdrawal of deposits for the couple of days after 15 March.  That room is still in existence. They are still monitoring and there is tremendous uncertainty about the level of deposits.  Some people would ask &ldquo;Why worry&rdquo;?  Some Disneyland financial analysts would say &ldquo;Why worry if we lose a bank? Is that not what private enterprise is about?&rdquo; The answer cannot be dodged.  The banks are interlocked. <Col N="934" /> For example, the Bank of Ireland shares plummeted nearly as much as Allied Irish Bank's shares when the exchange was opened after the event.  Secondly, banks are essential mechanisms for efficient State borrowing.  Had there been any difficulty with the AIB it would have led to difficulty with other banks and the efficient arranging of our borrowing requirements would have been under severe threat.</P>
    <P>Let us stop the nonsense suggesting that somehow we could have done without the AIB or any other major financial institution.  Our party supported the Government's decision.  Let us be quite blunt as to who the AIB are.  They have 27,000 shareholders, 87 per cent of whom are Irish.  Two out of every three shareholders in the AIB have shares worth less than £2,500.  The pension funds have about 60 per cent of the shares.  This is the pension money of Irish workers. The people on the left should not behave like the cat that got the cream in jumping on this own goal of the private sector because many of the shareholders are in the category of less than £2,000 and the pension funds is the money of Irish workers. It is not just a conglomeration of fat cats.  That is a simplistic view of the merits of State ownership versus private ownership.  The average holding in the AIB is £2,000 and the average dividend is £200, subject to tax.  Obviously it is the ordinary person who owns the shares in this bank.  Let us be clear about that.</P>
    <P>Banks in every country are notoriously worried about a major run occurring and they have to move quickly, and sometimes aggressively, to re-assure depositors that their money is safe.  That is what AIB had to do last week.  The consequences of not moving in and saying that the depositors' money was safe, that the shares would hold, that at least some of the dividend could be maintained, were horrific.  To pretend otherwise is to be dishonest.  All one has to do is to observe the bank in Ohio where recently the State had to move in and close down the bank for a whole week to prevent people taking their money out.  Do we want to get to that situation?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> Let us be crystal clear.  The bank had to be protected and cut free from the difficulties of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  For the State and for this party it was a question of to which red light one would respond.  There were priorities everywhere, red lights everywhere &mdash; the taxpayer had to be protected, the ICI and the Allied Irish Banks had to be protected.  The Government, with the support of this party, dealt with the greatest priority, the need to ensure that that bank was protected so that when the dust settled the bank would still be there and so that today we would not be debating an even greater catastrophe.  We support the stabilisation of the bank.</P>
    <P>The cost to the bank of getting out of the ICI has not been light and I am sure that the bank will and should be called on to do more.  If we accept the argument that the bank should be maintained, we must be very careful as to how hard we push from now on.  There was £86 million written off and there was a £50 million soft loan.  That soft loan should be turned into a grant, because effectively it will be a grant.  Can anyone see Allied Irish Banks sueing the State for a return of its £50 million soft loan with little or no interest?  Even they are not that crazy. The soft loan is so soft that it is in effect a grant and should be turned formally into a grant at this stage.  The £20 million guarantee money is in the Bill as being the liability of the State.</P>
    <P>I understand that the AIB have lodged £20 million in the Central Bank to meet that.  Yesterday Deputy Haughey made the point that it was not in the Bill that that £20 million was the liability of the AIB and asked that it be put into the Bill. If the £20 million is in the Bill as being the liability of the State and it is already in the Central Bank, it should be mentioned in the Bill so that that £20 million is clearly legally available to the State.  If we accept these proposals we have taken from Allied Irish Banks a total of £156 million in capital.  That is well over a quarter of the value of the bank.  Should we take another quarter off the value of the bank?  If we do that, let us do it clearly <Col N="936" /> and in the full knowledge of the danger into which we are putting the bank.  Can we take more than £156 million?  It is important to put that on the table because there is double thinking in this whole area as to whether or not we should demand enormous extra sums from the bank at this stage.  Maybe over the years we can ask the bank to repay the ICI.  I will deal with that at a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the interest on £156 million would be between £15 million to £20 million per year.  A figure of £20 million out of profits of £70 million per year is one hell of a fine for making a hell of a mistake.  They deserve that fine because they made a hell of a mistake but can we, as legislators, push harder? If we push harder I wonder will we bring down the house of cards?  That is the question I want to pose and we have to answer it in a non-ideological fashion, whether it is State owned or privately owned.  Do we want it brought down or do we want it maintained?  My answer is, I want it maintained.  A lot of the capital has gone and let us be reasonable and sensible about how hard we push that bank in the foreseeable future until it regains some self-confidence.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the creation of a semi-State company around the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  I am totally opposed to that step being taken now, as is proposed in the Bill.  I ask the Government to take the Bill out of the House because it represents a blank cheque, a black hole.  We do not know how much it is going to cost.  We do not have any idea.  The Bill asks the representatives of the Irish people to vote into law a new semi-State company, liabilities unknown, depth of black hole unknown and size of black hole unknown.  We are asked to vote it into the law today with our eyes closed.  It is a ridiculous request and it should be withdrawn.  It is an insult to the House to ask us to pass the legislation to establish this company and say, &ldquo;we will get back to you in a couple of weeks when we know the Bill you voted for; here is the invoice, pay it today in Dáil Eireann and we will come back to you later with the accurate figures.&rdquo;  That is a lunatic <Col N="937" /> way for a State to behave.  We blame the bank for behaving in a non-commercial way and quite rightly because they made a mess of it but we are now proceeding to compound the situation by behaving in a non-commercial fashion.  How more non-commercial can one behave?  We are being asked to agree to pay a bill that is not known, irrespective of its size.  It is a lunatic situation and the Bill should be taken out of the House today.</P>
    <P>If necessary the Bill can be reintroduced when we see the depth of the black hole, when we see how much money we are in for but it should be taken out of the House until such time as we know the extent of the liability.  At that stage, if necessary, the Bill can be reintroduced. Until that day I am totally opposed to the creation of a new semi-State company around this problem.  I should like to put that into perspective.  There are 28 commercial semi-State companies and I am involved in a committee dealing with them.  Those companies have a total turnover of £3 billion and employ 54,000 people.  In general they give an excellent service to the State.  There are some bad eggs and we are trying to weed them out.  Between them, according to the last available figures, they lose about £200 million spread over all the companies but today we are setting up a new semi-State company which on its own might lose that amount.  The company we are setting up might on its own totally outshine the losses of all the other 28 semi-State companies put together.  That is why I think it is a ludicrous position and why I wonder if any thought was given to it.  It is a millstone around the necks of the public. I implore the Minister to take the Bill out of the House until we know what we are getting into.  One Bill passed after three days could be the single biggest difficulty in those 28 companies.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording that we have been making some progress with the 28 companies, reducing the losses, getting them into shape and getting them more commercially minded.  They are coming round but we are now putting in one that by itself could sink the whole sector.  The acid test of the company is whether or <Col N="938" /> not it can survive as a private company. The answer seems to be that it cannot.  If it could have survived as a private limited company the bank certainly would have kept it.  It is clear that, although the bank did not do their sums right on day one they have certainly done them since, and that the company concerned cannot be maintained as a private limited company.</P>
    <P>The size of the loss depends on the re-insurance treaties.  The story is around that a lot of the re-insurance is now getting wobbly.  That is happening because it is dealing with a State body and not because it is dealing with some other type of animal.  The story is around, and I think some credence can be given to it, that the re-insurers are now looking at the small print, at the treaties, and saying that there was not full disclosure to them as re-insurers and because of that they will not meet the liability.  I am positive that the figure of £65 million given by the Minister in the House is a gross underestimation. It may be accurate today on the basis of what the re-insurance companies are saying but wait until their lawyers get at it, wait until they know that they are dealing with a State company instead of a receiver or liquidator.  The day they know they will say, &ldquo;it is a State company; it is Ireland Limited, the suckers will pay; let us find some legal loopholes and we will get out of this re-insurance because after all we were not told the full facts&rdquo;.  They will contend they they did not get full disclosure and will ask why they should be caught for re-insurance.  That will make the Bill ten times what it is supposed to be.  I can assure the House that that worries the heart out of me.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland should be wound down and the good business that is there and the employees should be placed with other companies. A temporary fund should be established for the more sensitive parts of the business. If that is not done we will be giving a blank cheque to the private sector, to every financial institution for ever more, and we will pick up the tab.  How do we know what bum business the Bank of Ireland have bought or the Ulster Bank, <Col N="939" /> or the Northern Bank?  We do not have any idea and if we take this step in a panic measure we will be asked to do the same in the House month after month from now on.  Would the other banks not be crazy if they did not look at their subsidiaries now and say, &ldquo;Maybe we can unload this one.&rdquo;  I am sure that is the atmosphere in the board rooms of the major banks today.</P>
    <P>If I do not want a semi-State company what do I want?  I will answer that by saying that apart from winding down the ICI, placing the employees and the business elsewhere with a temporary fund to deal with the sensitive business, I believe that the State should consider putting in a receiver into the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  I make that suggestion to protect the employees and the taxpayers.  If an administrator is installed and then the Bill is introduced to turn the whole thing into a semi-State company we are inviting claims from all over the world to double and treble, and go on doubling and trebling. People with claims will not settle lightly.  Would anybody settle a claim lightly against the State?  One would not. One would send in one's lawyers and get the best shilling possible because one would bear in mind that one was dealing with a State organisation.  If the State put in a receiver it would be an entirely different kettle of fish because a receiver cannot be pushed too hard.  If the receiver is pushed too hard he will pull the plug. If people were aware of that they would adopt a more reasonable approach to the future management of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  The Minister should consider whether it would be advisable to take out the administrator and put in a receiver to wind down the company over a couple of years, replace the staff and the business and do the normal thing that occurs in the private sector, let the company wind down over a period in an organised way.</P>
    <P>I have read an advertisement placed all over the world under the heading &ldquo;Insurance Corporation of Ireland PLC, Statement From the Administrator, William McCann, FCA&rdquo;.  In the course of <Col N="940" /> that statement Mr. McCann states that his function is to take over the management of the company's business which will be carried on as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial and financial footing.  That last part of that sentence is the crunch point.</P>
    <P>Who told the administrator that it was his job to put this company on a sound commercial and financial footing?  Who told him that his job was not to wind down the company and place the business elsewhere?  If the AIB could not place it on a sound commercial footing, how can the administrator do so?  How did he know that it would not be the decision of this House that the ICI would be wound down with replacement of employees? He jumped the gun by placing that advertisement and exceeded his authority. That advertisement should be withdrawn from circulation because it gives the impression that he has already arranged the money from the State and that it will soon be on a sound commercial footing. That is pre-empting the decision of the Dáil and that is why I particularly object to the advertisement.  A receiver would have been far safer from the point of view of the State because we have not yet decided whether we will keep the company going and shower it with money which would involve introducing a Bill every year to give Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta £80 million or £90 million or whatever they need.  In years to come SAT will be regarded as essential, like CIE.  I see no reason why the motor insurance business in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland cannot be put into the PMPA.  After all, the PMPA are a State-administered company.  Do we need a second State company dealing with motor insurance?  It is a crazy duplication which is totally unnecessary.  It could be done quite easily and could form part of the winding down of the ICI and the placing of business and staff elsewhere in an orderly fashion rather than setting up this sitting duck for every creditor worldwide to have a pot shot at the Irish State for the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>We have not yet decided whether we are keeping the company going or winding <Col N="941" /> it down over a period, which is the view I take, and yet the administrator announced that he will get it going on a financial footing.  It seems he has had assurances in this regard and I wonder what they are.</P>
    <P>I must also criticise the Members of the House who made irresponsible statements over the last couple of days to get publicity. We are all in the political business and we need to communicate with the public but do we need to be on the airwaves to the extend that, three mornings in a row, speakers on RTE advocated screwing the AIB?  Is that what the public want or is it just a cheap political approach to a very serious problem?  I deprecate the points made by a number of Deputies over the last few days.</P>
    <P>The regulatory system in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has failed and should be rewritten in full.  Having regard to what happened in the PMPA, we should have known that the system should be rewritten and why did we not do it then?  The UK authorities who checked out the accounts obviously did not put any great work into it either and they should also rewrite their system as they also missed it.  The Government had the 1983 accounts of the ICI in June 1984 and they saw that the ICI wrote £11 million of the business in 1982 and £32 million in 1983; it more than doubled in an 18 month period but the provisions for those claims did not rise accordingly.  This information was available in June 1984.  The reserve ratio, that between claims and premiums, was down from 120 per cent in 1982 to 70 per cent in 1983.  In 1981 it was 144 per cent.  The accounts were available in the Department but nobody seems to have noticed.  That is gross negligence on the part of the regulatory authorities and an alternative approach will have to be taken.  Unless the Department can sort out the regulatory mechanism to an even finer degree, they should hand over that authority to the Central Bank who have the job of getting information on a monthly basis from each bank in the country and there is no reason why they could not take on the insurance companies <Col N="942" /> in the same way.</P>
    <P>We did not turn the PMPA into a semi-State company but left it to an administrator. Why not leave this to the administrator also?  Why bring in a Bill which will turn it into a semi-State company?  Until that question is answered satisfactorily, the Bill should be taken out of circulation. If it was not needed for the PMPA it certainly is not needed for ICI.  We will now own two insurance companies and we will all bow to SAT because it is as Gaeilge.  We will not be as interested in the PMPA because it is not one of our sacred cows; it is something which the administrator can deal with at arm's length from the State.  This company should also be at arm's length from the State.  For these reasons, this is a ridiculous Bill.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the mechanism they use in the Department for general and life business is to seek the same type of report although, for general insurance, you need a report more often as life insurance is not a risk and is actuarially sound. This other area is wide open and extremely dangerous and it needs a different reporting system.  Are the life and general systems used in the same way in that there are quarterly reports?</P>
    <P>The AIB said they could not investigate the company before they bought it so why did they not do so afterwards? When there was a minority holding between Irish Shipping and Ocean Bank, why did they not investigate the safety of the minority holding at that time?  At one time, AIB had a minority holding through Ocean Bank of which 40 per cent was held by ICI.  Why did they wait until they had a majority holding to investigate it?  Why did the Continental Corporation of New York in 1983 sell 75 per cent of ICI and why, one year later, did AIB have to inject £30 million into it?  Did they not ask the Continental Corporation of New York why they were selling 75 per cent of an Irish company?  Surely that would have raised an interesting question.</P>
    <P>I do not think the worst is over in regard to ICI which is why I think this legislation is crazy.  If the worst was over <Col N="943" />&mdash; I know enough about financial institutions to say this &mdash; the bank would stay in.  They would not take all the losses and then dump it.  They would do the opposite, they would take all the blows, have it cleaned out and, when it was down to a reasonable figure, they would get back in, build it up and sell it.  I warn the Minister against using the figure of £65 million as a device to get the Bill passed because if only £65 million was involved the AIB or any other bank would stomach it and get on with it.  But it could be up to ten times that amount.  The Minister is trying to give the impression to the Members of the House that we can pass this Bill because, after all, it is only £65 million, we can breathe a sigh of relief, we can handle that.  We cannot handle £650 million if that is what it turns out to be and I fear it might be.</P>
    <P>I call for a full investigation by the administrator into what went on with these joyriders in London in the office of the ICI.  They were known as a soft touch. They were on an incentive scheme to sell on commission and they issued a money market report to the London underwriters in which they said: &ldquo;The company is now soundly backed by the AIB and all is well.&rdquo;  That was issued officially by the London underwriters a few months before the collapse of the ICI.  The report went around London that the company was basically sound.  I have a long list of questions about what those joyriders in London were up to.  Unfortunately I cannot go into them now but perhaps I will do so on another occasion.  I also have a list of questions about what Irish Shipping and AIB were up to in a company called Ocean Bank Developments and why AIB and Ocean Bank got into bed together in the first place, which led to their future investment in ICI.  Ocean Bank Developments should be examined because that company is the seeds of the trouble between AIB and the ICI.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer must not bear the brunt of this.  We were right to rescue AIB.  Do not compound the mistake by bringing in this Bill.  Let us not have a semi-State <Col N="944" /> company.  Let us wind down the ICI, spread the risk over the remaining financial institutions and put in a receiver if necessary.  We have made a major mistake.  Do not compound that major mistake by passing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Many issues arise in the consideration of this debacle and I would like to address three of them.  The first is the nature of the State involvement in shoring up the financial difficulties of AIB/ICI, including the timing and the extent of the commitment involved.  The second is the price being asked from those who are responsible for that fiasco.  The third is the price which the State can reasonably expect from the financial and economic institutions in that sector of the marketplace generally and the possibility of bringing about a change as part of a price for ensuring that we do not allow AIB and the ICI in effect to crash.</P>
      <P>With due respect to Deputy Brennan hindsight is a very exact science.  If we were starting again with a clean sheet the State might well have other options available to it, but the State had to act and most reasonable people would believe that it had no other option but to commit itself fully in the belief that, unless prompt and comprehensive action was taken, major repercussions to economic stability would ensue.  It remains to be seen whether that is the case; but a very strong body of opinion was that, unless strong, decisive, urgent action occurred, the consequences would have been even more catastrophic than they are.  There is not much point in delaying the House in debate on that issue.  The State has acted and to some extent this debate is redundant because the action, and perhaps even some of he legal obligations arising from that action, are complete and in place and, I presume, cannot be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area of my concern is consideration of the price which is appropriate to be paid by those who are reasonably deemed responsible for this mess.  The Minister dealt with that in his speech.  Whenever this kind of issue arises there is immediate recourse to the <Col N="945" /> national interest, national economic stability and the need to protect our financial institutions as an excuse for in some cases very massive payments &mdash; by the taxpayer, ultimately &mdash; of public funds.  The national interest in some cases could be defined as some type of action which is expected to be outside the interests of the ordinary consumer or member of the public except in so far as they are expected to pay to preserve this indefinable national interest.</P>
    <P>I argue that the national interest includes the interest of the taxpayer and it would not be at all in the national interest for the State in any way to be perceived to be engaged in any kind of covert, secretive, furtive negotiations or discussions which ultimately would lead to a deal being done with AIB or ICI, the taxpayer footing the Bill and the full implications and analysis of the deal not being made available publicly.  We have to trust our Government and Governments generally and those whom we elect, but they have a responsibility to come clean with the public.  In due course I expect, therefore, that, having had a full investigation and analysis of what went wrong here and what the State is letting itself in for, the public and this House will be told.  Therefore we should get away as quickly as we can from concepts of open-ended commitments, blank cheques and so on which strain credulity and the resources of the State and ask too much from the people ultimately.  That should not be necessary, although I defend the right of the Government to act in an emergency, as this Government had to act in the last few days.</P>
    <P>The Minister detailed the AIB price in his speech to the House.  It will be very difficult to form any conclusion other than that there is a great degree of inadequacy about the extent to which AIB and ICI are being asked to foot the bill for a mess which they jointly have created. According to the Minister, the contribution is as follows.  Writing off the total acquisition cost of ICI resulted in a loss of £86 million.  I do not believe that that can reasonably be said to be part of the price which AIB are paying.  Putting it as <Col N="946" /> charitably as I can, that is the price of simply wrongheaded speculation, if not downright mismanagement.  That is not part of the price which can be put on the credit side when it comes to totting up what AIB are contributing in this case. Deputy Brennan mentioned loans being in effect grants.  That would imply that somehow the State are involved in calling a spade by some other name.  I assume that if the State say it is accepting a loan it has every intention of repaying it.  A loan is not a grant and cannot be construed to be a grant.  Perhaps it should be a grant, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a soft loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a soft loan.  It is like tipping the chap who throws you the lifebelt.  I am not too grateful for soft loans when the purpose of the loan is effectively to steer one into shallow water, if I may use the analogy. The second part of the price is a major share of any damages arising out of legal proceedings against the formar auditors of ICI to go to the State.  As my colleague, Deputy McGahon, would say, I would not like to bet too much on the amount of money that would accrue from that legal action if it ever comes up.  I am willing to put a small wager that we will not hear a great deal further about it despite public posturings in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item is interest subsidies of £6 million on a £50 million loan over three years and an additional interest free loan of £20 million worth almost £3 million per year at current interest rates.  I do not believe that a soft interest rate on a loan to get an institution out of trouble can be seen ultimately as a major constituent in terms of people paying a price. It is an indication of what I might call a conciliatory approach.  What else would we expect?  It is a very small net price. The third item is the purchase price of £2.5 million paid for Credit Finance Bank which they had sold with ICI for £5.  If you buy an institution you buy it warts and all &mdash; and the &ldquo;and all&rdquo; is what that is about.  It is unreasonable to expect the State simply to take up the rotten elements of the deal and not expect also <Col N="947" /> that the State should not get the benefit of any silver lining in the dark cloud. Therefore, I question the legitimacy of including that as part of the price.  The sale of a 20 per cent shareholding in the profitable and healthy Insurance Corporation of Ireland (Life), also for £5, also belongs to ICI and comes with the deal. It is not unreasonable to overstress the degree to which that makes a contribution. There is also the biggest share in any bank levy that may be imposed. At this moment no bank levy arises from this mess.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech and other speeches that much thought is being given to the possibility of a bank levy.  Leaving aside the lack of justice inherent in taxing people who minded their houses to pay the bill for people who have not, the reality is that there is not now any levy involved in that respect. The price in total seems to be extraordinarily generous.  I believe the price from AIB and ICI should be the maximum possible consistent only with sustaining the viability of that banking institution.  I am not convinced that that bottom line has been reached nor that any serious attempt has been made to bring that about.</P>
    <P>I am a little heartened by a comment the Minister made in his speech which might give one a reason for believing he has something like that in mind.  In the last paragraph he said:</P>
    <P>Finally, I know Deputies will be concerned that AIB should continue to help in the longer term.  In this regard the position will be reviewed in the light of the audit and of the claims experienced as they emerge over time. We will have to assess the situation again not later than 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>That and some of his other remarks gave me reason to believe that this list, which in my view is not a convincing list, may not be the final tally which AIB will have to cough up for the price of the State bailing them out of very deep water.  That is reasonable.</P>
    <P>What kind of plight could one be talking <Col N="948" /> about if one pursued that line of argument? There are a number of options. One is that AIB repay over a period any money the State lends or gives them.  If the State gives the loan and if the sum is in the region of £60 million to £120 million, AIB should be obliged &mdash; in my view morally obliged &mdash; to repay whatever sum is necessary over an appropriate period of time, that period to be sufficiently long to ensure that it does not jeopardise the viability of AIB.  The period can be negotiated. It does not matter how long it takes.  I would be willing to go so far as to say that we should be willing to accept that AIB could say they would repay the money in their own reasonable time. Another option &mdash; and, in my view, a better option &mdash; is that the State should not pay any money to anybody unless it is in pursuit of public policy.  A third option would be that the State should purchase equity in proportion to what they pay for involvement in AIB.  I am not aware if AIB would be unresponsive, and I doubt they would be, but that would ensure that the bank was stable and there would be no cash transfer strain on the bank.  Yet the State would have a growing asset, assuming the continued success and growth of AIB.  This would mean that we were not giving money without a clear purpose or reason other than a general notion that it was in the national interest that this corporate banking structure had to be preserved intact.  That essentially is what we should be doing.</P>
    <P>I should be grateful if the Minister would answer the specific question why any of these options has not been pursued. The State could purchase shares in direct proportion to the amount of money being spent.  They could buy these shares by coming to an agreed price, whether it be £1.10, £1.20 or £1.30.  The State would become a shareholder and would reap a dividend in the same way as the fortunate AIB shareholders will do this year while the rest of us will be paying for it.</P>
    <P>The price outlined by the Minister appears to be one which takes great account of what the Central Bank says. The Central Bank said that the price outlined in the Minister's speech is the maximum <Col N="949" /> which AIB could pay at this time. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, whose job it is to assure the soundness of our banking system, was involved in the discussions leading to the decision to rescue ICI. Their strong view, as a regulator of the banking industry was that the contribution by the bank that I have already outlined was the limit of what AIB could prudently be expected to make at this time.</P>
    <P>That is fair and reasonable, but I am not asking them to pay anything at this time. I am talking about entering into a long term commitment to ensure that the degree of State involvement and State financial rescue support is minimal.  That could arguably be said to be in line with what the Central Bank said to the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be any harm if the Central Bank made some public observations about this matter.  If they are engaged in a central role with a regulatory, supervisory or consultative function in this respect, it would not be too much to expect them to make some general observations about the stability of the institutions involved or about how they perceive the situation.  In my view their voice has been conspicuously absent.  I do not know the reasons for that silence but I am arguing strongly and stating as a fact that the public are not convinced that AIB have been asked to pay a price now or over the next number of years, or if necessary two decades, consistent with the degree of support which the State has given in this case.</P>
    <P>Those who pay the piper should be able to call the tune, and that is not happening now.  Ultimately the question of price is a matter of judgment and it is very hard to judge a case, particularly when one is not in possession of all the facts.  Apparently the Minister does not have all the facts and, extraordinarily, nobody will have all the facts for a number of years until we see what the claims liability is likely to be.</P>
    <P>I find it very hard, as did the Minister, <Col N="950" /> to understand how allegedly professional organisations like AIB and ICI could not come up with reasonable &ldquo;guestimates&rdquo; quickly.  Obviously their data information systems are antiquated or outdated, or else there are other problems; and I hope there are not, because we all want to see the rescue being carried out as efficiently, inexpensively and successfully as possible. That is a fundamental issue.  Most people are not yet convinced that AIB have been asked to pay adequately for the price of this rescue.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves how this debacle happened.  I am not going to spend a long time dealing with the history of this case, but I am struck by a number of things.  People in this area of activity knew from commonplace talk of the difficulties of ICI, not just over the last number of months but over the last number of years.  I spoke to a senior banking official who was able to tell me that it was known four years ago that ICI had problems, that it was known widely that there was an underprovision problem and that this would be visible in the famous blue book.  He said that 18 months ago it was known that there was a major problem, particularly relating to London, and that six months ago everybody in the field was saying that the problem was &mdash; to use the word this gentleman used &mdash;&ldquo;horrific.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously the Department got wind of this and moved to act, particularly in relation to the Irish end of the business. If one looks at what the Minister said it is clear that he and the Department acted very quickly, efficiently and persistently, despite initial assurances, to ensure that the Irish end of the business was in good order and that the underprovision was compensated for.  However, fairly bland assurances were apparently accepted about the London end.  If I was in the position of a person asking those questions I would not be consoled if I knew that the obvious domino effect of a collapse in London, which handled 70 per cent in gross terms of the business of this corporate arrangement, was still subject to major query and that the people who <Col N="951" /> gave assurances about there being no underprovision in London were the same as those one had to persistently pursue in order to get them to do their job in relation to the Irish end of the business.  The regulatory end by the Department needs to be further examined.  I gather the Minister intends to do that.</P>
    <P>In an article by Des Crowley in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 24 March 1985 he stated that the repeated publicity about the ICI difficulties were for long dismissed by AIB and that as recently as 14 November the new chief executive assured the press that £23 million was the limit of the write-offs the banks would suffer because of ICI's difficulties.  That very day, however, the ICI management was holding a meeting with staff to convince them that they should end the strike called by their union, the ASTMS.  At that staff meeting the company's accounting policies were challenged by a junior accountant in the group and he was supported by a more senior accountant, Ernie Phillips.  They said that the claims provision in the 1983 company accounts had been cut by the top executive management in certain key areas.  The claims provision supplied by the accountants in the important public liability, employers liability and motor sectors had been cut by 42.5 per cent at the behest of management.</P>
    <P>If that is the case very serious issues arise.  I would expect that, in due course, in order to ensure continuing public confidence in the stability and integrity of ICI and AIB, adequate inquiries and investigations would ensure and appropriate remedial measures follow.  I do not believe that the public will be assured of the satisfactory ordering of affairs within companies which have fathered this debacle, the essential systems and personnel of which remain untouched.  That would be no more than paying the bill for wantonness, wilful or otherwise, without any guarantee that a similar bill would not be presented in due course.  What I am saying is that someone in those organisations will have to answer for what the Minister referred to, in somewhat <Col N="952" /> oblique language, as being inaccurate information and for what I am saying is simple mismanagement and gross irresponsibility.  If that does not happen, the national interest will not be served. It is a matter for the AIB and the ICI to take care of that matter and I expect they will do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the problem and how it had been handled and said:</P>
    <P>However, I have already referred to the lack of adequate information systems and of management control, particularly in relation to the London branch of the company.  It appears that the information supplied by the London branch to its supervisory authority and to its head office in Dublin did not reflect the true position of the business being transacted in the branch.</P>
    <P>That can only be construed in one way and the consequences should flow from it.</P>
    <P>The State should not be seen to be involved in private, behind closed doors discussions with major financial institutions nor should a general pact be declared that the less said the better.  That is not in the national interest.  What is in the national interest is to have a calm, rational analysis of the debacle and that appropriate action be taken.  That should be done and I look forward to hearing about it in due course.</P>
    <P>Part of the price which the State can now expect, if it interprets this not so much as a tragedy but as an opportunity, is to put in place the systems that would ensure that this kind of mess would never again occur.  No financial institution should be allowed to be in a position where it jeopardises our national stability. That could be done without major interference in the institutions, by proper corporate structures, rebonding, ensuring there are certain upper limits of growth, and by regulatory control of one kind or another.  The function of Government is usurped if we accept that in a country of one million taxpayers, where GNP is small, major financial institutions will be in a position to hijack the national <Col N="953" /> finances if and when they choose to go into speculative areas of venture or simply when they are mismanaged.  The State cannot continue to accept that.  Part of the price of the rescue operation should be to begin a systematic re-evaluation of all aspects of the banking system and industry which could cause that kind of problem.  There should be changes in the corporate structure of the financial market to ensure that no financial institution can ever again put a gun to the head of the country as has happened on this occasion.  Other aspects of these institutions should be looked at and this opportunity should be taken to do that.  The State should insist that this is part of the price of the rescue package.  The whiff of cartel about the banking institutions should be examined.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the State should not be able to regulate that certain types of risks, if they are to have a consequential domino detrimental effect on the State, should not be offset or rebonded in some other way.  In short I do not care how it is done but it should be done.  We must ensure that we are never again in a position where a Government, over a weekend, have to turn the national finances upside down in order to bail out mismanagement or bad speculation.</P>
    <P>Over the past two and a half years the Government have had to make very difficult decisions to get the national finances in order.  I remember the extraordinary controversy that arose about the withdrawing of food subsidies. The figure involved was £17½ million. How puny it all seems now.  Essentially we are now in the business of writing blank cheques and hoping there will not be too many noughts at the end.  I believe the Minister knows what he is talking about when he says the figure is somewhere between £60 million and £120 million. It is irresponsible for anyone to speculate that it is more.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about redefining the statutory responsibilities of directors and auditors.  That is appropriate and should be part of the price.  The State is not interested in picking up lame ducks but must insist that there are no more <Col N="954" /> lame ducks.  The Minister spoke about the quality of information required from insurers and the technical capacity of his Department to assess such information. Radical reform is necessary there.  Either the Department or the Central Bank should be in a position to give meaningful consideration to the data presented to them.  There is not much point in the present procedure which appears to be little more than taking an overview of what is presented and hoping that people are telling the truth.</P>
    <P>As regards jury awards, I do not believe that is the problem in this case although I agree there are areas that need to be examined.  It does not mean that we should rush into a commitment to abolish the system in the mistaken belief that somehow it is the fundamental problem in this case.  The essential difficulty here was under-provision in the London area and the fact that management did not do anything about it.  It was a management problem.  We must try to ensure that we put the systems in place so that we cannot be threatened again in this way.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a proper and thorough evaluation and analysis should be made of precisely what happened in this case. Having assured the stability of the banking institutions, in due course that evaluation should be made publicly available because the public are paying the piper. Thirdly, the corporate structure changes and the legislation and regulatory changes which need to be made should be introduced to ensure that this cannot recur.</P>
    <P>There are issues which the management of AIB and ICI should address.  I do not believe that the sum total of such addressing should be that one man gets extended holiday leave.  To me that would be further negligence.  A thorough re-examination in those two corporate bodies is important and I hope they will undertake it.  They are the steps which should be taken at the very least to ensure that we do not have a repetition.</P>
    <P>The House is responding very well to this difficulty.  The Government had to act to shore up what could have been a <Col N="955" /> catastrophic situation if they did not act. There is a degree of blind faith in their commitment but there was no other option available to them.  Any humming and hawing would have meant that there would probably have been a run on that bank with its own concomitant domino consequences which would be catastrophic for everybody involved.  The Government have acted properly and appropriately.  They have done their best to ensure the stability of the market place.  It may be reasonably deduced &mdash; and I hope I am not misintepreting what the Minister said &mdash; that the Minister may not yet be satisfied that the AIB have been asked to pay their full price.  I do not believe they have.  That price should be the maximum consistent only with the continuing viability and stability of the AIB-ICI.  Otherwise they would be paying too little.  The taxpayer is entitled to a better deal than that.</P>

      <P>In some ways I regret having to rise to speak on this Bill.  There could have been a very serious problem for the nation if one of our major prestigious financial institutions had collapsed because of the ICI problem.  Over the past number of years our banking institutions have taken quite a bashing about high interest rates and profits.  We cannot put all the blame on the financial institutions for high interest rates.  No matter what the rate of interest is, all the bank gets is its own margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to look briefly at the history and the development of AIB.  The Munster and Leinster Bank were a well known Cork bank for a long number of years and they gave a magnificent service to the community.  We now have Allied Irish Banks providing employment for 9,000 people.  That is a very large number of people in decent, gainful employment. In the service sector there are quite a substantial number of jobs.  In my own county AIB have approximately 40 branches.  They have 100 in the Munster region.  They have about 27,000 shareholders, some with very small shareholdings. <Col N="956" /> Any company is built around shareholdings.</P>
    <P>On page 27 of the directors' annual report there is a breakdown of the shareholdings. Two thirds of the shareholders hold shares to the value of about £2,500. There has been a good deal of criticism about the statements coming from AIB that they will continue to pay dividends. It is only right that they should pay dividends. People who invested their money are entitled to a return.  It is a small return.  It is somewhere in the region of 8 per cent gross.  Many of the people I speak about will get a dividend of less than £200 gross.  They are decent, honest Irish people who invested money in AIB. It is important for the bank to be in a position to pay a dividend.  Confidence is important.  If we do not have confidence in a bank which is one of our major financial institutions the community will suffer.</P>
    <P>Some of the moneys involved are pension funds.  I was surprised to read that Irish Life have approximately a 10 per cent to 12 per cent equity holding in AIB and a very large life assurance company known as Standard Life have a 5 per cent equity holding in AIB.  If the worst had come to the worst and the bank had to be liquidated, the sufferers would have been those who benefit from pension funds and they are mainly Irish workers. The funds would have been depleted and we would have had a crisis.  We have to recognise that the bank did not hide anything from the Government.  They put all their cards on the table.  That is to the credit of AIB.</P>
    <P>It has been explained that the loss to AIB will be in the region of £90 million. That is a staggering figure.  This cash input will reduce AIB's profits by a further £17 million per annum.  That is made up of a loan a few years ago of £6 million to ICI and recently the soft loan of £50 million. A further shortfall will arise in AIB's profits because under the Central Bank guidelines for capital adequacy they will have to cut back on their lending which will cost them in the region of £3 million. In turn the Government have got ICI life which is worth £20 million.  The Credit <Col N="957" /> Finance Bank has been bought back from the Government for £2.4 million at 50 per cent above the market value.</P>
    <P>Where did the problem arise?  It has not been said, but I believe that what prompted the take-over of ICI by AIB was that the borrowings were going out of control and AIB believed that they could do a better job.  We have heard that Ernst and Whinney are to be sued by Allied Irish Banks and one wonders was a proper, free acquisition carried out. In recent years we have seen much of this type of problem in take-overs &mdash; acquisitions are not properly carried out.  There must be a strengthening of company law with regard to auditors and company directors.  There is a rat race at present to become auditors and company directors in the State and private sectors.  We have too many armchair type directors who are not prepared to ask questions. People who sit on boards of directors tell me that one is the odd man out if one asks questions and particularly one must not ask awkward questions.  Some legislation must be introduced to bring about a tightening up in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I have been disappointed at the many State appointments made by the present Government of civil servants to boards of semi-State companies.  This is not in the best interests of any company.  Civil servants, by and large, do not like to be ruffled and it is doubtful if they will play a satisfactory role in the area of asking questions.  Practical people are needed as company directors, people who understand business.  There is at present no great commitment.  I am openly critical of the two directors of AIB who sat on the board of ICI.  Too many excuses have been made for them and it is very obvious that they did not ask the necessary questions. If they had continued to seek information they would have had to get it and AIB would not find themselves in their present sorry state.</P>
    <P>Auditors also have a major role to play.  They do not go into sufficient detail in their business.  They depend on the shareholders and on the influence of the directors to be re-appointed.  This whole <Col N="958" /> area must be examined and there must be a tightening up by legislation.</P>
    <P>AIB have played a significant role in the development of this country.  They are the major lenders to Irish agriculture, the agribusiness sector, the co-operatives and farmers.  It is right to say that during the recent financial crisis within the farming community, from the experience of many of my constituents and myself, Allied Irish Banks have given a very sympathetic ear.  They have financed and developed our co-operative movement to the tune, I would say, of 65 to 70 per cent of lendings.  That is proof of their great commitment to agricultural development here.  They have suffered from time to time in that area because many of our co-operatives have not been as successful as we would have liked.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that, looking at their shareholding, their customers, their whole business, they would be classed more as a community based bank than anything else.  One must examine the service that they give throughout the country.  All our small towns have a branch of the Allied Irish Banks.  They give cheque cashing facility, deposit facility, money changing and many of these transactions have no pay back.  It is quite disappointing to see the attacks that have been made on AIB and on all banking institutions.  Since the founding of the State they have contributed significantly to our economy.  In the industrial area, when any new project is put forward by Governments of any persuasion, the banks have always come up front and have been helpful in the area of venture capital and in the development of any type of new industry.  They have never questioned the risks but have been forthcoming and helpful.</P>
    <P>One must look at the profitability of Allied Irish Banks and at its breakdown. They made a profit of £50 million in 1983. After payment of a dividend the remainder was ploughed back to make more funding available for industrial and agricultural development here in the private and public sectors.  Further, one must examine the shareholders' funds, which were in the region of £420 million in the <Col N="959" /> previous year, and the losses that have been taken there.  What are shareholders' funds?  They are an accumulation of profits and assets and if there were a collapse they would not be worth the paper on which they are written.  Who would want the branches of the bank around the country?  They would be practically worthless.  Ninety million pounds has been wiped from the value of their equity on the foreign stock exchanges and £176 million shares which were worth £264 million on 14 March are now reduced to in the region of £180 million to £190 million.  It is very obvious that the sufferers here have been the small investor and shareholder.  Their depositors, by and large, are small people. Somebody tried to put an estimate on it that in the region of two-thirds of their depositors have accounts of under £500. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Cluskey in the House.  In the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of 19 November 1983, under the heading &ldquo;Insurers urged to go abroad&rdquo; there was a quotation:</P>
    <P>Irish insurers were urged to compete abroad and promote external development by the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Mr. Frank Cluskey yesterday when he addressed a Dublin seminar on insurance in this country organised by the ASTMS.</P>
    <P>He said the focus was on the challenges and not the opportunities which the EC presented to us.  We complained of new competition in our market and blamed the EC directives for this, but he reminded insurers that directives applied in all member states.</P>
    <P>It is correct that ICI have been major insurers here in the area of employers' liability.  We have a total liability in this country of 500 manufacturing firms and they have 25 per cent of this high risk business.  I am also aware that their rates were extremely keen, which was a help to our manufacturing industry in recessionary times.  Another risk area was that of car insurance and they had 5 per cent of that business.  They also provided a <Col N="960" /> very important facility for builders, a bonding cover.  Had the company gone into liquidation many of our builders &mdash; who are becoming fewer with the recession, as a result of Government policy and so on &mdash; would have gone out of business also.  We must remember the contribution they made to manufacturing industry in the area of employers' liability where they were definitely undercutting. Therefore one must examine the case on its merits.</P>
    <P>Our jury system is responsible for many of the problems being encountered in our insurance industry.  The Government have come up front there and some changes must be effected in that area.  It is correct to say that possibly many of the people who sit on juries have a chip on their shoulder <i>vis-à-vis</i> insurance companies which may be the reason there are such high awards given.</P>
    <P>It is alarming that 50 years after the establishment of this company by the late Seán Lemass &mdash; set up so that we would have an Irish based industrial insurance company to take us out of the clutches of foreign companies &mdash; this difficulty should have arisen.  The ICI experienced an industrial dispute which lasted eight weeks.  I should like to ask the Minister what delay that occasioned in having the necessary information come to the fore.</P>
    <P>It alarms me to learn that one of our State financial institutions, the ICC, were financial advisers to the ICI.  Certainly they would not receive full marks on their competence because I would contend they were incompetent in their assessment of the company through their subsidiary, Mergers Limited.  While there has been much vocal bashing of the private sector, we have nothing of which to be proud in the State or semi-State sector.  Indeed it is time the Minister for Finance examined that institution.  I would question their ability to assess a company because, had they possessed the expertise they should have, they would have come up with the relevant information sooner.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that individuals and companies here have been exploited since the establishment of shell companies <Col N="961" /> by people for financial gain. Indeed a leader in that field was Tony O'Reilly.  There has been asset stripping and the making of huge profits which has done our country untold harm.  Indeed it is since that time that the real rot set in here on the financial scene.  That is another area that must be scrutinised.</P>
    <P>There was an article entitled &ldquo;London's colourful ICI men&rdquo; in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 21 March 1985 which, if read, will be seen to be self-explanatory. I believe the information contained therein was well known before 21 March when this glossy magazine became aware of it.  It must have been known through gossip and, whether we like it or not, we must take heed of gossip.  I know we politicians are usually very sensitive to it. It is in this area that I would be critical of AIB, that there must have been a feed of information into their headquarters because, with each month that passed, there was something about ICI with the big problem being in their London office. If what one reads is true it appears that the re-insurance in which they were engaging was of the worst type.  Indeed it appears that they were re-insuring through another subsidiary of theirs.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that this occurrence should have taken place at this time.  I should say I have the greatest confidence in our banking institutions.  I believe they will ride the storm succesfully and will continue to make the contribution to our economy they have to date.  Until now it must be said that they constituted the only sector of our economy that did not receive State aid; they stood alone and did the job successfully.</P>
    <P>I read the following statement recently:</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that auditors, consultants, Department officials and the like took so long to report on such a matter of vital importance and urgency.  In this age of high technology in computerisation and micro chips it is very hard to understand such a lapse of time took place before the financial haemorrhage was diagnosed and the question is how much is the loss now <Col N="962" /> and into the future?  We will need that figure before we ask the Irish taxpayer for a financial transfusion.  That is elementary business procedure, just, fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I thank you for having allowed me make a contribution to what I believe will be seen to be one of the most important debates in this House in this session.  Had this action not been taken the likely outcome would have been of incalculable importance to the nation as a whole because our country would have become insolvent.  I must commend our leader on his responsible approach in supporting the Government in this case in the interests of the country and our people generally.</P>

      <P>After listening to public comment both inside and outside the House, and this morning listening to Deputy Brennan criticising some of us who made public comment that was critical of AIB and the Government's handling of this affair, saying that we were being somewhat irresponsible, I should like to make one thing clear.  I have not heard one person suggest that the Government could just walk away from this situation, and to imply that our criticism was on that basis is to misrepresent what we have been saying.</P>
      <P>I have been saying that I believe AIB panicked the Government at the beginning of this whole affair into making tentative arrangements with them that should not have been made.  We have been told about financial stability and how fragile is this whole area.  If a person is critical about what has happened or, more importantly, seeks to find out what should have happened, it is said he is being irresponsible.  The sacred cow, the financial sector and its fragility, must be protected at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that one should be irresponsible with regard to the question of financial stability and <Col N="963" /> its importance to the State but, in my opinion, in this instance it is being used in the way national security is being used in other countries, to try to obscure and hide gross mismanagement or at times an abuse of the democratic system.  We have to strike a balance between our responsibility to the taxpayers and our sense of responsibility to the financial institutions of the State and to have regard to how vulnerable they might be to what I believe would be a little healthy exposure.  It would not undermine them; at the end of the day it might do them and the State quite a bit of good.</P>
    <P>I believe that when AIB walked into the Government with these doomsday predictions they had their own position and their priorities very well thought out. They were accepted without proper examination by the Government and without assessing the matter properly.  If the Government had done that, I do not think they would have reached the tentative agreement they reached with the AIB.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the management of AIB took a different view.  They said: &ldquo;Right.  We have made a gigantic mess in a speculative venture.  How is the hatchet going to fall on us?  Is it by the Government or by the people in Leinster House? No, they can rant and rave for a few days and they can go to the press but at the end of the day we stay here if our shareholders are happy.  We are protected once they are satisfied we have got them a good deal.&rdquo;  AIB are not answerable to the taxpayers but are answerable to their shareholders and that is where their priority lay, not necessarily for the exclusive benefit of the shareholders, because whether they come or go depends on the shareholders.</P>
    <P>We must accept what we have been told in this House by the Minister.  I am not suggesting nor would I suggest that the Minister is not telling us what he believes to be the factual situation.  Let us examine it on that basis.  We have been told that the sums involved are between £50 million and £120 million.  The Minister stated that is the upper limit as he <Col N="964" /> knows it to be and we accept that.  Here we have AIB going to the Government and telling them they are going to put into liquidation a subsidiary wholly owned by them and that the effect of putting that subsidiary into liquidation would bring down AIB itself.  We are told all of this is for a sum of £120 million at the upper limit.  What rational person would accept that?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the profits of AIB, a major bank.  In 1983 their profits were £68.9 million, in 1984 they were £85.4 million and they have stated themselves that this year their profits will be in excess of £80 million.  If they were to take two years profits and pay £120 million &mdash; and nobody has suggested they would have to or would do that &mdash; they would still have one-third of their profits left.  These were the people who were going to put a company in liquidation which would undermine their own position.  I do not believe I would have accepted that argument from AIB.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has quite rightly told this House, that sum of £120 million is what is known now and it is not the definitive figure.  It is what AIB and their auditors who have been in ICI for some time have made as their initial assessment. One can only come to one of two conclusions. If the figure of £120 million, the upper limit, is true, does anyone really believe that AIB after shooting themselves in the foot by their operations in the insurance game were going to turn around and shoot themselves in the head by liquidating a company for that kind of money which in their exalted sphere is not really big money?  One can only come to one of two conclusions: either they sold the Government a pup, bluffed them and got away with it or that the sum that they reckon will be due at the end of the day will be very considerably more.  It can only be one or the other.</P>
    <P>In some statements this has been linked with the situation that pertained in PMPA.  There is very little similarity between this and PMPA.  There was considerable disquiet for a long time about the operations of PMPA.  At least three of my predecessors in the Department <Col N="965" /> had sat there wondering if a bomb would explode while they were there.  The bomb explode while I was there, but it had been known for a long time.  We would never have got to the root of that problem except that a previous Minister, Deputy Des O'Malley, had sent auditors to PMPA as his agents to try to ascertain the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he hopes to have a more realistic assessment of the financial commitments of ICI in about five or six weeks.  When Cooper and Lybrand were sent into PMPA it was anticipated that it would be for a reasonably long period.  Over 12 months elapsed before they could get a realistic picture and, even then, it has emerged since that that was not the full picture.  While the Minister might get some indication, he is being over optimistic in thinking that he will know the full picture in five or six weeks time.</P>
    <P>Another major difference between the two situations is that PMPA was the parent company.  The parent company went to the wall.  In this instance the parent company remains one of the most successful profitable private financial institutions of this State while a subsidiary has brought about this panic.  We are not talking about the same thing.  The people responsible for the management of PMPA are not still sitting around the boardroom, although I am not convinced that they paid the price for their operations in PMPA.  I do not suggest that the same type of activity went on in AIB or ICI but I am making the difference between the two situations quite clear.</P>
    <P>What most people are concerned about is that the legislation here is not perfectly clear.  When the legislation to deal with the PMPA came before the House it was clearly stated who would pay and how the cost would be paid.  We do not know that in this Bill.  All we know is that AIB are walking away fairly lightly, if the present proposals are adhered to.  After the delay which has taken place in this House and in exploring other avenues, I do not believe that any sensible Government would go along these lines.  The Government would be wise, to say the <Col N="966" /> least, to ensure that AIB carry the can for their mistakes.</P>
    <P>Another difference between the two situations is that PMPA are being financed out of the fund financed by a 2 per cent levy which was unanimously agreed by the House and which was accepted willingly and with a high degree of relief by the insurance industry.  Can the same be said about either the unanimity of this House or the perception of what is happening in the rest of the financial world in regard to this situation?  I do not think so.  Every penny that will be used from the fund for the purpose of putting PMPA back on a proper footing must be paid back to the fund by the administrator of the PMPA.  It will be paid to the fund by the disposal of PMPA as a going concern when it has been put in a healthy situation by the administrator.  I do not see the ICI or Allied Irish Banks being put in the same situation.  I do not see the similarity between PMPA and what we are being asked to do here.</P>
    <P>What people have been justifiably concerned about is how this sort of thing can go undetected by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who have a statutory obligation to supervise these matters.  I have definite views about how it can go on.  My views were so definite about practices in the commercial world, about directors opening companies, closing companies, putting companies into bankruptcy and opening up next door to carry on the same practices, that I had a very serious look at the role of auditors particularly in the necessary policing, in the public interest, of companies engaged in commerce.  I accept that the Minister is doing the right thing in strengthening that section of the Department.  The Minister has mentioned that he will be bringing in more qualified people.  However, it is not possible for that Department or any other Department, including the Central Bank, to police that operation unless they can accept certified accounts by auditors as being an accurate reflection of what is happening in a company.  There is no other way; and the whole system must break down unless there is professional <Col N="967" /> integrity, and, indeed, unless criminal activity by certain auditors is put at an end very quickly and sharply.</P>
    <P>One of the real criticisms I have of the Minister who has been landed with this mess is that he did not proceed with the proposed company law legislation which had been finalised by way of memorandum more than 18 months ago.  It would have gone some way towards rectifying this matter.  I see that the Minister, again with a touch of panic, is considering proceeding with certain sections of that legislation.  In my opinion there is no need to proceed with certain sections but there is a great need for a sense of urgency and priority about all of that proposed Bill.  It should be put through the House to bring some order to this matter of auditors.</P>
    <P>Talk of financial stability has got a great airing.  We are all told how nervous international financiers are.  We have been told that if there is any question of the State stepping into this area it will frighten them all away.  Are we children?  It is like telling a child, wrongfully, as it is wrong in this case, that if he or she does not go to bed, be good and go to sleep there is a great big bogey man outside. Let us look at the bogey man and whom he deals with.  International financiers lend money to China, Russia, Zaire or anybody if they see an opportunity of making a profit.  Whatever about this House, there are no political ideological hangups in the international financial world and that has been clearly demonstrated if any Member wishes to have a look at it.</P>
    <P>If we are to get so concerned about financial stability, about AIB being rocked to some extent, I should like to ask whom would the people who lend money have more confidence in.  Would they have more confidence in Allied Irish Banks or the Irish State?  One of the first things they look for and one of their main criteria when lending money to any country or organisation is political stability. They do not care how it is obtained. It may be the greatest tyrant of the Right or the Left, but that does not count.  The <Col N="968" /> only thing that counts with them is if the State is stable.  Their only concern is if the State can pay the money back, not necessarily the capital because its repayment can be rescheduled.  Their concern is if a State can pay the interest.  Those financiers want their money working for them and their interest coming in.  Let us have a sense of responsibility about financial stability but let us not be fools. Let us look at this objectively and let it not be a cloak for operations which are contrary to the best interests of our people.  Let us look at this in a cool and objective manner and without ideological hangups of the Left or the Right.</P>
    <P>One thing that should emerge from this is that there should be a proper objective look at the role of the banking system and the financial institutions.  Let us assess calmly and objectively whether all their operations are in the national interests or contrary to them.</P>
    <P>Having been in the same position that Minister Bruton is in now, I realise the difficulty of coping with a matter like this. I do not envy him his task in the future discussions which will be necessary with the financial institutions.  People are speculating about the approach of members of the Labour Party to this legislation. I have listened to Fianna Fáil speakers, from Deputy Haughey to the last contributor, Deputy O'Keeffe, and I must admire their consistency.  They have a consistency about political schizophrenia that is unrivalled here.  The way they can simultaneously hop from the right foot to the left foot and so far, apparently, not lose balance is incredible. In the Labour Party we were concerned about the Bill and the approach of the Government in solving the problem.  We had long discussions on the matter.  We have been told in the House, and received assurances elsewhere, that the passage of the Bill does not mean the end of the matter.  What concerned me was would the passage of the Bill mean that AIB would walk down the road on to future glories leaving the Irish taxpayer to pick up the pieces?  I have been assured that that is not the case and that discussions will now commence with AIB, and the <Col N="969" /> other banks and insurance companies, on a package.  The Minister has told the House that only as a last resort &mdash; they are his words &mdash; will the Exchequer be called upon.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that that last resort has to be resorted to.  Members on all sides have made that known also.  My colleagues and I have been assured that before this matter is finalised the package will be brought before the House for discussion.  We have been assured that it will be finalised in the House one way or another.</P>
    <P>Members are awere that I have faced a similar situation in principle with the Dublin Gas Company being handed £126 million plus of taxpayers' money without any accountability.  Are Members aware of what has happened to the taxpayers' money that was given to Dublin Gas? Will the Minister tell us?  If one puts down a question to the Minister to inquire about that money and what has been done with it, one will be told that the question is out of order because it is a matter for the Dublin Gas Company. One will be told that it is not a matter for the House because we only provided the money.</P>
    <P>That did not come before the House but, on the definite assurance which we have been given that any final package which comes before the House will be voted on, I will vote in favour of the Bill. Allied Irish Banks, financial institutions and the Government would be very foolish not to listen to Deputies on all sides of the House expressing their determination that the taxpayer is not going to pick up the tab for the speculative ventures of AIB or any other part of the private sector.  If they want to do that, they should acquire equity in the company.</P>

      <P>On 16 December 1981 there was a debate in this House on an Insurance Bill before it.  At the time Deputy Kelly was Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I was Opposition spokesman.  The proposal in the short Bill before the House at that time was to enable the Irish Life Assurance Company to take over a majority holding <Col N="970" /> in the Church and General Insurance Company.  The proposal was drafted in such a way that it enabled Irish Life, in effect, to take over any company in the country at any time.  Although none of us mentioned the PMPA by name, I had, of course, that organisation in mind when I suggested very strongly to the Minister that the proposals in the Bill should be amended to ensure that Irish Life would not have power to take over any general or non-life insurance company other than the Church and General.  The reason was that I had a horrible feeling, which I had had for some time, that it was only a question of time until the PMPA went and I did not want to see a sort of semi-State body being saddled with 45 per cent of the motor insurance business.  Because it was a semi-State body, it would be expected to take this insurance and would be put under pressure by the Government, Members of this House and other public representatives to take anyone and everyone who sought insurance.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Deputy Kelly, he accepted the validity of that point.  We had only one hour to debate it because it was shortly before the Christmas recess. Between the two of us we cobbled together an amendment, I do not know in whose name it was, perhaps it was in both.  In any event, the amendment met the point and was accepted.  There was general agreement in the House at the time regarding the desirability of having a semi-State body for non-life insurance because of the pressures to which it would be subjected.  Now, a little over three years later, we are proposing to set up such a body and that is a very ominous step.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned with various aspects of insurance for some time.  I wish to briefly quote an extract from this speech which I delivered in Limerick on 11 March, only four days before this problem came to light.</P>

    <P>Indeed the fundamental significance of insurance in our economy is further underlined by the fact that when an insurance company here goes under due to incompetence or over-ambitious <Col N="971" /> empire building, the State compels the prudent insurance companies and their prudent clients, to pay up and bail it out to prevent a national catastrophe....  According to the administrator, the PMPA may reach self sufficiency by 1994 but even this seems optimistic given the generally depressed state of the insurance industry so, for at least ten years to come, insurance premiums will go on bearing the unwelcome burden of a 2 per cent levy... I consider this preferable to the State and thereby the taxpayer becoming the dominant and ultimate insurer but it is a bit rough, to say the least of it, when the wise have to pay for the excesses of the cowboys. If the State were God, the saints would suffer for the misdeeds of sinners.</P>
    <P>Having re-read that speech, in the light of what has happened in the past fortnight, it is chillingly apposite.  In this Bill we are doing all the things that, two weeks ago, nearly everybody would have agreed we should not be doing.</P>
    <P>I fully realise the appalling sensitivity of this; it is not really an insurance problem any more, it is a banking problem and because it affects the number one bank in the country it affects the entire financial structure and the economy in the most profound way.  Therefore, one has to deal with it as sensitively as possible and try to ensure a solution is brought about in some way which will minimise the damage.  I am not simply talking about policyholders of the ICI or any other limited group like that but about potential damage to the entire financial credibility of the country, particularly in foreign eyes, which is profoundly worrying.  Therefore, I do not want to say anything today that would make the situation worse and one should not be apportioning blame to particular people who must be going through the most dreadful agonies, not just for themselves and their companies, but for the country.  For that reason one does not wish to exacerbate those agonies.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the way the <Col N="972" /> problem is being approached for, among others, the reasons I have given in relation to the unsuitability of the State becoming involved, in effect, as an ultimate insurer which will end up with all the dross.  However, I will come back to that later and to certain alternative approaches which I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words in relation to some of the matters which Deputy Cluskey mentioned.  While I do not agree with all he said, I know that he understands many aspects of this matter because, like myself, he had to live through it and even though he lived through a more intensive period of having to cope with these problems because he had to do it in public while I was trying to stave it off in private over a period of years.  I was not happy with Departmental supervision.  Obviously, from what he said, Deputy Cluskey was not happy with it either.  I do not want to blame anyone in particular but we should now consider the suitability of the general administrator in the Irish public service to monitor matters of enormous complexity where they are dealing with professionals every hour of every day.  The Irish public service has, as its cornerstone, a general administrator.  There are very few professionals within the public service and I suggest that, through no fault of the conscientious people involved, they may well not be able to cope with the kind of situations which arise from time to time. I am not criticising them as individuals because I know the degree of conscientiousness, but I wonder whether, not just in this field but in many other fields, we can afford to continue to rely on people who are basically general administrators and who may be dealing with insurance today and are just as likely to be dealing with exports, industry, industrial development, energy or whatever else next month or next year and perhaps were dealing with such matters a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>Apart from the difficulty of trying to identify these problems, one difficulty facing the Department which I found in my time there is, even when you identify <Col N="973" /> the problem, what can be done about it?  I recall having an argument with the chairman or managing director or whatever he was of a then large Irish motor insurance company when he banged the table many times and said to me, &ldquo;All right, what are you going to do about it? Take my licence off me?  I defy you to do it and you will have 50 per cent of motorists without insurance.&rdquo;  Of course, my bluff was called and I could not do it, but was it right that a company got themselves such a large share of the market that they could call the bluff of the Minister who could not afford to stop them writing new business or to take that company's licence away, even though I knew in my heart of hearts that I should if at all possible take the licence from the company concerned or at the very least stop them writing new business?  I suggest that as part of departmental supervision no company should be allowed to acquire more than 15 per cent of the non-life business of any class in this country.  That would prevent such a situation arising in the future, or if it did not prevent it arising it would enable the Minister of the day and the Department to deal more effectively with it than has been my experience or, it would appear, the experience of those who have succeeded me in that Department.  That is well worth examining.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the other supervisory body involved in this matter and to comment briefly on their part in it.  I am referring, of course, to the Central Bank who supervise all the banks here and who are very much a law unto themselves and who tend to take their own approach to things.  They are independent or quasi-independent of the Government and there are valid reasons in many respects why they should be, but at the same time successive Governments have often been mystified by actions taken by the Central Bank from time to time.</P>
    <P>One action that mystified me, because I can find no precendent for it in the western world, is the sanction by the Central Bank of the purchase by AIB of 100 per cent of a general non-life insurance company in this country.  I made inquiries <Col N="974" /> as far as I could as to whether in any other comparable country such a situation exists and I could not find any.  I am not saying that it does not exist; perhaps it does somewhere.  The practice in Britain, the US and elsewhere is that banks are not allowed by their regulatory authorities to own more than 5 or perhaps at the very most 10 per cent of a general insurance company.  Here quite a big company, I think the second biggest in the country on the general non-life side, is owned 100 per cent by a bank and the risks involved are considerable.</P>
    <P>Of course, the worst has happened and we are entitled to ask the Central Bank why that was allowed to come about.  I do not think that the Central Bank can wash their hands behind a facade of anonymity in regard to it.  Obviously, the bank concerned were pressing them to be allowed to do this.  Maybe they were a little greedy, maybe they thought they were on to a good thing, but the Central Bank is there precisely to stop exhibitions of greed that might not be for the benefit of either the bank concerned or the economy generally in the longer term. Another bank in Ireland owns 20 per cent of another general insurance company, and the Central Bank now might give some thought to whether it would be appropriate to reduce that bank's holding in that other insurance company down to a level more in line with what is found to be prudent in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>One of the small bits of silver lining that has come out of this whole affair was the Minister's reference to the decision of the Government to, as he put it, modify the right of recourse of a plaintiff to a jury to assess damages.  I noticed that the Minister used the word &ldquo;modify&rdquo;.  I would have been happier if he had used the work &ldquo;abolish&rdquo;.  I read in a newspaper today that the Minister for Justice sees that he has three options which he will consider and put before the Government in a month or two.  One is to retain the jury but give the judge power to give advice to the jury on what figure they should award.  I do not think that is any good because it is not very different from what is there at the moment and the jury <Col N="975" /> would be entitled to disregard the advice. The second option is to have a judge simply sitting on his own, as is the case in Britain and other countries, assessing the damages.  That is a great improvement. The third is one which I have suggested, that was to have an administrative tribunal in these matters where no significant point of law arises.  I made that suggestion in an article in <i>The Irish Independent</i> last Friday.  I think that is very much the best of the three options that the Minister for Justice is considering and I urge it on him because after this problem is solved in whatever way it will be solved, difficulties will continue for many companies.</P>
    <P>The publication of the blue book the other day showed an extraordinarily low degree of profitability in all classes of non-life insurance, and that properly gives rise to concern.  The system we have had here for many years which I have railed about for some time now is quite indefensible and must be brought to an end.  The best interest involved in trying to preserve it was not good enough.  It is unfortunate that an appalling disaster of the kind we are debating now seems to be necessary to bring people to their senses.  If this had been foreseen some years ago perhaps many of today's problems would not have occurred and we might not even be having the kind of debate we are having today.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is primarily to set up a holding company called Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta which I will call SAT for short from here on in.  SAT are not the ICI.  They are a holding company, I understand, although that is not clear from the Minister's speech or from the Bill.  That company will hold the shares of ICI which were transferred by AIB to the Minister a week or two ago.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland will continue as it is, a public limited company subject to administration and under the control of an administrator appointed under the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>May I draw the Minister's and the House's attention to the provisions of section 4(4)(a) of the 1983 Act?  It says <Col N="976" /> that body &ldquo;shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be connected with an insurer if (a) it is the holding company of the insurer within the meaning of section 155 of the Companies Act, 1963&rdquo;.  That has consequences that may not have been seen, because it was found necessary in the 1983 legislation to give the administrator jurisdiction over what was described as bodies concerned with the insurer concerned.</P>
    <P>The reason for that was that the PMPA set-up was appalling.  There were literally dozens of companies, industrial and provident societies, friendly societies, tontine societies, building societies and just about every other kind of society, all interlocking in a huge and virtually indecipherable way that practically nobody understood but the presiding guru.  It was necessary in the 1983 Act to give the administrator jurisdiction over all these concerns, but that Act has not been amended in this Bill except for two words which were left out.  The 1983 Bill went through this House in a day and few, if any, of us had time to read it or assimilate it all, and it was understandable that a grammatical error was made.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation in which the administrator can claim powers over the holding company.  It struck me that perhaps one of the reasons why AIB wanted to get rid of this situation was that they were the holding company and they did not want the administrator dictating to them or acting, as section 4 of the 1983 legislation says, &ldquo;as receiver and manager&rdquo; which he might have been entitled to do if he wished to exercise those powers and made an <i>ex parte</i> application to the court.  That is a matter which will have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Consequential and similar types of amendments to the 1983 Act may have to be made because, as Deputy Cluskey rightly pointed out, the PMPA situation is very different from the present situation. The PMPA shareholders were more or less cast aside, but the shareholding of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland has been transferred from the bank to the State holding company, SAT, established by this Bill.  For that and for many other <Col N="977" /> reasons which Deputy Cluskey mentioned, the appropriateness of the 1983 Act is not obvious to me in any case and amendments may have to be made.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I can deal with this only very briefly because, if I were going to deal with it fully it would take a long time.  But one of the dangers of dealing with this briefly is that I might give the wrong impression.  The last thing I want to do is to rock any boat where any bank is concerned, and particularly where the number one Irish bank is concerned. However, it is necessary to say this.  The commercial atmosphere that will obtain in this country is laid down primarily by the parts of the financial sector who have the greatest power and significance within the economy.  Those parts are the banks, particularly the associated or clearing banks, and the insurance companies. The standards which they establish are the standards of commercial dealings and integrity in this country, because what is done at the top pervades to the bottom; but what is sometimes done at or near the bottom should not be the standards of those at the top.  As I see it, one of the requirements of those who by virtue of their position must have total integrity, even if it causes loss to themselves, is that they must be able to say without having resort to law or anything else, whether it is in banking or in insurance, &ldquo;My word is my bond&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason the City of London has remained supreme in the financial world of banking and insurance while the rest of a once Great Britain crumbles around it, is that the City of London preserved that tenet, &ldquo;My word is my bond&rdquo;.  I seriously say to the Government and to the Allied Irish Banks, whose expertise and enormous contribution to this country I readily acknowledge and admire, that the number one Irish bank should be able to say &ldquo;My word is my bond&rdquo;.  It should not have to say, as it will in these circumstances if they are not changed in some way, &ldquo;My word is the bond of the Irish taxpayer&rdquo;.  That is not good enough and in the bank's own interest it should be, and I believe can be, avoided.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be quoting British <Col N="978" /> examples but this is one area &mdash; and let us be fair about it &mdash; where they do things well.  There are many banks in Britain which have encountered difficulties in the last ten years and each time the Bank of England put out what was called a life boat.  I am not going into the technicalities of it, but all those banks survived. The banking community rallied around and the strength of the financial muscle of the City of London was preserved and the honour and integrity of British finance were preserved.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that Irish finance is no less honourable and no less fully imbued with integrity.  The Government and the bank should consider an alternative approach to this.  In my view, the support should not be given to the insurance subsidiary but to the bank itself. That can be done without any major difficulty by the Central Bank, whose duty it is to do it and who may be open to criticism anyway for not having exercised their supervisory powers with sufficient diligence in allowing the purchase of this subsidiary in 1983.  I do not believe the administrator should be taken out because that is a guarantee to the Central Bank and to the public.  It is the Central Bank, the banking community and Allied Irish Banks between them who should solve this problem rather than having recourse to other areas, not simply because it is unfair to the Exchequer, and thereby the taxpayer, but because it is wrong in principle and will do enormous damage to the standard of honour and integrity in commercial dealings in this country if a major bank has to say &ldquo;My word is the bond of the Irish taxpayer&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The figures that have been mentioned are not so enormous as to be incapable of resolution.  What worries the bank, and I fully sympathise with them on this, is that because efforts will be made to resolve this &mdash; inevitably because of the nature of the problem it will take several years to do it &mdash; it will put the bank in some jeopardy because what counts for that bank as for any other is the confidence which lenders have, particularly those outside the country.  If it was made <Col N="979" /> clear that the Central Bank could stand behind it and hold it completely liquid in conjunction with the others, then I have no doubt that any crisis of confidence that might otherwise arise can be obviated.</P>
    <P>I cannot be certain that the proposal before us in this Bill will do anything to resolve the crisis of confidence in the bank.  It would be to the benefit of us all, to the economy and our commercial integrity if that was done.  I hope that some thought can be given to an approach in that fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of reasons, including the fact that I am likely to lose my voice because of flu, I will keep my comments as brief as possible.  In a debate like this there is the danger that there will be a lot of repetition.  Some of the points I wish to make I suspect may have been made already.</P>
      <P>We need to bear in mind the enormity of what has happened and the extraordinary good fortune we had as a country that the Ministers responsible responded the way they did and that the Central Bank and other banks responded as they did.  It is easy for people to offer great wisdom with hindsight as to how the problem should have been approached. In this debate I have heard people offer views which are unrealistic.  Some people have said, for example, that the State should acquire equity in the bank as a result of the contribution it is making. They ignored the fact that, if that happened, there would have to be an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of AIB to approve of such a deal.  Had that occurred there would have been a delay of a few days and the one sure thing that would have happened would have been a run on deposits in AIB, the credibility of the bank abroad would have collapsed and the economic order would have collapsed with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who make such propositions should think carefully about what they are saying, because it is nonsense.  I was astonished to see some senior reputable financial journalists make this point day after day in newspaper articles.  Some of <Col N="980" /> the suggestions which were offered might well have worked; but, as I say, it is easy to offer advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We should be very glad that the enormous catastrophe which might have occurred, and which would have dragged the country into total economic chaos, was avoided.  For that I compliment all the people concerned with this. It must have been a nightmare for the Ministers and bank officials involved.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy O'Malley and other Deputies who praised AIB in respect of their reputation and what they have done for the country.  I know that people complain that the banks will give one an umbrella on a dry day and take it back on a wet day; but the fact is that AIB and the Bank of Ireland have been outstanding contributors to the development of the country over the past number of decades and their contribution to our future is of critical importance.  They have carried the name of this country well with their branch operations in Japan, New York and all over the world.  We should be proud of that.</P>
    <P>Everyone makes mistakes.  I hope that in the coming months we will learn a great deal more of the detail of what happened, but it seems as if the bank made an indefensible error of judgment in the matter in which they acquired ICI. Perhaps there are explanations which we have not heard but the explanations I have heard in the media from Mr. Gerry Scanlon, their chief executive, have not been convincing at all.  The view in the financial world is that AIB did not do themselves any credit by the manner in which they acquired ICI.  However, all of that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>What we have to remember is that we, as a country, through our system of Government, our Departments and the Central Bank, actually regulate the insurance and banking industries.  Whether we like it or not the regulatory agencies failed us on this occasion.  There may be very good reasons for that, but the fact is that an insurance company almost brought down a bank which could have brought down the economic order of the country.  That is an unavoidable fact.  We <Col N="981" /> can talk about who was doing what in AIB or ICI, but at the end of the day the fact is that by a whisper we missed collapsing into economic chaos in an area where in terms of insurance it is regulated and watched by the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and in terms of banking it is watched and regulated by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we must look carefully at the way the regulatory agencies, particularly his own Department, operate.  I hope the Central Bank will also take a close look at the way they observe the conduct of banks.  For example, is there anything to stop the Bank of Ireland buying a company which could threaten to bring it down at some stage in the future?  Will we learn any lesson from this debacle?  At the end of the day the only lesson to be learned is that we must not rely on a private company like AIB to ensure that its affairs will never threaten the State but rather that the State, through its own resources, must ensure that something like this never happens again.</P>
    <P>I regret to say we had some warning that this kind of thing could happen when the PMPA collapsed.  Many Members of the House held the view that the management of PMPA was appallingly bad and that it could never happen in another company.  Unfortunately, we now have another example of what appears to be, through sheer bad management, an insurance company collapse.  It is clear that the controls we maintain over insurance companies and banks will have to be fundamentally reviewed.  I do not know if the legislation is strong enough or if when the Department note that there is something wrong with an insurance company they have the power they need to get that insurance company to correct whatever is wrong.  The Minister and the Department have the right to withdraw licences but obviously some tiers of control or powers should be there.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some indication of what changes he regards as being necessary in the powers his Department have in controlling insurance companies generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> We have to examine whether or not we want the banks to engage in other types of business.  In world terms, we live in a very small economy.  Even though AIB and the Bank of Ireland are very big companies in Ireland, when they get into world level business in the States or in the UK, the disaster which can befall them, if an error of judgment is made, or if some mistake occurs, is such that it could cause the collapse, as it almost did on this occasion, of our whole economy. We need to consider that very carefully for that reason.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see any witchhunt in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland but, if it will cost the banks, or the insurance industry, or the taxpayers a great deal of money, certain questions have to be answered.  I do not know whether the under-provision for claims the ICI allowed to continue for the past several years was justifiable in any circumstances. It was evident to other insurance companies and to some people in the financial world that the under-provision was significant and should not have occurred. The ICI might be able to indicate that they were able to justify the provision they made for claims.  I am sorry they have not done this.  I am sorry AIB have not offered some explanation over the past week as to why this was the case. Perhaps there is no justification.  If there is not, AIB should explain to us how, on something that should have been perfectly obvious to them, they did not see the trouble arising a long time before they actually did.</P>
    <P>The other question which arises and which has been flaunted in the newspapers regularly over the past week is the re-insurance business in London.  There have been claims that some of these transactions were reckless in the extreme and that there was an air of lunacy generating the type of activity that was going on in the London office of ICI.  We are entitled to some explanation as to whether or not there was this lunatic-type business and whether there was any sense in doing what they did and particularly the way they invested heavily in certain types of insurance.  I do not know whether <Col N="983" /> they could be justified at all.  There is a difference between making errors of judgment in business and being reckless or acting dangerously merely to generate a cash flow for reasons unassociated with getting in insurance business.  I do not know whether or not that was the case. The Irish taxpayer and other Irish banks are entitled to know why they engaged in that sort of activity and whether there was any justification for it.</P>
    <P>The question of liability arises in this context.  The Minister said the liability will range somewhere between £50 million and £120 million.  I understand that that is in respect of dealing with ordinary insurance claims over the next few years. I assume the figures the Minister is giving are accurate and based on some analysis that has been carried out of outstanding claims and I accept that.  I gathered from the Minister's speech that that only includes claims and does not include the costs involved in the re-insurance contracts if some of these contracts are repudiated.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House will have seen Mr. John Moore of the <i>Financial Times</i> on a &ldquo;Today-Tonight&rdquo; programme the other night making the point that it was possible that these re-insurance contracts could be repudiated.  Mr. Moore who, I understand, is a reputable journalist said that the liability involved then could be nearer £500 million than £50 million.  That is what the man said. If that is the case, we will have to review our position.  The Government made the correct decision to bail out the ICI and the AIB.  They had no choice.  They have no choice but to face up to the insurance contracts which are there and continue to provide cover for all those people who hold policies with ICI.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether I would be happy if the Irish banking system, or the Irish insurance industry through levies, and so on, or the Irish taxpayer should have to pay one red cent to some of the go-boys who are involved in the re-insurance industry in London.  I gather it is an upmarket form of bookmaking and a pretty rough business to say the least of it.  There is a view abroad in London that <Col N="984" /> here we have a company backed by the Irish State and all bills can be paid easily. I gather that many of the people involved in that re-insurance business will now use every means, honourable and otherwise, in the book to avoid their own liability and may repudiate contracts here and there in the hope and knowledge that somebody else will pick up the tab.  If that is facing us, and if we are in any way prevented from dealing with it as it should be dealt with, we should review our position and should not be willing to pick up tabs for the type of re-insurance contracts other people entered into.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something Deputy O'Malley said about the jury award system.  Over the past couple of years it has been very popular for attacks to be made on the jury award system.  Our whole legal system needs to be reviewed fundamentally.  No credit is due to any of the past several Governments for doing very little about this issue.  I believe they are mostly compromised by the senior Bar.  They would not admit to that, but that is the case.  The senior Bar are a super lobby.  We should face up to that and be willing to take them on.  I have no doubt that most of the reform necessary within the legal system could come from the Bar themselves if they were prepared to face up to it.  They have not been prepared to face up to it.  The Government should take steps in this regard. Reform is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years the level of damages granted by juries has dropped significantly and primarily because of the publicity which has been generated by insurance interests to try to convince the Irish public that the reason their premiums for motor insurance and employer liability are so high is high jury awards. That is too clever by far on the part of the insurance companies.  There are many reasons why the costs of our insurance premiums are the way they are.  In the employer liability field and in the field of motor cover, we have a far higher incidence of accidents occurring than they have in other countries.  The rate of road traffic accidents is far higher here than it is elsewhere in Europe.  That is <Col N="985" /> also the case in the employer liability field.</P>
    <P>It is a bit unfair to exploit the victims of motor traffic accidents or employer liability accidents and say they are not entitled to get their money.  People should bear in mind the fact that awards are made in serious type cases to satisfy people for their lives.  I will give a couple of examples which I can quote from my own first hand experience.  About seven years ago I was involved in a case on behalf of a girl who as a result of a car crash was paralysed from the neck down. At that time we got an award for her &mdash; the case was settled at the door of the court &mdash; of £220,000.  By the time she provided herself with the facilities she needed in her own home, and the changes which had to be made in her own home, by the time she paid off the hospital bills &mdash; which went into tens of thousands of pounds &mdash; and medical expenses and by the time she acquired the rotating bed she needs to avoid bed sores and paid for an electric wheelchair and the nursing care for which she must pay, she does not have much money left to look after herself for the rest of her life.  In other words, she has no other source of income. What seemed a large packet of money in 1977 or 1978, for her for the rest of her life is a pittance and simply will not do.</P>
    <P>In another fatal car accident case, a breadwinner with a family of six children died.  His widow was left to look after the family and educate them and the amount of money she got in 1976 or 1977 was £40,000.  That simply did not pay the bills that family have had to pay over the past seven or eight years.  These were figures which looked very fancy and large at the time.  We must face up to the fact that people are going to be killed and badly injured on our roads in traffic accidents and there is entitlement to proper awards.  I do not approve of jury awards that are completely outlandish, any more than I would approve of awards of judges that are too small.  However, we must be extremely careful in the matter of compensating people when damage is done to them.  The person who is quadriplegic as a result of a road traffic accident <Col N="986" /> should not have to take one penny less than he or she is entitled to, merely because we complain about the cost of car insurance to us.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that it was not the cost of motor insurance premiums that caused the collapse of the PMPA or of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. Seventy per cent of the business activity of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was generated in the London office, and there is no jury award in the UK, so the only common denominator we know of between PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was plain, down to earth bad management.  That is what we need to guard against, mostly.  We must seriously tackle the insurance cost problem which we very definitely have here. Let us look at the road system, the drunken driving and the level of uninsured driving, which latter is now of the order of 20 per cent of all drivers.  Let us tackle those problems and stop complaining about those who are the victims of these accidents and suffer most of all from them.</P>
    <P>In regard to what is to happen the ICI under the new company SAT &mdash; I give it the abbreviation given by Deputy O'Malley &mdash; I agree with other speakers who have made the point that the State should not stay involved in the insurance industry.  The earliest opportunity should be taken to withdraw from it.  We have no business in that field.  It is of no benefit to this country at all that we remain in it. The only reason for the State going into the business is the appalling situation that confronted the country a couple of weeks ago when the problem emerged. Whether we can get other insurance companies to take on cover of the policies that exist in ICI, I do not know.  An attempt should be made as early as possible to spread the work out among other companies and avoid the State having to remain in this area.  The problem with PMPA at administration level was more complex because it covered so much more work.  One must consider that only 30 per cent of the insurance corporation's business was actually conducted in this <Col N="987" /> country.  It should not be so difficult to dispose of it to other companies.</P>
    <P>I noticed with interest that the managers involved in the insurance corporation life insurance business side are very interested in buying out that aspect of the business.  I caution against that.  The managers of that company should not be given the right to buy it.  If possible, some deal with some other insurance company should take place spread over the whole lot.  There is a real danger involved here that the State will end up carrying the worst possible cover within all the activities of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and its associated companies.  That should be avoided.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy O'Malley who made the point about honour amongst the banking community.  I accept that the Government had very little option but to conclude the type of agreement they did conclude with Allied Irish Banks in order to ensure that confidence should continue to be reposed in our financial system and banking system. It was vitally important that the liability of Allied Irish Banks be absolutely clear and certain for that purpose.  However, the moral obligation of AIB is far greater than they have been willing to admit to. They are going to have to find a means of discharging that obligation.  I see difficulties for them in rushing in with millions of pounds more, if any financial institution would do any such thing to assist the Government.  Obviously, they have shareholders to deal with.  In fairness, there must be recognition of the other financial institutions who may have to pay additional levies because of this occurrence, and of the Irish taxpayer, if he or she is going to have to pay anything.</P>
    <P>In order to rehabilitate themselves from the mess in which they find themselves, AIB must be prepared to make extra concessions.  I do not know if the Government have the choice of avoiding any liability falling on the taxpayer.  I should like to join with others who have said that it should be the banking system and the insurance industry that should pick up the tab.  Even if they do, we will <Col N="988" /> all have to contribute something towards it, but at least in so far as emphasis is concerned, and this is of importance, that is where we should start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to rise to speak on this situation.  What we are discussing is management accountability and responsibility.  At present, we have not received from the Government as much information as we should be getting. It is all right talking about a figure between £50 million and £120 million.  As a previous speaker said, that was less then two years profits of AIB.  Is there any concern in the country, let it be in business, farming or anything else, that would not forego two years of its profits &mdash; if there were profits &mdash; to ensure not being held up to ridicule or that confidence would not be eroded in their regard?  The word &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; is the important word in this issue, confidence in the system, in the Government.</P>
      <P>There has been a long litany of debacles as far as high finance was concerned. Since the present Government came into power there have been this £500 million black hole and the milk output return, which amounts to millions also.  We have had the PMPA debacle and recently the question of massive funds in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The workers who are carrying the can and paying tax are entitled to more than they are getting at Government and departmental level.  I take issue with the Government who make great play of their ability to handle national finances. According to himself, the Taoiseach nearly has a monopoly of ability to handle these finances.  Still, we have had disaster after disaster in the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seriously understating the reaction of the public with regard to the AIB matter when I say that a vastly different performance was expected from that bank.  As one of our major financial institutions, which along with other financial institutions has reaped substantial profits from the Irish people, AIB have lectured, as other financial institutions have, various Governments on how things <Col N="989" /> should be done.  It is a great pity that they can run away without any accountability at all.  When this type of occurrence takes place we are told, with regard to top management, that perhaps this lack of accountability has been occasioned by ill health &mdash; in other cases the situation is met through golden handshakes and payoffs &mdash; but all of them leave with substantial pensions and remuneration for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister of State is present I might raise the jury system with him, something that has been raised by many speakers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Southern Health Board, which is responsible for monitoring foodstuffs in its area, for a report on the matter, and I will be in touch with the Deputy again when I have a reply from the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my question, up to 70 per cent of samples of cream were found to be unsatisfactory when analysed in the Southern Health Board region.  I understand that standards exist for milk since 1978.  Since there is such <Col N="990" /> an unsatisfactory situation obtaining in one region, can the Minister say if the same obtains throughout the country? Secondly, why have standards not been adopted for cream, because the position with regard to milk is much more satisfactory, with 21 per cent of milk samples being found wanting.  My two questions are: why are there regulations for milk and not for cream and, secondly, does the problem relate to the southern region only or is it nationwide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the health boards hygiene laboratory that the quality of cream on leaving the creameries is generally satisfactory.  As the Deputy knows, nearly all cream sold in Ireland is pasteurised.  Problems have arisen subsequently, either during transportation from the creameries or in storage at retail outlets, in relation to inadequate refrigeration.  I have asked the Southern Health Board for a detailed report of the problem in Cork and as soon as I receive it I will send a copy to the Deputy.</P>

However, the Department have issued microbiological guidelines for cream, also for milk, ice cream, eggs and fish which enable the public health officials to ensure general compliance with regulations.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is an urgent need to introduce orders in relation to cream since the figures to which I am referring are those contained in the public analysts report for 1983, which means that the matter is now urgent?

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether, in his view, reports relating to high levels of contamination in mincemeat are well founded and the action, if any, he intends taking in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a recent report of a survey carried out in the Dublin area of contamination in mincemeat stated that a high proportion of the samples taken had levels of contamination in excess of &lsquo;guideline&rsquo; values laid down by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this does not in itself mean that <Col N="992" /> the mincemeat sampled was unfit for human consumption it does indicate a poor level of hygiene at some point or points in the chain of production or retailing.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the recent Government decision to introduce measures for the better control of conditions in slaughterhouses.  Butchers shops are paid particular attention by health inspectors in the course of their enforcement of the food hygiene regulations and the inspectors seek to promote an informed attitude to hygiene among managements and workforce.  I am considering the preparation of an information guide for the trade and I will set out hygiene practices to be observed in butchers' shops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extremely full reply to my question. I understood him to say that the report did show a high level of contamination. I also understood the Minister to say that he was extremely concerned at this.  The Minister's response appears to be to provide an information guide.  Is there not something more urgent and practical we can do?  I might put it to the Minister that mincemeat forms part of the regular diet of a growing number of families.  Here we have a report which says there is a high level of contamination. Is there not something more we can do other than a guide, which, I accept, would be helpful?  Has the Minister's Department any other specific controls they can exercise, or can additional inspectors be put into this field?  I think the Minister would agree that it is a very serious situation, but I accept that he is concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would accept the Deputy's view that the bacteriological counts are disconcertingly high.  I would point out that mincemeat, of its very nature, is susceptible to large bacteriological populations and accounts reported to me were far too high by any standard.  Guidelines exist and the health boards are continuously making efforts to ensure that the highest degree of hygiene prevails at all stages after slaughtering.  I <Col N="993" /> will review whether statutory form should be given to the guidelines but they are very clearly laid out for the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the meantime would the Minister agree with me that the general public are not aware of what the Minister has just told the House, that they are not generally aware of the danger in this product.  While the Minister is reviewing the statutory situation would he not take steps in the public press, by way of advertisement or otherwise &mdash; and I would hope this debate would help also &mdash; to inform the public that this is a fairly difficult situation and that before purchasing this produce they should be extremely careful, asking whether the regulations in any given shop have been adhered to?  The public deserve to know the information the Minister has given.  It is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause lies in the poor conditions prevailing in slaughter houses catering for the home market. Any level of contamination may be introduced at the slaughtering stage.  The basic issue involves proper supervision and an effective programme of hygiene inspection, advice and enforcement in slaughter houses and then in butcher shops.</P>

      <P>In 1983 some seven hotels and holiday camps, 40 restaurants, seven butchers and pork butchers and seven fishmongers were prosecuted successfully. In respect of premises used for the manufacture and processing of food other than ice cream, some seven were prosecuted successfully, as were seven <Col N="995" /> mobile vehicles and 13 public houses selling food.  In all there were 124 prosecutions in 1983 in respect of the food hygiene regulations.  I hope that all those who endured the experience are still alive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards and ourselves endeavour to do that.  To put the matter in perspective, there are 3,170 public houses selling food and of these 13 were successfully prosecuted. There are 11,000 butchers and pork butchers and of these seven were prosecuted successfully.  Out of 86 fishmongers seven were successfully prosecuted.  There are 10,000 restaurants and of that number 40 were prosecuted successfully in 1983.  It is very bad to have had 40 prosecutions but that is out of 10,000.  We are not that dirty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>That allegation has been made.  The Food Advisory Committee and similar bodies in other countries have recommended the progressive reduction, so far as it is practicable, of the levels of nitrate and nitrite in food and they have also recommended that research into alternative preserving methods should be continued.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1982 nearly 31,000 people discharged from acute hospital had suffered from smoking-related diseases. In 1981 there were approximately 16,500 deaths as a result of smoking-related diseases.  While tobacco consumption <Col N="998" /> is a cause in many of these deaths other factors such as environmental conditions and old age are also involved.</P>
      <P>These figures indicate that the level of morbidity and mortality from smoking related illness in this country is extremely high.  Because of the serious risk posed by smoking to health it has been the aim of Government policy to reduce tobacco consumption through legislation and the activities of the Health Education Bureau.  The Tobacco Products (Control of Advertising, Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978, and the regulations made under the Act in 1979 impose strict controls on advertising and sponsorship by tobacco companies.  This legislation will be amended in the near future to strengthen the provisions and remove ambiguities which have become apparent in their applications.</P>
      <P>Last year I received the approval of the Government to draft a Bill to place further controls on smoking.  The proposed legislation will restrict smoking in certain designated public areas and introduce a health education levy on the advertising and sponsorship budgets of tobacco companies.  The levy will fund an expanded anti-smoking programme by the Health Education Bureau.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of these measures and increased health education activity should be sufficient to dissuade a great many people from beginning or continuing to smoke.</P>

Are the same criteria used in the UK and in Northern Ireland as those used here to identify these admissions to hospital due to smoking-related diseases and deaths due to smoking-related diseases?  If the criteria are the same is the Minister aware that the comparative figures for Northern Ireland show that the number of deaths is just over 2,000 and in terms of admissions about 3,000 people are admitted to hospital <Col N="999" /> each year?

The source for deaths from smoking-related diseases is the CSO data; and the estimate of deaths directly attributable to smoking range from 3,500 to 5,000 per annum.  The comparative data has not been challenged and is generally accepted by experts in the area.</P>

      <P>The programme has been quite successful.  It has had a definite impact on young people.  The biggest problem is the increase in the numbers of young women who are smoking.

I do not expect the Minister to answer here, but if the comparisons are fair and the criteria used to determine the number of deaths and admissions to hospitals are <Col N="1000" /> the same then there are 500 per cent more deaths here and 500 per cent more admissions to hospital here due to smoking related diseases.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent report by the medical correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> in relation to a company.  Officers of my Department had discussions with the company last week at the company's request following the publication of the <Col N="1001" /> article.  The company claims that its diet formula was different from the so-called Cambridge diet in that it did contain more protein.  The company also claims that, since their product went on the market some months ago here and in the UK, there have not been any reported health complaints of a major nature.  Some persons allergic to dairy products have had problems.  The Food Hygiene Advisory Committee have been asked for their views on the medical safety of such formulae and the company indicated that it makes it clear to people that the diet should be taken under medical supervision. I have asked for a report on this and as soon as I receive it I will forward it to the Deputy.  Pending the preparation of that report we issued a letter to the company, before they had a meeting with the Department, asking them to ensure that their sales representatives made it clear to users that they must have medical advice before starting and during their diets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the decision made in October 1982 to remove from the GMS items which could be purchased without a prescription and at little cost to the consumer, antacids were deleted from the list of available items.</P>
      <P>Where a patient is prescribed an antacid and its purchase would entail hardship he may apply to the local health board for assistance towards the cost of purchase.</P>
      <P>The question of restoring these items does not arise at present.  However, it is a matter which is kept under review with particular reference to the possibility of more potent and expensive alternatives being prescribed.  This would not be in the best interests of the patient.</P>

Will the Minister accept that in the last year in which antacids were used the cost to the GMS was about £447,000 while the most commonly prescribed drug now for stomach ailments, Tagamet, cost £1.8 million in the last year for which figures are available? Is the Minister not concerned that there may be drugs that are more potent being used now in place of antacids?  Is the Minister aware that many people who need antacids are not in a position to pay for them and that it is not practicable for them to apply to their health board for <Col N="1004" /> an allowance in lieu?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We must generally accept that antacids are generally a cheap product in so far as anything is cheap in this area.  They are available without a doctor's prescription.  Therefore, they were excluded from the GMS list in October 1982.  I am aware that concern has been expressed by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union at the prescribing of new products which are available only on prescription in substitution for the excluded antacids but I do not think a strong case has been made to change the position.  I do not have information on the amount spent on alternatives in the GMS.  I hold the view that the restoration of antacids into the GMS would be very costly.  There have been new significant breakthroughs in terms of usage.  I do not have the other detailed information which the Deputy requires but I will get an estimate from the GMS payment board and forward it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Contributory old age pensioners and retirement pensioners who have income additional to their pension, for example, from an occupational pension scheme may qualify depending on the amount of their total income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that old age pensioners generally are adequately protected by the <Col N="1010" /> existing guidelines especially with the inclusion of the age allowance which I introduced last year.  I do not, therefore, consider that medical cards should be issued automatically to all old age pensioners irrespective of their financial circumstances.</P>

      <P>Many contributory pensioners have been deprived of the medical card as the result of having a retirement pension.  Therefore, would the Minister reconsider the position of old age pensioners and raise the ceiling to qualify for a medical card by approximately 50 per cent?</P>

      <P>For a pensioner couple, for example, over the age of 66 the income guideline is £100.50 a week. On top of that anything paid in excess of £10 for rent is allowable.  If they are paying £15 a week they will be allowed another £5.  That is the guideline.  It is being kept in line with inflation and, generally speaking, with an increase of 7.5 per cent this year, it is above the rate of inflation.  Several Governments including the former Government considered this matter and decided that it should be related to income.  The former Government decided to give medical cards from July 1982 to all persons over 66 who were in receipt of social welfare pensions including contributory pensions. That decision was reversed in October 1982.  I am operating this as it was since October 1982.</P>

I ask him to tell the House when that decision took effect.  As the Minister knows, there was a change of Government in December 1982 and up to the time of the change of Government old age pensioners were still receiving medical cards.  I ask the Minister to tell us the date on which that decision took effect.  Also, will the Minister instruct the health boards to accept that a person who receives a full old age pension after <Col N="1011" /> investigation by a social welfare officer will not have to go through a second investigation by a community welfare officer at great expense to the health board in order to receive a medical card?</P>

      <P>Medical cards are <Col N="1012" /> issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of a health board are unable to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  In determining eligibility chief executive officers take into account the financial and other circumstances of applicants.  Those suffering from long term illnesses which give rise to substantial medical and drugs expenditure would have such cost taken into account and, indeed, viewed sympathetically by health boards.  Those suffering from one of a schedule list of long term illnesses have drugs and appliances prescribed for that condition supplied free of charge.  As part of their continuing review of patients' circumstances, health boards may issue a medical card rather than a long term illness book to patients suffering from one of the scheduled conditions where their financial and other circumstances would warrant this.</P>

      <P>The report of a working party comprising representatives of my Department, the health boards and the medical profession reviewed the operations of the General Medical Service including the method of paying doctors and was published in August 1984. That report concluded that a change in the method of payment would be desirable and that a modified fee-per-item system would be most likely to be successful in meeting the relevant criteria for a method of payment, including those of my Department.  Negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation arising from publication of that report commenced in December 1984 and are continuing.  I am hopeful that these discussions will result in a new method of payment which will <Col N="1013" /> satisfy the objectives implicit in the relevant section of the <i>Joint Programme for Government.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with the serious situation which has developed over the last number of years.  There have been many debacles in the financial area and I was quoting a reply given to my parliamentary question by the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism.  On 29 January at column 745 of the Official Report I asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he was aware of the high rate of insurance premiums which industrialists in this country have to pay under employers' liability compared with <Col N="1039" /> their competitors in other EC countries, and the action he proposed to take on the matter.  In his reply the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The level of awards is ascribed by many commentators to the existence of the jury system.  However, the Prices Advisory Committee on Motor Insurance, which reported in 1982, did not consider that the jury system should be abolished.  An alternative measure, to the effect that the trial judge should be permitted to guide the jury on the going rate of general damages, is being considered by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedures at present.</P>
      <P>He proceeded to justify why the jury system should not be abolished.  I was glad to see today that the Minister has decided to introduce other measures. Many industrial concerns are finding it very difficult to compete in the marketplace because of high employers' liability insurance.  Recently I discussed this with a firm in my constituency who export 99 per cent of their production.  They claim that their insurance increased from £18,000 last year to a minimum of £40,000 this year, despite the fact that they have a good accident record.  They say that the uncertainty in dealing with outstanding claims and the length of time taken &mdash; from three to five years &mdash; to settle cases are the main reasons for the cost increase. They also claimed that it was anticipated that there would be a 50 per cent increase projected for next year.  If that is so, it would mean that their insurance bill would be equal to the PRSI bill.  They say that a company like theirs competing on the European market find that their employers' liability insurance bill is four to six times greater than that of their United Kingdom competitors.  They said if the situation was not changed they would be in very serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism mentioned the figure of £120 million and said that the Government clearly intend to levy either the Allied Irish Banks or all banks and insurance companies to cover all or most of the <Col N="1040" /> liabilities incurred by ICI.  There are many &ldquo;ors&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in this, but it is a pity he could not be more specific.  We know that if the insurance companies and the banks are levied, this will filter back to the people who are already paying very high insurance premiums.  This is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>Over the last few months we have heard a great deal about the inadequacies of management in Irish industry, particularly in small family firms.  Members of the boards of ICI and AIB are leading lights in the Irish business world.  When one looks at the names of the directors and management personnel, one wonders how a small business could compete. The answer is that small businesses are more careful and do not buy a pig in a poke, which has happened in this case.</P>
    <P>When it was discovered that ICI were in financial difficulties Fianna Fáil avoided any action which would worsen the position, but because we did not take any action, it could be taken that we agreed with the Government's handling of the matter.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We must condemn the Government for their handling of this situation. We were told that the sum involved would be between £60 million and £120 million, less than two years' profits for Allied Irish Banks.  Last week a major industry in my constituency collapsed.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment and asked the Minister to take whatever action was necessary to ensure a continuation of employment for 65 people.  At no time did I ask him for money.  There would have been a more valid argument to look for money in that case than to expect the taxpayers to bail out a bank which got into difficulties because of mismanagement at many levels.</P>
    <P>I hope the least possible damage is done to our financial institutions but we must restore public confidence in the economy.  We cannot have a succession of bungling efforts; there was the £500 million, the black hole in the economy, we were unable to get our milk figures right and so on.  Measures have to be introduced, even if they are severe, to bring back an element of responsibility <Col N="1041" /> and confidence in the economy as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time at my disposal I cannot deal with all the points raised in the debate so far which merit comment or reply.  I should, however, like to try to place the issue in its proper perspective and convey to the House developments which have taken place during the past 24 hours which will, I hope, set at rest the unease felt by some Deputies about the possibility of losses arising from problems at the Insurance Corporation of Ireland falling on the general taxpayer.</P>
      <P>When these problems first came to the Government's notice it was clearly seen that they centred on an insurance company; as such, it was an insurance problem, albeit a large one.  Unfortunately, however, the company was owned by our largest bank and, while that did not make it a banking problem, it did immediately carry the danger that it might impinge on the operations of the bank.  The various components of the financial sector do not operate in water-tight compartments. The internationally-widespread growth in recent years of mergers, links, takeovers and associations between firms in differing financial subsectors bears eloquent testimony to the degree to which different parts of the financial sector are seen to be interdependent and mutually supportive.  It was with these considerations in mind, and especially because the insurance company concerned was owned by our largest bank, that the Central Bank was deeply involved in the discussions of the problem from the outset and assumed a clear and prominent place in the arrangements announced by the Government on 15 March last to cope with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second feature of the financial sector of which I would like to remind the House is that, of its nature, it operates on trust.  It would not be possible to carry on the financial business of the country if the component parts of the financial sector did not at all times have the implicit trust of those who deal with them, whether they be other firms or <Col N="1042" /> the general public.  At the heart of this problem, therefore, was the urgent need to put in place arrangements which would maintain public confidence and enable the unhesitating conduct of business &mdash; in both the banking and insurance worlds &mdash; without which the economy itself could not function healthily.  It is quite wrong, therefore, to view the speed with which the Government acted or the fact that they did not wait until all the details were known as in any sense a panic reaction, as some Deputies have implied. Speed in this case was not panic; it was necessary prudence and an essential ingredient in coping with the problem.</P>
    <P>This brings me to what is for many Deputies one of the more frustrating and even infuriating aspects of the problem &mdash; the uncertainty of its dimensions.  The problem has, in effect, three dimensions: past, present and future.  The past dimension of the problem is quantifiable and more or less quantified &mdash; AIB knows how much its investment has cost and we know, within reasonable margins of tolerance, the amount of losses, at least up to the end of 1983.  The present is also quantifiable but cannot yet be fully quantified.  We have, as the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism said yesterday, a first assessment of losses, amounting to over £65 million and some estimates of the losses likely to arise from the activities of the company to date.  It is not possible as yet to quantify the likely additional losses, though clearly we shall be in a better position to do so when the audit, which is at present proceeding, is completed and as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>While Deputies may be frustrated by this, as the Government are, they must not allow this to cloud the issue; it is in the very nature of the insurance business. These are insurance contracts on which no losses have as yet been notified but on which it may be expected that claims will eventually come through.  This is why, above all, time is needed to allow the full details of the story to unfold and to allow us to assess properly the true dimensions of the problem.  This is why the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and <Col N="1043" /> Tourism indicated clearly yesterday that the position will be reviewed &ldquo;in the light of the audit and of the claims experienced as they emerge over time&rdquo; and that the Government will assess the situation again not later than 31 December 1985. In a very real sense, therefore, the action taken by the Government and announced on 15 March was an arrangement to buy sufficient time to allow the problem to be properly assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being prepared. I apologise to the House.  I understood that they would be available before I came into the House.</P>
      <P>The essential uncertainty of the problem which I have outlined and its essentially unquantifiable nature, both in amount and duration, were at the heart of the Government's reasons for taking the action they did and in this view the Government were strongly supported by the Central Bank.  If the losses could have been accurately quantified, or their duration clearly limited in time, Allied Irish Banks could, by themselves, have coped with the problem &mdash; no doubt at considerable cost to their shareholders and with some disruption.  They could not, however, prudently be expected to cope with a situation where both the size of the losses and the duration for which they might run could not be charted with any assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank which, as I have said, was involved in these discussions from the outset, was strongly of the view, and so advised the Government, that for these reasons alone the prudent &mdash; indeed, the essential course &mdash; was to separate the affairs of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland completely from those of Allied Irish Banks and to cope with the insurance problem as a separate issue.  Because of the ownership of ICI by our largest bank, because of the possible implications for the banking system as a whole and because of its banking responsibilities, the Central Bank was closely <Col N="1044" /> involved throughout in putting together the package of measures agreed on by the Government and Allied Irish Banks.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism referred again to what the Government statement of 15 March provided in relation to funding, which was that it would be on a broad basis through a number of special arrangements involving AIB, the banking and insurance sectors generally and, if necessary and only as a last resort, the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the most recent development in this affair.  Hitherto, the Central Bank's involvement in the problem has been at management level. Yesterday afternoon the board of the Central Bank considered the matter at its meeting.  It decided, having regard to its statutory responsibility in relation to banking and financial systems generally, to indicate its willingness to provide sufficient funding, in conjunction with the banking system, within the dimensions of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and subject to the end-year reassessment referred to by him, to deal with the problem as it arises so as to obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer.  The Central Bank will be discussing with Allied Irish Banks and the other licensed banks the appropriate form and apportionment of this funding.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's decision by the board of the Central Bank means that the Exchequer will not now be involved in funding the administration of ICI.  I am sure that those Deputies who have expressed their opposition to this Bill &mdash; itself merely a vehicle for setting up a company to ensure that ICI is separated from AIB &mdash; because, mistakenly, they construed its introduction as meaning that the burden of the losses involved would fall on the taxpayer, will wish to reconsider their position in the light of the information I have just given.</P>
    <P>As to the arrangements we have made with AIB, they are as follows: First, AIB will make a loan of £50 million for a period of three years at a rate 4 percentage points below the three-year gilt rate, <Col N="1045" /> to the Central Bank.  AIB have further agreed that, should the emerging position and the reassessment at the end of this year warrant it, they are prepared to extend the term of this facility for a further period not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>Second, AIB have agreed to place a non-interest bearing deposit of £20 million with the Central Bank to cover the contingent liability assumed by the State in respect of the AIB's guarantee to the Institute of London Underwriters.  Third, AIB have agreed to share with the Government, in proportions to be determined when the ultimate losses are known, the proceeds of the bank's action against the former auditors of ICI Ernst &amp; Whinney.</P>
    <P>The total of £70 million provided in this way by AIB to the Central Bank will be onlent by the bank to the Insurance Corporation Fund to finance the operations of the administrator.  These funds will, of course, be quite separate from the moneys already in the fund which are helping to finance the administration of the PMPA.  Finally, I would remind Deputies of something I said at the beginning of my remarks.  Financial institutions depend on trust and can properly operate only in an atmosphere of trust and calm. Those who indulge in uninformed speculation about the affairs of financial institutions, wherever they do so, should be acutely conscious of the possible damage that they may cause by their very indulgence in this speculation.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland, now under administration, has itself a substantial cash flow which enables it to carry on its day-to-day business.  The £70 million of funding which AIB have put in place provides amply for any immediately foreseeable funding requirements of the administrator.  Yesterday's decision by the board of the Central Bank renders doubly assured the provision of any funding requirements that will arise and allays fears that losses arising from the company's operations were about to fall on the taxpayer.  These arrangements ensure that we can now concentrate on <Col N="1046" /> assessing the full dimensions of the problems so that we may all come to a sensible, informed view of how they are to be met within the framework of the arrangements which I have set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that has to be said in response to the intervention by the Minister for Finance is that we on this side of the House welcome the belated if dramatic change of mind on the part of the Government.  This is precisely what our leader suggested and precisely what the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism rejected.</P>

      <P>These arrangements ensure that we can now concentrate on assessing the full dimensions of the problems so that we may all come to a sensible, informed view of how they are to be met.</P>
      <P>It is hard to reconcile that statement with the statement made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who put the dimensions of the problem yesterday within figures of from £50 million to £120 million.  It is very clear from this belated but welcome conversion to reality expressed by the Minister for Finance that, even now, the Government do not know precisely where they are going or what the extent of the problem we all have to face may be.  In passing I want to note that yesterday morning this House was asked to accept what was in the words of the Minister introducing the Bill a relatively simple and straightforward purpose of statutorily underpinning the role of the State in respect of ICI.  The only issue presented to us was an issue affecting the administration of ICI and the need to provide indemnity funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this issue became public it is recognised that we have adopted a very responsible and measured approach. Nothing that will be said from our side <Col N="1047" /> will change that consistent approach.  It must now be acknowledged that within the past day the Government have had a very traumatic change of mind, perhaps on the basis of information which they did not have when the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism introduced the legislation.  On the basis of their awareness of the significance and seriousness of the matter they asked us to pass a relatively simple and straightforward Bill.  The Minister for Finance has now asserted that there is an inter-linkage between the various financial institutions and that we are not just dealing, and never were, with the ICI alone but with much bigger and broader issues.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that more than any thing else what has undermined the essential confidence the nation requires was the indecisive and contradictory approaches of the Government within the past few days.  We would all expect that the Government facing a serious issue of this nature would come before us and explain in a consistent way the scale of the problem and request the House to respond in a responsible way to the Government's proposals.  We are getting quite the opposite.  Our financial institutions must be underpinned in terms of their role in our economy and confidence internationally which this party have always supported in Government and in Opposition.  That has been undermined to a considerable extent by the approach of the Government.</P>
    <P>We must ask the Minister what is the relevance of the Bill he introduced yesterday.  What was the need for it?  Of all the options which were open to us, the Minister indicated that the ultimate decision taken by the Government was the decision he proposed to the House yesterday to set up the compensation fund.  Now it is being presented as a simple response to a decision made by the Central Bank.  Yesterday the Minister presented us with an unpaged script. Anyone who has had even the most limited experience in this House of ministerial scripts will see that what was presented to us yesterday was the product <Col N="1048" /> of a last minute decision on the part of the Minister concerned.  It had been changed and rechanged.  Paragraphs were deleted and pages were incompleted.  Up to the time he came into this House yesterday with two extra pages of some significance to be added he did not quite know what he was about to propose.  He said yesterday:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, whose job it is to assure the soundness of our banking system, was involved in the discussions leading to the decision to rescue ICI. Their strong view, as a regulator of the banking industry, was that the contribution by the bank that I have already outlined was the limit of what AIB could prudently be expected to make at this time.</P>
    <P>What has changed in the course of the day?</P>
    <P>The only reference to the Central Bank in the contribution from the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday was that one underlining that what he was proposing yesterday was in line with the strong view of the Central Bank.  Here we have the Minister for Finance coming in today and conveying to us that, in view of the decision of the Central Bank yesterday, the Government are now taking a position which will guarantee that the taxpayer will not be called upon to meet even the contingent liabilities as lender of last resort, if you like, arising from the ICI-AIB debacle.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the Minister's speech yesterday that that obligation was going to be placed, in the final analysis, on the taxpayers and the Exchequer.  He made it eminently clear that while his hope and expectation was that it might not be necessary, nonetheless he was underlining very specifically that in the final analysis, in the last resort, it would be the Exchequer that would, if necessary, underpin the liabilities that arose from the collapse of the ICI.  That was the position announced by one Minister yesterday and today the Minister for Finance comes in giving us an entirely different position.</P>

      <P>It is very clear that the Government, frankly, have been in a state of total confusion at a time when what the country required more than anything else, in the face of what was and is a serious problem, was a deliberate, consistent and direct strategy that the House would support, as was indicated from this side at all stages, which would underline the confidence in our whole financial structure and our financial institutions. That, I submit, is the first responsibility of Government but, unfortunately, in the way this Government handle business, they have done more than any one Government has done for a long time to undermine that confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told yesterday that the Bill was relatively simple and straightforward. Now it is going to be, and at least we have a belated recognition, much more than simple and straightforward. The Bill and its implications are complex <Col N="1051" /> and far-reaching.  Yesterday, we were being asked to cast the taxpayer in the role of the statutory re-insurer, without any clear indication of the amounts he or she might be called upon to guarantee. In fact, up to the announcement of the Minister for Finance now, the State was being asked to follow the imprudent, if not reckless, precedent of the ICI and the Allied Irish Banks in indemnifying against losses, the nature and extent of which were generally unknown.  This is why it was that this party, from the moment that the need for this was first published &mdash; and our leader spoke very clearly on our behalf &mdash; indicated that we could not, should not and would not, in conscience, accept such a liability which could be unlimited in terms of amount and, indeed, in extent of time.  Last week the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as follows:</P>
    <P>The only people in a position to work out the liabilities of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland are the team now working in the company and that will take up to six months.</P>
    <P>How then could the Minister justify, if that were the case, bringing in legislation yesterday that we now know was not necessary in any event, in which the Exchequer taxpayer would be bound to guarantee to finance the compensation fund to an extent that could not be fully known until, at the earliest, the first week in May if we required six weeks for the information to emerge?  If it could not be fully known until then, what was the urgency in bringing legislation of the kind we had yesterday, which is generating confusion?  It has done more to undermine confidence.  Certainly, the Government have undermined confidence in themselves long ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy understands what this is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has done more to undermine confidence in the institutions <Col N="1052" /> that are very essential and are a permanent aspect of our economic health. Can we now have some indication from the Government as to whether they now stand over the statement made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday that, despite the fact that we would not know the information for another six weeks he could actually say that it could be £50 million and perhaps up to £120 million but under no circumstances could it exceed the latter figure?  Can the Government tell us now that that, in fact, is a position to which they are adhering and on which they can stake their reputation, such as it is?</P>
      <P>Anyone with any knowledge of insurance contracts will appreciate that one of the main issues that distinguish these from other contracts is, as our leader and others mentioned in the course of this debate, that they are contracts <i>uberrima fides</i>, where you must disclose all material and relevant facts.  There is, at least, a suggestion that the re-insurers and underwriters of the ICI commitments are questioning their legal obligations under those contracts, on the basis that there was not a full disclosure of documentation or information which would bind them legally, either in terms of liability or in terms of a specific quantity.  If that is the case, that kind of issue could take, not six weeks but perhaps two years to resolve.  Nonetheless, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday could convey to us blandly that they were of an order of between £50 million and £120 million, without taking account of how the impact of these dramatic events could continue beyond six weeks, six months or 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we had from the Government, certainly before this debate concludes, a straight and clear indication of what they regard as being the extent of the total commitments.  The Minister for Finance today has said that it is not possible to quantify them and it would have been well if, before the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism made his statement yesterday or the Minister for Finance made his today, there had been a little consultation, in <Col N="1053" /> order to give the House some indication as to where precisely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot has changed since yesterday and before this debate concludes our apprehension on this side of the House is that something else might now emerge from Government which would change events dramatically again. The most important thing that should emerge from this debate at this stage &mdash; and all of us should acknowledge this &mdash; that despite the damaging effect of the confusing and contradictory approaches of Government &mdash; is the underpinning of the confidence in this economy and the institutions which serve it.  The potential of our economy is enormous, the potential of the development of our resources and of investment in this economy is enormous.  Just imagine the effect it will now have on those who will view us from the outside, particularly those viewing a Government who could not even discharge their basic responsibilities in relation to the monitoring of our insurance liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might illustrate, by way of the remarks of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday, the extent of the problem, in his lack of capacity to research, much less identify the extent of the problems of the ICI. The Government's role in the affair does nothing at all to inspire confidence that they have the requisite degree of judgment and skill to restore confidence in our financial institutions by protecting the taxpayer against unacceptable and unquantifiable burdens.  There is now a good case for unloading some of those responsibilities of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. He and his Minister of State assured us in this House in the last six weeks that there was no cause for concern in respect <Col N="1054" /> of the ICI.  That is what was put on the record of this House by the Minister of State.  Surely that is a clear illustration that neither Minister is aware of the extent of the problems and certainly not in a position to discharge their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism acknowledged in his speech yesterday that even two years ago his Department were concerned about the adequacy of the claim reserves of the ICI.  Despite that the Minister and his Department wasted one and a half years in fruitless, ongoing discussions with the ICI.  Despite the fact that early in 1983 he had acknowledged that they had cause for concern, all that continued between his Department &mdash; who have the duty and obligation to monitor and control &mdash; were discussions. What happened in the course of discussions? By September 1984 the Minister seemed to have come to the belated conclusion that his Department were not capable of sizing up the full facts.  Only in October 1984 did he engage a firm of consulting actuaries to undertake an examination of the Irish technical claims reserves.  Apparently about that time he accepted, just on trust, a statement from the ICI that there was no cause for concern in respect of their reserves on the London market.  Within two months of the independent firm of auditors going in to examine the situation &mdash; on the statement of the Minister yesterday &mdash; it became very clear that there were serious deficiencies in the information systems and the data base covering the London branch of the operations of the ICI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing up two separate investigations there.  He is quite confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indicating to the Minister that, when the world at large was at least aware of the reason to be apprehensive and to inquire behind the London activities and re-insurance commitments of the ICI, he whose job it is to monitor, regulate and control the <Col N="1055" /> insurance sector, blandly accepted assurances that all was well, when he must acknowledge now that all was far from well.</P>
      <P>I am saying very deliberately that the crisis in which we now find ourselves arose as a direct consequence of the failure of the Minister and of his Department to take the necessary actions, seek the necessary information, if necessary, to demand all accounts in respect of the London operation and to go through them with a fine comb as of one and a half years ago.  But it was not until the last few months, in the course of an independent audit &mdash; particularly when the AIB themselves approached the Minister's Department last month &mdash; that the full facts began to emerge.</P>
      <P>We were given bland assurances from the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday that, because of these assurances from the ICI, there was no reason to have any degree of concern.  He mentioned that the ICI were trading in a market in which they had long experience.  Does that not fly in the face of the facts?  They were trading in a market in which they had no experience &mdash; the market of re-insurance, in the re-insurance world in which they were very small boys indeed covering everything from re-insurance to Australian bush fires, to the blood stock industry and, we are told, in some cases, the success or otherwise of an English third division football team.  Are we being asked to accept that this was a market of which the ICI had long experience and, on the basis of that long experience, they did not require the same degree of diligent inquiry and searching examination on the part of the Minister and the Government that clearly in retrospect was absolutely essential?</P>
      <P>The Minister said yesterday also:</P>
      <P>It would be unreasonable to expect that the State should provide resources to double-check on the work done by auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since when do the Government of this <Col N="1056" /> State, or a Minister within that Government, discharge their responsibility by simply accepting the work done by auditors of any company?  Far from it being unreasonable to expect the State to provide the resources to double-check it is absolutely essential that the State should have the resources, expertise and skill to double-check to protect us against the kind of battle we now face.  In a world in which the major insurance corporations have people of the highest degree of technical competence, of post graduate qualification, dealing with their affairs it is fairly clear that the Minister and his Department have not got either the resources or the qualifications to compete much less to regulate the activities of companies with that kind of resources available to them internationally.  Even if the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is now, as he said yesterday, reassessing the capacity of his Department to deal with these issues and to discharge their obligation, then it must be said that it is a bit late.  It is somewhat late of the Minister, after two years, to come to the conclusion that he should reassess the capacity of his Department to discharge their statutory responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said the Government had a tertiary responsibility.  It should be said that, on this and any related issue, the Government have a primary responsibility, if not in terms of indemnifying through the Exchequer the consequences of a loss of the kind with which we are now dealing, a primary responsibility in ensuring that the financial structures of this nation are geared and controlled in every respect in accordance with tried and trusted procedures.</P>
    <P>For over 18 months now we have been calling on the Government to review the Central Bank legislation, particularly the controlling and monitoring of our financial institutions.  Each time we are told the matter is being considered by the Government and that very shortly it will come before the House.  For more than 18 months we have been asking for legislation to deal with limited liability: in <Col N="1057" /> fact, the then Minister, Deputy Cluskey, informed us a year and a half ago that it was ready but we are still waiting for that legislation.  Having regard to that it is very clear that the primary role of Government is not being discharged as a regulator, controller and monitor.</P>
    <P>I have often accused the Government of intervening too much in areas where they should leave matters to others.  I have particularly accused them of intervening by way of the introduction of penal tax levels and tax structures, thus suffocating the economic well-being of the nation.  However, in this area the Government stand accused of standing back and of not having any idea of how to discharge their responsibilities under existing law.</P>
    <P>We welcome the belated acceptance by the Minister for Finance of the principle we have been proposing from the start but more than anything else this debate has demonstrated that there is no basis whatever for having any confidence in this Government to regulate and control the affairs of this economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the action the Government took in the past few days in relation to the crisis that obviously loomed at the time.  There has been a great deal of speculation and uninformed criticism from many quarters &mdash; and I suppose that in the circumstances that is understandable &mdash; as to what could or should have been done in the circumstances. I believe the Government took the only action available when the crisis arose and they took a decision in a forthright manner and in a way that would maintain public confidence in the financial institutions of the State.  That was their responsibility and they discharged it admirably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance which has alleviated the fears expressed by many people in the past few days.  I listened to the Opposition spokesman on Finance who was critical of the way the Government had handled the situation but as matters have developed things have worked out exactly as the Opposition <Col N="1058" /> were suggesting and as many people outside and inside the House were suggesting they should.  In the final analysis the taxpayers, the bank depositors or the people with insurance premiums will not be left to bear too great a burden.</P>
    <P>In such a situation I suppose a question that should be asked is whether it should have arisen at all.  One must question the sequence of events that led to this debacle.  Everyone with a bank account is well aware that little happens from day to day that is not quickly recorded on a central computer and, where necessary, the alarm bells are set off automatically. I would be very worried if a financial corporation of the magnitude of ICI were able in the future to accumulate losses to such an alarming extent and with such rapidity without the alarm bells sounding. It would be very worrying for those of us in public life, for the taxpayers and for business interests if there was a repetition of the difficulties that arose in this case, the speed with which it happened and the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member here is aware of the supervisory role of the Government Department responsible and also of the responsibility of the major financial group involved.  When one considers that AIB cater for 40 per cent of banking interests, one can realise the dramatic impact that difficulties in this area would have had on business, on confidence and on the entire Irish economy.</P>
    <P>When the news first became known Members of this House were made aware of the concern of the business world. Many of those people had probably been repeatedly lectured by their financial institutions as to how they should run their business.  I am sure many of the business people here and outside the House have had to listen to these financial institutions tell them how to run their business affairs and I am sure they were told on many occasions where they went wrong.  All of us have had that experience. It must be a sobering thought for some of those financial institutions to find themselves in that position.  One hopes that will bring home to them the reality of business, the effects of competition <Col N="1059" /> and the speed with which business enterprises can go wrong and off the rails.  In a peculiar way it could have a beneficial effect on the whole system, or at least I hope it does.</P>
    <P>Had the Government not acted in the way they did, there would have been a serious knock-on effect and many aspects of Irish society would have been affected. I should like to quote from a document recently circulated by the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs relating to the number of people employed in the insurance business whose livelihoods would be affected, as well as the livelihood of many others in various enterprises that are insured with ICI.  The document stated that ICI employ approximately 800 staff in many locations in Ireland and elsewhere.  They gave a rough breakdown as follows: Head Office, 550; Republic of Ireland, 13 branches, 90; Northern Ireland, two branches, 20; Britain, four branches, 75. The document indicated the various aspects of business and enterprise covered by ICI insurance and it highlighted the absolute necessity for positive and decisive action to ensure that there was no failure to recognise the importance of keeping the show on the road.</P>
    <P>That has clearly been done.  The action of the Government last week and today will ensure that future Governments will be more aware of the difficulties likely to occur and the various commercial institutions will have more confidence in the ability of Governments to take control of that kind of situation.  The same document indicates that 8,000 people are employed in the insurance industry.  That indicates the magnitude of the situation.</P>
    <P>This is the second insurance problem arising in the last couple of years.  We continue to hear of the kinds of losses to which insurance companies can be subjected. We learnt in recent days of the high risks in the ICI business.  It is amazing that a company closely associated with Allied Irish Banks should have allowed itself to pick up the loss makers in the insurance area, the high risk insurances which other insurance companies <Col N="1060" /> were extremely reluctant to handle.  The general public will want to know why this happened.  They will want to know why this trend was allowed to continue for some time and how it will be possible to ensure that other companies cannot embark on the same course.</P>
    <P>The case of PMPA about which we had legislation not so long ago is a sore point for a number of people who were investors with the PMPS.  Those investors see their position in the light of recent events. They invested with a company closely linked to a motor insurance corporation which was taken over by the State but the State did not take responsibility for the money invested in the PMPS, which amounted to £18 million.  The primary concern there was to ensure that the motor insurance sector would continue in operation and they see their savings, in many cases their life savings, being utilised to shore up the PMPA.  It is one of the sad things that we are incapable of assuaging the feelings of these people.  I have great sympathy for the investors with the PMPS and I hope the Minister will consider that matter again.</P>
    <P>The fact that modern technology is available to the financial corporations to assist them in monitoring on an hour to hour basis the fluctuations in the market makes it hard to understand how a slide of this magnitude can take place undetected. That is something which should be carefully examined so as to ensure that we do not have a repetition of this in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the most repeated queries that most of us have had to deal with in the past few days is whether or not the taxpayer will have to foot the bill.  From recent developments I am glad to know that that will not be the case.  If we could have had the answer to that query a couple of days ago there would have been less speculation but it was something that took time and effort to put together.  It is to the eternal credit of the Government, and the Ministers responsible, in association with the Central Bank, that they moved swiftly and decisively to protect the insurance industry, the vast number of people employed in it and the people <Col N="1061" /> covered by employers' liability and other insurances.  By their swift action the Government showed that they were aware of the effect a delay would have had and that they were committed to dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>I am still concerned at the way in which this situation arose without sounding the alarm bells.  I am sure every Member of the House at some time or other was told by some financial institution that he was going in a wrong direction and was told how to run the show in a more efficient way.  I cannot understand why that was not done in the case of AIB some time ago and I cannot understand why decisive action was not taken earlier.  As a result of this experience I hope other companies similarly engaged, having regard to the massive impact of a failure or a mistake on not only themselves but on the economy, will ensure that they operate in a fashion that will make it impossible for a repetition of this crisis to occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House came into this debate with certain priorities in mind.  One was to ensure that the stability of our financial institutions was preserved and that strength, integrity and confidence in them were preserved. Secondly, we did not want the taxpayers to be asked to foot a bill they were not responsible for creating.  We also set out to examine as far as we could &mdash; unfortunately, it cannot finish in this debate &mdash; the dimension of the problem and how it can finally be resolved.  The debate took a different turning with the intervention of the Minister for Finance today.  The House will recall that from the outset of the debate on this issue Fianna Fáil adopted a responsible attitude.  We were conscious of the grave consequences that would result if we went for cheap political kudos.  There would be short term gain in that but serious consequences in the long term.  Unfortunately, while the Government asked everybody to adopt a responsible attitude in regard to this, many of their backbenchers chose to take the other road and not back the apparent stand being taken by the Government in holding the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> I do not think any other single issue in recent years has gripped the general public so much.  It has become increasingly obvious to everybody that the general public are not prepared to shoulder the bill for a mistake they did not contribute to in the first place.  The principle of liability should always be established. Our leader, Deputy Haughey, a week ago suggested that the problem should have been approached from a different angle on the first day.  That was not done. In fact, Minister Bruton ridiculed him and said he was totally out of line, was misguided and was not suggesting the correct way to approach the problem. What has happened in two weeks to change the Government's attitude to the matter?</P>
    <P>When one is dealing with affairs involving financial institutions the first thing one must be is decisive in one's action.  If one is indecisive and there is a lack of action an air of uncertainty is created in the financial world.  A lack of confidence results.  This feeds upon itself and develops a momentum of its own which, if one is not careful, one will not be able to stop. We recognise that this is a serious matter. We wanted decisive action but we did not get it.  For two weeks the Government lumbered along from indecision to indecision and, finally, produced a Bill which does not do any more than underpin a semi-State body.  The actions needed to run the collapsed ICI company were already in place.  An administrator had been appointed and Allied Irish Banks shares had been transferred to a shelf company, those shares being held by two civil servants in the Minister's Department. There are other companies in the State sector &mdash; for example the Irish National Petroleum Corporation &mdash; which as yet have not been underpinned statutorily.</P>
    <P>We have our views as to why it took two weeks to produce the legislation before us, the first 13 sections of which are clear cut and could have been copied out of any other Bill.  Another section amounted to a paper exercise transferring the liability from AIB to the Government for a guarantee of £20 million which <Col N="1063" /> had been given by AIB to the Institute of London Underwriters.  That guarantee did not require legislation.  I do not have any doubt that the Institute of London Underwriters would accept a guarantee for the £20 million from the Central Bank because that amount had been lodged in the Central Bank.  It was available for any shortfall that might arise under the guarantee given by AIB.</P>
    <P>The court appointed an administrator who had, under the 1983 legislation, access to the insurance compensation fund.  We are all aware that the accountant appointed by the High Court to take charge of the fund can go into the market place and borrow on the strength of the income from the portfolios he has and that the fund can be supplemented at any time by the Minister for Finance under section 4 of the 1964 legislation.  It is well to remember that a limit has not been set on that fund.  There was a limit of £1 million, but that was removed when we passed legislation in 1983 to deal with the PMPA problem.  Funds can be supplied at any time by the Minister for Finance but the only way those funds can be repaid is through the taxpayer.  We saw that unfolding.  We were conscious that taxpayers had to be protected and that is why we highlighted that matter.  Minister Bruton never ruled out the possibility of a mini-budget.  There was talk about such a move in the first week of this crisis. It is obvious that in the early days the Government had in mind asking the taxpayer to carry the burden.  They changed when they got the feedback from their own backbenchers.</P>

      <P>I will not concentrate on the contradictions in the Minister's statement yesterday and the contradictions involved in today's statements.  I do not have the time to do so.  Now that the Minister has intervened in the debate it is no harm to remind him that 70 per cent of ICI business was carried on in the London office and the remainder at home.  Throughout the Minister's script he made it obvious that his regulatory service was concerned only with the Irish scene where only 30 per cent of the business of the company was being carried on, although the corporate headquarters of the company was under the Minister's jurisdiction.  He was not concerned about the 70 per cent of the business despite all the warning signs that went out.  The Minister said that in 1983 he became aware of problems in ICI, but even at that stage he did not make any inquiries of the British Department of Trade and Industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that the position is different, but I am basing my statement on what the Minister said yesterday.  How any responsible Minister, with the alarm bells ringing all over the place and his Department looking into the Irish business carried on by ICI, would not think of making an inquiry of the British Department of Trade and Industry is beyond me.  I am not taking the responsibility from the British Department of Trade and Industry, because obviously they were not too concerned, despite the fact that in the market place in London everybody was referring to the serious position in ICI.  The day the Minister was introducing emergency legislation here to recover money from a bank business people all over the country were ringing to try to find out if the legislation concerned ICI.  I lunched in a city centre hotel and I was asked a number of times if ICI were involved.  The Board of Trade obviously fell down on their obligations because it was well known on the market what was happening to ICI over there <Col N="1065" /> and it is incredible to suggest that the Board of Trade did not know.  An article in <i>Business and Finance</i> last November sounded the alarm bells but nobody bothered about them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the House, the Minister tried to convey that the solutions were arrived at after two weeks of Government consideration.  They could not possibly have spent two weeks discussing the Bill which was introduced.  It is important to examine the statement of the Minister for Finance and, in that regard, I will examine the role of the Central Bank, quoting from his statement.  He said:</P>
    <P>It was with these considerations in mind, and especially because the insurance company concerned was owned by our largest bank, that the Central Bank was deeply involved in the discussions of the problem from the outset and assumed a clear and prominent place in the arrangements announced by the Government on 15 March last to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that the Minister said that the Central Bank was &ldquo;deeply involved&rdquo; because later on the said:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank which, as I said, was involved in these discussions from the outset, was strongly of the view, and so advised the Government, that for these reasons alone the prudent, &mdash; indeed, the essential course &mdash; was to separate the affairs of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland completely from those of Allied Irish Banks and to cope with the insurance problem as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Obviously, that was the view of the Central Bank, if we are to believe the Minister's statement, as late as yesterday. What happened to change the mind of the Central Bank?  Further on in his statement &mdash; this is a gem &mdash; the Minister said:</P>
    <P>That brings me to the most recent development in this affair.  Hitherto, the Central Bank's involvement in the problem has been at management level.  Yesterday afternoon, the board of the Central Bank considered the <Col N="1066" /> matter at its meeting.  It decided, having regard to their statutory responsibility in relation to banking and financial systems generally, to indicate their willingness to provide sufficient funding, in conjunction with the banking system, within the dimensions of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and subject to the end-year reassessment referred to by him, to deal with the problem as it arises so as to obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We see from the Minister's statement that the Central Bank was deeply involved and so advised the Government; yet the Minister said that the involvement of the Central Bank up to then was at managerial level.  When the Minister talks about the Central Bank, is he referring to the management?  Are we to understand from his statement that the board of directors of the Central Bank did not look at the problem over the last two weeks?  The statement implies that it was left to the management, who advised the Government.  Who advised the Government?  It is very important to know why the directors of the Central Bank were not brought in on the first day of the crisis.  The Minister for Finance also said:</P>
    <P>Yesterday's decision by the board of the Central Bank means that the Exchequer will not now be involved in funding the administration of ICI.</P>
    <P>When did the Central Bank decide otherwise?</P>

      <P>The Government were getting the advice of the Central Bank all <Col N="1067" /> along.  Was it advice from the management or from the board of directors? What is different now from two weeks ago?  When this crisis broke, decisive action was needed.  If the Central Bank had come in then we would have avoided all the rumours and counter-rumours regarding problems in the banking and insurance systems.  The Government will have to do a lot of explaining to convince the public that they could not have acted any sooner, because the first duty of a Government is to protect the financial stability of their own institutions, and we gave them full backing in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not doubt the Minister's figure of £65 million or £70 million, because they have had the best advice available from internal auditors and the actuarial profession.  The figures have been available to everyone, but it is illogical to suggest that the AIB would have suffered such damage and humiliation if they could have avoided it.  Confidence in the bank has been undermined, regrettably, because that institution is deeply rooted in our society and is a great flagship of achievement.  Our leader said, time and time again, that the Central Bank and financial institutions, even on a moral basis, should have stood behind them, if their sources did not allow them to carry the situation through, which I find hard to believe, although I know there was an erosion of their equity base.  However 50 per cent of their losses are written off against tax, so that their losses are halved.  If the equity base had to be protected then it was good business for the Central Bank, the Government and the financial institutions to do it because it has repercussions not alone for them but for everybody else in the financial scene. Why delay two weeks?  The lack of confidence that has been created in this economy is a hallmark of the indecisiveness that seems to have engulfed this Government for a long time back.  The first priority in an economy and in the financial institutions is confidence.  Without it we can go nowhere.  The Government can talk about all the policies they like, <Col N="1068" /> but if they cannot establish and retain confidence then all their efforts will be in vain.  Therefore, the first priority of any Government and this Government especially should have been to put in confidence where it was needed, but they lacked the decisiveness to do that.  Maybe this brings out one of the inbuilt weaknesses of Coalition Government.  Maybe it takes them too long to be decisive about issues that should be decided on the spot. Maybe that is one of Coalition's weaknesses. I do not know because I have never worked in a Coalition nor would I like to do so because I like to be able to implement what I believe in, and I am sure the Minister feels the same about it. Half a decision is no decision.  Either you take a full decision or you take no decision.  Half a decision must be the compromise of Coalition Governments and in a situation such as this it is infinitely difficult to take the decision which is so necessary in the interest of the country, the economy and the financial institutions. If this is a spin-off of Coalition Governments I do not want to be around to see another one and, I am sure, neither do the people.</P>

Let the Deputy ply his own business outside and if the people want to buy it that is fine.  I am speaking with conviction of what I believe are the dangers of this situation and the essential requirement in taking immediate action.  That is the action we were talking about.  Why all the damage for two weeks?  Was it worth it?  I do not think so.

The consequences for this country if things go wrong in a financial situation are too horrendous to contemplate.  Maybe the Deputy does not realise the seriousness of what is happening. The Central Bank are the regulator of the banking system.  The Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism are the regulator of the insurance business.  The speeches of both Ministers indicate that the lines of distinction were drawn clearly by the Central Bank for the last two weeks and that the insurance sector should be kept separate from the banking sector.  What changed their mind?  When I get an answer to that I might make a different assessment of the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance expressed political arrogance when he said:</P>
      <P>...those Deputies who have expressed their opposition to this Bill &mdash; itself merely a vehicle for setting up a company to ensure that ICI is separated from AIB &mdash; because, mistakenly, they construed its introduction as meaning that the burden of the losses involved was going to fall on the taxpayer,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who reads the Act of 1964 will know where the compensation fund comes from.  Is anyone trying to convince <Col N="1070" /> me that funds given out by the Minister for Finance into a compensation fund will not be paid by the taxpayer?  Who else is to pay them?</P>
    <P>I want to get back to the package and the figures and parameters set out.  The Central Bank have accepted the outside parameter of £120 million.  That is to be made up of a £50 million loan from AIB, £20 million that is already there as a back to back arrangement for the guarantee of £20 million to the London Institute of Underwriters originally given by AIB now taken up by the Government and £50 million obviously to be provided by the Central Bank.  I want the Minister to clarify that the Central Bank will be repaying the loan.  How will they repay the loan?  Is it straight from the money generated by the Central Bank coming from profits of financial transactions in banking and financial areas?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said that the losses for 1983 have been defined.  I understand the £65 million to £70 million figure to come from the losses for 1984 with an outside parameter of £120 million. After all the assessment and advice available to the Minister, that is the outside parameter he comes to.  I understand from Deputy Flynn that the contractual arrangements have been set aside by the administrator since he went in, no new business would be written.  I understand also that very little business has been written since 1 January, and that would indicate that the risk would be in relation to the amount of business, and I am sure they were much more careful in writing the business from 1 January than they were before that.</P>
    <P>What about repudiations of re-insurance contracts?  Is the Minister satisfied and will he satisfy this House that there can and will be no repudiations?  I understand that legal advice has been taken on this but the grave risk is that re-insurance companies when they see State involvement will seek any possible loophole in an effort to break re-insurance contracts. We all know that re-insurance is done on bona fides, on the basis that the best practices of re-insurance and insurance have been applied.  I do not know <Col N="1071" /> whether that is so, but rumours which have been going around for quite some time about ICI suggest that they were in re-insuring situations that even Lloyds would not take, for example insurance against a strike of baseball in America when everybody could sit back and let the Irish insurance company pay up when the strike took place.  There was also re-insurance against bushfires in Australia, satellites that did not go up or satellites that went up and came down when they should not have come down, re-insurance against the municipal authorities on the west coast of America and re-insurance against wrongful arrest.  These were all the highest possible risks and everyone knew that.  Is there not a danger of trying to break out of re-insurance contracts, and if that happens will the Minister agree that we will be in a bottomless well in that regard?  Nobody can quantify now or in three months the results if that should happen.</P>
    <P>What happens beyond £120 million? The Central Bank are in there now for £120 million within the parameters set. What will happen in six months?  What do the Government propose to do if the amount exceeds that?  Where is it to finish?  For the life of me I cannot understand why this legislation was introduced now when we are told the figures will not be available for six months.</P>
    <P>Most people have pointed an accusatory finger at Allied Irish Banks and said they bought a pig in a poke.  The Minister bought a pig in a poke.  He removed limited liability and replaced it by unlimited liability.  The shareholders of Allied Irish Banks can make up their minds about the people who run their business but the people of this country look on the Government as their board of directors and they will see how the Government perform their duties on their behalf.  This Government took on an unlimited liability on behalf of the people but they did not know how to handle it.  After all the uncertainty and lack of confidence that was generated, the Government finally came round to the view Deputy Haughey proposed a <Col N="1072" /> week ago and which they dismissed as ill-informed and unworkable.  The Minister produced a solution here yesterday and 24 hours later it had to be changed.  The Minister stands indicated of creating the worst fortnight of uncertainty in the history of this country.</P>
    <P>Is there something wrong?  As I know from experience in business and finance a person's word is his bond.  The day a man breaks his word his credibility is gone and people lose confidence in him. The day a bank breaks its word, it faces the same problem as an ordinary businessman. AIB should have got the moral support of the Central Bank, the other financial institutions and a Government who knew what they were about.  Unfortunately this Government's lack of decision in the last fortnight indicates a technocrat's approach.  We have too many technocrats in the wrong places. They do not know what the commercial world is all about because if they did, they would have realised the correct decision should have been taken on day one, and this would have saved the trouble that has been caused over the last two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that I as Minister of State with responsibility for the supervision of insurance should deal factually and clearly with the system of supervision of insurance undertakings under the relevant Acts and regulations, and the statutory powers which the Minister has under those instruments.  It is particularly appropriate and desirable that I should do so in view of some sweeping comments made over the past ten days and a certain amount of unease which has been expressed.  I am also very conscious of the statement by Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; a statement which I accept was made by him in good faith &mdash; to this House yesterday that the British Department of Trade and Industry had no responsibility in relation to supervising the UK branch business of ICI.  Deputy Mac Giolla's statement is nevertheless factually incorrect.  I would like that to be noted very clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The first thing that must be stressed is that insurance companies operating here are, like any other companies, subject to the Companies Acts and the attendant requirements involving the presentation of statutory returns and the responsibilities of directors and managers.  They are also, however, subject to much more specific financial and other requirements laid down by EC Directives which harmonise basic insurance supervision throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>To be more precise the supervision of non-life insurance undertakings authorised to operate in Ireland is grounded on an EC Directive of 24 July 1973, introduced into Irish law by the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations, 1976.</P>
    <P>The first non-life directive, as it is known, recognised the different considerations which arise in dealing with the head office and branch office activities of insurance undertakings and it established the respective competences of the supervisory authorities of the member states in dealing with insurance undertakings. In the case of head office companies, the supervisory authority of the member state in which the head office is located is responsible for the global activities and overall solvency of the company concerned, while the operations of EC branches are supervised by the authority of the member state in which the branch is located.</P>
    <P>In addition to defining the respective competences of supervisory authorities, the first non-life directive also specified the mechanisms by which supervision was to be carried out.  It addressed the question of reserving for the underwriting liabilities incurred in different territories by providing in Article 15 that each member state in whose territory business is carried on must require an undertaking to establish sufficient technical reserves. Such reserves are required to be covered by equivalent and matching assets localised in each country where business is carried on.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, each member state supervises the branch operations of an insurance undertaking, and the <Col N="1074" /> returns and accounts furnished by the branch office to its supervisory authority feed into the head office accounts.  The supervisory authority of the member state in whose territory the head office of that undertaking is situated then verifies the state of solvency of the undertaking with respect to its entire business.  The solvency margin of an insurer is essentially a cushion of free reserves to guard against either the over-estimation of assets or the under-estimation of its liabilities.</P>
    <P>The general approach adopted by each supervisory authority in examining accounts submitted to it is to assess the nature and acceptability of assets to cover liabilities, and to test the reasonableness of the reserves set up by each insurer in respect of the business written in the member state concerned.  Supervisory authorities are not entitled to impinge on one another's supervisory competences, nor is the head office supervisory authority responsible for resolving any operational uncertainties at branch level in another member state.</P>
    <P>It can be seen therefore that the supervisory authority of a branch has only to look after the proper running of that part of an undertaking's business in their own territory.  The supervisory authority of the head office, which is responsible for the global activities and overall solvency of a company, may require collaborative evidence from supervisory authorities of branches in order to verify the value of an undertaking's actual solvency margin. The supervisory authorities of branches are required to take the initiative towards the supervisory authority of a head office in pointing out differences which they note between branch accounts and the particulars supplied to the supervisory authority of the head office, and pointing out shortcomings in the management of the branches of which they are aware.</P>
    <P>With regard to the latter type of information, it is made clear that supervisory authorities of branches may judge freely what information is sent to the supervisory authority of the head office, and when to send it.  Under the formal EC <Col N="1075" /> Protocol of Collaboration between insurance supervisory authorities, each supervisory authority may make requests to and receive from other supervisory authorities information which it needs in order to carry out the responsibility for supervision which is laid upon it, provided that the requests made do not detract from the division of competences between supervisory authorities as provided for by the directive.  As I have already made clear, the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom were required to ensure that the London branch of ICI established sufficient technical reserves covering the business carried on by the London branch office.  In other words, this was not within the competence of my Department as the supervisor of the head office operations of ICI.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I would point out that my Department, in relation to its supervisory functions covering branches of EC undertakings established in Ireland, have had occasion from time to time to insist that remedial measures be taken at branch level in Ireland to ensure that the Irish technical reserves are fully covered by branch assets, in the interests of protecting the Irish policy holders concerned. This has arisen in those instances where, arising out of its analysis of the branch accounts submitted to it, my Department have concluded that the assets put forward in the branch accounts to cover the branch technical reserves are insufficient to meet the eventual liabilities of the branch operation in Ireland.  I emphasise this point particularly for the benefit of Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    <P>The basic requirement imposed on insurers by the first non-life directive relates to the maintenance of solvency.  The Minister has specific powers to take action in cases where the technical reserves provisions or, in the case of head offices, the solvency margin are not being met.  These powers envisage a direct intervention in the activities of the insurer through the issue of directions to suspend business, the furnishing of deposits to the Minister, or such other measures as are deemed necessary, including the disposal <Col N="1076" /> of assets.  In the case of failure to meet the solvency margin requirements, the Minister may as an initial step require a scheme to be submitted to him for restoration of the financial position.  If the solvency margin falls below the guarantee fund amount, which is one-third of the full solvency margin, the submission of a short term finance scheme would be required.  The ultimate sanction under the 1976 regulations, if an insurer fails to filfil its obligations, is the withdrawal of authorisation.</P>
    <P>That, then, is an outline of the system of supervision as set down in EC directives. I will now deal with the practicalities of checking on the financial state of authorised insurers.</P>
    <P>The compiling and presentation of insurance accounts requires the exercise by the company &mdash; its underwriters, its claims estimators, statisticians and in some cases actuaries &mdash; of a high degree of professional judgment which is the product of very considerable specialised expertise.  Approval by the board of directors and certification by the statutory auditors add the final seal of approval.</P>
    <P>The examination of accounts by my Department, while essentially a test of the reasonableness of what the insurer produces, is quite detailed and searching. Starting with the company's revenue account, it is possible to identify the underwriting result per category of business, and we examine the individual factors contributing to these results.  Close attention is paid to the loss ratio arising in each category of business, to the cost of claims incurred, average claims cost and, very importantly, by reference to the claims settlement analysis it is possible to trace the accuracy of initial provisions for outstanding claims as reflected in the final settlement costs.  This analysis provides basic indicators from which decisions can be taken on the need to pursue reserving procedures with the company concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not at all unusual to request more detailed reports on particular aspects of an insurer's business activities or to require the early submission of financial <Col N="1077" /> data.  This does not mean that the insurer is insolvent and unable to meets its liabilities; not does the fact that insurers are called in to the Department to discuss their accounts have any significant connotations. The investigation of such matters is a normal part of the supervisory function. After all, the requirement to meet the solvency and reserving criteria is ongoing and the task of supervision is not simply the checking-off of forms received once a year, although the analysis of the information provided in this way is essential to the process.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department for a number of years have engaged expert consultants to carry out in-depth examinations of a particular company or of certain aspects of a particular company's business. Such examinations can be directed at clarifying particular features of a company's activity or it may be part of our ongoing system of random checks which is applied as a back-up to normal supervisory procedures.  In doing this we seek to pursue a balanced approach by dividing our attention between the newly-established companies and those which are longer established in the market.  The information gained from these examinations can also provide useful indicators in areas to be watched more closely in the future.</P>
    <P>By and large, our experience is that the affairs of insurance undertakings are managed by responsible people who are fully aware of both their duties under the law and their professional responsibility to the insuring public.  They co-operate fully with the Department in filing the returns legally required of them and in supplying any further information which may be requested in connection with these.</P>
    <P>In relation to the London branch office of the ICI, where the bulk of the losses arose, supervision is reposed by the statutory measures of the EC in the UK Department of Trade and Industry, and the Irish supervisory authority had every reason to be satisfied with what had been cleared by that supervisory authority.  In respect of the head office, as the Minister mentioned in his Second Stage speech, <Col N="1078" /> we proceeded to ask questions of the company some two years ago and, despite what might be termed as reasonable answers, in the absence of a marked improvement in performance it was decided that the 1983 year-end accounts would be given priority examination and a more thorough analysis of areas which we had identified as rather worrying.</P>
    <P>Arising from its examination of ICI's 1983 accounts, which were forwarded to the Department at the end of June 1984, my Department arranged a meeting for 17 August 1984 with representatives of the company to discuss matters of concern, concentrating particularly on the adequacy or otherwise of the outstanding claims provisions struck in the 1983 accounts.  Very detailed questions were put to the visitors at that meeting and the company was requested to respond as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Department made it clear that, having examined the Irish claims reserves of the company in the 1983 accounts, it appeared that the provisioning of the company in this respect was inadequate. The company had been striking its claims reserves on an individual case estimate basis and the Department stressed that there appeared to be reserving problems resulting from this procedure.  The company was advised strongly that the case estimating procedures should accordingly be supplemented by statistical and actuarial techniques to ensure that the reserves would be adequate at the end of the day when all claims were settled.</P>
    <P>At the time of the meeting with ICI representatives on 17 August 1984, the Department had already decided to enlist the aid of an actuarial consultant to examine the Irish claims reserves of the company's affairs.  It was while that exercise was in progress that the company's own internal examination, which the bank is understood to have initiated, revealed the £23 million under-reserving for outstanding claims announced on 14 November 1984.  That led to a strengthening of reserves and an injection of £30 million paid-up share capital by the bank in early <Col N="1079" /> December.  The Department's consultancy exercise confirmed that the reserves of the Irish business of ICI, as strengthened by the injection of £30 million were reasonable.</P>
    <P>A further meeting took place between my Department and representatives of Allied Irish Banks and ICI on 14 November 1984.  The purpose of that meeting was to discuss the ICI results contained in the half-year results of AIB for the period ended 30 September 1984, which were being released to the media at that time.  My Department raised questions at that meeting in relation to the financial and trading position of the London branch business of ICI.  We were advised that there was no under-reserving in the London branch and that a deliberate policy had been pursued to cut back on gross premium growth in London to bring matters fully under control.  It is also relevant that the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK, who were responsible for supervising the branch activities of ICI in London, had not communicated any concerns to my Department. Accordingly, my Department had no reason to pursue matters further at that stage.</P>
    <P>There were allegations by both Deputy Haughey and Deputy Flynn during the debate yesterday to the effect that I deliberately misled the House when answering questions at the end of January 1985. That is a serious allegation.  I emphatically refute those allegations.  At the time I was answering questions about whether any insurer had refused business or indicated that it was not open for business during 1984 and if I accepted that there was a crisis existing in the writing of non-life insurance business in this country.  In reply I indicated that I was not aware of any insurer intending to pull out of the Irish market, and furthermore that I did not accept the latter proposition that there was a crisis in the industry.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies seem to be inferring now that because of what has come to light in relation to ICI, that I was deliberately misleading the House when I made those statements.  I was not.  In the particular case of ICI, my Department had <Col N="1080" /> identified a problem in relation to its Irish business and AIB had injected £30 million into ICI during December 1984.  The consultant actuary employed by my Department had confirmed that the corrective measures were adequate in relation to ICI's Irish business.</P>
    <P>No problems had arisen at that stage in relation to the UK branch business of the company, which was under the supervision of the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom.  My reply at the end of January was, therefore, based on the information available to my Department at that time, which indicated that the Irish business of ICI was adequately provided for.</P>
    <P>I resent the allegations made by Deputy Haughey and by Deputy Flynn. On a number of occasions, particularly at Question Time, I have heard wild supplementary questions from Deputy Flynn which, to my mind, are geared to cause unease to the public in relation to the insurance industry.  Deputy Flynn should be more responsible in his questioning. As a former Minister in the Department he knows full well the conditions in the Irish insurance industry in general.  His attitude at Question Time leaves something to be desired.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate yesterday Deputy Prendergast referred to the &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; scheme of compensation in respect of occupational injuries in operation in New Zealand and indicated that the scheme had been abandoned due to its uneconomic cost.  Deputy Prendergast considered that the costly experience in New Zealand of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; cover represented a good case for the retention of the jury trial system in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that Deputy Prendergast put this view in good faith, I must beg to disagree with this statement regarding the alleged abolition of the New Zealand scheme.  The system referred to operates under the Accident Compensation Act, 1972, and provides compensation for personal injuries to victims of accidents at work, or in the home, and of motor accidents.</P>
    <P>Although the scheme has recently been tightened up to discourage claims of a <Col N="1081" /> questionable nature, the levels of compensation for injuries of a minor nature have been revised and certain administrative changes have been made.  My Department have been advised by the New Zealand Embassy in London that the scheme is still in operation and, to the best of their knowledge, there is no question of the operation of the scheme being suspended or discontinued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the insurance market in general, it is recognised that the increasing incidence of claims and the growth in size of claims, and the degree of competition from outside companies which have come in and established in the Irish market, together with the recession itself, have put considerable strain on what is by European or world standards a relatively small industry built up carefully since the thirties.  That policy of building up an Irish insurance industry brought enormous benefit to the economy as a whole and in the welter of recent exchanges of a depressing nature, that should not be lost sight of.  It is important to the nation generally that our insurance industry is maintained and developed to face competition.</P>
    <P>Apart from the claims problems which I have just mentioned and which are largely associated with a period of high and continuing inflation, I think it only fair to mention some of the other difficulties under which we operate.</P>
    <P>First, there is the inevitable time-lag involved in the filing and examination of statutory returns with the result that where remedial action is called for a certain amount of ground may need to be made up.  I do not consider this matter is a serious one because generally we are dealing with companies on an on-going year in year out basis.  While it seems to be a problem I would not consider it a major problem.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the fine line which must be drawn between too much and too little enabling statutory powers &mdash; in other words, the continuing need to strike the correct balance between, on the one hand, the outright protection of the man in the street in his dealings with the institutions and, on the other, the normal <Col N="1082" /> commercial freedom and professional competence of these institutions in carrying on their business on a day to day basis. Put another way, too little supervision would mean that a supervisory authority did not exercise intelligent judgment and apply yardsticks devised from its experience and its knowledge of the industry as a whole and, in particular, that it failed to call on any company or branch of a company to explain trends which looked unusual or abnormal; while too much supervision borders on taking the management responsibilities out of the hands of the underwriters, claims estimators, etc., whereas they, together with the directors of the company, must always carry that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Clearly, now, there is a necessity for careful stocktaking of the economic climate in which the industry is functioning and of the legal procedures which put pressures on claims.  Such an exercise is as much the responsibility of the industry as of the Minister.  Also, admittedly, we will have to look at how much further supervision can be strengthened and improved, but always consistent with the primary responsibility of management and the supporting experts within the insurance companies for &mdash; and I would stress this &mdash; it must always be remembered that supervision does not amount to doing those people's jobs.</P>
    <P>In the area of motor insurance the Government have pressed forward with the implementation of the measures announced in October 1983 on foot of the recommendations made by the Prices Advisory Committee.  In regard to the further implementation of the Government's measures on motor insurance, the Government set up in February of this year a working group of Ministers of State to monitor and ensure the earliest possible implementation of the measures announced in October 1983.</P>
    <P>I have tried in the course of my speech to deal a bit more technically than I normally would in a contribution in this House with the technical workings of my Department in relation to the insurance industry.  It was necessary for me to do so on this occasion.  I wanted to paint the <Col N="1083" /> picture of how my Department exercise their responsibility for the insurance industry.  I am satisfied that the officials of my Department are of a high calibre and that they carry out their duties in an excellent way.  Where necessary, we bring in outside consultants.  That is as it should be.  We may need to strengthen some aspects of our work.  That would be a normal on-going and positive thing to do in any organisation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the crisis which came upon the ICI was most unfortunate.  An explanation will, I am sure, be forthcoming in the weeks ahead.  The Opposition should not express an opinion that there is confusion about the relative contributions of AIB and of the banking system generally. The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism yesterday dealt clearly with the contributions coming from the AIB and with the view of the Central Bank.  He said the contribution mentioned was the limit which the bank could prudently be expected to accept at that time.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Finance has now dealt with is the role of the Central Bank following the decision of the bank's board yesterday.  That decision opens the way for the contribution from the banking sector in general to which the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism referred yesterday.  This is, of course, quite separate from the AIB contribution. As both Ministers have indicated, the steps which have been taken are a measure of the Government's resolve that the taxpayer should not have to shoulder the burden of these very necessary steps to protect our financial sectors. I comment on the speed, firmness and preciseness of the Government's actions in this matter.  It is clearly necessary, because we must have confidence in our financial, insurance and banking sectors. The Government's move firmly to take control of the situation was the correct one and will result in the continuation of full confidence, both at home and abroad, in our financial sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly agree with the last remarks of the Minister. <Col N="1084" /> Nobody in this House has any interest in doing anything to affect the financial institutions of the State.  It is because of that wish that this Bill has been debated and we have had the various restrained discussions in the last week or so.  Perhaps in some of the contributions, and outside the House, figures have been thrown around fairly loosely, or perhaps not so loosely, but it is hard to substantiate them.</P>
      <P>This party have gone along with the figures stated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. We are talking about a liability ranging between £75 million and £125 million. I do not wish to go back over many of the arguments already put, but in the final reply to this debate there is an obligation on the Minister to answer the questions which have been raised by so many Members.  Is that the honest case believed by the various people who have examined these figures &mdash; the actuaries who went in during the days before the Government took over, the officials of the Departments, the administrator in his initial examination &mdash; and with the information that was obviously available through various contacts with the London and American insurance field?  If so, a major question must be asked about the leadership in the AIB.  Why did they, last Friday week, ask the Government to take over the liabilities of ICI if these did not amount to much more than one year's profit?  I could give all the arguments on that, but various people on all sides of the House have dealt with these.  In the last day or two since this debate started the Minister must have had the opportunity to consult with AIB leadership on this matter.  If a good answer is not forthcoming, I retain the right to say more on that matter over the next few days.  The public and this House and all the financial institutions outside of AIB and ICI, deserve an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length, as was his job and duty, about the supervisory end within the Department.  Perhaps he felt that he was being accused.  I shall take him on his word that the information which he gave to the House around the <Col N="1085" /> time of the budget was the best information available.  With the greatest respect, I am sure the Minister is as disappointed as anybody to see how widely out of order that information was.  I know that he is not satisfied and that he must come in and read out parliamentary briefs.  However, if that is the best information that section can give to the Minister on a matter pertaining to a company which is in the state the ICI are in at present, I would seriously take whatever action was necessary to sort out the section.  Perhaps it is a matter of control.  It may not be the fault of individuals, but the whole procedure that allows information like that to be given to the Minister is to be deplored.  It is not just good enough, to put it quite straight and simply.</P>
    <P>Speaking to my brief as spokesman on Labour, there is the matter of 800 people's jobs involved in all this.  It is almost amusing to hear about everybody being worried about the investors, private institutions and funds, with nobody being interested in these 800 jobs, or the jobs of 8,000 in the insurance industry. The position must be made clear for the sake of the future of these people, their career structures and related matters. Where do the staff stand and who are their bosses?  Does the appointment, in the High Court, of the administrator, made under the 1983 Act, make him now totally in control, or is this legislation setting up a semi-State body and legalising the shares in a holding company? Does that make that board the employer? The 1983 Act has wide powers, which obviously were not used.</P>
    <P>Will there be terms of reference for the administrator and his staff, on how they will deal with the semi-State company? Will the liquidator be the chief executive officer of the semi-State body, or is that just a device to legalise the handing over of the shares, or is the 1983 Act to be enforced as in the case of the PMPA?  It is important to draw the clear distinction, from the staff's point of view, as to whether it is the administrator, or the holding company set up under this Bill, with a board of five people?  Who are the employers and what controls will they <Col N="1086" /> have?  If an administrator becomes involved in the same type of area as in the PMPA, in reducing staff and disentangling the company, and doing goodness knows what, a clear brief should be set out.</P>
    <P>While our initial job would be to put ICI on some type of sound basis, we should know the structure by which this company will be run from tomorrow on when, presumably, this Bill will be passed.  It is only fair that that be set out quite clearly.</P>
    <P>What is the future of the finance and insurance industries, particularly the latter, which comes within his brief.  I am glad there has been a major change today from yesterday, when it seemed, perhaps, that levies on the insurance companies would have been passed on directly to the consumer, and the taxpayer, if not directly, would indirectly shoulder the ICI burden.  The speech made today by the Minister for Finance changes that.  It will now be the Central Bank, the financial banking institutions, which will bear the burden.  It is now a banking matter, which we tried to ensure a week ago.</P>
    <P>What will happen in the long term? What are the plans and proposals of the Minister?  What ideas has he, in his supervisory function?  What has he done since November 1983?  With the collapse of the PMPA in 1983 there was imposed a levy on all of the insurance companies that were not involved, which last year amounted to £11 million, to allow the PMPA to continue as a sort of semi-State company even though there was no legislation to render them a semi-State company at that time.  Those companies are now being asked to compete with the very company in respect of which they are paying a subsidisation levy.  Put bluntly the PMPA can go into the market undercutting the companies paying the levy to maintain them viable.</P>
    <P>If the same type of thing happens in regard to ICI, if somebody else is paying the levy &mdash; thank God it is not the taxpayer &mdash; where does that leave us?  Every time a commercial company gets into difficulty must the State pick up the tab <Col N="1087" /> whether through Central Bank levies, direct deficits or otherwise to the extent that companies in the commercial sector will be justified in asking: how can one make money in this country?  How can one run a commercial business when the State makes one pay a levy to maintain a company run by it and when that company can go out and undercut one? Sooner or later there must be an inquiry initiated &mdash; one that will not take five years to report &mdash; into what will happen the insurance industry so that people will know what is the commercial climate in which they must operate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position for the staff in ICI and the other 8,000 involved in the insurance industry, the various staff association and trade unions involved.  Second, he might say what will be done for commercial companies, letting the various boards of directors know where they stand.  Even if it is 18 months too late I gather that the actuarial advice and assistance available to the Minister's Department will be forthcoming in order that some kind of credibility will be attached to the information they supply.  I am sure that will be done without delay.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism said:</P>
    <P>An important focus in this debate will be on the contribution by Allied Irish Banks to the rescue of ICI...</P>
    <P>He continued to say:</P>
    <P>In fact they are contributing as follows:</P>
    <P>Then he listed the various things that AIB were doing, the second last mentioned being the sale of a 20 per cent shareholding in the profitable and healthy Insurance Corporation Life, also for £5.  As I understand it 80 per cent of the shares of that company are held by ICI and, therefore, by Allied Irish Banks.  I might ask the Minister is that an error or is it not an 80 per cent stake held by ICI and AIB?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State has clarified some of the points made in the course of this debate to date. I might raise a few not yet clarified.</P>
      <P>In relation to the London branch of the ICI I understand that the Minister has replied to the point raised yesterday by Deputy Mac Giolla about the role of the British Department of Trade and Industry and the various EC legislation. Perhaps the Minister would clarify for me exactly what is their role.  Was he saying in his speech a few moments ago that the British Department have a responsibility under company law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is that, under EC non-life regulations, the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain is the regulatory authority for branches of insurance companies operating in England, just as an EC head office company with a branch in Ireland is the responsibility of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism here.  Our Department are then the regulatory authority and have legal responsibility for overseeing the branch.  The UK Department have a legal responsibility of overseeing branch operations in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is saying that the British Department of Trade and Industry were negligent in not fulfilling their legal responsibility in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.  I am clarifying who is responsible for the supervision of the branch.  The United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry were the responsible supervisory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now clear that they <Col N="1089" /> have a legal responsibility whether or not the Minister admits they fulfilled it.  It appears they had a legal responsibility which was not fulfilled.  I presume there was no information supplied to our Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, or its supervisory section.  Therefore, there was a breakdown somewhere.  They had the legal responsibility, we had the supervisory responsibility.  Nobody became aware of what was going on and the information clearly was not available.  Therefore, somebody somewhere fell down and the Minister has clearly said where he believes that responsibility lies.</P>
      <P>When this Bill has been passed I should like a clear statement as to who will hold the management position, what brief that person will hold and in what way it will be carried out.  If that can be clearly established it will avoid many difficulties in the future.  I am as concerned as anybody else in ensuring that the ICI, a company that gave good employment for 50 years be restored to a healthy state and that the jobs there be sustained.  I want reassurance that the administrator is not going in to effect a demolition job whereby staff would be integrated into the insurance industry without any protection. It is vital that it be clarified whereby this is being done under the 1983 Act which gives administrators <i>carte blanche;</i> whether it is to be a semi-State company with a board of five, or a semi-State company with five board members having no authority but rather with that authority being vested in the administrator. I would ask the Minister to clarify that position when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes I will endeavour to clarify matters for him. We are establishing a holding company under this Bill, if you like, to hold the Government shares in ICI.  ICI is the employer but the company is in administration, in a similar situation to that of the PMPA under the administrator, who is answerable to the court.  I am comparing it with the PMPA from a technical and legal point of view.</P>

      <P>The terms of the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, apply to ICI as a company under administration.  My Department, as the regulatory authority, will deal with ICI on an arm's length basis under my supervisory responsibilities in relation to matters such as price application systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  It has long been known that staff in some of these companies have been wrongly accused of saying things, of putting together various pieces of information about the places in which they earn their livelihoods.  The Minister and most people would agree that the recent collapse of companies, whether in the private or public sector, has certainly not been the fault of the workforce. Rather has it been the fault of those holding senior positions.  Will the Minister consider allowing some participation by the staff who have worked so constructively? Will the administrator allow one of the staff representatives to be part of the board of five or to be part of a committee with a supervisory role?  The staff have not been at fault in the case of the trouble at ICI or in respect of Irish Shipping.  In the latter case people gave life service to that company and in their later years they were thrown on the scrap heap.  Dedicated people like these should be allowed a role in discussing the future of their company.</P>
      <P>In the case of the ICI it was said that staff representatives were responsible for rumours that were unhelpful, but if they had been advising the Minister six weeks ago he might not have had to come to this House and make the statements that were given to him by his Department. The staff involved were aware of the difficulties. Now they should be allowed to work with the administrator to bring ICI back to its former state, if that is possible. The staff have suffered hardship and trauma and they should be allowed to participate in the future working of their company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> In the case of the PMPA one can see that, while Mr. Kevin O'Kelly and his staff are doing as good a job as they can, they are still losing money and this cannot continue indefinitely.  They cannot expect the insurance industry to continue contributing as they are doing. Sooner rather than later there will have to be a total review of the insurance industry, either bringing it back to the commercial sector or the State sector, and I assume all of us wish to see it in the commercial sector.  We cannot have it half and half.  The danger is that some of the people involved in the insurance industry will not stay around forever.  Perhaps at the end of this debate the Minister may announce an inquiry or an investigation into the entire insurance industry to see what can be done to put it back on a proper commercial footing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister of State for his partial replies to the points I raised.  I hope the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, will clarify the other fundamentally important questions I raised.  They are important if we are to improve on the PMPA position and ensure that ICI will become a profitable company.  As the supervising authority, the Minister has power to allow the staff to become involved in decision making.  That will be for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government did a good two weeks' work in the way they rescued the ICI and the AIB.  We were threatened not only with the collapse of the ICI but obviously the AIB would have been seriously undermined also. The Government were quite correct in asking that the cost be borne by the financial sector because they, through their inter-dependence, are the major people dependent on continued confidence in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think it has been somewhat beside the point the way Opposition spokesmen have tried to say that there should not be even a residual possibility of the taxpayers having to pay any money.  The reality is that it would not <Col N="1092" /> be possible to do what has been done if one ruled out any possibility of the taxpayers contributing.  What the Government have done is that they have put a long stop safety net under the financial institutions.  It is seriously misunderstanding what had to be done in this crisis to suggest that the Exchequer could exonerate itself entirely from any possibility of taking up some of the cost.  What the Government have done quite responsibly is to put the real onus entirely back on the financial institutions.  They said that the taxpayers are only willing to provide a long stop safety net in order to secure the continued survival of the financial institutions in which all of us have a stake.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the balance of benefit in what the Government did is entirely on the positive side.  It is unfortunate that commentators have concentrated on just two beneficiaries, namely, the AIB shareholders and the overseas holders of policies, some of whom have been the most extraordinary kind of people, stallion owners and the like.  The real stake holders who have been helped by this rescue package are mainly the policy holders of the ICI, some of whom have paid premiums for employment liability and who would have found themselves without any cover.  Equally, there are people who now stand with claims for damages they have suffered.  There are harrowing cases of people who are waiting for compensation.  They are the people who were threatened, as well as the employees of ICI and ultimately the whole financial structure.</P>
    <P>There was not an alternative for the Government to allow the bank put ICI into liquidation.  That was not on the cards because of the damage it would have done to people who had taken up policies in good faith and who were expecting funds to come back to them.  I will go further and say there was a real risk that if the ICI had repudiated the reinsurance business it had taken on in London it would have jeopardised the possibility of any native Irish insurance industry being able to get the kind of reinsurance cover that is essential for the <Col N="1093" /> continued viability of a native insurance industry.  That would have been a serious blow to the entire industry.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, we realise that AIB itself could not have come unscathed from the liquidation of ICI for a simple reason. The AIB have used as a capital base for their overseas activities what are known as floating rate notes.  Essentially these are loans they have raised and they are accepted by the Central Bank for the overseas activities of the AIB.  One of the clauses in the notes is that if any subsidiary of a bank that has raised these notes defaults the notes can be called in. In other words, with the liquidation of ICI we could have faced not just the effect on the insurance industry but on immediate recall of essential support for the overseas activities of the AIB which would be immediately thrown into serious question.  The spin-off on the operations of the AIB at home and abroad would have been too horrendous to contemplate.  That is why the AIB came to the Government for the support they needed.</P>
    <P>Let it be said that we in Dáil Éireann have an enormous stake in the continued viability of the AIB.  We have only to think of events last week in the United States where there has been a rapid fall in the value of the dollar.  That was because of uncertainty regarding a number of financial institutions that were small fry in relation to the size of the US financial sector whereas the AIB is the major fish in our financial waters.  In a very short time several points have been knocked off the value of the dollar.  If we faced a similar effect, even a 1 per cent fall in our terms of trade would cost us £60 million a year and we could face a much more serious drop in the value of our terms of trade as a result of such uncertainty about our financial structures. Let us be quite clear that when we are talking in terms of the possibility of liabilities having to be picked up and borne by other parts of the financial sector if things had gone seriously wrong, it means that the whole economy would have faced millions of pounds of losses in terms of the effect on trade.  Leaving that <Col N="1094" /> aside, if the State were to continue to raise the sums for which we are now in debt to overseas creditors, we would be bound to face a risk premium on that money.  It would not take much uncertainty to create a situation in which a half per cent risk premium would occur and that alone would cost £50 million a year. We are talking about huge real losses to the economy should things have gone awry and should the Government not have intervened.  The Government therefore were right in their response.</P>
    <P>The question then arose as to the correct take to be exacted from the AIB. The answer to that is subjective because the right take is one that would be seen to be right afterwards by the market.  One cannot objectively determine it on the basis of ratios.  It is based on mood and feeling in the market.  The Government were right to leave a safety margin in what they exacted from AIB because the risks of not leaving a safety margin were horrendous.  The Government were right to do this in the knowledge that they would ask for that extra safety margin to be exacted from the financial sector.  We could have exacted more from the AIB, but let us be clear that we must leave a safety margin in this case so as to prevent the undermining of confidence in our financial institutions.  Some of the overnight experts who complain that we could have gone closer are like the people who go to a stunt display and when someone stops three or four inches from the brink they say that he could have gone further. It was crucial not to go to the brink.</P>
    <P>The AIB in their 18 months ownership of this company put in a reasonable amount of money.  They had to write off £86 million, they put in £12,500 million in assets and a £5 million contribution over the next five years.  That amounts to almost £125 million.  We should compare that to the annual dividend of AIB.  It is eight times their annual dividend.  Even the £5 million a year is taking a third of their annual dividend for the next five years.  That is not even including whatever bank levy they will have to pay.  In many ways AIB have made a significant contribution to this crisis.  We should not <Col N="1095" /> be swayed by the rather emotional reaction to AIB's decision to sustain their dividend.  As politicians we might have preferred to see AIB being a bit more abject and going around in sackcloth, but the financial market might not view it the same way.  They might feel that an AIB going around in sackcloth and not declaring a dividend would undermine confidence. That would be the case for shareholders who need a liquidity cash flow coming from their investments.  Pension funds are an obvious case where they must make payment to pensioners.  They could not sustain the holding of AIB shares if a dividend was not going to appear for several years, because they are committed to their pensioners and the pensioners would have suffered.</P>
    <P>The AIB decided to sustain their dividend as a commercial decision despite a blow of £11 million to their profits for the next five years.  They are the best people to decide whether that was the right decision to ensure the restoration of their capital base.  It is unfortunate that people reacted emotionally to the declaration by the AIB that they would sustain their dividends.  This was probably in the best interests of the financial sector.  It is regrettable that many commentators put out a false figure of what the AIB were giving in dividends.  The figure quoted in numerous cases was twice the reality. People should have been more careful in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not exonerate AIB from blame for their deplorable, inept behaviour in this affair.  For a bank confidence is a crucial thing, so they should not have entered into diversification into an open-ended liability industry.  If they went into brewing, for instance, at least there would be a limit to their losses; but in going into insurance and re-insurance there is absolutely no limit to their losses.  That points to a failure to realise the nature of the banking business.  Any hint of a problem has a devastating effect on a bank.  They should not have entered into such a diversification project.  If they wanted some diversification it would have been better for the economy if they had acted on the <Col N="1096" /> suggestion made recently by NESC, that they should take up equity in Irish companies so that they could support Irish industry, the real productive sectors which are creating wealth, rather than moving into a project which would jeopardise their own business.  The bank should have built up their knowledge of the sectors which they are supposed to help by taking equity in Irish companies many of whom are suffering from lack of equity and over-dependence on borrowed finance.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the bad selection of directors in State companies and the poor performance of State directors. There were directors on the board of ICI who must not have known much about the insurance industry when the bank, on their own admission, paid £50 million for an industry which at that time was worth minus £50 million.  We have to question the approach adopted by the AIB and the sort of people they put on to those boards, who could not alert them to the problems in the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, while they have acquitted themselves reasonably well on the domestic front in that they acted in time to ensure the viability of ICI's domestic activities, their control over overseas activity is a serious worry.  It is quite clear from this experience that the buck stops with the parent company even if the supervision is the responsibility of a government outside that country.  There is a problem which we must face, particularly in the area of re-insurance, which seems to be an extraordinary business.  It appears that the company which takes on re-insurance business does not know the liabilities; they do not get a regular flow of information on the risks of which they have taken a percentage.  This is why there has been such difficulty in the auditors pinning down to what extent the ICI were involved in on these re-insurance contracts.</P>
    <P>The Department must look seriously at this.  One approach &mdash; I do not know if it is the right one &mdash; would be to limit the re-insurance activity of any Irish <Col N="1097" /> based company to within a certain percentage of its own underwriting business. In other words, that it would be only laying off its own bets and would not be getting into a speculative activity on the re-insurance market.  Such an upper percentage put on to insurance companies would be for the best for the Irish insurance industry.  Certainly, ICI would not have run into difficulty if that had been done.  If that happened it would be good for the industry given that the Government cannot carry out proper supervision overseas that would allow them to be confident that the risk at the end of the day would not fall in Ireland for activities carried on overseas.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the role of the Central Bank in all of this.  To be honest, I believe that the Central Bank are just as guilty as AIB in allowing AIB to diversify into the one open-ended industry where liabilities cannot be pinned down.  If the bank were irresponsible in going into that area, then the Central Bank, who are charged with ensuring that the financial sector is strong and reliable, were equally irresponsible.  The Central Bank must examine their consciences also about what happened.  They have detailed rules preventing banks taking up equity in individual companies when engaging in lending activities and despite those detailed rules they can blithely allow shareholders' funds, which are at the base of the bank, to be used for open-ended business like this.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank must re-examine the criteria being applied.  Allied to that the Central Bank must examine whether it is correct that Irish banks should be supporting their overseas activities through these floating rate notes, given that they depend not only on the viability of the bank but on the viability of all their subsidiaries. The Central Bank should question policy in that area.  I am aware that the Bank of England would not dream of allowing banks operate overseas on such a capital base.  The Central Bank should be asked serious questions about their role in policing this area.</P>
    <P>If we are looking ahead to where the financial sector is going we must ask why <Col N="1098" /> are the banks, not only AIB, looking for diversification into other sections of the financial sector.  One of the problems is that there is a false distortion to go into life assurance activities, to go into building societies and pension funds.  Those false distortions are easier vehicles for savings for the individual than saving through banks.  It is not surprising to see the banks trying to expand their own base into insurance, building societies and so on.  We have to address that, a problem that has been ducked too often in the past.  We must ask ourselves why life insurance offers people a vehicle that is purely for savings giving them a tax break that would not be enjoyed by many small savers who put their money into a bank. After all the bank is normally funding activities more valuable to the economy and producing wealth and jobs than would a life pension fund which would typically be supporting property development and Government gilts.  That issue is not related to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism but it does relate to the issue of tax reform and distortion of savings markets here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House on this matter but I wish to raise a few points in regard to the Minister's statement which have caused me confusion.  What has happened in recent weeks has dealt a serious blow to the country.  The panic action of the Government has done more to undermine our credibility than anything else.  Many questions need to be put to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, arising out of his speech in the House and, as Deputy Richard Bruton stated, the Central Bank must stand indicted in regard to this issue.  In recent years a number of banks have gone to the wall.  Banks on the fringe of the financial world here went to the wall because there was not proper supervision by the Central Bank.  I recall one bank being taken over by a group of directors who did not have any money but used the bank's finance to take it over.  The Central Bank did not investigate that activity.  The collapse of these peripheral banks resulted in considerable <Col N="1099" /> losses to small depositors.  There should be an investigation into the role of the Central Bank and how active they are in pursuing these matters.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank seem to have ignored all that was going on despite the fact that the bank concerned was involved in commercial activities outside their own sphere.  The Central Bank were aware of what was happening but did not carry out an examination as to how the bank could cope with the liabilities that might present themselves.  A number of questions must be put to the Central Bank about this issue.</P>
      <P>The Department must stand indicted also.  The AIB were asked by the Department if they were satisfied that there was no under-reserving on the London business and the bank gave an assurance that there was not.  However, the same AIB and ICI representatives gave assurances on the Irish business which the Department found inadequate.  In the light of that, why is it that the Department accepted their word that everything was right on the British scene?  That calls for an answer.  Have the Department been in contact with their British counterparts to inquire why the British Ministry did not send a report about this?  If the British Ministry, as is suggested by the Minister, were in dereliction of their duty in not examining the affairs of the company in London what degree of responsibility rests with them?  What can we do about this?  It is obvious that the British Ministry were in dereliction of their duty in not monitoring the affairs of the company in London.  Has the Minister been in contact with his counterparts in London about the affair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have had a change of heart in regard to this because there was a public outcry at the suggestion that the overburdened taxpayer might once more have to pay a levy due to the action of the bank.  The proposals outlined by the Minister for Finance leave a lot to be desired.  They amount to a cosmetic exercise. The Minister told us that the AIB have agreed to share with the Government, in proportions to be determined <Col N="1100" /> when the ultimate losses are known, the proceeds of the banks action against the former auditors of ICI, Ernst &amp; Whinney. That is a farcical situation.  We do not know if there will be a successful action although the Minister says that they will share the proceeds of the bank action with the Government.  This is an insult to our intelligence and they should not assume that the auditors are guilty when no action has been brought.  The Minister should not have cast this reflection on a firm of auditors.  He said:</P>
    <P>AIB will make a loan of £50 million for a period of three years at a rate 4 percentage points below the three year gilt rate to the Central Bank.  AIB have further agreed that, should the emerging position and the reassessment at the end of this year warrant it, they are prepared to extend the term of this facility for a further period not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>The AIB should have been asked to dispose of their interests in Bank Corp in America because that would not have undermined their position in Ireland. This was another speculative move on the part of AIB with Irish money and it would not be too much to ask them to dispose of their interest in that and to make the money available to cover the losses.  To say that they are making a gracious gesture in writing off their total acquisition cost for ICI is an insult as it is not a serious contribution to their losses.  If they write off a sum of £86 million it will not help the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Central Bank.... decided, having regard to its statutory responsibility in relation to banking and financial systems generally, to indicate its willingness to provide sufficient funding, in conjunction with the banking system, within the dimensions of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and subject to the end year reassessment referred to by him, to deal with the problem as it arises so as to <Col N="1101" /> obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>What happens if liabilities far exceed this amount?  No indication is given as to who will pay that amount.  They will only give this funding up to £120 million but if, as some experts have suggested, it reaches £400 million or £500 million, what will happen then?  It is incumbent on the Minister to answer this.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Yesterday's decision by the board of the Central Bank means that the Exchequer will not now be involved in funding the administration of ICI.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not know the extent of the liabilities at present and perhaps when the full extent of the losses is known, it may be far in excess of present estimates.  There is no indication as to who will pay the extra costs.</P>
    <P>Later on in his speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>AIB have agreed to place a non interest bearing deposit of £20 million with the Central Bank to cover the contingent liability assumed by the State in respect of the AIB's guarantee to the Institute of London Underwriters.</P>
    <P>Will this have any effect on the deposit which the AIB must place with the Central Bank?  Will it also affect its lending capacity and its policy in relation to lending in the private sector?  The Minister should make a statement in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, went to a great deal of trouble to explain what happens in his Department but I should like to know if his Department sought discussions with their counterpart in London to ask why the losses were not picked up there.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>We were advised that there was no under-reserving in the London branch and that a deliberate policy had been pursued to cutback on gross premium growth in London to bring matters fully under control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> Having regard to the fact that they did not accept the assurances in respect of the Irish business, why did they not ask for further details?  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is also relevant that the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK who were responsible for supervising the branch activities of ICI in London had not communicated any concern to my Department.  Accordingly, my Department had no reason to pursue matters further at that stage.</P>
    <P>Because the parent company were in this country and must accept final responsibility, does the Minister consider that he should have accepted the fact that there was no communication from the British Ministry?  Did he think that that was an indication that everything was all right? Under an EC directive, the responsibility lies in this country.  In that regard, what happens when information is not available in the country in which the branch operates because there has been a failure to monitor or take proper action to ensure that the company is functioning properly?  Is there an onus on that country to make good the losses?  The Minister should be able to give us that information.</P>
    <P>There should be a change in the Central Bank regulations which ensure that banking business do not engage in activities outside their own sphere.  One bank sought to operate a building society but, luckily, permission was not granted to do this.  If that sort of thing were allowed, many banks might not be able to fulfil their purpose, which is to provide finance for business in the private sector.  The more they engage in extraneous activities, the more money is dissipated and not available for the purposes for which the banks were set up.  There should be stricter control and what has happened in the last few years in regard to fringe banks leaves a lot to be desired.  The Central Bank should exercise control and, if it is not in a position to do this, this House should make certain that they do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The Minister has not been forthcoming in the information he made available to the House.  There has been a change in the decision by the Government as outlined by the Minister for Finance today and they have come to the conclusion that what was suggested by the leader of Fianna Fáil is the only option open to them so that the taxpayers will not have to bear the burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the final comment made by Deputy O'Connell, I should like to point out that it was not only the leader of his party who expressed very strong reservations regarding the possible exposure and liability of the taxpayer; that view was forcibly expressed by many Members of my party, by me and by many backbenchers of the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy Haughey had no monopoly on that.</P>
      <P>One red herring was thrown into this debate by Deputy Bruton in his speech. While it is not directly involved here, he put it in, and I thought it inappropriate that he should have done so.  By implication he suggested that jury trials in this country somehow carried a responsibility for the present situation of the ICI.  The question of whether juries should hear actions for damages is important, and no doubt should be discussed in this House; but it has no bearing on the situation of the ICI.  The problems of the ICI arose in England where for decades past there has been no trial by jury of actions for damages.  I do not know why that was thrown in, except perhaps as a distraction. Certainly it has no relevance whatsoever to the main thrust of the debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers in this debate commented on the question of the public sector and the private sector, and it has been rightly pointed out that this debacle illustrates that the failings of the private sector are every bit as great as if not greater than the lapses that undoubtedly have occurred in some parts of the public sector.  Deputy Kelly described the events we are debating here today as according a free kick to those on the crazy <Col N="1104" /> Left, as he put it, who criticise the private sector.  I would prefer to put it that this was an own goal scored by the private sector in the course of their speculative business activities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly is a noted protagonist of the private sector, and he indicated in a radio interview this morning that this was perhaps the first event which left the private sector open to criticism.  That is very far from the truth.  The private sector in this country has an appalling record in all sorts of ways.  The PMPA was a private sector situation that caused financial chaos which is still going on.  The private sector has had its liquidations and receiverships day in and day out now for some years past, causing increases in unemployment. Most of the unemployed who have lost their jobs were former employees of the private sector, not the public sector.  Fóir Teoranta, the State rescue operation, is engaged week in and week out in propping up with taxpayer's money many of these private institutions. To put a balance on it, the best one could say is that there is good and bad on both sides of the economy.  Neither the public sector nor the private sector has a prerogative as far as good and bad enterprises are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came into this House earlier today and announced this new rescue package being put up by the Central Bank.  Lest anybody get carried away by that with any sense of euphoria, some notes of caution must be sounded on this issue.  While certainly it is welcome and no doubt, in the short term anyway, no call will be made on the taxpayer, I fear the matter will not end there.  I suspect that this question of the ICI and insurance holdings of the new company will be talked about and debated in this House for many a long year yet, and I think there will be calls, debates on finance and votes of money for, perhaps, a long time.  By no means will it be finished up with the passing of this Bill.  A great deal of money must pass through the channels before that situation is reached.</P>
    <P>The implication is put forward and the error is around that the Central Bank is <Col N="1105" /> coming up with this provision of money to cover the situation and to exonerate the taxpayer.  Somehow it is a little reminiscent of the Fianna Fáil election programme of 1977 where all this money was being put up from somewhere to do all sorts of things &mdash; to abolish taxes, to assist taxpayers and so on.  The money must come from some source and I want to analyse where it is likely to come from. This notion that there is some gift proposal here calls to mind Cassandra's warning: &ldquo;I fear the Greeks when they come bearing gifts.&rdquo;  The Central Bank are nothing more or less than a State institution and any money it provides from its own resources or reserves is taxpayers' funds, the moneys of the State.</P>
    <P>Anything that the Central Bank provide is taxpayers money, let there be no misunderstanding about that.  The Central Bank put forward this package and tells us now that they decided at a meeting yesterday to provide this package &mdash; everything is going to be all right; the Central Bank have seen to it.  I wish I could have confidence enough in the Central Bank to be able to accept their proposition, but I am afraid I cannot in the light of the history that they have handed down to us over the past couple of years. I am afraid that their record does not warrant a great deal of confidence, the very confidence that they are charged with inspiring into the whole banking system.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, told us in his speech introducing the Bill that the Central Bank's job is to assure the soundness of our banking system.  That is right; its job is supposed to be to assure the soundness of our banking system.  But the very fact that we have been debating here talks about a run on the banks and the dangers of insurance and bank collapses is an indication that they have not done their job very well.  When the Central Bank come forward and tell us what AIB could prudently be expected to contribute towards this debacle, one must look with a could eye at best on advice coming from the Central Bank.  It was they who permitted AIB and other banks <Col N="1106" /> to set off and engage in speculative ventures. These ventures cannot be undertaken by AIB or any other bank without the consent, authorisation and permission of the Central Bank.  The fact that they gave that consent to, let us face it, gambling activities has led to the situation we are debating today.  Therefore, one must look with some caution at the Central Bank's proposals.  They have got these things wrong far too many times to enable us to have unbiased 100 per cent confidence in them.  The funds that will be used here from the Central Bank are taxpayers' funds.</P>
    <P>A further neat, careful and cautious limitation is put into this package, as indicated in the speech today by the Minister for Finance.  His words must have been chosen very carefully.  He said that the Central Bank indicated their willingness to provide sufficient funds in conjunction with the banking system within the dimensions of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
    <P>This is not an open-ended commitment to exonerate or indemnify the taxpayer. There is a limit on it, and the limit is that set down by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, namely, a limit of between £65 million and £120 million.  I will not indulge in speculating on whether the ultimate liability might be £500 million or £650 million or whatever, but I do have some reserve &mdash; and I think it is reasonable to have some reserve &mdash; about the parameters set by the Minister in his speech yesterday.  The fact that the parameters he set &mdash; £65 million to £120 million &mdash; are so wide indicates how imprecise any assessment of the exposure must be.  As he said, it is not possible at this stage to speak in definitive terms about the precise financial position of ICI.  It will take years before the full extent of that is known.  I believe that the time will come when the exposure will exceed, and well exceed, the uppermost figure of £120 million enunicated.  No provision so far has been made in regard to how that will be dealt with or who will <Col N="1107" /> provide the moneys to meet those increased amounts if and when they arise.</P>
    <P>On the package the indication is &mdash; and I quote from the speech of the Minister for Finance &mdash; that the Central Bank will be discussing with Allied Irish Banks and the other licensed banks the appropriate form and apportionment of this funding. That has not been settled yet.  Discussions have to take place on what the contribution will be and the extent of the contribution from the commercial banks.  It may well be that at the end of the day their contribution may be minimal.  Great care will have to be taken to ensure that when the commercial banks, the Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland and the others make their contribution, it will be drawn out of their profits and not passed on to their customers in the form of increased bank charges or interest charges.  There will be nothing clever about that.  There is no great shakes in the commercial banks making this contribution if all they do is pass it on to their customers.  That contribution must come out of their own pockets if it is to have any meaning.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly right and reasonable that the commercial banks, with AIB at their head, should cover this situation in its entirety.  That is their responsibility because they operate in this country an oligopoly situation.  Between them they have a closed shop.  They have the same bank charges, the same arrangements and the same rates of interest.  They do not compete with each other as banks do, and have done in the past, in the United Kingdom.  They have a cosy little interbank set up and they work as a unit. Many complaints have been expressed about that situation from time to time, and rightly so, but the answer that is usually given is that the banks protect each other to the advantage of the customer. They say that is better than if they competed with each other.  That may be, but this much must be said.  If they operate a monopoly situation between them for charging purposes then the very least that the tax paying members of the public can expect from them is that they operate a mutual support system when a crisis <Col N="1108" /> arises.  That is the other side of the coin. They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the role of AIB and what the extent of their contribution should be.  As the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, said yesterday, this is a matter for debate.  In my opinion what has been put forward here as their contribution to the package is woefully inadequate.  This loan of £50 million is referred to somewhat euphemistically as a contribution.  I do not regard that as a contribution.  A loan has to be paid back with interest, whether it be a hard loan, a soft loan or an interest free loan.  One way or another the main catch about loans is that they have to be paid back, as will this money.  I wonder about that.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Corporation of Ireland will be converted to a semi-State body carrying on the business heretofore carried out by ICI.  They will take over their assets and liabilities.  This £50 million being lent on interest by the AIB to the Central Bank is going to be onlent &mdash; that is the expression used and I like it &mdash; to the new semi-State body.  I do not know if it will be onlent at interest or not.  I do not think there will be much point in charging interest because I would not rate too highly the prospect of getting it.  What is going to become of this £50 million? The answer is clear enough.  It will shoot out of the country to the United Kingdom and the United States to pay the claimants on the irresponsible policies taken out by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. It will not take long to exhaust that loan paying the claims to the bloodstock owners, the owners of the satellites and on all the other irresponsible policies written by the corporation and for which this country will have to carry the can one way or the other, be it the taxpayer or whoever.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about protecting the policy holders.  If there is one category we should not be worrying too much about protecting it is the policy holders. These policy holders in the United Kingdom and the United States are people who ran around looking for a policy for their outlandish, highly risky, speculative projects, but they found it impossible to <Col N="1109" /> get cover except from ICI, who willingly rowed in and obliged.  Now the chickens have come home to roost and they have three enormous claims already pending &mdash; and you can be sure that more are still to come.  From their point of view it was like taking candy from a child.  The ICI were ready to oblige when all the others refused.</P>
    <P>The idea that we should bend backwards to protect that category seems rather strange.  The money will be onlent to the new semi-State body and will be spent on payment of claims.  Sooner or later, whether it is three or five years, the AIB will approach the Central Bank and say that it is time for the loan to be repaid with interest.  Admittedly they are not charging the Central Bank the full rate of interest but nevertheless AIB will want the £50 million repaid with interest. Where will the money come from to repay AIB?  From whom will it come? Will it come out of the profits the new SAT will make?  Is anyone suggesting that will turn into a profitable institution having regard to the backlog of claims that are hanging over its head?  Will it make profits of £50 million plus interest to enable it to pay back its onloan to the Central Bank so that it, in turn, can repay AIB?  I doubt it very much.  What we are talking about are ongoing losses rather than incremental profits.</P>
    <P>As far as the loan is concerned, the question arises whether it will do the taxpayer or the Central Bank any good in the long term.  I have grave doubts about that.  I do not regard it as an adequate contribution from the resources of AIB to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>The directors of AIB as well as those of the Central Bank have a great deal to answer for.  The whole system of directors and director appointments will have to be examined thoroughly because State institutions, be they the Central Bank or the taxpayer, ultimately carry the can for these people.  Some system will have to be devised to ensure that not just anyone can become a director of a bank or an insurance company by virtue of the fact that such a person has an in arrangement <Col N="1110" /> with a club and has contacts.  People occupying sensitive positions of that nature, which can affect us all, will have to be licensed before they are eligible to be a director of a bank or an insurance company. Existing bank directors should be compelled as soon as possible to apply for a licence under which their records could be examined.  I would hazard a guess that it would be highly inappropriate for many of them to be granted licences to carry out functions in what appear to be private enterprise institutions but which at the end of the day have reprecussions in the public arena.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the AIB are escaping from this far too lightly.  The contribution from the action against Ernst and Whinney is a remarkable proposition to be talking about.  Any action of that nature at best can only be regarded as speculative and to talk in a realistic way as though funds may be forthcoming to the State or the Central Bank from that source strikes me as rather strange.  The real owners of AIB, who elect the directors and who took on this venture, are their shareholders.  There must be some contribution made to the kitty by the shareholders of AIB.  Apparently that is the one thing that is being scrupulously avoided at the say so of the Central Bank. I do not believe that some reduction of dividend for AIB shareholders would be inappropriate.  It would be highly appropriate that there should be some reduction for some years until we see exactly what comes out this mess when the claims position is qualified.  It will take some years before that will happen.  Some percentage of the profits of AIB should be put aside each year and frozen as a contingency fund until we see what the outcome of the losses will be and where the money will come from eventually to meet the claims that have to be met.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We could talk about this subject for a considerable length of time and yet we would possibly be no nearer a solution at the end than we were at the beginning.  AIB are not the first people to have made a major blunder and I have no doubt they will not be the last. What the public, whether or not they are taxpayers, are concerned about is that these national scandals and disasters will not continue.  They are not interested in whether they have to pay out of their wage package by way of taxation or pay when they go into the bank by way of being a bank customer or insurance holder.  They are not interested from which purse the money is taken.  What they are interested in is that we the legislators, do a good job and take the necessary steps to ensure that disasters of this kind do not happen again.</P>
      <P>Approximately 18 months ago, when we had the PMPA debacle, several pleas were made from all sides regarding the need for urgent reform of company law. Obviously those pleas fell on deaf ears.  I have not heard very much about changes in company law in the past 18 months. During this debate we have been told that urgent change is required.</P>
      <P>For the past number of weeks we have spent time talking about wandering animals and the breeding of bulls.  No doubt they were important Bills in themselves but that kind of legislation cannot be put before the absolute necessity to reform company law, to change our insurance system and to introduce the kind of measures suggested by the various committees and commissions which have sat through the years.  From 1970 to 1976 a committee of inquiry examined the whole insurance industry.  Their report has been left to sit in the Library and no doubt in many Government Departments but nothing was done to implement any of the recommendations in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rescue of the PMPA will cost £10 <Col N="1112" /> million per annum to insurance holders and to the insurance industry and Irish Shipping will cost the taxpayer anything up to £200 million.  Five or six friendly or provident societies have gone to the wall and small investors and elderly people who invested their life savings in these societies have had to pay the consequences of the disastrous management of these companies.  No Government and no Member of this House sought to introduce any Bill to have these people bailed out.  The Irish people want to see justice being done.  Whether it is a bank carrying clout, or an elderly person with £5,000 invested and the company goes to the wall, the Irish people want to see them all treated in the same way.</P>
    <P>For many years now people have been operating here collecting money from small investors.  At the end of the day these companies have gone to the wall. One such company was clearly breaking the law.  It was operating under an Act of 1896 which entitled it to take £200 only by way of deposit from the public.  It took far more than £200 from the public. Clearly it broke the law, an indictable offence.  I do not believe anyone was ever prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Recently on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; we saw that five industrial and provident societies went to the wall at a cost of £24 million to the people who had their life savings in them.  Recently we saw the case of Kings North at a cost of £15 million. The public have every right to have lost confidence not just in the banks but in our whole administration.  Is it any wonder that many of our elderly people prefer to keep their money in biscuit tins or under their mattress than to put them in some of the institutions which have been allowed to operate for far too long?</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we had from the Central Statistics Office three major blunders.  One of those blunders was in relation to milk returns.  Our Irish officials have spent the past year in Brussels not negotiating future improvements for farmers, but wrangling over the errors of our own officials.  It is time some kind of watchdog or supervisory or monitoring <Col N="1113" /> role was carried out by some Government Department and I do not care which Government Department.  These officials should be made responsible for the errors which take place.  Whatever about people losing faith in their politicians, they always felt that at senior levels in the Civil Service things would be looked after.</P>
    <P>In the case of some of these companies who went to the wall the rumours were around for months that they were in danger.  Why were they never called in by a Government Department?  The supervisory and monitoring role which should be part and parcel of our Civil Service structure was not involved in those cases.  If the law is not sufficient and if the supervisory or monitoring role is not sufficient, they should be changed. I fully support the idea of free and private enterprise.  The more incentives you give to individuals to do things for themselves the better.  We cannot have that system on the one hand and on the other hand when financial blunders are made allow people to offload the burden onto the State and the taxpayer.  Whether it is the taxpayer by way of direct taxation, or when he goes to take out an insurance policy, or open a bank account, the taxpayer and the public have to pay.</P>
    <P>Mistakes have been made in the past and the great speeches which are being made during this debacle will not fall on deaf ears.  I hope the Government will take the necessary action to ensure that disasters on this scale cannot happen again.  It was right for the Central Bank to decide in the past 24 hours to play a more serious and a bigger role in this affair.  They are the supervisory authority for all the banks.  They should have ensured that there was vigorous supervision of the activities their banks got involved in.  I can perfectly understand why the banks thought it necessary to involve themselves in the insurance industry.  For quite some time there has been an anomaly between interest payments, disclosures, and so on, as between the different financial institutions.  Building societies and insurance companies have enjoyed the advantage.  For a long time the banks <Col N="1114" /> have been worried about the fact that they have lost substantial funds to the other institutions.</P>
    <P>In their first report in July 1982 the Commission on Taxation recommended that these anomalies should be cleared up so that money would not continue to be taken from banking interests and put into other institutions at an advantage. That recommendation was never implemented. In recent budgets Governments have gone further to penalise investment in banks.  It is for that reason as much as anything else that banking institutions saw fit to involve themselves in these other fringe financial arrangements.</P>
    <P>The time for reviewing legislation, for having committees, for sitting back and thinking about what might or might not happen has long since passed.  Over the next few months in this House we have to ensure that we bring in the necessary changes in company law to ensure that, when company accounts are produced, they fairly and accurately reflect in no ambiguous way the financial position of the company.</P>
    <P>I hope the banks have learned great deal from their experience and that they will not be as keen in the future to hound the small person, the small businessman or the widow who has to get a personal guarantee if she wants to get £1,000 to build an extension or to put in new windows. These demands all of the banks have made on the public to ensure that their money was secure were unreasonable in many instances.  I hope the mistake they made will make them slow in the future to criticise Governments for getting involved in white elephants or whatever.  I hope they will take their own responsibility seriously and realise that they owe it to the people of Ireland to run their own affairs in an orderly fashion and not be so quick in the future to pontificate and to lecture everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank my colleague, Deputy Harney, for sharing her time with me.  I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important legislation proposed by the Government to resolve the very serious <Col N="1115" /> ICI problem.  The public perception of the ICI problem is one of concern.  Has the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism obtained all the information pertaining to the affairs of ICI which now shows that they are in a sorry state, or has he been hampered by lack of information?  That remains to be seen. After the PMPA affair one must be criticial of the supervisory authority within the Department for not being more effective in monitoring the whole business of insurance generally.</P>
      <P>One must now conclude that there is a continuing crisis in general insurance.  As public representatives we must demand action to ensure that we will not have to deal with a similar disastrous situation again as happened on 15 March.  One of the most serious consequences of the AIB-ICI crisis is the instability which now exists in our financial institutions.  The public, and especially the small investor, had faith and confidence in the safety and security of our banking system.  That has now been shattered, mainly due to the enormous and outrageous rumours now circulating.  I appeal to the Minister to assure the people of the stability and safety of their deposits.  Otherwise we will be back to the biscuit tins.</P>
      <P>Risk-taking was always regarded as a non-banking activity.  People felt secure that their investments and banking arrangements were free from uncertainty. The debate so far has been responsible and rightly so.  National stability has been maintained.  A balanced view must be expressed so as to maintain confidence in our financial institutions and so prevent a dismal situation becoming a national crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big question of the moment is, who will pay the debt?  I welcome the fact that the Minister stated it would not fall on the taxpayer.  I also welcome the statement by the Minister for Finance today that the Central Bank will now be involved. The onus is now on the Government to come up with a rescue plan which will be fair and must involve the commercial private sector which has made massive profits over the years.  This rescue plan <Col N="1116" /> should be spread over a number of years and certainly must not fall on the taxpayers, but be based on the profits of these commercial and banking ventures.</P>
    <P>The Minister must now be aware that the financial experts and advisers here have let our concern down.  One must put a question mark over their professional competence from here on.  I welcome the statement of the Minister for Justice in that he has decided on the right of access to jury actions for personal injuries.  This is a very timely statement in view of the high cost of premiums generated by some of the large damages awarded in the High Court.</P>
    <P>One other relevant point is that the Minister for Justice is considering that the judge should be enabled to indicate a settlement sum to the jury on an advisory basis.  The second consideration is that an advisory tribunal sit with the judges in these cases.  This does not mean awards will be decreased but it could go a long way towards relieving the situation. However, it must be stated that the jury system has always been seen as a basic feature of the independent administration of justice and possibly could be challenged in relation to determination of guilt.  The aim should be to secure a level of award which is fair and just.  In the future, consistency must be the keynote in all awards.</P>
    <P>At this moment there is a crisis in the general insurance industry.  Statistics for 1982 show that the vast majority of companies recorded substantial losses &mdash; 50 per cent having losses in each case of over £2 million.  Figures available for 1983 indicate that the position was far worse than for 1982.  It is now known that some companies have attempted to right this situation by redundancies, substantial cuts and a cutback in loss-making business, as well as the increasing of premiums and the introducing of additional cover restrictions.  I trust we shall not see this line of thought extended, as many would not be in a position to continue providing themselves with adequate cover.  This will affect many industries, as they will be unable to meet the premiums <Col N="1117" /> demanded.  This will lead to many companies and individuals taking the risk without any general cover.  It will also lead to a further increase in the number of uninsured motorists.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the big losses in insurance are public liability, employment liability, motor insurance, household damage and fire damage, mainly due to the size and number of claims and the high damages awarded in the High Court. There is, in effect, no cost control operating in general insurance.  These costs are now out of control.  As well as putting insurance companies at risk, they are creating hardship for industry and consumers generally.  If any worthwhile impact is to be made on the cost of insurance, the Government must tackle and eliminate the causes in such a way that the consumer can anticipate insurance at a reasonable rate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, accepting that there is a clear necessity for careful stocktaking of the economic climate in which the industry functions and of the legal procedures which put pressures on claims.  He also indicated that supervision can be strengthened and improved.  To me and many people, in fact to the public at large, this is the keynote to the whole situation for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to be the observer of the Minister's intervention today, which was welcome.  It seems to have resulted from a search for a solution and will encourage constructive criticism, the type which has taken place over the last week, even among backbenchers, both Labour and Fine Gael, of the quick intervention by the Government in the first place, even if there is now a situation in which bankers seem to be bailing out bankers.  Nevertheless, one would like to know a little more about the meaning of the intervention.  We realise that the profit from the Central Bank goes to the Exchequer in the first place and if it comes from Central Bank reserves, while there might be a temporary depletion of reserves, nevertheless at some time in the future it would have to <Col N="1118" /> be paid back.  I presume, therefore, that the Central Bank, in conjunction with the financial institutions and the banks, would work out a system whereby they would be able to repay the money proffered. That would mean that it would fall back on the customers of those institutions, and, to a large extent in many cases, on the taxpayer, but not indiscriminately as was feared earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister today referred to the Central Bank's indication of its willingness to provide sufficient funding in conjunction with the banking system within the dimension of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I presume that he was talking about £120 million maximum. It is estimated that it will fall between £80 million and £90 million.  We were told by the Minister that it means that the Exchequer is not now involved in funding the administration of ICI.  The money is coming from the banking institutions.</P>
      <P>I thought one of the obvious solutions would have been that the Government would invest £120 million, or whatever, in Allied Irish Banks, take shares for that amount and then over a period sell them back.  This may be disadvantageous in that AIB would then become a semi-State body and because of the industry one would be dealing with, which is affected by uncertainty and is an open-ended industry, it may not be desirable in the first place.  It must be said, after three weeks of putting the Government through the hoop that the Central Bank must come under criticism for not coming up with this solution earlier.  It has been argued successfully, and is not disputed, that it is the responsibility of the Central Bank.  They should have absorbed this problem in a businesslike and professional manner three weeks ago when the crisis broke.  Much anxiety has been caused by this slow intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most disappointing things about the Minister's speech was his reference to the fact that legislation would be brought in which will change the jury system.  I regret that the Government have capitulated so quickly to a pressure <Col N="1119" /> group and are giving in to big business and the institutions, because these say that the present method of jury awards is adversely affecting insurance premiums. The Minister for Justice according to yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> when pressed on the very high legal costs associated with the present system, agreed that that was probably a factor in occupational injury claims.  I hope this will be debated fully and that the Government will not rush in and change the jury system.</P>
    <P>I do not think that people are aware of the reasons for these awards being made, which awards can sometimes be very high.  We are really talking about the badly injured, those maimed for life, people who are very sick, disabled or permanently ill.  We are talking about people whose life expectancy has been shortened as a result of accident.  To change this system, because of lobbying by large insurance companies, without giving it careful consideration would be disastrous.  I observed my father-in-law, having been paralysed from the neck down, being rendered a quadriplegic for five years, lying on his back, being awarded a very modest sum of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was urging the Minister to be more consultative before changing the system of jury awards.  Such change <Col N="1120" /> would mean that the 12 men, trusted and true, would no longer be entrusted with making awards to their peers.  It would mean also that the role of the ordinary man would be rejected, it being handed over to the judges who, in our society, come from an elitist group, leaving it to them to decide how much discomfort a person should suffer, how much costs, they are to be awarded, the standard of life to which they are entitled etc.  We know that one of the many causes of these huge awards is the amount of legal fees involved, the amount of time lost through delays in the courts system, with people waiting four and five years to have their cases heard, often suffering badly in the interim period.  In some instances insurance companies do not endeavour to have such cases dealt with.  I submit that one of the other reasons for these high jury awards is that the provisions of the Road Traffic Act are not applied.  It is very dangerous to even drive now with so many people driving without insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the details of the reason for the débacle that has occurred between the ICI and AIB.  It has been adequately covered already.  People might be inclined to suggest that the AIB adhere to what they know best, which is banking.  Of course they are likely to be more successful at that.  Often the banks have an unfair advantage in putting pressure on individuals and companies <i>vis-à-vis</i> lending.  It really boils down to the institution versus the individual and small companies.  We should allow the banks to learn a lesson from the way the Government have treated them.  Surely the objective is not to destroy Allied Irish Banks, or make them crawl away from their mistake but rather to walk away with dignity, which is what any individual or company should be allowed do by the banks in similar circumstances.  There is no point in kicking somebody when they are down.  The impression has been given that some people would like to see AIB go to the wall, but such people obviously have not taken into consideration the tremendous success of that bank, or of the large number of its employees who in <Col N="1121" /> the main are extremely efficient and who worked very hard to make it the biggest bank in the country.</P>
    <P>Rather is the invective directed mainly at the directors and board of the bank, where there may be a lesson to be learned also.  The populace may rejoice at the perceived dent in the establishment occasioned by this débacle in the control of the banks, mainly by gurus who make up the board of directors, those who would be the non-risk takers, non-entrepreneurs from accountancy ivory towers using OPM &mdash; other people's money &mdash; some of whom probably are as bad as the economic theorists, some of whom lend a hand in running the country.  It has been said by many Members that they are not slow to deliver speeches to Government, with comments prejudiced in favour of the private sector.  It should be remembered that that same sector, in turn, is screwed by the banking sector these gurus represent.  Invariably the message is that the Government should be good to big profit makers, neglecting to recognise the fact that they themselves are very hard on the private sector, particularly the individual.  There is here a temptation to gloat and I suggest that we resist that temptation.</P>
    <P>The stance taken by Fianna Fáil on this Bill is reminiscent of that taken on the Family Planning Bill in that soundings were made over a week or two when it was decided to take a stance against the Bill.  The opinion held on all sides of the House is that the taxpayer should not suffer as a result of what has happened. One should be careful not to destroy the success story that is Allied Irish Banks. The measure of a successful company or of an individual is that it or he can get up after a hard knock or blow.  It would be ironic that the bank would cause such problems for the Government of the day or that it could discredit this country.</P>
    <P>Much soul-searching should be done by the banks and the private sector as a result of what happened, particularly by the banking sector, which is inclined to go for the cream all the time.  As the Leader of the Opposition said, there are many people who have had unhappy <Col N="1122" /> experiences at the hands of the banks. It is not desirable that the punishment should be absolutely punitive.</P>
    <P>In a Confederation of Irish Industry <i>Newsletter</i> of November 1984 there was an article written in relation to failures and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the prevailing attitude to those who fail in business and those who succeed is similar.  Those who fail are regularly treated with contempt, those who succeed are seen as pampered recipients of State aid.  We need to develop new attitudes to failure, risk-taking and success.  Honest failures should be encouraged to try again.  Those who succeed should be applauded and encouraged to further enterprise.</P>
    <P>That is something of which the AIB should take note.</P>
    <P>In his speech Deputy Haughey said that if ICI were commercially profitable the Irish taxpayer would not benefit.  In the same way we could say that the Irish taxpayer did not profit from the success of the PMPA before its collapse.  I think it is necessary to correct the altruistic statement of my colleague, Deputy Kelly, yesterday that there was a feeling that between them the ICI and AIB have let down the private sector and given a free kick to the crazy left and that this was at the root of much of the fury felt by the public.  I do not think that is so.  I do not think that kind of approach exists in business at any level.  It is very much a &ldquo;dog eat dog&rdquo; situation, with the survival of the fittest.</P>
    <P>AIB have had a very short purgatory. They were taken very quickly out of pain by the intervention of the Government. I do not think they should be crucified or made to survive with a ball and chain around them.  We should not forget that AIB carry out very successful operations and the punishment meted out should not be such as to destroy them.  I know that in similar circumstances the bank would take assets and require directors of a company to give guarantees jointly and severally.  As I said on another occasion, the banks would bottle one's blood.  AIB <Col N="1123" /> should remember what has happened here.  As Deputy Harney pointed out, they should remember how they have been treated by the Government, when they are dealing with other individuals or businesses.  The object is not to crush AIB but to put them back where they belong because they still retain the qualities that brought them to their present position.</P>
    <P>I should not like to finish my speech without mentioning Irish Shipping.  The employees of that company are looking for a relatively modest settlement in respect of their redundancy but they have not got it yet.  I hope the Government and the Minister will reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to give a firm rap on the knuckles, or perhaps a kick lower down, to AIB.  An invitation should be given to AIB and the banks to help to get the economy moving again.  They should return the compliment by injecting capital into our economy by means of loans. The banks should give more opportunities to the men and women who are building up the country.  I am talking now of people without connections, not the belted earls, not the small coterie of people for whom the State seems to have been founded and for whose benefit it has since existed.  The banks and various institutions seem to support these people. There is a hierarchy in Irish society not only in the religious sphere but also in secular life and it is stifling the growth of the country.  In my view it is inevitable that when bank personnel step outside their ivory towers and their fur-lined moúse traps they will sometimes be devoured by a lurking tomcat, rather like a tame rabbit being devoured by a hungry fox.  Their decisions are insulated by the kind of pressure they can apply on a company or on an individual but what has happened in this case should be an example to all of them of what it is like to compete in the real world of business. It is not the Government who were taken for a ride.  The boardroom occupants of AIB thought they were on to a good thing when they saw the golden casket of ICI but they failed to detect the contents of <Col N="1124" /> maggots inside.  Let us learn from what has happened in this instance and let us move on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the high level of consensus in which this debate was conducted on all sides although there were occasional flashes of acrimony. However, it must be accepted that there was an endeavour by all sides to find a solution and this is true of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition who is present.  All tried to find a solution and to contribute to the best of their knowledge, ability and experience.  Although this debate was occasioned by a very regrettable and sad event it was useful in helping to formulate policy.</P>
      <P>I know that after the intervention in the debate by the Minister for Finance to announce the arrangements being made by the Central Bank that will obviate the need for a contribution from the Exchequer if the losses are within the parameters which the Government expect, Deputy O'Kennedy saw this as a change of heart and position on the part of the Government. I think he misunderstands the situation. The fact is this is a decision made not by the Government but by the Central Bank and, as I pointed out before when the matter was brought to my attention, the Central Bank act autonomously and it was their judgment that it was appropriate to take this step at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must recognise that the independence of the Central Bank in their decision-making is very important in a case such as this.  In our original assessment of what the AIB could bear, the Government took careful account of and was guided to a great extent by what the Central Bank said was possible.  However, it is true that from the outset the Government envisaged the likelihood, indeed almost the certainty, that the Central Bank would be contributing to the solution of the problem in the way they have indicated today they will do.  I should like to quote from the press statement I made on the evening this matter <Col N="1125" /> first came to light.  The wording is quite important.  I said:</P>
    <P>This financing will be broadly based and will involve the Exchequer, the Central Bank, the banking and insurance sector generally and the former owner, the AIB.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank was clearly mentioned by me as a possible source of funding at that time.  Therefore, there is no reason for the expressions of surprise now in evidence in some quarters about what has been announced, not is there any reason for trying to say that this is something unexpected.  It is normal that the Central Bank in the course of their work should come to this decision, as was envisaged as a possibility and a likelihood from the first time a statement was made on this matter by me on behalf of the Government. There are no grounds for believing that the losses will fall outside the range of £50 million to £120 million.  This has been questioned by some.  These figures are based on the information supplied to us by the auditors and actuaries acting within the company.  They are the people in the best position to assess the true situation.  Our assessment is based on their information.  This assessment is based on the re-insurance contracts being sustained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn wished to know why the legislation needed to be introduced at all and why we could not work with the legislation that was passed in 1983.  We had to recognise the need to give guarantees in respect of the Institute of London Underwriters' business.  In regard to the setting up of the company in which I have shares, that mechanism was not provided for in previous legislation.  It was necessary on this occasion in order to separate the ICI from the bank.  If the shares in the company were not taken over by someone else there would not have been a separation of the ICI from the bank and this was deemed to be necessary.  In a matter of this importance, where confidence is of great moment, we decided that it would not have been wise to have left this legislation hanging around for a <Col N="1126" /> number of weeks.  The action to underwrite the Minister taking shares in the company had to be introduced quite quickly in case somebody challenged whether we had the statutory right to do what we have done.  As the entire exercise was designed to promote confidence, to do something for which there was not a statutory base would be contrary to what both Deputy Flynn and I wished.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies, and also Deputy Flynn, questioned this legislation from the opposite sense.  They wished to know why it took ten days to produce the legislation. That ten days involved two week ends, so it did not involve ten working days.  There were considerable difficulties in drafting not the first 14 sections of the Bill but in drafting the sections in regard to the Institute of London Underwriters. This was new territory in respect of which there had to be a lot of consultation.  It might have been possible to get some of the other legislation introduced more quickly but these sections required a degree of consultation as to the precise wording.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey raised queries about the timescale within which we expected the information to be available.  We made this statement on the basis of information supplied by the auditors.  Deputy Cluskey referred to the experience of the PMPA where it took a lot longer to get to the bottom of the situation.  In the case of PMPA the auditors seeking the information on our behalf did not get the co-operation they are now getting in the case of ICI.  That co-operation is an important factor and should enable the auditor to meet the timescale he has set himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said that if the system had been operated properly it should be possible to get this information in about two or three days using advanced accounting and computerised systems. As Deputy Flynn knows, the central problem of this company was that proper information systems did not exist in it. It might have been possible to get that information as quickly as the Deputy would have liked if those systems were <Col N="1127" /> there, but they are not and that is why six weeks was mentioned.</P>
    <P>A number of other Deputies wished to know why the Government did not insist on taking shareholdings in the AIB as the price for engaging in the rescue of this subsidiary of the AIB.  It is our advice that for the bank to give shares away free or on preferential terms would have required an extraordinary general meeting of the bank.  That would require notices to be sent out resulting in a considerable amount of publicity.  If such a meeting were called before the reasons for it were announced and before the Government had put its rescue in place, it would lead to speculation which might jeopardise the entire rescue attempt. Therefore we decided not to pursue that as a condition precedent to a settlement.</P>
    <P>If we were to make it a condition subsequent to a settlement, if we were to say to the bank that we would only settle the problem if the bank recommended to an extraordinary general meeting that they give us a share, there would still be a remaining uncertainty because there would be uncertainty as to whether the recommendations of the directors would be passed at the meeting.  This course of action would have generated a degree of uncertainty about the durability of a settlement and that would have jeopardised its entire purpose.  Also, a dilution of the shareholding, although something that might be feasible in calm times when people would not attach any significance to it, would, when there was perhaps a degree of uncertainty about the bank, lead to an even larger fall in share values in the bank.  While there is no direct cause and relationship between share values and confidence in the bank and its ability to lend, a rapid fall in the share values would have an effect on confidence on the part of depositors.  That would not have been desirable.  To some extent that also acts as a constraint on people who might suggest that one should seek to solve the problem by looking for dividends or large parts of the profits to be allocated.  That also would have the effect of leading to a rapid fall in shares which, <Col N="1128" /> although not directly linked to confidence in the bank, could have that effect by the public uncertainty and unease that might generate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning suggested that the bank might have been required to sell the First Maryland Bank and the proceeds of the sale made available for the rescue. That would have required an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders. It would not have led to a high level of confidence being generated and confidence is at the centre of our endeavours in this entire matter.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flynn and Richard Bruton raised questions about banks generally getting involved in diversifications into other related financial activities in regard to which they did not have particular expertise.  The Deputies suggested that the Central Bank should try to stop this type of development.  It is fair to say that the point raised by the Deputies has been very much taken on board by the Minister for Finance and, I expect, also by the Central Bank.  I expect that this advice will be taken very much to heart.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also was interested in ensuring that the Minister should have power to attach conditions to an authorisation to carry out an undertaking and also in regard to paid-up share capital. In fact, the statutory power to do this is being taken in the proposed insurance legislation.  As a matter of practice it is already being done but it needs statutory underpinning which is going to occur in the insurance Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flynn and Richard Bruton raised questions about whether Irish insurance companies should be so largely involved in the re-insurance business. Deputy Richard Bruton asked whether the Central Bank should essentially have allowed a bank to take over a business in which re-insurance played such a large part.  Deputy Flynn suggested that there should be controls on the re-insurance activity of insurance companies generally. There are a number of points to make on this.  There is no other Irish insurance company engaged in re-insurance business on anything like the same <Col N="1129" /> scale as ICI was.  Controls are not as relevant to other insurance companies as they would be in the case of the ICI.  It had to be said that if one was to say that Irish companies should not engage in a substantial amount of re-insurance business Irish companies in the insurance business who want to re-insure would be forced to do their re-insurance overseas because there might not be Irish companies available with a sufficient authorisation to transact the business of a quantity necessary to accommodate the needs of the Irish market and, perhaps, to take in other business.</P>
    <P>While I would not at all rule out the possibility suggested by the two Deputies of some form of monitoring or control on the extent that re-insurance represents in any insurance company's business &mdash; that should be done any way by the supervisory authority as part of its normal prudential activity &mdash; I would have doubts about placing rigid limits on this because it might mean that we were voluntarily denuding ourselves of the possibility in the Irish insurance industry of doing work that was valuable and forcing, perhaps, Irish insurers to send the business overseas. However, it is a suggestion that certainly deserves to be followed up and it will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn also suggested that the Minister should have the power to veto chief executive officers and directors of companies being appointed.  We do that already in respect of new companies. Frankly, it is very difficult for the Department, without it becoming the boss of all insurance companies and running them, to say in respect of some person that he or she is not suitable to be a director unless we set down certain specific disqualification criteria.  It would be our intention in respect of general company law to introduce certain bases for disqualification for acting as a director. I am aware that the people concerned in the present companies are unlikely to be people who would have been disqualified under any of the criteria one might think of.  I am not sure whether that provision would have made that much difference in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> Deputy Flynn suggested that new procedures might be provided for the submission of returns and accounts to the supervisory authority which would involve, in fact, the Minister nominating a second actuary operating independently of the company's own actuary to do a second actuarial examination of the accounts.  That would be a completely new departure.  It involves a separate actuarial examination of each accounts by another actuary, apart from whatever actuarial resources the Department might have which would assist in its general work.  I must say that in the Department we need to increase personnel involved in actuarial matters.  Of course the Department use outside consultancy for this purpose on a regular basis but it is not desirable for us not to have at least a significant amount of such competence in-house in the Department.  It is my intention to take this matter further.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of the supervision by the Department of the insurance business generally.  Deputy Flynn, for instance, said that following the PMPA crisis the prudent thing for the Minister to do would have been to have had a searching inquiry made of the state of health of all other non-life insurers.  In fact, it is fair to say that it was good insurance supervision under the responsibility of successive Ministers that led to the PMPA crisis being brought to a head in the first place.  Were it not for good supervision it would not have been brought to a conclusion as satisfactorily as it was.  It is worth saying that seven studies were carried out altogether at the initiative of my Department into the PMPA.  It was the seventh one that revealed the problem in its true light, the first six did not.  One can see that it was not an easy task to get to the bottom of this matter but the Department was very persistent in seeking it out.</P>
    <P>I should also say that in addition to examining the individual accounts submitted, all of which are independently audited, the Department carry out cross-checks with the help of consulting actuaries on the claims provisions of the head <Col N="1131" /> office companies in Ireland.  If under provisions exist in respect of specific headings they are taken up with them.</P>
    <P>I can say in reassurance to all concerned that of the cross-checks we have done &mdash; we have done a complete cross check on the accounts &mdash; in so far as the Irish operations are concerned none indicates any difficulties in the overall solvency of the company.  There have been indicated under-provisions in respect of individual classes of business.  They are, of course, being pursued with the companies concerned but we have no evidence as a result of these cross-checks of any threat to the overall solvency of any of the companies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Collins, dealt in some detail with the relationship between the Irish supervisory authority and the British Department of Trade and Industry in this case.  The Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>Under the formal EEC Protocol of Collaboration between insurance supervisory authorities, each supervisory authority may make requests to and receive from other supervisory authorities information which it needs in order to carry out the responsibility for supervision which is laid upon it, provided that the requests made do not detract from the division of competences between supervisory authorities as provided for by the Directive.</P>
    <P>Clearly the competence in regard to the supervision of the branch business in London rests with the Department of Trade and Industry and that is in accordance with the EC directive.  There is no doubt, legally or otherwise, as to the division of competence there and we can be seen to have acted fully and conscientiously in pursuing this matter in the questions we raised with the company in accordance with the division of responsibility laid down in the EC directive in question.</P>
    <P>I stress that the action announced by the Central Bank today was an independent decision of the Central Bank and that it is not possible for the Government <Col N="1132" /> to direct them as to their decisions in the performance of their statutory functions. The Central Bank are a State body upon which a higher degree of independence has been conferred by this House than on any other State body because of the importance of ensuring that they act as they think fit in protecting the banking and currency systems.  The original decision which was taken and announced last Friday week envisaged a contribution by the Central Bank, as is clear from the statement I made on that occasion but the timing and nature of the contribution by the Central Bank and the extent of the contribution is a matter for them. They made the decision announced yesterday on their own account and there was no question of the Government changing their position.  From the beginning, the Government had envisaged that the Central Bank would make a contribution and it was a matter for the Central Bank to decide when they would announce the contribution and they did so independently.  For that reason, I had to take issue with Deputy O'Kennedy in his absence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Central Bank, in consultations with the Government, in conveying this decision indicated that the announcement was one which could be made in this way.  There is no question of that decision being other than an independent one by the bank taken in their <Col N="1133" /> own time, in their own way and to the extent that they, in their independent function, deemed necessary.  I say sincerely to Deputy Haughey that it will do no good for Members of the Opposition to suggest other than that the Central Bank are independent in the exercise of their functions and I hope that Deputy Haughey will not make any such suggestion because it would not serve any good purpose.  I know that Deputy Haughey has been anxious in all his utterances regarding this matter to serve the greater good of the country and he would be departing from what has been his practice in this affair up to now if he suggested, at this late stage, that the Central Bank were acting other than independently on this issue.</P>

      <P>I have very little time so I hope you will pardon me if I speak rapidly.  When I spoke earlier in this debate, I indicated that Fianna Fáil had three principal objectives in this affair, the principal one being the need to protect the interests of the taxpayers and to ensure that they would not be liable in any shape or form for major financial losses for which the taxpayer had no responsibility.  We will be returning later to the other two objectives but, in respect of our principal objective, we have achieved our purpose.  We were clear in our minds and trenchantly argued that, as this difficulty had arisen in the financial sector, it should be contained, dealt with and solved within that sector.  We were totally opposed to there being any recourse to the Exchequer to make good the losses or to any imposition in the short or longer term, directly or indirectly, on the very hard pressed taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Friday, I indicated specifically what was required, namely, the putting together under the direction of the Central Bank in exercise of its statutory responsibilities under section 6 in relation to banking and the public finances, a package which would involve, in whatever measures seemed appropriate, financial institutions which would meet the financial implications of the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. <Col N="1134" /> That is now going to be done.  The Government and the Central Bank have now decided to act precisely along the lines which we called for last Friday and I am not making any accusation about the independence of the Central Bank. What is extraordinary and what should not and cannot be sidestepped is the complete turn around by the Government that this represents.  Only yesterday, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism outlined a different approach &mdash; an insurance approach &mdash; as one which should be and was being undertaken by the Government.  Not alone that, he specifically rejected the adoption of the procedure which I had proposed and I wish to quote what he said in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 24 March:</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the Fianna Fáil leader, Mr. Haughey, of invoking the Central Bank Act to have convened a conference of the financial institutions rather than take the action we did would not have dealt with the problem. The section of the Act Mr. Haughey mentioned referred to the protection of the currency.  There are three other points to be made about that suggestion. This was an insurance problem, not a banking one, and the Central Bank's powers relate to banking. Secondly, the Central Bank acts independently of the Government, it does not take instructions from them.  Third, any such conference would have taken time to convene and it is extremely doubtful if the necessary confidentiality could have been preserved.</P>
    <P>In those words, the Minister specifically ruled out the course of action which I proposed.  The same report is given in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of that day and there is no doubt that the Minister was crystal clear at that time that the suggestions I had made about the Central Bank intervention were not going to be adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, clearly indicated that the insurance approach was the one to be adopted and that the taxpayer would be involved.  Let us be absolutely clear in <Col N="1135" /> that regard.  He specifically said that the taxpayer would be involved.  He said that the compensation fund would be financed on a broad basis by a number of special arrangements involving Allied Irish Banks, the banking and insurance sectors and, if necessary, but only as a last resort, the Exchequer.  The Exchequer was to be involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little time and I would appreciate good manners when I am speaking on this very serious matter.  Today, the Minister for Finance clearly said that there will be no recourse to the Exchequer.  They are two separate and distinct statements by two different Ministers in the course of two days.  There is another statement of the Minister to which I wish to refer the House as it has a bearing on this matter.  In today's statement, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Yesterday's decision by the board of the Central Bank means that the Exchequer will not now be involved in funding the administration of ICI.</P>
      <P>This clearly indicates that, before he made this speech and before the decision of the Central Bank was conveyed to us, the Exchequer was going to be involved but would not now be involved.  Let us stop prevaricating about this.  The Government started a process which would involve the taxpayer in the rescue operation and that has now been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we welcome the fact that the course of action we proposed to meet this situation has now been adopted and that the Government now accept that the taxpayer cannot and should not be made liable for the losses, we must ask why this course of action was not undertaken at the start or at least agreed to when I <Col N="1136" /> publicly put it forward last Friday.  The change around by the Minister for Finance in the House this afternoon is in complete contradiction to his previous stance.  There could be no clearer indication that the Government are incapable of handling a financial crisis of this order.</P>
    <P>The nature and extent of the problem were known on Friday, 15 March and the possible repercussion and likely developments were also known.  The Government in that situation with that knowledge decided to deal with it in a certain way and they persisted in that approach for practically two weeks.  Now they have changed direction completely and undertaken a course of action which they previously stated was unsuitable and inappropriate.  Such a change of course, such a radical turn around in midstream, indicates faulty judgment, which at this level is frightening.</P>
    <P>I want to make a quick reference to another aspect of the Minister's speech, and this is a very serious matter.  The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>That brings me to the most recent development in this affair.  Hitherto, the Central Bank's involvement in the problem has been at management level.  Yesterday afternoon the Board of the Central Bank considered the matter at its meeting.</P>
    <P>The clear implication in that statement is that the board of the Central Bank were not involved in the matter until yesterday and it was being dealt with at management level.  I tell the Minister that I do not accept that, and if that is the version of events that he is trying to put across in this House it casts very serious doubts on the integrity of his approach to this whole matter.</P>

      <P>I do not believe, and nobody in this House believes, that the Governor of the Central Bank would not have been involved and consulted in this matter from the very beginning.  It is misleading of the Minister to try to suggest <Col N="1137" /> that it was dealt with at management level.</P>

I suggest that that is not acceptable. That is equivalent to misleading this House, because nobody in this House or anywhere else believes the Minister for Finance if he tries to say that the Governor of the Central Bank was not <i>au fait</i> with this matter and involved in it from the very start.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that our actions were not to be interpreted in any way as reflecting any indication of a belief by us of a capacity in this Government to handle this situation.  I stated on behalf of my party at the outset of this debate that we would be voting against this legislation to indicate our opposition to the procedure that the Government had started because that procedure would have resulted in a burden being placed on the Irish taxpayer.  As the statement from the Central Bank now indicates quite clearly, there will be no recourse <Col N="1138" /> to the Exchequer and, therefore to the taxpayer.  Our demand has been met, our approach has been adopted and accordingly we see no point in opposing the legislation because we were doing so only to indicate that we were totally opposed to the taxpayer being involved in any way in picking up these losses. We have succeeded in our objective of protecting the taxpayer which this Government at the start did not intend to do.  They have now been forced to do it by opposition in this House and by the overwhelming volume of public opinion on the matter.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that the Central Bank has intervened in this situation. That has never happened before in the history of the Central Bank and we must all take account of that fact.  We must also accept that the results of what has now taken place could be very far reaching. This Government have created an appalling situation, an appalling impression of muddling, confusion and change of course.  Now apparently as a Government they have set their machine to work to create a certain impression, and we can gather from the interjections from the back benches that they are now going to try to put this latest development across in a certain political context.  All right, let them proceed to do that if they wish; but they are dealing with national financial institutions and with a situation where trust and confidence are essential factors, and they are dealing with sensitive international financial markets where massive amounts of money can move with lightning rapidity.</P>

That sort of Government do not inspire confidence.  I appeal to the Government, now that this new development has taken place, to handle it carefully and sensitively because they are dealing with a situation which is potentially dangerous, nationally and internationally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the time given to me to address myself to this very important problem and I do not thank The Workers' Party for going through the futile ritual of calling a division and thereby depriving me of almost ten minutes of my time.  As a result I will probably speak more rapidly than I would normally.</P>
      <P>The VHI have altered rules 43 and 44 from 1 March 1985 or the next renewal of a member's contract.  Rule 43 limits hospitalisation of a member to a total of 84 days in any period of 346 days with a period of 180 days between them.  Rule 44 limits the benefit in respect of maintenance and treatment arising from alcohol, drugs or other substance abuse to two periods of hospital stay in a member's lifetime.  The effect of these changes are discriminatory in that they are aimed at the most vulnerable section of the community, the alcholic, the drug addicts and the psychiatrically ill.  These groups are not able or willing to fight their corner.</P>
      <P>The saving to the VHI is likely to be little over £1 million and when this is compared to their claim level of £76 million in 1984, that represents 1.3 per cent of claims.  It can be more readily seen that they have lost their nerve as far as treatment of alcoholism is concerned. They have sacrificed the great advances in treatment of alcoholism for a 1 per cent saving.  It has always been the tradition in this Republic that the very strong carry the weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of alcoholism the experts tell us that the disease will go under ground and that alcoholics will not be able to finance the cost of rehabilitation. The result is likely to be greater absenteeism and stress within the families of alcoholics. Alcoholism will be concealed to all except the family.  It is a return to the sin model of alcoholism and the stigmatisation of this disease once again.  From a statistical point of view the disease will be seen to reduce significantly whereas in <Col N="1142" /> fact it will be the treatment that will have been reduced.</P>
    <P>The cause of the VHI problem is not alcoholism or long stay patients but the dramatic increase in public hospital charges which, from my information, I understand is 467 per cent since 1981.  The volume of claims from public health hospitals must be added.  Most hospitals increased their fees by some 8 per cent in 1985 whereas public health hospitals increased their charges by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The result of the change of rule 43 is that patients who require long term treatment will come into the hospitals or health boards which are already overburdened. The cost will be £2 million in current expenses and perhaps several more million pounds in capital costs. Unfortunately those involved, alcoholics, schizophrenics, depressives and others require long term treatment.  What I am asking, on behalf of the many organisations that brought this problem to my attention, is that the Minister use the statutory powers he has to ask the VHI to reverse the decision and allow a public debate to take place.  The decision might be reversed even on an interim basis.  My information is that the VHI took this decision without any consultation and certain sections of the health service feel aggrieved at the manner in which the decision was taken.  This decision appears to have been taken without any public debate.</P>
    <P>We know that alcoholism is a chronic relapsing illness.  About 8 per cent of the drinking population become addicted making 100,000 people in the Republic alcoholics.  For every alcoholic there are at least ten people affected by the illness in one way or the other, making one million people directly touched by the problem which is one third of the population. I am asking the Minister to instruct or direct the VHI to reconsider their decision.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister consent to the change of rules 43 and 44 in relation to long stay patients?  The many people who brought this matter to my attention is indicative of the deep concern felt by a large section of the community.  The VHI appear to be <Col N="1143" /> an excellent organisation run with efficiency and courtesy.  However, this decision appears to have been taken without consultation and in a manner which smacks of offhandedness.  My proposition is that there must be consultation with all concerned, individuals and organisations. I appeal to the Minister to consign this decision to limbo pending a full debate.</P>
    <P>Naturally there may well be, as has been suggested, abuses of the system but with monitoring such abuse could be eliminated.  My information is that the abuses are mimimal to the point of being trivial.</P>
    <P>As part of the general outcry, I will quote a number of prominent individuals who have interested themselves in this decision.  I would describe it as a dreadful decision, a decision which hurts the particularly weak, vulnerable and possibly embarrassed section of our community. I am not a medical person and would not be competent to adjudicate on the deep issues involved but nevertheless as a public representative I am entitled to articulate, on behalf of those who brought this problem to my attention, the matters concerning them.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> Tuesday, 12 March 1985 it was stated:</P>
    <P>Professor Karl O'Sullivan, Director of St. Patrick's Hospital in Dublin, said it was a pity that the constraints on total hospitalisation in any one year would fall on the most vulnerable cases, such as those patients with schizophrenia, who may require more hospitalisation than the permitted limit of 180 days.  And he added that some alcoholics also suffer from other serious psychiatric disorders for which they would require treatment.</P>
    <P>He described as &ldquo;very harsh&rdquo; the limitation on the in-patient treatment of addicted patients and said he and his colleagues were very upset about it.  It would be more reasonable, he said, to impose annual limitations and he conceded that some limitation on hospital use by alcoholic patients would be no harm, admitting that some <Col N="1144" /> abused the system.  But he wondered why it would not be possible to identify those who went in and out of hospital a great deal and exclude them from open-ended benefit.</P>
    <P>That appears to be a reasonable proposition. In the same article by Dr. David Nowlan, Medical Correspondent it was stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Donal Glynn, a clinical psychologist and assistant director of the Rutland Centre, also found the limit of just two periods of in-patient treatment for life for any addicted patient, &ldquo;rather stringent&rdquo;.  Given that alcoholism was a relapsing disease, he would like to see some clause in the VHI contract which would allow for occasional relapses.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that alcoholism is an illness for life.  It does not go away. It is there forever.  The Minister might take account of that having regard to the stringent and strange decision by the VHI.</P>
    <P>Recovery from alcoholism is possible but it is recognised as a chronic disorder. Treatment is conducted on a planned programme with a prolonged follow-up on an open-ended basis.  The length of the treatment and rehabilitation process will vary depending on a large number of factors, including the age and condition of the patient, the degree of associated physical and psychological disability and social, family, legal and other associated problems.  In all cases medical supervision and social supports are required on a long term basis because of the chronic nature of the condition and the potential for a relapse.</P>
    <P>The last part of that sentence is important because the potential for a relapse in this illness is immense.  But for the exceptional work done by our psychiatric private hospitals, public hospitals and Alcoholics Anonymous, we would have a far greater problem.  There is no doubt that we have a great problem, an immense problem.  I am asking the Minister to address himself to the problem and to explain in some detail the reasons for <Col N="1145" /> the decision.  Does he consider it is appropriate to open up a public debate on the decision?  A Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful to you for allowing me to speak on a subject which affects the very body of our nation.  I am grateful to you for allowing me to speak on the Adjournment after a number of requests to be allowed to raise it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank Deputy Andrews for raising this matter?  It gives me an opportunity to give the House precise information in relation to the main areas in which the VHIB are proposing that cover against the cost of services should be more limited in the future.</P>
      <P>In the case of maternity benefit, cover is being reduced from seven days to five days.  Longer stays for serious complications will also be covered.  This reduction is not unreasonable in view of the current medical practice in relation to maternity care.  It is to be noted that longer stays arising from complications before and after the birth will also be covered.</P>
      <P>In general, benefit in respect of hospital treatment is to be limited to 180 days in any period of 365 days.  The extent of the cover that will be available is substantial, and there will be no limitation as regards the number of episodes that will be covered.</P>
      <P>I was informed of the board's decision. My approval is not formally necessary.  I support the decision of the board for very obvious reasons.  Benefit in respect of hospital maintenance and treatment arising from alcohol, drug or other substance abuse and complications is to be limited to two periods of hospital stay, subject to a limit of 42 days per stay and a separation period of 180 days between the stays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews and others expressed concern about this curtailment of cover and particularly the limitation of cover in the case of alcoholics and drug addicts. It is grossly unfair to the vast majority of subscribers to the VHI that they should be required to pay enhanced premiums to enable a minority of members to be fully reimbursed for the cost of lengthy <Col N="1146" /> and recurring periods of in-patient hospital care arising from the gross abuse of alcohol or drugs.  Unrestricted cover was available in such cases and was a disincentive to the drastic change in lifestyle which is essential.  The VHI Board are satisfied that, because there was no limitation on the frequency of admission or duration of stay, there was over-use of the system particularly by alcoholics.  I can well understand their concern.</P>
    <P>The current annual cost of attempting to cope with alcoholism and treating alcoholics in public psychiatric hospitals is about £8½ million a year.  This figure would be substantially higher if treatment for alcoholism and related conditions in the general hospitals and in the community were to be included.  I am concerned that the VHI arrangement should not be unduly penal.  The board's scheme covers maintainence in private psychiatric hospitals in addition to the private hospital. Should a person legitimately require in-patient services over and above the restricted periods covered by the boards schemes, he can obtain them without charge in a public psychiatric hospital where, in the case of persons whose income does not exceed £12,500 a year, the services of consultants are also available without charge.  Having used up his VHI entitlement, the alcoholic is quite free to avail of the public psychiatric hospitals should he require in-patient care.  There is no charge for a public bed in such hospitals.</P>
    <P>The board will keep the situation under review and are prepared to operate the arrangements in a flexible way.  They will consider individual claims above the prescribed limits in exceptional cases.  The approach adopted by the VHI Board reconciles with the general approach of the Department.  I want to quote from the report &ldquo;Psychiatric Services &mdash; Planning for the Future&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of specialised alcohol treatment programmes has been seriously questioned.  There is no evidence that intensive, high-cost in-patient treatment is in any way <Col N="1147" /> superior to simple, inexpensive community-based intervention.  Compared with the latter form of management, the intensive approach is not considered to be cost effective.</P>
    <P>The over-specialised approach to alcohol-related problems is also a separatist approach.  It draws the problem away from the community and family and tends to exclude the contribution of primary care and community medical and social services from the management of the problem.  To that extent, it runs counter to the general principles of the delivery of health care which stress that help to individuals and families should be as near to their communities and homes as possible.</P>
    <P>I can understand Deputy Andrews' concern about the implications of the change.  That policy statement was signed <Col N="1148" /> by an eminent group of psychiatric consultants and hospital managers.  It is a very strong report.  I will bring the Deputy's concern to the attention of the board. My Department will maintain close contact with the board in monitoring the effect of their decision in relation to cover.  The board will treat individual cases with compassion and care.  We have to face up to this enormous illness in our community and cope with it in a more effective way.  We cannot have people going into hospital every time there is a breakdown or an episode and finishing up in a private psychiatric hospital at enormous cost to the subscribers to the VHI and to themselves.  After a great deal of consideration the VHI arrived at their decision.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="1014" /> capital contribution provided for in the agreement of October 1983 was received by the Irish Government shortly afterwards. That sum was intended to assist with the cost of building a pipeline to the Border and, indeed, significant costs had been incurred or committed on the project at the time the British Government first indicated that they were unwilling to proceed.  That decision not to proceed was a unilateral one by the British Government and the Irish Government for its part has maintained its willingness to go ahead with the agreement reached in October 1983.  As the Irish Government has not agreed that the project should not go ahead, there is no obligation on the Government to refund that capital contribution to the British authorities.</P>

      <P>I have received applications within the past few days for allocations of capital under the new remedial works scheme announced in the National Plan in respect of houses at Woodview, Castlequarter, Killenaule, and Carronreddy. The applications are being examined and the local authorities concerned will be contacted as soon as possible.  No application has been received under the scheme in respect of Clerihan, Clonmel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improvement grants and special capital allocations have been approved in respect of the installation of solid fuel appliances in certain local authority dwellings at Woodview, Clerihan and Carronreddy.  Arrangements are being made for an inspection of the work with a view to finalising the payment of the <Col N="1019" /> grants and the making of the capital allocations as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he can give an estimate of the number of man-days lost each year through absenteeism in the public service as a percentage of total days worked; the annual cost to the Exchequer through absenteeism in the public service; the extent to which this absenteeism is believed to be alcohol-related; and the plans or programmes his Department has to combat the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the number of man-days lost each year in the public service through absenteeism are not recorded centrally.  Preliminary results of a survey confined to the non-industrial civil service in respect of the year 1982 indicate that the average number of working days lost through sick leave in that year was nine, which represents approximately 3.9 per cent of the average number of scheduled working days.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any firm estimate of absenteeism rates for the public service as a whole it is not possible to supply the annual cost figure requested by the Deputy.  Moreover, assessments of the cost of absenteeism may vary depending on what cost elements are taken into account and on factors such as the nature of the sick pay scheme.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate the extent to which absenteeism in the public service is alcohol-related as in many cases alcoholism may not be cited as the reason for absence.  The introduction of programmes to deal with alcoholism will hopefully result in the availability of more information in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A programme to deal with alcoholism in the Civil Service has been agreed under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and was circulated recently in booklet form to civil servants.  The programme operates through welfare officers in Departments and through personnel <Col N="1020" /> officers and the chief medical officer. Similar programmes exist or are being introduced in other areas of the public service.</P>
    <P>I can also tell the Deputy that the Institute of Public Administration has been commissioned to carry out a research project aimed, <i>inter alia</i>, at analysing the volume and pattern of absenteeism in the Civil Service and selected public bodies with a view to identifying specific implications for policymaking.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no correspondence between the inspector of taxes and the taxpayer since April 1981.  The last return of income/claim for allowances from completed by the taxpayer was in respect of the year 1973-74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax-free allowances referred to in <Col N="1021" /> the question presumably relate to the tax year 1985-86 which does not commence until 6 April 1985.  The relevant certificate of tax-free allowances (From P2) contains a note advising taxpayers who dispute any of the allowances to write or call to the tax office at once.  If the taxpayer in the present case contacts his inspector of taxes, the matter will be given attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in addition to a retirement pension the taxpayer is also in receipt of a social welfare old age pension.  Both pensions are chargeable to income tax. In accordance with the standard practice the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the retirement pension by means of the restricted tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>It now appears that the taxpayer will not be liable to income tax for the coming year, 1985-86, because his estimated total income for the year will be below the relevant exemption threshold.  Arrangements have been made to issue the appropriate exemption certificate.  The inspector proposes to review the position for 1984-85 and will be writing to the taxpayer shortly for the necessary information. Any tax found to have been overpaid will be refunded to the taxpayer on completion of the review.</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy requested concerning payments to the HOPE organisation in 1983 and 1984 is outlined in the following tabular statement for convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> In relation to 1985 the Eastern Health Board has paid HOPE £20,000 on account in respect of this year's running costs.  Meanwhile they have arranged for a review of the operation of the HOPE hostel including care policy, occupancy, staffing and salary levels.  The board awaits the outcome of this review before deciding on the level of funding for the current year.  I understand that officers <Col N="1026" /> of the board will be meeting representatives of HOPE on Monday next (1 April) to consider further the 1985 grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>To date the Department of Social Welfare has not received any applications from HOPE for assistance from the £650,000 provided in this year's budget for voluntary bodies in the social service area.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit from this Department at a weekly rate of £67.50 since 28 June 1984.  This reduced rate of benefit was awarded to him in respect of himself, his wife and one child, based upon his record of 34 Irish contributions in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>It has recently come to light that he was last insurably employed, prior to his incapacity, under United Kingdom social security legislation.  Under the EC Regulations on Social Security, the claim for sickness benefit is therefore the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Accordingly, the claim, the medical evidence and details of his Irish insurance were transferred to the UK authorities on 25 March 1985.</P>
      <P>Pending settlement of the claim by the Department of Health and Social Security, The Department of Social Welfare will continue to pay benefit until 30 April 1985 to avoid any possible break in payment. The appropriate reimbursement to the Department of Social Welfare will be arranged with the Department of Health and Social Security.</P>

    <P>1 1985 is the first year for these organisations to receive grants.</P>
    <P>  2 A sum of £50,000 of this grant is to assist towards the cost of hosting European Special Olympics in Dublin in July 1985.  The percentage given is based on the increase in the normal grant to this organisation over the equivalent grant in 1984.</P>
    <P>3 The grants listed above are in respect of coaching, administration, equipment and special projects. The percentage increase in each case compares with the grants under equivalent headings in 1984. Grants towards the cost of international competition in 1985 have yet to be allocated.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will issue a reply to Deputy Vincent Brady's letter of 21 November 1984 on behalf of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 5 whose application for participation in the enterprise allowance scheme was rejected despite the fact that he has met the eligibility conditions laid down by being on the live register for a period in excess of 13 consecutive weeks and was in receipt of unemployment assistance during that time.</P>

      <P>At the date of receipt of application, the person in question did not meet the eligibility conditions of the enterprise allowance scheme in relation to unemployment assistance.  The question of his eligibility for unemployment assistance was the subject of reassessment and subsequently an appeal to the Department of Social Welfare.  The appeal has been successful.  The applicant has been informed to this effect and about the procedures concerning the reactivation of his enterprise allowance scheme application.  A more detailed reply is being issued to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>None of the occupational safety and health Acts or Regulations administered and enforced by my Department contain specific provision regarding safety or sound proof cabins on such machinery. However, the Factories (Noise) Regulations, 1975, which also apply to every place where building operations or works of engineering construction are carried on, provide that it shall be the duty of <Col N="1037" /> the occupier to see that adequate steps are taken to ensure that sound pressure levels which could cause harm to persons employed, are kept at the lowest practicable level.</P>

      <P>The enterprise allowance scheme was introduced on 19 December 1983.  The first participants entered the scheme during the first week of January 1984.  Applicants may avail themselves of courses run by AnCO which are specifically designed for persons about to set up their own enterprises.  In a number of regions night courses, day seminars and information concerning various aspects of business skills are provided by local vocational education committees in conjunction with the National Manpower Service for <Col N="1038" /> participants in the enterprise allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry in conjunction with the National Manpower Service is involved in a pilot project in Sligo.  This project involves a panel of business, industrial, and financial advisers voluntarily giving advice and assisting participants on the scheme.  It also includes short evening courses sponsored by AnCO.  It is hoped to gather experience from this pilot project and gradually extend similar services to other regions. In addition, officers of the National Manpower Service at NMS Offices and during monitoring sessions provide advice and information to participants.</P>
      <P>The total number of applicants approved to date is approximately 6,682.  Of these 441 left the scheme prior to completing the normal one year participation period.  A further number of approximately 800 have reached the end of their one year participation period in the scheme.  The number of participants now in the scheme is 5,442.  Information received from the National Manpower Service in regard to the sustained demand for participation, the low drop out rate and the steady increase in participation indicate that the scheme to date has been most successful.  An evaluation of the scheme is being undertaken at present.</P>
