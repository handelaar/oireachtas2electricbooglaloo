      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the total number of people who received social welfare payments in 1984; if he will give a breakdown of this figure and the respective costings; and the variations, if any, in numbers and costs that can be anticipated in 1985.</P>

      <P>My Department keep statistics of numbers of people in receipt of social welfare payments on a weekly basis.  Cumulative statistics on the total number of recipients over the year as a whole are not maintained.  I propose to circulate tables showing details of numbers of recipients at end of June and end of May 1985 and the costs of the schemes administered by my Department in both 1984 and 1985.  These tables also indicate the change in both numbers of recipients and expenditure in these years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he accepts that <Col N="876" /> the regulation whereby a reduced rate of unemployment benefit is payable after 156 days to an unemployed person who has less than 280 paid contributions in a seven year period is unfair to persons who have a continuous record of contributions prior to the seven year period; if he will change the regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of the relevant legislation the rate of unemployment benefit payable to a claimant is reduced after 156 days of benefit where he does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.</P>
      <P>I regard this provision as reasonable as it ensures that in allocating resources from the Social Insurance Fund some recognition is given to the recent payment record of contributors into that fund.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to make any change to the legislation on the lines proposed by the Deputy.  However, the general question of the seven year test is a matter which I expect will be addressed by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting this question I had a specific case in mind relating to a man who has paid contributions every year since 1952 and it is only in recent years that his contributions have fallen.  In fact he has something like 32 contributions short out of a total possible contributions for 34 years of 1,768.  Does the Minister not feel that in a case such as this there is a grave injustice being done where a person has paid for 34 years into the Social Insurance Fund and now, because he has had a period of unemployment in the last few years, is being deprived of the full benefit of those contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative provision is that payment at the full unemployment benefit rate for the duration of 312 days would be paid to only persons with an annual average of 40 employment contributions over the seven years preceding their claim, namely, at least 280 <Col N="877" /> contributions.  That is the basis of the reduced rate and if everybody were to receive the full rate irrespective of the amount of contributions paid, the cost would be prohibitive.  It would also mean that the allocation of available resources from the insurance fund would not be giving recognition to the payment record of the people paying into that fund.  I estimate that the cost of additional payments would amount to £8 million or £9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are difficulties in applying an across the board deletion of the seven year period but surely the Minister would agree that the record of a contributor prior to that seven year period should be taken into account?  In this case the person has been contributing for 34 years and it is only in the last number of years that his contributions have fallen below the full amount and he is only 32 contributions short in that seven year period.  Would the Minister not agree that there is a case for reviewing the application of this seven year rule to take account of the previous history of contributions by a contributor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case for some phasing in this area and for fewer restrictions but it boils down to the availability of money.  This was last examined in 1982 and at that time it was estimated that about 13,500 people were involved on that reduced basis.  That number would have increased substantially since then.  At that time the cost was about £3.46 million.  That would be at least doubled if not trebled at this stage in terms of any reduction.  Accordingly, since persons are on unemployment benefit, the reduced rate would be the equivalent of the maximum urban rate of UA which is also the equivalent of the short term urban unemployment assistance rate. There is still no means test on it, it is based on insurance record.  There is a case but one would have to allocate very substantial additional resources.  If one did it here one would have to examine the averages in terms of, for instance, contributory old age pension entitlement, <Col N="878" /> widows' pensions and so on.  We would have to progressively change the other averages which would be very expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree to at least undertake a review of the application of this seven year rule with a view to introducing the possibility of phasing the reduction that is being applied at present, especially in cases where there is a long history of contributions in previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am prepared to examine it.  It is an aspect which will be considered by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I will send a copy of the parliamentary question and the background notes to the commission and ask them to review the question of the seven year test.  I would expect to have the report from them not later than next March with perhaps an interim report by Christmas, but this is one aspect which I will ask them to examine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that in cases where civil servants take career breaks or special leave for study, they face difficulties on their return as PRSI is not paid for the period while on leave; if he accepts that this acts as a serious deterrent to civil servants taking this leave; if he will consider making some special arrangement to cover people in this category; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants who take career breaks can maintain their entitlements for pensions under the Social Welfare Acts by becoming voluntary contributors, provided they have had a minimum of 156 weeks of insurable employment in respect of which contributions have been paid.  This is the general position in relation to any worker who for whatever reason ceases to be insurably employed.  Civil servants are accordingly <Col N="879" /> treated no less favourably than others.</P>
      <P>The scheme for career breaks was agreed in the course of discussions between the staff side and the official side under the General Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service. I understand the Department of the Public Service, which has overall responsibility for the scheme, and the staff unions involved, regard the scheme as a very useful advance and I am not aware of any dissatisfaction being expressed with the scheme.</P>
      <P>In regard to study leave, separate arrangements exist for the grant of paid study leave to civil servants who are attending second level and third level courses in their own time.  This paid leave may be granted at the rate of three days in a year to second level students and five days in a year to third level students. Since persons are paid and continue in employment while on this leave, no change takes place in their social insurance contribution and entitlement situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has indeed fallen short.  A substantial number of persons are entitled to FIS.  There has been a similar experience in the UK where a similar scheme was introduced and the take up of the scheme for a variety of reasons has been exceptionally low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Nonetheless, to date 6,900 have been awarded payments and there were over 10,000 applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few applications at the moment being processed. We have been fortunate in that with the relatively small numbers applying and the arrangements for staff we have been able to deal with applications immediately. Up to 4 July 1985, 10,500 applications were received, 5,900 supplements were awarded, 4,000 were rejected and 271 claims had not been pursued. There are only a few hundred in current assessment.  With the change in the benefit rates in December we will get another group of applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the low uptake of this scheme, would the Minister not consider the suggestion I made here a number of times that application forms be sent out through the Revenue Commissioners to persons who they are aware are on an income level which would render them eligible for the supplement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The advertising has been quite extensive.  I would imagine that of all the schemes we have in the Department of Social Welfare this has received the most by way of publicity.  I will consider if we can get in touch with people who would be entitled in that regard.  If I can get that kind of arrangement under way I will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the amount of benefit is so low that a number of people do not consider it worth their while to apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The payment is a payment for a full year. Once a person is deemed to be eligible and the payment book is issued the book is there for 12 months.  Even if the average payment is £6 it is still £6 for a full year period and subject to review at the <Col N="881" /> end of 52 weeks.  Therefore, the amount, even if it is small, because it is a payment which continues without review for 52 weeks could not be regarded as exceptionally low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the total allocation of funds to the Eastern Health Board for supplementary welfare allowances for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985; if he will specify the expenditure in the years 1983 and 1984 by the Eastern Health Board on (a) clothing grants, (b) assistance with ESB bills, (c) the footwear scheme, (d) mortgage assistance and (e) rent assistance; if he will request the Eastern Health Board to revert to the procedures used up to 1983 for the payment of clothing grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of total expenditure on supplementary welfare allowances in the Eastern Health Board area for the years in question are as follows: 1983, £13.7 million; 1984, £17.0 million (estimated); 1985, £20.12 million (estimated).</P>
      <P>The information supplied by the board does not enable a breakdown of expenditure along the lines requested by the Deputy, except in the case of the footwear scheme.  Estimated expenditure on that scheme was £289,000 in 1983 and £427,000 in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it possible for the health board to manage the expenditure of this money in a proper manner or how can the Department monitor it if they are not providing the breakdown <Col N="882" /> which I requested in regard to assistance for ESB bills, mortgage, rent and clothing grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are multiple payments and multiple reasons why payments are made.  Particulars of expenditure on the scheme are received by the health boards in three different forms.  We receive a quarterly return of the number of recipients and expenditure furnished by the superintendent community welfare officers.  We also get particulars of the monthly expenditure returns furnished by the superintendent CWOs and we get a final figure then supplied by the finance departments of the different boards. Suffice it to say that a very substantial amount of money is now being paid out on supplementary welfare, having gone from around £11 million in 1982 up to well over £20 million this year, and the pressure on the health boards is very considerable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul suggested recently that a substantial number of the former middle income group persons are applying for these reliefs and benefits?  Will he accept that that is the situation on the ground today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am aware of the number of middle income families who have had to avail of SWA payments to meet their basic needs, but overwhelmingly persons of very low income are the persons who are assessed and in need of the payments.  However, there is a proportion of middle income families where the breadwinner has become unemployed and there might be, for example, very substantial mortgage payments. That situation can arise and it can be a matter of dire poverty for those families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are quite adamant about the substantial increase in numbers in the middle income group who now find themselves in <Col N="883" /> this kind of difficulties.  Will the Minister take steps to get some accurate figures on that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that there has been a relative increase but the proportions are somewhat the same.  Still predominant are persons who are unemployed in particular and persons who, for example, are suffering from chronic illness and so on who need these exceptional payments.  In the Eastern Health Board area alone over £20 million is being paid out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I also asked the Minister if he will request the health board to revert to the procedures used up to 1983 for allocating clothing grants which were changed around this time last year or perhaps earlier, around April 1984, which resulted in a large number of people who up to then were in receipt of clothing grants because of their situation being denied them last year and presumably they will be denied them again this year if the regulations remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of money paid out in the country as a whole on supplementary welfare last year was £40 million, half of which was paid out in the Eastern Health Board area.  The guidelines are fairly general, and as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned we leave it to the health boards to administer the schemes and set out their own criteria within the framework of the general guidelines.  We cannot produce guidelines for every eventuality of direct need of families.  It would be quite impossible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the officials dealing with this type of benefit have cut down considerably on the amount of money allowed to people making application for this benefit, with particular reference to the Tallaght area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the position.  For example, for the Eastern <Col N="884" /> Health Board area in 1981 the amount was £7.7 million; in 1982 it was £12.7 million; in 1983 it was £14.7 million; in 1984 it was £17.5 million, and now in 1985 it is £20.5 million.  To give an example of the other health board areas, in the Western Health Board area in 1981 it was £2.2 million; in 1982 it was £2.4 million; in 1983 it was £2.8 million, and in 1984 it was £3.2 million.

      <P>The individual payment is the question asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that the number of people unemployed has increased considerably from 1981 to 1985.  It is not that the Department are paying out more money, it is that the numbers have increased and that is why the Minister has had to increase the amount of money mentioned by him, but that does not mean that the amount of money paid to the individuals making applications for health benefits has increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.  There have been changes in, for example, the payment of ESB bills.  The cost of electricity has increased and the once-off payments or those made twice or three times a year have been matched by the health boards.  The over-riding point is that the health boards have authority to make the payments.  We get the return of payments made at year end.</P>
      <P>We try to estimate what money is likely to be spent by the health boards.  It is an estimated figure.  We can do no more than that.  There has not been any cutback, as has been alleged.  I am such a victim of political propaganda that I am quite pragmatic about it now.  There have been allegations of a cutback in this area but the payments are being made to a very substantial number of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing as he has done before &mdash; quoting <Col N="885" /> the global figure for supplementary welfare allowance.  The question we are asking is whether the money allocated to families for clothing grants, particularly for children, has been cut back.  In his earlier reply the Minister stated that he did not have statistics from the health boards concerning clothing grants.  I put it to him that he should insist that the health boards provide him with figures for clothing grant allocations last year and the year before.  I am certain on the evidence available to me in Ballymun and Finglas that there have definitely been cutbacks in clothing grants, particularly for children, in 1984.  The same situation will hold in 1985 unless the Minister takes steps to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the point made by the Deputy.  I know of the various allegations but under the scheme single payments for exceptional need may be paid.  The main items under this heading would be furniture, clothing, bedding, ESB bills.  In some cases the goods are issued directly by the health board from their own stores.  Supplementary payments are also made for rent, including the interest element on mortgage repayments.  They are also made for extra heating requirements for individual families and for special diet requirements. Payments are also made under the national fuel scheme.  The money is made available directly to the health boards and it is up to them to administer it in a fair and reasonable manner, taking into account the needs of individual families. The guidelines do not make exceptional provision for matters such as clothing for families and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to clear up the question of whether these allegations are true, the Minister should insist that the health boards provide him with statistics as to the number and value of children's clothing grants issued by them in 1984 and 1983.  I am positive they will show that there has been a cutback in clothing grants.  If that is so, will the Minister insist that the health boards <Col N="886" /> revert to the 1983 guidelines for clothing grants this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Eastern Health Board, not the Minister for Social Welfare.  In certain Eastern Health Board areas there was a development whereby there was an automatic expectation of automatic entitlement to assistance for children's school clothes in the case of persons in receipt of social welfare payments.  There never has been an automatic entitlement under the scheme.  The health board are enabled to make a simple payment of SWA to meet exceptional needs for clothing.  This gave rise to considerable controversy last year when the health board tried to standardise their approach.  They took that decision themselves; I did not take the decision.  I do not direct the health board as to the minute categories of individual assessment of needs.  It is quite impossible to do so.  Needs are multiple, including clothing.  I hope that whatever approach the board adopt internally for their community welfare officers will not lead to the kind of controversy which arose last year, largely from the fact that there was an automatic payment irrespective of assessment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the exact position in regard to unemployed people who are in arrears with mortgage repayments?  Have they an entitlement to welfare payments from the health boards to assist them in paying off arrears on their mortgages?  Quite a large number of people have been forced to sell their houses because they have been unable to meet mortgage repayments following unexpected unemployment. Unemployment is escalating and this is a major problem throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large the health boards do not pay the ordinary mortgage payments but where, for example, there is a freezing of a mortgage and an agreement is reached between a <Col N="887" /> building society and an individual client, a proportion of the interest payments may be paid by the health board in order to ensure that the family are not evicted and have some opportunity of getting employment subsequently.  Payments towards the interest on a mortgage as distinct from payment of any capital portion have been and are being paid by health boards.  The situation is most acute in the Eastern Health Board area because half of all supplementary welfare payments are now being paid in that area where one-third of the population live.  It is an interesting aspect of social research that the lack of income is more integrated in the Eastern Health Board area than has been popularly assumed.  There is a lot of conventional wisdom about income distribution which I would like to explode if I had the opportunity of so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no limit on the expenditure in 1985 by the Eastern Health Board on this supplementary welfare scheme?  Did I understand the Minister to say that the Eastern Health Board may pay out what they wish and at the end of the year that amount will be made good by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey will know that we have an annual estimate of projected expenditure.  In the past two or three years we have had to forecast substantially above the normal growth of such expenditure but where the costs are incurred by the health boards we get an estimated year end figure.  We now have a half year estimated figure and it may be that it will be much higher at the end of 1985 than we have anticipated.  If it is, there will be a Supplementary Estimate. The health board, within the framework of the guidelines, operate the system and if additional moneys are required for 1986 <Col N="888" /> they will be forecasted, estimated and paid out.  It is that kind of a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a purely factual question which arises directly from Deputy De Rossa's question.  I am grateful that his question gives us the opportunity to deal with these matters.  If he can explain to me how he is so successful in coming out of the draw I might be able to use that information to my financial advantage on the racecourse some day. Is the position, therefore, as outlined by the Minister that provided the Eastern Health Board stay within the guidelines, there is no limit to the assistance they make available in 1985 under this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. In the case of an industrial dispute where 800 or 900 people go on strike, community welfare officers may indicate that a small number of those on strike may receive immediate payments.  We can make no forecasts; the payments are made and at the end of the year the health board are recouped.  My job is to try to provide for those contingencies and, so far, we have been reasonably within target.</P>

      <P>Far from improving pensions we are sitting on a time bomb in regard to the funding of social welfare pensions and particularly the State sector which was hinted at in the national plan.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The time bomb is a political creation.  For the last 15 years I have advocated that the self-employed and the farming community should be brought into the framework of social insurance.  However, it will prove extraordinarily difficult to do that as long as the Opposition believe that the farmers should not even pay rates, never mind social insurance.  The time bomb is that we are paying out an enormous amount of money on non-contributory pensions to the self-employed and the farmers on a non contribution basis but every time a move is made to try to rationalise the system there is massive opposition from Fianna Fáil and from the farming and self-employed interests.  As a consequence there is a totally lopsided system which constitutes the time bomb and eventually people will be fed up paying for the pensions of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a 6 per cent deduction in regard to public service pensions. Ministers and Deputies contribute 6 per cent of their salaries towards their pensions although, to judge by some publicity, one would imagine that we paid nothing.  Public servants pay for pensions, either in whole or in part, but we pay out tens of millions of pounds to the self employed and the farming community who pay nothing.  That is manifestly unjust and inequitable.  We should not spend all our time pillorying public servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The poverty trap is caused by a very complex interaction between the social welfare system, the taxation system and health, education and housing entitlements.  As far as social welfare is concerned, the modifications to the pay-related benefit scheme and the introduction of the family income supplement were intended to alleviate <Col N="892" /> some of the problems.  The proposed child benefit scheme will help to neutralise the relative positions of families at work and those in receipt of social welfare payments by giving a much larger monthly payment for children regardless of the employment status of the family.</P>
      <P>Further alleviating measures will be considered in the light of the forthcoming report from the Commission on Social Welfare who are carrying out a detailed examination of this whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the introduction of the family income supplement was intended to alleviate some of the problems.  Would the Minister clearly admit that the family income supplement has failed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the unemployment and poverty traps is very much broader than the family income supplement.  It relates to the question of income tax payments, especially by a married couple.  It also relates to the impact of PRSI payments, medical card limits and the cut-off point in relation to them and to local authority housing rents being increased as earnings increase.  As Deputies are aware, there is a lack of coordination of the ways in which benefits are withdrawn and taxes are imposed.  As a result, many anomalies can arise and as a consequence we have poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
      <P>There is a very urgent need for to look at the interaction between taxation, welfare, health eligibility and the payments of rent for housing throughout the country. Some excellent work has been done by the National Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Social Welfare in this area.  I will endeavour to remove many of these anomalies and the first major step will be the child benefit scheme which will directly effect 470,000 families rather than the 5,000 or 6,000 affected by the FIS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing there is an interaction of various factors such as increasing PRSI payments when wage increases are granted, there is the problem of increased PAYE payments, and as cognisance is not taken of the fact that these people are being taxed on their gross salary &mdash; in effect we are talking about the PRSI payments being a tax on a tax &mdash; I am sure the Minister will admit that there is an anomaly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very long winded.  He went round in circles. Not alone did he indulge in verbal histrionics but he did some physical gymnastics as well.  Would the Minister not agree that something should be done about PRSI increases and taxation on gross income?  This can mean that families with increased wages can end up with less take home money but because they got these wage increases they are no longer eligible for medical cards because of the stringent cut-off point.  I do not expect the Minister to solve the problems of the Minister for Finance since he is not able to solve his own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With the PRSI ceiling at £13,800 a year, one has an arbitrary cut-off point and that is an indication of where the trap can develop.  We have arbitrary cut-off points on medical card eligibility and income tax thresholds <Col N="894" /> where a person's income can increase but he is worse off.  Social Welfare payments are based on the number of children in the family whereas the number of children in the family is not taken into account for ordinary wage and salary earners. This means that considerable distortions can arise in this area.  In my view the most important development will be the introduction of the child benefit scheme. This scheme will level things much more effectively and we will have to examine the question of phasing and tapering some of the eligibility limits.  That would make the system fairer but it cannot be done while there are hundreds and thousands of people outside the PRSI and income tax frameworks.  That is a very big problem, as Deputies will appreciate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>The Government have noted with concern the decision of the South African authorities to refuse entry to a group of Irish citizens.  The group had travelled to South Africa at the invitation of Nobel laureate, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and other leaders of the South African Council of Churches.  The purpose of their visit was entirely peaceful and open; to meet leaders of groups which oppose the apartheid system and victims of racial injustice. The Irish Embassy in London has on instructions raised with the South African Embassy the unilateral action of the South African Government in apparently introducing a visa requirement for travel between Ireland and South Africa, in view of the fact that on a reciprocal basis no such requirement has existed up to now, and their response is awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> The Government are seeking an explanation from the South African authorities for the arbitrary exclusion of the Dunnes Stores strikers.  Our understanding is that the strikers are currently being confined to the transit area of Johannesburg airport pending their return to London; the issue of safety does not, therefore, appear to arise.</P>
    <P>Visa arrangements are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Justice. As I indicated in my reply to a parliamentary question on 7 May, my Department are currently studying the implications of any changes in the existing arrangements. On completion of this assessment and taking account of the most recent development I shall be in a position to make a recommendation on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make it clear to the South African authorities that it is totally unacceptable that 15 Irish citizens should be confined at the Johannesburg airport in the manner in which those concerned have been confined, including the Dunnes Stores workers? Would he agree that the arbitrary imposition of the visa requirement by the South African authorities effectively ends the rationale to the reciprocal arrangement of non-application of visa?  Would he accordingly be in a position to confirm to this House today that his Department's view will be that we should now require all South African citizens entering this country to first seek a visa from here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it is unacceptable that this situation should have arisen in Johannesburg.  As I mentioned in my reply, I have raised the matter through our embassy in London with the South African authorities and we are seeking an explanation from the South African authorities for the arbitrary exclusion of the Dunnes Stores workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the review which is at present under way in relation to visa arrangements, I cannot anticipate the result of that review.  There are a number of aspects which must be considered. There is, for instance, the fact that we <Col N="900" /> have a common passport area with the United Kingdom.  There is also the fact that we have quite a number of aid workers in Lesotho, and, as the House will know, Lesotho is land-locked by South Africa and those travelling to Lesotho have to travel there via Johannesburg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this action by the South African Government confirms &mdash; if such confirmation were ever required &mdash; that this Government must take a firmer line in relation to their dealings with South Africa and, in particular, that the Government should adopt a much stronger position in relation to the boycott of South African goods in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the Minister for Labour has circulated proposals about control of imports of South African produce. I should also point out to the House that Ireland has consistently supported the idea of UN sanctions against South Africa, provided that such sanctions were selective, graduated, mandatory and fully implemented.  Government policy, in addition, requires the public sector to refrain from purchasing South African products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the position is as stated on the 1.30 p.m. RTE News, that there is no possibility now of the 15 Irish citizens concerned being allowed to remain in South Africa?  Could he indicate what representations he made to the South African Government to permit them to continue with the visit?  Would he also agree that, in the event of the South African Government not allowing the visit to take place, adequate financial compensation, at the very least, should be paid to the 15 persons concerned for the manner in which they have been treated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister also indicate whether he is satisfied that the behaviour of the British Airport Authority in Heathrow was, in all senses of the term, proper and correct, or is he concerned at <Col N="901" /> that behaviour, having regard to reports that British Airways have been suggested at some stage as having acted in unison with the South African authorities and having sought to prevent some of the passengers &mdash; in particular the Dunnes Stores strikers &mdash; from boarding the plane at Heathrow before it left for South Africa?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem that there would not now appear to be a possibility that the group will be permitted to leave the transit lounge and enter South Africa.  With regard to the response of the Government, I mentioned in my reply that the matter has been taken up with the South African authorities and that an explanation has been demanded.</P>
      <P>In regard to the situation on the ground, I should mention that, as a matter of Government policy to show our opposition to apartheid, Ireland does not have full diplomatic representation in South Africa.  The Irish Honorary Consul in Johannesburg has a function in relation only to consular matters.  He travelled to Johannesburg airport to see what assistance he could render.  He also contacted the South African authorities in Pretoria on the matter but formal representations are made through our embassy in London.  On the question of adequate financial compensation that was raised by Deputy Shatter, that is a matter we can raise in the course of our discussions with the South African authorities but cannot anticipate their response at this stage. With regard to what happened at London Airport, my understanding is that British Airways have a regulation under which they do not permit passengers to travel on their flights unless their travel documents are fully in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to an earlier answer by the Minister about his concern for our volunteers and workers in Lesotho, will he confirm that immediately he will enter into discussions with people in Lesotho and in other countries in Africa so that our experts and our volunteers will not run into problems when they have to fly via Johannesburg in future? <Col N="902" /> That is the only way one can go to Lesotho and we want to ensure that our bilateral programme is not hampered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Ireland is concerned &mdash; I mention Ireland because the same may not apply to other countries operating in Lesotho &mdash; we have not had any difficulties with any of our aid workers going to Maseru via Johannesburg. I take the point raised by the Deputy that it would make the implementation of our aid programme more difficult if such difficulties arose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that it is clear now that the boycott in which the young Irish workers have been involved in the past year is now seen to be very effective and has been of considerable concern to the South African authorities?  For that reason, will he use his offices to ensure that Dunnes Stores management will lift the restrictions that have forced these young people out on the street?  Will he ensure that no other Irish company can adopt the same tactics and that Irish workers will be allowed to refuse to handle South African goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the concern of the workers has been brought home to the authorities in Pretoria in that they have taken this arbitrary action.  In relation to resolution of the dispute with the supermarket concerned, as the Deputy will be aware, there have been quite a number of discussions on the matter and my colleague, the Minister for Labour, has been involved in trying to find a formula for resolution. The matter has been referred to the Labour Court but I am not fully aware of the up-to-date state of negotiations. Certainly I hope that a resolution to the problem can be found in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that it is not acceptable that British Airways should seek to enforce arbitrary visa requirements imposed at the last minute by South Africa on Irish citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> Will he also agree that the internal regulations of British Airways say nothing about their enforcing such arbitrary requirements?  Further, will he not agree that it is not acceptable for British Airways to have acted in the manner as reported prior to the departure of the flight to South Africa?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that British Airways have a regulation whereby they do not permit passengers to travel unless their travel documents are in order.  I will look into that aspect further.  I am not aware of the details of such regulations.  Beyond that, it is a matter for British Airways to deal with any complaints in that area.  It would be outside my province.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 indicates that the Act of 1852 means the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, and that the Act of 1860 means the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860.  It is proposed in this Bill to amend for the first time those two pieces of legislation which are more than 100 years old.  On more than one occasion during the Second Stage debate the Minister said that in this legislation he is proposing to give effect to the intention of the legislation in terms of those two Acts which had been frustrated by court decisions.  Is the Minister serious in bringing before the House at this stage a Bill to give effect to what was the intention of the legislators of so long ago? He is proposing to put himself in the position of interpreting what the intentions of the legislators at that time were.  The courts have a very important function in this matter.  They have rules clearly in regard to plant and equipment of the kind the Minister is proposing to include for the purposes of valuation cover in this legislation, and it is a very retrograde step for any Minister to bring in legislation that would frustrate court decisions.  Court decisions have a very important bearing <Col N="985" /> on the rates to be paid on business properties particularly and on industrial property and that is what the Minister is proposing to do in order to give effect to the intentions of the legislators of about 120 years ago.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to amend two Acts, one of which is 133 years old and the other 125 years old, so as to give effect to the intentions of the legislators at that time, legislators who had little enough in common with the legislators of today.  The Minister has acknowledged that the reason for the amending legislation relates also to court decisions frustrating the intentions of those legislators.  I propose that the Minister withdraw the legislation and think again about the very serious impact it would have on the industrial base of the nation in terms of the extra costs it would involve and to think also about how ridiculous it would be to ignore those factors simply to give effect to the intentions of legislators of so many years ago. Those legislators could not have had any knowledge of the industrial processes.</P>

      <P>I accept that we are on the definition section but I suggest that you address yourself to the definition and purpose of the Act of 1860 because then you will realise the importance and the relevance of what I am saying.  When those Acts of 1852 and 1860 were introduced there were no industrial processes of the kind that are at issue at this stage. There was little or no agri-food industry, particularly in the dairy sector, but the food industry will be seriously affected if this Bill is passed.  Neither was there at that time any chemical industry and neither were there VAT rates that might have been included in that earlier legislation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that. We will deal with the details as we go through the various sections, but it is clear that anyone who considers the base of this legislation will realise that the two Acts that are proposed to be amended have no relevance to reality.  It would be a great mistake to place such an unacceptable burden on such essential elements of our economy as the manufacturing sector, the processing sector, the chemical industry, the various agri-food industries and so on merely to amend Acts of so many years ago.  For that reason I am pleading with the Minister to take back the legislation and to subject it to a much more considered examination in the light of what he is proposing.  If today's needs are such that a different approach is required the Minister should delete some of the existing legislation, but he should have regard to the penalties of the kind he is proposing here because such penalties would cripple the manufacturing industry at a time when we need most to encourage that sector.  I am asking the Minister formally to withdraw the legislation and to give us all time for more serious reflection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in support of Deputy O'Kennedy's appeal to the Minister.  The Bill is totally ill-defined.  It was presented to the various people concerned in what can be described only as a sleight of hand manner.  The definition bears no relation to what is being attempted in the Bill. If the Minister received bad advice in relation to bringing a Bill of this kind <Col N="988" /> before the House, he should not hesitate to face reality now and withdraw it because its enactment would result in tremendous damage to the economy.  I am not making that point in any political way.  The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill was totally misleading and it was only when one sought the guidance of professional people, as I did, that one realised what the Bill was all about.  On 2 July the Commissioner of Valuation, in dealing with an appeal, was interpreting this Bill as if it was already an Act of Parliament. He was taking it for granted that the Bill would be enacted.  That is not the way we should do business in this House.  We should not bring in legislation at the end of a session and endeavour to rush it through in one hour and a half.  Has the Minister realised what the implications of this Bill would be in terms of energy costs?  Such items as pylons and conduits are being introduced into the categories of fixed property.  This brings in Bord Telecom and means that the consumer will pay at the end of the day.  Is the Minister not aware that we are already 50 per cent out of line in terms of energy costs?  That is a question I shall take the opportunity to deal with later.</P>

The Minister's problem is that he does not know what is happening around him.  He listens to people who are seeking a sleight of hand way to bring in more revenue and that is what the Bill is all about.  It has nothing to do with amending other Acts.

One would have expected that a Bill of this kind would have been regarded as part of major legislation.

The Bill presented a golden opportunity in that regard.  I speak as one who is very much concerned in this area, being a Fellow of the Institute of Valuers.  Consequently I have a special interest in all legislation dealing with the Valuation Acts.  I was surprised that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity of this legislation to deal with the appeals procedure on the basis of the information and the advice that would have been forthcoming from those in the profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order to submit amendments at any time before the Committee Stage?  In pursuance of that order, the Minister who is now making this point has not submitted amendments during the course of the debate here on many occasions.  In view of that, would the Minister not acknowledge that this cheap little point he is now making would be better left unsaid?  The Minister brought in amendments as we were on our feet here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be anticipating you, Sir, in saying that that was certainly not a point of order.  Deputy O'Kennedy adverted to the fact that we now have certain industrial processes that did not exist in 1852 and 1860.  Of course he is perfectly right.  It is for that very reason that we have this Bill to amend those Acts.  If Deputy O'Kennedy were to reflect a little about it he would come to the conclusion I arrived at quite some time ago, that what has been wrong in the intervening period is that we have not had more Bills to amend the provisions of the 1852 and 1860 Acts.  Part of the reason that difficulties now arise is that it is only now &mdash; and I am glad to be the one taking the initiative to clarify the matter by way of appropriate amendments of those Acts &mdash; that the provisions of those Acts are being amended.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy asks: How do I know the intention of the legislator in 1852 and 1860?  For a lawyer that strikes me as being a very disingenuous question. It is part of the stock-in-trade of lawyers that, in looking at legislation, they have regard to what was the intention of the legislator.  I am not the first person from whom Deputy O'Kennedy has heard a reference to that notion.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also said that this Bill did not constitute the way to go about a new base for valuation.  I must say I entirely agree with him.  I made it clear in my concluding remarks on Second Stage that in this Bill I am not talking about bringing about a new basis for valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> A number of Members reproached me for not carrying out a complete revision of the valuation system.  As I said during the course of Second Stage, I think they are right but that is not the purpose of this Bill.  This Bill has nothing to do with fundamentally changing the basis on which we carry out valuations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe my ears, that there is no fundamental change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the other side of the House should restrain their theatrical expressions of surprise.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Deputy O.J. Flanagan said, I think my remark about this not being the basis for a new system of valuation applies to what he said: it is not.  If there is feeling in the House &mdash; as I suspect there is &mdash; that we need to take a fundamental look at the valuation system, then this Bill will not be the end of the amendments to the valuation system.  It is true also that this Bill does not change the existing appeals procedure. That is not the function of the Bill nor was it the intention of the Government in bringing it forward.  If there is a strong and sustainable body of opinion that that is required I am perfectly happy to receive views as to how that might be done.  I have an open mind on that matter.</P>

To conclude this discussion we have had &mdash; and I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence in allowing me to reply to things that were really out of order &mdash; it is not a question of sleight-of-hand. I have given the House adequate opportunity on Second Stage and intend doing so on Committee Stage, as much time as the House likes, to tease out these issues that have been raised, most of which I am bound to say &mdash; as I did <Col N="994" /> on Second Stage when we had far less acrimony and a good deal more analysis &mdash; I felt I had dealt with on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A definition of these Acts.  According to the Minister apparently the purpose of this legislation is to implement the intention &mdash; perhaps I might have your attention, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for a moment as distinct from an exchange there.  I might have your attention, Sir, as I make my point.  In replying to Second Stage the Minister said that the purpose of this Bill was to give effect to the intentions of the legislators of 1852 and 1860 and here I might quote from Volume 360, column 236, of the Official Report of 2 July 1985, when the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is not for me to criticise the courts but the local authorities have lost ground as a result of a number of court decisions which did not fit in with the intentions of the legislators.</P>
      <P>Those of 1852 and 1860.  Is the Minister seriously asking us to amend legislation here simply to give effect to the intentions of the legislators of 1852 and 1860 when processes of the kind about which we are talking never existed?</P>
      <P>I might give some other extracts from what the Minister had to say in the same column:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> I wish to emphasise the point that our purpose in this Bill is not to extend the valuation base but to put beyond doubt a number of matters that have become the subject of challenge in the courts and to restore the valuation base to the level that was intended in the legislation.</P>
    <P>If there was an acknowledgement that we are dealing with nonsense legislation that is it.  The Minister's purpose in this Bill is to restore the valuation base to the level that was intended in those two Acts. That a nonsense to bring before any House of Parliament in 1985, 130 years later.  And, if we were in any doubt the Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>It stabilises the law as it was intended to be without expanding the base and it gives more certainty to the law.</P>
    <P>Of 1852 and 1860.  In the light of that, is the Minister seriously asking us to continue with the Bill before the House? Neither Deputy Reynolds nor I was here the last day.  I might say that perhaps what we were about will have more lasting benefit to this nation than what the Minister was about here the last day. When I saw those two statements of the Minister on the record as being the purpose of this Bill I could not believe it.  We are wasting the time of the House to give effect to the intentions of the legislators &mdash; and mind you they were then a different type of legislator &mdash; of 1852 and 1860 in respect of activities which did not exist.  Is the Minister still insisting that that is his purpose?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and that it will cover, broadly speaking, what it was intended to cover by those Acts.  I take Deputy O'Kennedy's point that we are now dealing not just with processes but with types of premises that did not exist at the time the 1852 and 1860 Acts were passed. When introducing Second Stage I mentioned car parks as an example.  They did not have car parks in those days but it is clear from the terms of the two Acts and the practice that has been based on those Acts over the years that car parks are the kinds of hereditaments that would be rated.  The intention of this Bill is to make that perfectly clear so that there is no room for the kind of doubt that has given rise to numbers of court decisions in recent years that have taken things out that should be in the valuation base.</P>

Many of them can be very helpful to the Minister and can be extremely constructive.  Not alone are they familiar with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he is aware of dissatisfaction I am sure the Minister will be prepared to give it serious consideration. I am glad that the Minister has taken serious note of what I have said.

      <NameTxt>Deputy O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably the main section in the Bill because this is the section which says that these new categories of property which are not mentioned in the 1852 and 1860 Acts shall now be deemed to be rateable hereditaments in addition to those specified in section 12 of the 1852 Act.  Those are the ones mentioned in the schedule in section 3 which in turn refers to the new schedule in section 8 which is a new schedule to the 1860 Act.  Therefore, this is a section that imposes the charge to rates on all this new property, or what I would call new property.  The Minister seems to suggest that it is simply putting back what was there already before a court decision which, to paraphrase him, did not take account of the intention of the Legislature in 1852 and 1860.  If there is doubt about what the intention of the Legislature was at any given time, whether in 1852, 1860 or 1984 for that matter, the place to interpret the Legislature's intentions is not in the Department of Finance but in the courts of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts and the courts alone are charged with deciding what was the intention of the Legislature. It is no easy task for them when they are dealing with chip fabricating electronic factories, for example, to decide the extent to which these are liable as rateable hereditaments in terms of legislation passed in 1852 when industry in this country was entirely different in nature from what it is today.  Through no fault of their own people in the middle of the 19th century could not even begin to conceive of what might be a rateable hereditament <Col N="1002" /> in terms of industrial activity or plant at that time.  The courts here have interpreted what the intention of the Legislature was, and it is not for the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance or the Commissioner of Valuation to come along and say, as they do in their explanatory memorandum in a slightly arrogant fashion, or for the Minister in his speech to say in what I suggest was a slightly arrogant fashion although he may not have intended it that way: &ldquo;The courts misinterpreted the intention of the Legislature and we are putting them right.  We are putting it back to what it should have been, what we believe the Legislature intended in 1852 in respect of an amount of modern industrial plant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is completely the wrong approach and it is being done &mdash; and it nearly succeeded &mdash; for the purpose of putting it across to this House that this was some minor loophole that needed to be cleaned up, just a little difficulty that needed to be smoothed over, and needed just the routine of going through the legislation for the purpose of putting it all right again and putting it back as it was before those silly courts who do not understand these things changed it a bit.  We have heard that story before.  On 27 June last year we were told that emergency legislation was necessitated by a court decision &ldquo;in order to close a legal loophole&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I stood up here and questioned whether it was just closing what was described as a legal loophole or whether it was a legal loophole at all, and whether it was not the intention of the Legislature to do what the courts had decided, which clearly it was.  I went on then to show that the Bill in question, which ran to six or seven pages, went away beyond any question of simply closing a single alleged loophole that existed as a result of the failure of the Minister for Communications and the Department of Communications successfully to prosecute a citizen or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have the same technique being used.  It is an old trick of the Civil <Col N="1003" /> Service.  I have seen it previously several times.  A classic case of it was the Air Transport Bill last year and we have it again here.  You get a nice, slightly bureaucratic Minister who takes advice on these matters, and if he has not some commercial experience, he is inclined not to stand back from the thing and say, &ldquo;Lads, have sense.&rdquo;  Here we are getting under the guise of another closing of an alleged loophole &mdash; which it is not &mdash; a blanket redefinition of the entirety of industrial plant, and that has terribly serious consequences.  The CII have given an estimate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot swear that it is right.  I have not seen the detail of the evidence with which they support it but I have not seen anyone disprove it either. Their estimate is that industrial undertakings in this country last year paid £80 million in rates.  That is not denied by the Minister as far as I am aware.  Their great fear is that, on the basis of this Bill and how they have been advised by valuers and others who deal with these questions on a day to day basis, that bill of £80 million will be doubled approximately.</P>

      <P>I do not think they are suggesting that it will be precisely doubled. They are saying it might be less than doubled or a little more than doubled because it is not easy to pin down exactly what it will be.  Whichever way it goes, it seems that there will be a drastic increase in the rates burden to be borne by industry, and we know that is happening at a time when so many industries are under pressure, when it is almost a daily occurrence to read of the closure of more and more firms, and when we have been through the last 12 or 18 months, probably the most difficult time of all in terms <Col N="1004" /> of problems for manufacturing industry, and have seen more closures than we have ever seen in any comparable period in the history of this State.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into arguments with the Minister, but it is difficult not to be provoked by his blanket denials of the fairly bland and general statements I have made about the situation today.  I could describe it in far more vivid and perhaps more accurate terms in much more detail.  The Minister should be a little more aware of the reality of what is going on around him.  Many of his critics and many people outside this House criticise the Minister because, they say, he is a bit out of touch.  If they were here today to hear what he has been saying, I think we would have to agree that they have grounds for it.  To suggest that the last 18 months in this country have not been the worst in terms of industrial closures and business problems generally is positively and obviously ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is being done under the old guise that has been used to put things across this House before now, that this is simply rectifying some kind of errors that have arisen as a result of legal decisions.  That is one I suggest the House should not fall for again.  Let us be thankful that it did not fall for this in June 1984.  The Minister for Communications does not even suggest now that the Bill which he has introduced and which is part of the way through Committee Stage is just trying to close legal loopholes, because the reality has been flushed out into the open.  We will have to do the same in relation to this.  There is no question that this section expands greatly the definition of rateable hereditaments.  It makes two new sets or lists of property rateable hereditaments and, therefore, subject to rates.  The two of them are set out in section 3 and 8.  It says that they shall be rateable hereditaments in addition to those specified in <Col N="1005" /> section 12 of the 1852 Act.  In other words, it is a new list.  They are all additional.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister can argue that it is simply a clarification of the intention of the Legislature in 1852.  It is not. There are things clearly included under these definitions which could not conceivably have existed in 1852.  I have no objection, nor should anyone have an objection, to a reasonable updating; but if the reasonable updating has the effect of including huge areas of property that were never included up to now, then the Minister should have the decency to say so and let the House debate it on that basis rather than on the basis that it is clarifying the intentions of the Legislature and rectifying the errors made by the Supreme Court &mdash; which is in effect what the Minister is saying.  It is a very different matter then.</P>
    <P>If a Bill were introduced into this House which had approximately the effect of doubling the rateable valuations and the rateability of agricultural land there would be an outcry.  There would be 100 Deputies screaming that it was all wrong.  In economic terms, is this any less significant if it has the effect, which it probably has, if not of doubling the charge to rates, at least of increasing it very substantially?  Even if the CII's estimate of a doubling is wrong and it is only a 50 per cent increase, it is still an extra imposition of £40 million a year, which to many industries which are there only by the skin of their teeth is the kind of additional imposition that will bring them down, put them under and put God knows how many thousands out of work, as if such things did not matter.</P>
    <P>One of the additional hereditaments which is described in clear language rather than the vague language used in other categories is as follows:</P>
    <P>All cables, pipelines and conduits (whether underground, on the surface or overhead), and including all pylons, supports and other constructions which pertain to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of section 2 is to impose charges on a huge variety of things that have not previously been charged.  In deference to your wishes I will certainly talk about this in more detail on the following section and others. I want to convey to people who might not feel it to be the case that the effect of the Bill when one studies the small print is quite frightening.  It is well beyond anything one would be led to believe by the Minister's introductory speech or by the explanatory memorandum.  There has been a tendency in recent times to have very short explanatory memoranda with Bills.  I regret to say that at their best several of those explanatory memoranda are misleading.  I do not say this simply because of the example we have here but because this sort of thing has happened three or four times in the past year or two. Explanatory memoranda are supposed to be neutral statements from the permanent Civil Service of the effect of a Bill but they are not.  In this case the explanatory memorandum begins as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> 1.  The Purpose of the Bill is&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to provide for the continued rating of</P>
    <P>.lb (a)  industrial plant deemed rateable prior to recent Court decisions, and</P>
    <P>(b)  other property not specifically referred to in existing legislation. .le</P>
    <P>That could not but give the impression that there is nothing new and it is intended to convey to Deputies and others outside the House that there is nothing new.  It is not true.  There is a considerably expanded definition of what is a rateable hereditament.  One is entitled to object to that sort of statement being used.  In the last resort the Minister has to take responsibility because it was published from his Department and is not accurate.  I do not think anyone would contest that.  It is a serious matter that in order to facilitate the passage of Bills through this House explanatory memoranda which are less than accurate are provided to Members.  It did not happen in the past and the fact that it has happened during the past year or two is a matter of regret.  It means that each explanatory memorandum is looked at with a certain scepticism, not necessarily as a source of assistance but rather as, perhaps, a trap.  It is a pity that is so.  If the Minister wants to make a political commentary on a Bill he can make a speech about it or issue a memorandum under his own name, but if something comes out under the name of the Department of Finance or any other Department it should be accurate down to the very last comma.  It should not be open to the objections to which this explanatory memorandum is open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley has been indicating, it is very clear that the Minister unintentionally &mdash; the alternative is unthinkable &mdash; misled this House or the Department of Finance misled the House and are now belatedly recognising that this Bill should not be pushed through as originally intended.  I <Col N="1008" /> will give some examples of misrepresentation. It may be innocent but it is certainly misrepresentation of the purpose of the Bill before us.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>1.  The Purpose of the Bill is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to provide for the continued rating of</P>
      <P>(a)  industrial plant deemed rateable prior to recent Court decisions...</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the legislation of 1852 and 1860 which the Minister is amending never deemed as rateable some of the matters now being affected by section 2. In 1852 and 1860 there was no rating of industrial plant which the Minister now proposes should be included in section 2. In the light of that, how can the Minister allow an explanatory memorandum to go out to the public and to legislators saying that the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the continued rating of industrial plant deemed rateable prior to recent court decisions?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that industrial plant of a kind that will now be covered by virtue of the effect of section 2 &mdash; they are covered in the schedules in sections 3 and 8 &mdash; were even remotely in the minds of the legislators of 1852 and 1860?  It is clear that this was not the case because the Bill mentions cables, pipelines, conduit pipes, pylons, supports and other constructions which pertain to them.  The Bill also mentions mills and buildings used for the containment of substances or for transmission of a substance or electric current.  These were not even remotely contemplated by the legislators in 1852 or 1860.  However, the Minister said that the only purpose of this Bill is to provide for the continued rating of industrial plant deemed rateable prior to recent court decisions.  That is a total misrepresentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is misrepresentation. In introducing this legislation the Minister said it was only of a technical <Col N="1009" /> nature and that we were merely concerned with technical adjustments.  Clearly that is a misrepresentation, although I do not want to go so far as to say that it is deliberate or fraudulent.  However, it is clear that it is misrepresentation on a grand scale.  Legislation which was introduced as a technical adjustment is turning out to be something entirely different.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, the Minister went on to say that the main purpose of this Bill was to clarify and re-inforce some provisions in rating valuation law.  Is the Minister seriously asking the House to accept that what he said in any way accurately describes the effect of section 2? Section 2 will add schedules to be covered as rateable hereditaments under sections 3 and 8 that could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be called clarification of existing legislation or simply reinforcing existing provisions.  These matters were never included in the original provisions. They are not there to be clarified or to be reinforced.  They are obviously major changes by way of additional hereditaments which had never been rateable. The commissioners and the Department of Finance might have wished them to be rateable but the courts held in upwards of 40 decisions that this kind of property was not rateable under the law.  Therefore, who deemed them to be rateble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The rating authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as such intention was conveyed to them by the Department of Finance.  Now, fortunately, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, we have the courts to tell us what the law means as distinct from what the Minister and his officials would like it to mean.  For that reason, I am asking the Minister to delete this section.  The Minister's speech and the Explanatory Memorandum totally misrepresented the position.  Listen to this for a misrepresentation from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is not to extend the type of properties to be <Col N="1010" /> valued and rated but rather to preserve the traditional valuation base.</P>
    <P>That is a distortion of the truth because the traditional valuation base did not extend to pipelines&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It extended to gas pipelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should check on the law.  It is the easement over which the pipeline exists which is covered, not the pipeline.  The Minister does not even know that much.  These provisions fly totally in the face of his statement that the purpose is not to extend the type of properties to be valued and rated but rather to preserve the traditional valuation base.  Where, in the traditional valuation base, is there any reference in the law to the containment of a substance or the transmission of a substance or electric current.  It is not there and the Minister says that this is maintaining the traditional base.  Where is there any reference under existing law to cables, pipelines and conduits, including pylons, supports and other constructions pertaining to them?  Where is there any reference to any plant which moves or is moved mechanically other than a telescopic container which certainly did not exist in 1852 or 1860?</P>
      <P>We are being asked to consider legislation on the basis of misrepresentation in the Minister's speech, in the Explanatory Memorandum and in his reply to Second Stage.  I am not sure that the Minister understood the extent to which he misrepresented matters.  How, on that basis, can he ask us to deal with this legislation as simply clarification and maintaining an existing base when it includes as definitions of rateable property and hereditaments items which were never included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to re-echo what Deputy O'Malley said in relation to the courts. It is not acceptable, even for legislators whose decisions and laws are reviewable by the courts, that any Minister would come in here and say that, in view of <Col N="1011" /> court interpretation &mdash; and the implication seems to be that the courts' interpretations were wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I find this totally unacceptable.  I wish the Minister would make up his mind.  If he came here and openly said that the purpose of this legislation was to raise extra revenue by extending the valuation base to matters that have never been covered under law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>I will not go into this in detail but under section 3 all constructions affixed to lands or tenements, other than buildings, were not included in the original Act and are now being taken in.  &ldquo;All lands developed for any purpose other than agriculture, horticulture, forestry or sport, irrespective of whether or not such land is surfaced, and including any constructions affixed thereto which pertain to the development,&rdquo; were not included but are now being taken in.  &ldquo;All cables, pipelines and conduits, (whether underground, on the surface or overhead) and including all pylons, supports and other constructions which pertain to them&rdquo; were not included, but they are being taken in. That will have an enormous impact on the supply and cost of gas to the manufacturing sector.  It will mean extra costs to the ESB who, in turn, will pass them on to their customers in the manufacturing sector.  This will have a major impact on the ESB and Bord Gais Eireann.  &ldquo;All fixed moorings, piers and docks&rdquo; were not originally included but are now included.  The fishing industry will be affected by this and we will debate this further later.  &ldquo;Plant falling within any of the categories of plant specified in the schedule to the Annual Revision of Rateable Property (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1860 (inserted by the Valuation Act, 1985)&rdquo; is now included.</P>
    <P>Under the schedule in section 8 other categories of plant never contemplated by the legislators of 130 years ago are now included.  &ldquo;All constructions affixed to the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building (whether on or below the ground)&rdquo;&mdash; that brings us into a new area of what is liable to rateable valuation &mdash;&ldquo;and used for the containment of a substance or for the transmission of a substance or electric current.&rdquo;  We are into a range of property which was never legally rateable but now is.  &ldquo;All fixed furnaces, boilers, ovens and kilns&rdquo; were never legally rateable but now will be if this Bill is passed.  &ldquo;All ponds and reservoirs&rdquo; are now included too.  Yet this <Col N="1013" /> Minister asks us to accept this Bill as a technical piece of legislation and to accept the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the purpose of the Bill is not to extend the type of properties to be valued but rather to preserve the traditional valuation base.  As far as I can, I want to insist that the Minister takes back this legislation and the explanatory memorandum and the next time he brings it before this House he should have it properly and accurately described in the House and in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>I would not wish to attribute to the Minister the intent to deliberately mislead, because that would be going too far; but he must have given this legislation a very cursory examination if he was able to describe it as simply clarifying and reinforcing some provisions in the rating valuation law and as a technical piece of legislation reinforcing what is already there.  He should take into account what Deputy Flanagan said, because I agree that the appeals procedure on valuation is totally and utterly inadequate and unsuitable in this day and age.  I say this having some experience of the law. Judges in a rushed Circuit Court session cannot give a proper hearing to major valuation issues.  Unless you provide special judges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been claimed that the explanatory memorandum is misleading on the grounds that paragraph 1 does not present the whole picture.  Deputy O'Malley claims it is misleading to say that the purpose of this Bill is not to extend the type of property to be valued and rated but rather to preserve the traditional valuation base.  That is the purpose of the Bill.  There is nothing misleading in saying that.  I refer Deputy O'Malley to paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum which indicates what is provided for in section 3 and indicates in relation to the property which is to be subject to valuation that &ldquo;Many such properties have been already valued but it is considered necessary to put the matter beyond dispute, particularly as <Col N="1015" /> some of the items were either non-existent or of little practical significance when the Valuation Acts were passed in the last century.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They are not at all contradictory. In fact, the one is complementary to the other.  Section 2 provides that the categories of fixed property specified in the schedule to be inserted in the Act of 1852 by section 3 of this Bill shall be deemed to be rateable hereditaments, in addition to those specified in section 12 of that Act.  I do not know whether it is in order for me to do so, but I would certainly ask Deputies to refer to section 12 of the 1852 Act and while they are at it, to have a look also at section 13 of that Act.  I shall read it, if I may.</P>

      <P>The Chair is of opinion that we must keep to section 2. That section provides for the insertion of a new section in the Act of 1852.  That is what is in order and that is what the section is about.  It deals with the schedule and, of course, the schedule specifies what is in that schedule.  The new schedule is what we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>...and no Mines hereafter to be opened shall be deemed rateable until Seven Years after the same shall have been opened;</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the 1852 Act reads as follows:</P>
      <P>For the Purposes of such Valuation all Mills and Buildings erected for manufacturing or other Purposes, together with the Water Power thereof, shall be included in such Valuation, provided that the Water Power of any Mill or Manufactory be only valued so far as it may be actually used, and that such Valuation shall not extend to or include the Value of any Machinery contained within such Mill or Manufactory.</P>

As far as the categories of fixed property are concerned, the intention here is to use the broad term &ldquo;all constructions&rdquo; in place of the word &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; in the 1852 Act to include property such as grain storage bins and oil storage tanks which have hitherto been valued and rated.  I do not intend to talk about No. 2 in the schedule. We can come to that on the section. Reference to authority therein for valuing cables, pipelines and conduits are references to things which have traditionally been valued as easements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies are making an error in speaking about the Bill which is before us as if none of the things had ever before been valued, which is not the case.  I intend, in spite of their interruptions, to point out to them the fact that the things that are mentioned here have traditionally been part of the valuation base.  Piers and docks, for example, referred to in the schedule in section 3 of this Bill have traditionally been valued, although they are not specifically mentioned in the legislation.  They are mentioned here specifically in order to make the position clear.  This, as I have said right from the beginning, is part of the purpose of this Bill, to add clarity to the law in order to put a certain number of matters and a certain number of types of property which have been traditionally part of the valuation base beyond dispute, so that there is no further argument about whether they are properly valued and rated.</P>
      <P>In relation to No. 5 in the schedule, that covers a number of types of plant further referred to in the schedule in section 8.  What we are talking about here, as I have said from the beginning, is clarifying the position to remove doubt so that there is no further argument, either in court or anywhere else, as to whether certain things are properly the subject of valuation and therefore rateable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has made a number of remarks about who has the right to interpret legislation.  If the Deputy reads my remarks made on Second Stage, I have adverted to the fact that the courts have decided that certain properties are not properly valuable or rateable.  I do not agree with that and it certainly was not the intention of the legislation that that should be the case.  Of course, interpretation of legislation is a matter which, under our Constitution, is given to the courts.  Equally, the interpretation and <Col N="1020" /> clarification of legislation must surely be a matter for legislators, otherwise why are we here?  Again, I come back to the point that what this Bill sets out to do is to put a number of matters beyond dispute.  In certain instances the law and practice have not been clear and unambiguous and it is only in those cases that a doubt can arise where a court is called upon to give its opinion.  This Bill intends to remove that area of uncertainty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,277,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of <Col N="1022" /> the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>In presenting this Estimate for the Department of Energy, I would like to take the opportunity of describing the role which I see for my Department and to hear the views of Deputies on the matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, the Estimate for the Energy Vote is quite small but the amount to be voted does not fully reflect the extent of those activities for which the Department exercise responsibility. I am also answerable for the plans and overall operations of the State agencies in the energy area &mdash; the ESB, Bord na Móna, Bord Gáis Éireann and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, as well as the Nuclear Energy Board.  I intend to advert in my speech to the work of these agencies and Deputies will, therefore, be given an opportunity to discuss all aspects of energy policy.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the details of the Estimate, I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to the very significant financial contribution the Department are making to the revenues of the State. The Estimate indicates that, in addition to Appropriations-in-aid, that is, income generation totalling over £2.6 million, it is expected that Marathon will pay about £6.7 million in Kinsale Gas royalties to the Exchequer in 1985.  It does not, however, record that some £87 million is to be remitted by Bord Gáis Éireann direct to the Exchequer on foot of receipts for natural gas.  As well as contributing to the revenues of the State, the activities of the Department and their associated agencies confer major economic benefits on this country.  I will deal with those later in my speech.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that the Estimate for the year is just short of £10.3 million and shows an increase in net expenditure of £1,368,000 over the outturn for 1984. There is an increase in estimated expenditures in 17 subheads amounting to £2,597,000 but this increase is offset to a <Col N="1023" /> large extent by a reduction in the estimated expenditure in three subheads amounting to £500,000 and an increase in the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid amounting to £729,000.  The largest increases in expenditure occur in two capital services &mdash; subhead M &mdash; Bord na Móna, Grants for Private Bog Development (£500,000) and subhead P &mdash; FEOGA, Western Aid Electrification (£924,000).  Over a quarter of the gross expenditure is provided for capital services. The largest increases in non-capital services occur in subhead A.2 &mdash; Consultancy services (£342,000), subhead D &mdash; Geological Survey (£172,000) and subhead A.1 &mdash; Salaries, wages and allowances (£158,000).  Most of the reduction in expenditure occurs in subhead L &mdash; State support for mining operations (£387,000).</P>
    <P>Government policy on energy has as its main objectives the promotion of the use of domestic energy sources and the lessening of our dependence on oil by broadening our choice of fuels together with initiatives to encourage exploration for additional domestic supplies of oil, gas and coal.  These policies are designed to achieve the maximum benefit to the country from our indigenous resources by implementing appropriate and consistent pricing policies.</P>
    <P>The use of domestic energy sources has been advanced primarily by the development of the Kinsale Head gas field and through infrastructure investment in the gas network.  This includes the construction of the Aghada ESB station to use gas, the conversion of Marino generation station, Cork, to gas firing, the laying of the Cork to Dublin pipeline and the conversion of plant at North Wall and Poolbeg, and the development of the Dublin and Cork gas companies.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna continue their turf development programmes for supply to ESB turf-fired stations and for private use.  We have also seen a continuation of investment in the private bog development scheme, for which Bord na Móna act as my administrative agent.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of these strategies <Col N="1024" /> native fuels increased their share of total primary energy requirements from 19.4 per cent in 1979 to 41 per cent in 1984. These reductions in dependence on imported fuels are due mainly to the use of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Hand-in-hand with these efforts we have pursued a strategy of broadening our fuel mix to guard against physical shortage and price increase impacts.  The most notable success of that strategy has been the construction of the Moneypoint coal burning electricity generation station, the first phase of which is due to come on stream next October.</P>
    <P>This diversification in our national fuel mix, together with the maintenance of an oil refining capacity at Whitegate, improves our security of supply position.  The medium term outlook now looks more stable and the economy less vulnerable to sudden disruptions in supply or to the impact of severe oil price rises.  We must constantly seek further ways and means of reinforcing this situation.</P>
    <P>The use of natural gas for electricity generation and the development of the gas network through the construction of the Cork-Dublin pipeline, together with the extension of the gas network principally in Cork and Dublin have introduced a major element of competition with oil, and a choice of fuels for industrial, commercial and domestic consumers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the allocation of natural gas for electricity generation and very favourable prices since 1979 &mdash; often about half that or less than what the alternative fuel, oil, would have cost the ESB, have reduced the ESB's fuel costs and tariffs for all users.  In particular the allocation, which I made earlier this year, of an additional 10 million cubic feet per day of gas to the ESB is specially designed to improve the competitiveness of electricity for industrial users.</P>
    <P>The policy of encouraging exploration for additional supplies of native energy sources is continuing.  The number of exploration wells to be drilled offshore in 1985 will equal the 1984 drilling.  While the majority of the wells will be located in the Celtic Sea, the prospectivity of other areas, such as the Porcupine Basin <Col N="1025" /> off the west coast and possibly, the Kish Bank Basin in Dublin Bay, will be tested. At present Britoil are drilling in the Porcupine and Esso in the Celtic Sea.  Other oil companies are finalising their plans in order to commence operations later in the season.  Deputies will be aware of the announcement of the results of the BP well, 48/18-1, in the Celtic Sea which showed an encouraging gas flow and will help to intensify interest in our offshore potential.</P>
    <P>This year will also see awards of further offshore licences, under our third round of exclusive licensing.  Deputies may recall that because of the late availability of certain technical data the closing date for the receipt of applications &mdash; originally fixed for February this year &mdash; was postponed to mid June in order to provide sufficient time for companies to fully evaluate all the blocks on offer.  Given that our round coincided with similar rounds in other European areas and that certain material facts became available to companies only recently, the degree of interest in the round has been satisfactory. All in all, 27 companies are seeking licences under applications submitted by 13 consortia.  These include a number of companies new to the Irish offshore as well, of course, as many of the companies already operating here.  My Department are now involved in detailed discussions with the applicants.  When all necessary negotiations have been completed the full picture will emerge of the acreage and associated work commitments to be covered by the licences to be awarded in the round.</P>
    <P>I hope to announce the award of licences sometime in August.  I am confident that as a result of the round the next few years will see some acceleration in the pace of exploration.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing weakening of world oil prices, and increasing competition for scarce exploration funds, interest has still not been lost in the deeper waters off our coasts.  As I mentioned previously, Britoil are drilling their first exploratory well offshore Ireland in the Porcupine Basin and another company, new to Ireland, Quadrant Exploration, <Col N="1026" /> have carried out an extensive seismic programme over three Porcupine blocks, which they hold under option agreement. More recently, an agreement has been reached with BP giving them an option on seven Porcupine blocks in which they have a keen interest.  Apart from wells to be drilled if the area is eventually licensed &mdash; and there is provision for up to four wells in the initial phase of such licence &mdash; the agreement provides that BP will immediately shoot 1,500 kms of seismic over the blocks.  This work has already commenced.</P>
    <P>My professional advisers believe that the Porcupine Basin has considerable potential and to advance exploration there my Department are in the process of preparing a comprehensive report on the geology, geophysics and geochemistry of the basin.  This report will be made available for purchase by the oil industry. It will be prepared along the same lines as the report which was produced for the Celtic Sea Basin, which on its publication evoked a positive response from the exploration industry and led to an upsurge in exploration activity in that particular area.</P>
    <P>The Government are well aware of the commercial realities facing the oil exploration industry at the moment. Earlier this year, the Minister for Finance issued a statement giving details of the taxation regime which will apply to oil and gas developments.  By and large, the industry has welcomed that statement. More recently I outlined in the House the manner in which I would apply, in the case of marginal fields, the discretionary power available to me under sections 23 (7) and 29 (2) of the 1975 exclusive off-shore licensing terms.  These two sections empower me to reduce the levels of royalty and &ldquo;carried&rdquo; State participation in order to enable a marginal field to be developed and, at the same time, to provide a reasonable return on the expenditures to be incurred by the licence holders.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements, without going into much detail, provide for a formula governing royalties, State participation <Col N="1027" /> and carry, based on a profitability indicator. Relief, by way of the formula, will only apply in the case of marginal fields, and by a &ldquo;marginal field&rdquo; I mean one on which the return on investment does not adequately reward the investor for risk, taking account of alternative investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The arrangements I will be applying may seem rather complex.  This is unavoidable, because it is a delicate exercise which needs to strike a fair balance between the State's interests and the need to allow an adequate return on the high risk investment of the oil companies. The matter has been studied in great detail in my Department and the arrangements to be applied have been tested over a wide range of hypothetical cases. I am satisfied that they are the fairest that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements, which will apply to new licences, including licences granted under the third round, will facilitate the more competitive and better endowed companies in committing the large funds involved in exploration and will at the same time safeguard the State's entitlement to its due share of revenue from a field.  I will, of course, be prepared to consider on a case by case basis any requests from the holders of existing licences to have the new arrangements made applicable to their current licences.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that 85 exploration wells have been drilled offshore Ireland, I still believe that the potential of our acreage &mdash; which is very considerable &mdash; is far from fully tested.  While we would have wished for better results to date, we have nonetheless one producing gasfield and there have been quite a number of encouraging flows of oil and gas.  Regrettable, it is a fact that many of the wells drilled in the Celtic Sea did not penetrate the deeper geological horizons which now, in the light of more recent developments and with the availability of better quality seismic data, are considered to be more prospective than was originally believed.  My Department have been trying to ensure that as much information as possible should be made readily <Col N="1028" /> available to the exploration companies and to encourage them to participate in our exploration programme.  Indeed, over 10,000 kilometres of speculative seismic have been shot in preparation for the Third Round over the blocks on offer. Arrangements were also made in 1984 for all available non-confidential well and seismic data to be commercially marketed on a worldwide basis so as to ensure maximum access to that data for the industry.  Companies are aware of this and, indeed, many of them have acquired large amounts of the latest available good quality seismic data which, together with the most recently available well data, will in the future form the basis for sound exploration programmes.</P>
    <P>Onshore exploration activity continued during 1984 in the North West Carboniferous Basin, where two exploratory wells were drilled, one in Cavan and one in Leitrim.  Unfortunately, only minor indications of gas were encountered in each case.  These two wells were part of a four-well exploration programme relating to the entire Basin, which extends to areas north of the Border in County Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the licensees, are now considering possible arrangements to provide for further exploration work in the licensed area.</P>
    <P>During 1984 a new onshore licence was awarded to the Tullow Oil Company. The licensed area covers parts of counties Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny and Laois and, following the satisfactory execution of the initial work phase of their work programme, which was commenced this year, the licensees will have earned the right to a one-year extension of the licence during which they will be committed to drill at least one exploratory well.</P>
    <P>I would now like to focus briefly on two other issues relating to oil supply. While other energy forms, particularly natural gas, are now playing an increasingly important role in meeting Ireland's energy requirements, oil remains the primary energy source and will continue to be very important for many years ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the issue of the Whitegate refinery is one that comes <Col N="1029" /> frequently to the fore in any Irish energy policy debate.  The background to the State acquisition of the refinery and the introduction of the mandatory offtake regime in September 1982 is well known, and I do not intend to dwell on past history on this occasion.  The mandatory offtake system was challenged in the Irish courts by some oil marketing companies in Ireland, and was defended by the Government.  In July of last year the European Court ruled that, while the mandatory offtake system amounted to a quantitive restriction on imports &mdash; prohibited under the EC Treaty &mdash; an exemption from this probibition may in certain circumstances be justifiable on grounds of public security as provided for under the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Although it was a year of two distinct halves in terms of market and refinery economics internationally, Whitegate got through 1984 within the target levels which were anticipated when the purchase of the refinery was entered into. While international developments played a major part in these matters, the INPC and the Whitegate workforce have themselves achieved significant improvements.</P>
    <P>During 1984 my Department entered into more intensive negotiations with Gulf Oil in relation to the Whiddy Island oil terminal.  Those negotiations concluded in a package which I outlined to this House last December.  The formal contractual agreement with Gulf which embodied this package, the principal element of which provided for reconstruction of the terminal's jetty, was signed on 4 February 1985.  Since then preparatory work on the project has been under way, including discussions between Gulf and various Government and local authority agencies, to ensure that the project fully takes account of the recommendations of the Costello Tribunal report into the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster at Whiddy in January, 1979.</P>
    <P>Turning to mining, there has been a fall-off in the level of exploration in recent years for a variety of reasons largely outside our control.  This has been a world wide phenomenon related to the <Col N="1030" /> recession in economic activity.  My Department have taken various steps with a view to attracting foreign exploration companies to Ireland such as the improvement of services, in regard to information and otherwise, available from public agencies.  I am glad to state that the steady decline in recent years in the number of exploration licences appears to have been arrested and we are looking forward to an increase in the number of such licences in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in the House recently the position in regard to the Tara-Bula takeover deal.  While agreement in principle was reached some months ago, the deal in question has not yet been completed and I am not, therefore, in a position to give full details.  The preparation of the necessary contract documents and an examination of certain financial details have been in train for some time.  A number of significant problems emerged in the course of these exercises, which necessarily took some time to resolve.  I am hoping, however, to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that in this case as in other cases there is a reasonable return to the State in terms of tax, royalties and dividends.  In fact, towards the close of last year Tara Mines complied with our wishes not to issue redeemable preference shares which would have diminished the rights of the State.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the activities of Bord na Móna.  Today, Bord na Móna contribute about 15.3 per cent of our national energy needs.  At the end of the 1983-84 production year, turf accounted for 1.303 million tonnes of oil equivalent in our national energy supply.  The overall Bord na Móna capital estimate for 1985 is nearly £11 million which is mainly for the continuation of bog development work under the board's Third Development Programme.  Significant provisions include £1.914 million for railways, £1.794 million for machines, £2.337 million for drainage and £0.612 million for buildings.  The Ballyforan briquette project was deferred by decision of the board <Col N="1031" /> in 1984.  Consequently no provision has been made for it in this year's Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>In 1985, production will consist of 4.8 million tonnes of milled peat, 0.484 million tonnes of briquettes and 0.415 million tonnes of sod peat.  Production of moss peat will rise from 1.424 million cubic metres in 1984 to 1.5 million cubic metres in 1985.  Over half of the milled peat will be used for electricity generation and the remainder for the production of briquettes.  Sales in 1984 were 4.321 million tonnes of energy products and 1.424 million cubic metres of moss peat with a total value of £112 million.  Sales in 1985 are estimated at 4.509 million tonnes of energy products and 1.5 million cubic metres of moss peat with a value of £121 million.  The Government are committed to the continued development of this valuable indigenous energy resource for electricity generation and for domestic use.</P>
    <P>The Private Bog Development Grant Scheme, which came into existence almost four years ago, has had a wide welcome and the indications are that it is highly successful.  The 1985 allocation for the grant scheme is £1.5 million.  Since its inception, approximately 550 schemes have been grant-aided and to date £3.327 million in grant-aid has been approved in respect of the development of some 1.5 million tonnes of sod peat under this scheme.  I have just received a review of the scheme and my preliminary conclusion is that this State encouragement was a major influence on this significant production of domestic energy supplies.  It is clear too that the existence of the scheme has promoted the development of more efficient machines and production methods.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the electricity sector.  The Electricity Supply Board's non-voted capital expenditure for 1985 will be of the order of £230 million.  This provision represents a decrease of 7.6 per cent on the 1984 outturn of £249 million and signals the beginning of an era of reduced capital expediture by the board as completion of major projects such as the <Col N="1032" /> Moneypoint generating station comes to an end.</P>
    <P>1985 is a significant year in the development of the ESB as the first 300 megawatt coal fired unit at Moneypoint comes on stream next October.  The Moneypoint coal project was conceived to lessen our dependence on oil as a basis for electricity generation and to give major fuel economies. Steam coal is now considerably cheaper than oil and it is believed internationally that this price differential will continue long term.</P>
    <P>The provision for expenditure on generating capacity in 1985 will be £140 million; £136 million of this sum will be spent on work at the Moneypoint site.  The balance of £4 million relates to residual expenditure on the extensions to peat fired stations at Lanesboro' and Shannonbridge and the new gas fired combustion turbines at North Wall in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The board's expenditure on premises and general equipment is expected to amount to £4.2 million.  A major portion of this expenditure will be on the completion and equipping of the national control centre at head office in Dublin and refurbishment of a number of area depots throughout the country.  The board anticipate that the expenditures on the new national control centre will achieve efficiency savings of up to £2.5 million per annum in their fuel costs.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the ESB on transmission and distribution projects will amount to about £82 million in 1985.  This includes £25 million for the 400kV lines from Moneypoint to the east side of the country and £5 million on maintenance of standards on the existing transmission system.  Expenditure on distribution projects will account for the remaining £52 million in 1985.  This expenditure is required to maintain an acceptable level of service to existing customers and to strengthen electricity distribution networks for the connection of new customers.</P>
    <P>The sum provided in the Vote this year for the Western Package Electrification Scheme is just over £2 million.  The aim of this scheme is to improve over a ten year period the viability and competitiveness <Col N="1033" /> of farms through the extension and improvement of electricity supplies to farms in the region.</P>
    <P>Eligibility is in accordance with EEC Regulation 1820/80.  Those who qualify for aid must be principally dependent on agriculture for their income.  The State and the EC each contribute 40 per cent of the cost of connection, the remaining 20 per cent being borne by the beneficiaries. To date, 3,264 applications have been approved under the scheme at a total cost of £7,640,683.  It is anticipated that a further 699 farms will benefit under the scheme in 1985.  I have recently carried out a review of the scheme, and I have put forward for approval by the Commission certain proposals with a view to its improvement.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the report of the inquiry into electricity prices is the result of independent analysis and research into the cost structure, operations and organisation of the Electricity Supply Board.  The inquiry team was appointed in July 1983 under the chairmanship of the former chief executive of the Danish Electricity Utility, Elsam, and included in its membership representatives from industry and Government Departments.  I have referred the report to the ESB for consideration of its various recommendations and I expect that in the near future we will have our first opportunity to assess how these are being or are to be implemented.  The ESB have, as Deputies will be aware, already embarked on a variety of initiatives designed to improve overall efficiency and to effect price improvement.  There are no easy or simple routes to this end, bearing in mind many adverse factors, among which are a few years of negative growth in demand, high dollar exchange rates and other; but I do agree that maximum efficiency and price improvement must be a top priority for the board.</P>
    <P>Natural gas from the Kinsale gas field is broadening our fuel mix to a significant degree, providing a secure supply of essential energy until the end of the century and contributing handsomely to the economy by displacing a significant proportion <Col N="1034" /> of expensive imported oil products.  For example, in 1984 natural gas displaced the equivalent of 2.09 million tonnes of oil, representing approximately 22 per cent of Ireland's primary energy input. As I have mentioned already, BGE are also a substantial contributor to the Exchequer.  The amount to be paid this year is estimated to be £87 million, an increase of £33 million over last year's contribution.  The explanation for this is that the State places in the hands of BGE, at a very competitive price, an asset which belongs to the people as a whole. The marketing of these resources in accordance with approved economic criteria inevitably gives rise to a large surplus in the books of BGE and it is clearly appropriate that this profit should be available, through the Exchequer, for the benefit of the people as a whole. Those who advocate &ldquo;give-away&rdquo; policies by BGE for the benefit of special interests, and those only in the regions linked to a gas supply, should bear this in mind.  Moreover, market clearing prices are urged by EC and IEA to try to ensure rational use of energy.  The Government adopted the policy of energy related pricing in 1982.</P>
    <P>Under present policy, I am planning the depletion of the Kinsale field over 25 years approximately from 1979.  The bulk of this is going towards electricity production, industrial and commercial use and the premium market of domestic and home heating uses.  If there are further supplies of gas available, policies on allocation and price will be reviewed.  I would point out to the advocates of cheap gas that it would make little economic sense to lay a costly capital infrastructure at heavy State expense based on a lower gas price than later further supplies will be available at.  Such a development would be unlikely to endure.  Imported gas is certain to be costlier than present supplies and any new indigenous gas is not likely to be cheaper either.</P>
    <P>Following the agreement reached with the Dublin Gas Company last year, the development of the largest premium market in the country for natural gas is now fully under way.  While sales by that <Col N="1035" /> company in 1984 fell somewhat short of projected levels, Dublin Gas Company are confident that they will achieve their sales target in 1985.  Overall sales of gas in the Dublin region are targeted to show an eight-fold increase between 1982 and 1991.  Despite some minor setbacks, Dublin Gas Company's major conversion and development programmes are progressing within budget.</P>
    <P>The State's contribution to the project consists largely of rebates off the price of the gas delivered to the Dublin Gas Company, while the State has a significant shareholding in the company and is entitled to a large share of the profits. All in all, projections of the amount of moneys accruing to the State over the life of this project are expected to be about £740 million, and I would like to assure the House that so far as I am concerned there will be very little room in the affairs of Dublin Gas for speculator profits.</P>
    <P>Government policy dictates that natural gas should be distributed to population centres and industrial consumers only where it is economically feasible to do so.  Regard must be had to appropriate rate of return on investment in such supply projects.  In adopting this policy the underlying consideration was that the gas should be utilised so as to derive the maximum possible benefit for the community as a whole while at the same time making it a competitive and cost-efficient fuel.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, consideration of the supply of natural gas to towns or industries must necessarily be based on sound projects which will enable the State to achieve a reasonable return on its investment. Furthermore, BGE must get a price for the gas which reflects its inherent value as a replacement for imported energy.  The Kinsale Head gas field has a limited life-span and its reserves must be fully and properly utilised to the maximum benefit of the Irish economy in the long run.</P>
    <P>In this context discussions are continuing concerning the supply of gas to Limerick and I hope that these will be <Col N="1036" /> concluded soon so that I can put the matter before Government for consideration. Bord Gáis are also discussing proposals concerning the supply to and distribution of natural gas in Clonmel and in Waterford.  In Clonmel, an already approved project had necessarily to be revised by the Clonmel gas utility management because of omissions from the essential scope of the work and other proposed variations in the project.  Renegotiation of the altered financial requirements has not yet been finalised between Clonmel and BGE.  The projects for Limerick and Waterford will be put to Government as soon as I have BGE's proposals.  The same will apply to Clonmel unless the changes from the previous Government approval are not significant. As to Cork, following the withdrawal from negotiations of a private sector company, I have authorised Bord Gáis Éireann to proceed with an offer for all of the shares of Cork Gas Company.  The Cork Gas Company have been in a critical financial position for some considerable time and I believe that this is the best means available of revitalising the company and of ensuring the continuation, on an economic basis, of supplies of natural gas to consumers in Cork.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation remains a very important objective of my Department. The allocation for energy conservation at £310,000 is slightly reduced compared with the provisional outturn for 1984 of £351,000.  I would have wished, if the overall financial position were easier, to have some modest additional funds for promoting conservation, but I am conscious that energy saving has its own significant reward, and a short pay back time.  This will not cause any significant adverse effect on the effectiveness of the energy conservation programme.  Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the expenditures in earlier years will continue to be rewarded in the longer term so that the national benefit from our endeavours is growing year by year.</P>
    <P>In the past the main thrust of our conservation and energy efficiency effort was aimed at domestic and industrial energy users.  Energy efficiency awareness was <Col N="1037" /> promoted in these sectors by means of information and advisory programmes, together with practical assistance under the attic insulation grants scheme, the steam audit service, the national boiler testing service, etc.  These sectors will still be well provided for in the 1985 programme with the energy phone answering householders' queries during the months of the heating season and the introduction of the electrical audit service to replace the steam audit.  The fuel efficiency survey grant scheme will also continue.</P>
    <P>Attention is now being focused on the public sector in the development of new initiatives to realise the large potential savings previously identified in this sector, that is in Government offices, educational buildings, local authorities, etc.  The practical benefit to be gained by achieving even a fraction of these savings is self-evident.  In addition, the public sector, I hope, will be able to give the lead to others to improve their energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>An important complement to the energy conservation programme is the European Community's energy demonstration programme which is administered by the Commission.  Under this programme financial assistance is granted to support innovative energy projects which demonstrate the efficient use of energy.  This scheme provides an excellent incentive for the development of new sources of energy and the improvement of energy efficiency in Ireland as well as in the other member states.  In 1984 successful Irish applicants were approved grand aid totalling £1.9 million under the programme, and further grants will be announced later this year.  We will also be continuing our various programmes, some of them with EC assistance, dealing with new and renewable energy.  However dramatic results are not to be expected in the short term from these initiatives and caution is required in regard to the allocation of resources to them.</P>
    <P>I have very briefly outlined the main areas of activity of my Department to illustrate the importance of the functions <Col N="1038" /> involved, despite the relative smallness of the Vote, at £10.3 million.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed with the Minister's speech in that decisions have not been taken in many areas where I would have thought final decisions would have been taken, and action taken.  I will list all these areas as we go along.  I am gravely disappointed about the lack of action in areas that could make a very significant contribution to the advancement of economic activity.  We have had a litany of inactivity and indecision, unfortunately, probably because of ideological paralysis that exists within the two parties in Government today.  For instance, take the natural gas pipeline development.  For the last two and a half years many times from these Opposition benches we plugged unrelentingly for an expansion of the natural gas grid.  I have an interest in that because when I was Minister for Industry and Energy in 1982 that project was carried out in very quick time and under budget, and it was a significant landmark in public sector development.  It showed what could be done with both public sector and private sector involvement, and I would have thought that such principles and policies would have been pursued by the present Government because of the excellent results they showed in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even then, in October 1982, I made decisions in principle that Limerick should get natural gas, that the spur should be extended from the gas pipeline to Limerick, and that Clonmel and Waterford should get natural gas on another spur.  What has happened?  Nothing unfortunately.  Two and a half years later we are still talking, and the Minister said that when the arrangements are finally worked out he will bring them to Cabinet.  The history of the two Government parties is no credit to any Minister or Department.  I appreciate that the present Minister has not been there for very long.  Nevertheless we have had a Government in office for two and a half <Col N="1039" /> years.  I do not know what the Minister and his predecessor were doing, but between the two of them we have not gone one step further down the road.</P>
    <P>We finished a good project in 1982.  We had excellent contractors, and one would have thought that the best value for money would be got by ensuring the continuation of that partnership and that team to expand our natural gas grid.  It is not denied by anybody that a great impetus to economic activity on the building and construction side would be given by bringing natural gas into cities like Limerick and Waterford and a large provincial town like Clonmel.  It would give an impetus to reducing energy costs for industry, and domestic consumers who have to meet high electricity bills week in and week out would benefit also.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the Government face many difficulties in many other areas, this is one area where they could have got their teeth into something and shown something for their time rather than producing a blank sheet after two and a half years of inactivity and indecision. There is no myth about laying a spur off a main gas pipeline into places like Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford.  I do not want to belittle the type of operation that takes place but in a sense it can be compared to bringing a group water scheme off a main.  It is as simple as that.  It is no great job.  Why have this Government not proceeded with it?</P>
    <P>There is no great joy in the Minister's speech for Clonmel, Waterford or Limerick and no indication of when the arrangements will be worked out. Arrangements were worked out by Limerick Corporation in October 1982. The Coalition-dominated corporation decided then that they were prepared, happy and willing to take a minority stake in Limerick Gas then.  How two and a half years later, has it taken so long to break the back, the heart and the commitment of the private sector partnership who were prepared to go in with Limerick Corporation?  Did it take so long to get them out of the scheme so that Labour Party ideology and policy could be pursued? <Col N="1040" /> The Minister is entitled to pursue his policies in Government.  I too am entitled to question whether that is in the national interest, in the interest of the community in Limerick, Clonmel, Waterford, Kilkenny or anywhere else and whether it is in the taxpayers' interest.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as the Minister recognises, that natural gas is a national asset which should be used to the best benefit of the taxpayers.  I am not convinced by anything I have heard up to now that the taxpayer in Limerick or in the country in general will benefit from the policy and the direction being pursued that all gas companies in which the State is involved must be majority State owned, and nothing that has happened up to now has convinced or will convince me or any hard pressed taxpayer either.  Surely it was in everybody's interest to get the job done two and a half years ago.  Then the benefits would have accrued to the taxpayer and he would have received some alleviation, but no, this Government are prepared to stop all progress and movement because of an ideological hangup between the two parties.  That does not serve the interest of the country or of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>After two and a half years finally the private sector partnership had to pull out of Limerick.  The same private sector partnership was prepared to take a majority stake in Cork Gas Company. Here again the Minister's Department, and he I presume, were not prepared to give the go ahead to it.  Finally the taxpayer &mdash; the State again &mdash; must come in and bail out an ailing company in a very serious financial situation.  Pursuing that line, I find difficult to understand, and perhaps the Minister will tell me, if they were so badly off financially as obviously they were, why so much per share was paid to them.  How long could they last?  A week?  A day?  Has somebody political friends?  I am not looking at the Minister when I say that, but if he is trying to convince me, this country, this party and this House that he is pursuing policies in the best interest of the taxpayer, then he should do the hard commercial <Col N="1041" /> thing in relation to that. Somebody's pal somewhere along the line had to be looked after because in the hard commercial world the shares were not worth what was paid for them, far from it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, why were this private company allowed to run up credit to the tune of £4 million with the State company Bord Gáis Éireann?  Why did they allow the credit to run so high?  That accusation is being made every day in the week by the hard pressed taxpayers against the Revenue Commissioners and the Government.  Why allow them to run up such huge credit whether in holding back PAYE, PRSI or anything else?  A semi-State body allowed a private company to run up £4 million approximately of credit and then had to allow them to pay for present day supplies.  That was not in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer.  The takeover inevitably had to be done by somebody, perhaps by the State fully.  I would not agree with that.  I would agree with a partnership of the private sector and the State sector which in my opinion would have worked out better in the long term and would give better value for money and a better return to the taxpayer in general.  That did not happen in Limerick or Cork.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny we come to another private company who also have an interest in Dundalk in another gas company.  Different criteria seem to apply there.  The State were not prepared to take out Kilkenny but they were prepared to take out Cork.  Yet a very large industrial complex on the edge of Kilkenny were only too happy to enter into negotiations.  For months past the people of Kilkenny have been misled into believing that they were going to get natural gas.  Representatives of the Government and of the Minister's party in Government with him were continually telling the people of Kilkenny that it could be negotiated, it would be negotiated, negotiations were going on. Negotiations have been finalised and at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies Bord Gáis Éireann were able to confirm <Col N="1042" /> to me that Kilkenny was not getting natural gas.  The following week in the Kilkenny newspapers Deputies from the Government side were still trying to mislead the public into believing that natural gas could be negotiated and would be on its way.  Perhaps it was because we were nearing a local election era.  Despite the fact that negotiations had been broken off a considerable time previously, members of the Government were still trying to mislead the people of Kilkenny that they would be supplied with gas.  The people of Kilkenny are entitled to know why they should not get it when the State was prepared to bail out an ailing company in Cork.  The 700 customers in Kilkenny and the large industrial complex were entitled to the same sort of treatment given to Cork but they did not get it because they do not have the political clout.  Things might be different if Deputy Peter Barry represented Kilkenny. Maybe the chairman of the parliamentary party does not matter as much in Government circles as Deputy Barry.  The latter was able to deliver the right deal for his people in Cork &mdash; of course, he had a Corkman as chairman of Bord Gáis as well and probably a little help along the way.  Once the local elections are over the poor people of Kilkenny are thrown to the wolves and told to forget about natural gas.  That is making fish of one and flesh of another.  No matter how the Minister tries to explain it to the people of Kilkenny, they believe they have been treated as second-class citizens in relation to this national asset.</P>

      <P>I never said I wanted to give it away.  They do not want it for nothing.  The Minister should not use that excuse.  What he says in this House is poles apart from what the Bord Gáis people say.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the fact that officials of his Department are not willing to attend for further questioning by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies in relation to some activities of Bord Gáis.  I <Col N="1043" /> hope the Minister will take this point and give due respect to the committees of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Minister to the Joint Programme for Government. The Leader of the House, Deputy John Bruton, said he was going to make this House work better by enlarging the committee system and that this Government would give every help and assistance. The Minister for Energy now says that the Leader of the House does not speak for him and that he will run his own show.  If that is to be the position, for heaven's sake stop conning the people and this House and forget about the committee system.  I have put many working hours into the committee system and it is a pure waste of time.  I am not interested in putting any public sector officials on the spot.  They are entitled to respect and I do not concur with the sort of questioning and abuse they have endured from certain committees of this House.</P>
      <P>If it is on that basis that they are making their case, I fully appreciate it but the committee of which I am a member have always taken the view that if a question is unanswerable as far as a civil servant is concerned all he has to do is say so and we will respect it.  If committees work in the way the Government have led the country to believe they do, let them do so.  If not, let us stop the charade, close them down and let the Ministers and Deputies get on with their business.  All we are doing is running from one committee to another.  It does not make much sense and they serve as a platform to undermine some of the institutions in this House.  People are using the committees for cheap political reasons to get themselves publicity.  That was not the purpose for which the committees were set up and I hope somebody takes a look at the system before it gets out of hand and decides whether we should continue to have these committees.  If we are not to have them, let us stop codding ourselves and the House, as well as the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> The area of Drogheda and Dundalk has been badly hit by industrial closures. Certain industries such as Premier Peri-clase were high energy users.  I know the problem which existed there in 1982 and I doubt if a takeover would then have happened had it not been for the fact that they expected natural gas.  As far as I was concerned, Dundalk and Drogheda, as well as Northern Ireland, were to get natural gas.  That area is a region which would benefit economically from natural gas.  We have a £5 million deposit from the British Government which the Minister held back despite the fact that the Taoiseach wanted to give it back and said so in this House.  I pay tribute to the Minister that he holds the same strong views as I do on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>In fairness, the Minister sat beside him and knew he said the wrong thing.  He managed to change the record within three hours but the Minister knows as well as I do what was said. We both knew he was wrong.  I have not a bad memory.  He said that any interpretation of the documents before him would suggest that the money should be repaid.  They were the precise words. I jotted them down.  I got the record before he changed it.  If that is the privilege of the Taoiseach of the day, let him have it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister kept the money anyway.  Full marks to him for that.  I would also draw attention to the fact that approximately £23 million is available from the EC for gas development along the Border area.  With £5 million sterling from the British Government and money available from the EC, why not build the pipeline to Dundalk and Drogheda?  What is holding it up?  If Bord Gáis are treating this development in a <i>laissez faire</i> manner, the Minister should get his finger out and make them <Col N="1045" /> do something about it.  For two and a half years they have done nothing except work on a small outer ring in Dublin, yet they have approximately 125 people employed.  What have they been doing? That was the only project they undertook. I warn the Minister, his Department and the House against the building of another semi-State empire at the taxpayers' expense.  Bord Gáis are a semi-State body who are no more than a conduit by which gas passes through &mdash; they are no more than that.  I am not convinced that an organisation with 125 technical qualified people were not capable of doing something better towards the development of natural gas than constructing a small outer ring in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Other benefits flow from the development of the natural gas grid.  Our spokesman on horticulture will have something to say on this industry where we can make a big impact on import substitution if the Government decide on a proper pricing policy for natural gas.  It cannot succeed until they have energy at the same cost as their competitors.  That is a simple fact of life and the Government must realise that the horticulture industry cannot properly develop without a pricing policy which is competitive with that enjoyed by producers abroad who flood this country with their produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's newspapers contain a submission by the CII on the evaluation of the development of the natural gas grid.  I hope the Minister will evaluate the project and if the sums are anywhere near those done by the CII the Minister should get Bord Gáis to do something about it.  This country badly needs economic activity and here is an area which can show a proper return on investment.  Borrowing money for good investment is good business.  I am not talking about cheap gas policies, although there are many who want it for nothing.  That is not the way to do it.  There is a difference between charging nothing, a cheap policy and charging very high prices.  There is also the spin-off and the added value to the economy in general.  It should be considered in these terms and not merely <Col N="1046" /> on a narrow economic assessment as to the price to be charged for gas.  Certain areas can give a greater economic return by a proper pricing policy.</P>
    <P>I said many times in the House that the perspective to the outside world leaves a lot to be desired.  A national newspaper had a headline saying that there was a £10 billion gas find when there was a show of oil off the Waterford coast and many people were put out of business by this kind of irresponsible journalism.  That headline seemed to be as a result of a leak from Government sources and, if that is so, it is highly irresponsible.  Thank God the Irish investors caught on because the shares went down the following day and that is the way to deal with that sort of journalism.  The Government were not in a position to know how much gas was there and to talk about a sum of £10 billion puts it in a category of about two and a quarter times as big as the find off Kinsale&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows how good the journalists were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the newspaper mentioned Government spokesmen and I do not know who those invisible characters are.  They used to be called national handlers and I do not know if that term applies to this kind of Government spokesman.  Another national newspaper, within a matter of days, mentioned the sum of £4 billion which was probably a far better guess.  We would all like to think that the sum of £40 billion was correct but we know that until another three or four appraisal wells are dug nobody will know the extent of the gas find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always been convinced that there is more gas although I do not know its quality or quantity.  When one find is discovered, it is normal for others to follow and we are hardly the exception in that regard.  That is why I was prepared in 1982 to follow a progressive policy of expansion in the gas area and to follow an exploration policy which would have been of much greater benefit than the course adopted.  We need any possible <Col N="1047" /> economic activity which can be generated and the building and extension of natural gas spurs is one positive way in which the Government could have demonstrated their willingness to do something for unemployment if they had been able to overcome their internal ideological differences. If there is gas, perhaps it is time to decide what we will do with it. Companies will not be interested in finding more gas here until we have a definite policy in that regard.  We should develop the market to its full potential and a deal with the British Government regarding the supply of gas to Northern Ireland would have given impetus to market development which would have encouraged further exploration and a quicker development of any gas which might have been found.</P>
    <P>If there is another gas find of significant size in this country, will we fully develop the market and evaluate a national grid? Will we use gas as the major component in the economy?  I appeal to the Government and the Minister not to look at it in a narrow revenue context.  We need economic development and whatever contribution can be made by changes in policy in relation to natural gas, distribution and pricing will be fully supported by this party if we can be assured that it will bring overall benefits to the taxpayers. Naturally, the Minister for Finance would love to see more and more revenue coming in but if we could get more revenue, directly and indirectly, by a different policy it would be far better.  The Minister has common sense and I know that we do not differ much in many areas but I cannot accept the record of development and activity over the past two and a half years, as it has been very disappointing.</P>
    <P>Oil exploration needs the same climate as applies in the case of gas.  I have spoken in the House before on the revised terms of the 1975 agreement for oil and gas exploration.  I do not know where the Minister found his magic formula; I passed it on to people who fed it into a computer and they did not come to the same conclusions as the Minister, who <Col N="1048" /> would like us to believe that the oil industry were satisfied with them.  If that was the case, I would have expected that the third round would have been very successful.  Reading between the lines, it is obvious that the response was not very satisfactory.  If the third round had been successful, we would have heard a lot more about it and its postponement from 15 December shows that there was very little response.  I know, from my contacts in the oil industry, that they were looking at areas outside Ireland in which to invest their money and who can blame them? The attempt at changing the terms was a step in the right direction.  I gave my views on it at at the time and I have not changed them.  The problems were not dealt with in those changes but the major problem to be assessed is that of State participation and I hold on to the the sure fire bet of royalties.  From meeting oil industry experts, I know that they are more inclined to leave the royalties here and not to complain about them.</P>
    <P>The terms of 1975 seem to be a sacred cow, that they were produced and could not be changed by anybody.  They were right for the time when we thought that there was plenty of oil.  Ten years later we are still in the same position.  We are not an oil producing country.  Why should people put money into high risk investments if they do not expect to get a decent return?  It is a very risky area but the Government are not prepared to look at it properly, to provide the right climate and quadruple the level of exploration. In the course of his script the Minister referred to 84 wells, but more wells were drilled in the UK sector of the North Sea in six months this year than we have drilled since we started at the game.  We cannot be satisfied with that level of activity.  The expectation is, from information I obtained in the House, that we might have five or six wells drilled this year and possibly the same number next year, but that is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We should get rid of the hangup we have that we are giving away everything. We are not giving away anything because we have not found anything to give away. Let us find it first, and then, like Norway <Col N="1049" /> and the UK, we can change the rules. Anybody who looks at the change in rules by the UK in 1983 will note the difference it will make.  Everybody in the oil industry accepts that when something is found and we become a proven oil producing province different terms apply.  We have to get rid of the ideological notion that we cannot be giving away this and that when in effect we are not giving away anything.  All we are doing is stopping investors coming here to help us find the oil we all want.  I would like to see the horizon on the Celtic Sea, and the Porcupine if possible, littered with rigs drilling. That is what we need and the easy way to get that work going is to provide the right climate.</P>
    <P>However, I am convinced, because of the OPEC oil price reduction and the weakness in the oil market, that Ireland has missed the boat in oil exploration.  I am convinced that we are going to see a reduction in oil exploration for the rest of the decade and that it will be into the nineties before we see a rejuvenation of oil exploration activities.  I have good reason to suspect that Ireland is being seen in the oil exploration world as a reserve field.  We have been relegated to that position.  It is no great joy for me to make that statement, but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>The third round has been a dismal failure. I am convinced of that because four or five companies operating in Irish waters have not gone into the third round despite the fact that there were shows of oil and gas before that round closed. Surely that points to the fact that something is wrong.  If companies, some Irish and some international, have not gone into the third round, we must ask why? The reason is that the climate is wrong, the return does not exist and the UK terms are better.  Why should people not invest their money in the North Sea sector where they will get a good return in a proven oil province?  Investors do not have to come here to please us or for the privilege of spending their money here. They will spend it where they think they will get a decent return with the minimum of risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> The Government should take their courage in their hands before it is too late &mdash; something I have advocated very often.  I have made it easy politically for the Government to change the terms and spell out an honest appraisal of the position. We must find the oil first and then change the rules.  Apparently, we are quite prepared for narrow political reasons to let good international investment, which is scarce, bypass the country. The end result is that we will have a bad third round.  The Minister has told us that the position is satisfactory but, in departmental terms, that means that the position is far from satisfactory as far as the general public are concerned.  Before it is too late the Government should go the rest of the way.  They went a bit of the road, but in the wrong direction. Obviously, the people who advised the Government to go in that direction are not familiar with the oil exploration business and how one gets scarce international investments involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that the graph on mining activity here has gone down in recent years, once again indicating a need to change policy.  The approach of the Government, and the policies that existed prior to their taking office, are in need of change.  I did not have an opportunity to change the policy in the short time I was in charge of the Department but it may not be too long before I return and I will have pleasure in changing it to give Ireland the development prospects we should enjoy.  I want to give the Minister the opportunity in his remaining months or weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We were told by Minister Bruton and his sidekick, Minister Collins, that the mining town of Navan was getting a great present.  We were told that the town would be getting an extra 300 jobs, but in the middle of July the Minister tells us that the deal has not been completed and when it is he will be glad to announce details in the House.  When will something be done in the Department to finalise the deal?  On the day the announcement was made I know the deal had not been sorted out and I made a statement to that effect in the House.  It is my belief that the deal has not been sorted out, but if it is not sorted out quickly the only solution will be the appointment of a receiver.  The Minister has been negotiating for the last seven months and he knows the problems as well as I do.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Dáil resumes in October I will be looking for direct action to be taken in regard to this project.  It has gone on too long.  It appears that the Minister of State is the workhorse being used from time to time to take others off the hook.  He has tried to spin us stories and yarns in regard to the project, but his time has run out.  I am aware of the problems and that they have not been <Col N="1052" /> resolved.  I hope the Minister does something about them.</P>
    <P>Changes are needed in regard to our mining policy.  I accept that the climate for international mining is not great.  I would have thought we would have heard more about the ESB from the Minister than the two paragraphs in his speech.  I was a member of the Government that decided to carry out an inquiry into ESB prices.  A major problem facing industry is energy costs.  That problem would have been tackled if the Government were serious about reducing costs to industry and improving the climate for productivity. One major factor has been the cost of Government services such as the ESB and telecommunications.  The private sector has slimmed itself down but the Government have not.  Daily the Government are handing on to the private sector huge increases in costs in energy, public services and so on.</P>
    <P>Here is a specific area which was tackled by experts, a good report was produced, but no action was taken except that some time ago the Minister said there would be a small reduction in the cost of electricity to industry.  I wonder if the Minister was at the same Cabinet table that approved the Valuation Bill we had here this afternoon.  Because of pressure being exerted here all day I am glad the Government saw the light and did not guillotine the Bill through at 5.30 p.m.  Were the Department of Energy aware of what was in that Bill?  The Minister for Finance tried to present it as a slight technical change, but the real effect of it was that it would have a horrendous impact on industrial costs and would make us even more uncompetitive.</P>

For the first time electricity pylons and cables and electric motors in industry will be included.  The definition of valuation is being changed.  It used to cover machinery and buildings and now it will be plant and buildings.  For the definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; new schedules are included and in that are all the electricity areas I mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One more sentence completes the passing reference.  As at present set out, it will add almost 1p to the cost of production at Ardnacrusha and approximately ½p across the board. Earlier this year the Minister took one step forward but with this he will take three steps backwards.  I ask the Minister to bear these facts in mind because this is running contrary to his declared policy trying to reduce electricity costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> We have a report but no action is being taken on the prices side.  I want to bring to the attention of the House and the Minister the changing of regions by the ESB and the closing of district offices.  I am in favour of any move by the ESB as long as it will lead to a reduction in electricity costs.  The ESB are talking about changing their regions and so are Bord Fáilte but the Government should stop semi-State agencies, especially those under the control of the Minister for Energy, from going in different directions. This has been a weakness in overall co-ordinated management and is shown up quite distinctly in the energy area. Over the years Bord na Móna went in their direction and the ESB went in another with the result that we have over-capacity in the ESB and problems with Bord na Móna, but no overall co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at what is happening to the ESB and to look at the very excellent report submitted by the staff associations.  They commissioned outsiders to investigate this area.  I have read this report and the conclusion these outsiders came to is that it will do nothing to reduce electricity prices.  Yet that is the reason the ESB gave for changing their regions.  I want the Minister to satisfy himself that this will lead to reduced electricity costs.  The staff associations, who proved their case, are not being listened to by the ESB.  They refused to sit down and discuss the merits or demerits of this report.  I want the Minister to take this on board and to ensure they get a fair hearing.  If changing the regions does not reduce the cost of electricity, the Minister knows what to do, because Tralee, like Athlone, will be affected.</P>
    <P>We are all disappointed to see that after another year the Ballyforan peat briquette is not going ahead.  Deputy Kitt will discuss this in detail because it is in his constituency.  I notice the Minister has reviewed the private bog development scheme.  This is an excellent scheme, but I was worried about it when it was mentioned in this House.  In 1982 the Department of Finance tried to ensure <Col N="1055" /> that that scheme would be scrapped.  This is an excellent scheme which has provided jobs and incomes in many poor areas. With Bord na Móna's move away from sod peat production, this can fill that vacuum very effectively.  I do not want to see anything happen to that scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Except to expand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Would the Minister consider producing a policy for cut-away bog development?  By the year 2000 there will be approximately 200,000 acres available.  Here we are in 1985 and we are not focusing our minds on this.  We are talking about it now and again, but that is not what I am talking about.  I want a policy set out clearly so that we will all know what is going to happen. Part of these cut-away bogs may be suitable for afforestation or horticultural development or for other uses and it is time a policy document was issued so that each interest can make plans.  We have 230,000 unemployed and these are areas which could provide work, but there is no sign of a policy direction.  I appreciate that the overall drainage will have to be the responsibility of Bord na Móna, but whatever the Minister has in mind, he will have my full support when he brings it into this House if it makes sense and if it will contribute to economic development and activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Moneypoint comes on stream there will be serious overcapacity of electricity. What are we going to do with it?  Have we focused our minds on it?  Have the ESB focused their minds on it?  Perhaps I might mention a few ideas which I think are worth considering.  In any industry if there is over-capacity one looks at the alternatives.  The first is, we can leave it alone and the price of the product will stay high, it will probably be uncompetitive and no more jobs will be created, or we could look at the second alternative, which is marginal cost pricing. This situation must be realistically faced.  We will have very serious overcapacity in electricity in relation to Moneypoint, where the fuel mix probably will <Col N="1056" /> be the cheapest of any.  That is a plus on one side.  On the other, we have the social and economic problems of Bord na Móna in connection with the peat stations. Having looked at the last report, I am quite satisfied that production unit costs in many of the milled peat stations are very good.  What are we going to do with all this electricity?  We are now at a juncture where more energy appears to be available and, with a full assessment of the natural gas situation in Cork, one should look at excess ESB capacity and ascertain the best use to be made of this.</P>
    <P>One idea worth looking into again is that of a smelter.  One of the reasons for this not being continued with in the seventies was the high cost of energy. That was only one of the factors, the market situation being another.  We know where the smelter will be put and I am talking about the Minister's own constituency. This is also very close to Moneypoint for supply of electricity.  This must be assessed and evaluated.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should now tell the ESB to stop planning any more generating stations.  We have one which is costing probably £1.2 billion at Moneypoint.  I am not faulting their vision away back in the seventies when they built to a certain expectation which was not realised.  Nobody could foresee the oil crisis of 1979.  I know the ESB and I am sure the Minister does.  They will be doing things that we will never find out about until it is too late.  What are the ESB planning people doing now that their capital programme has come to an end for the moment?  The Minister for Finance said that I was not here last week.  I was out in the Arab states and there are still very large areas for expansion of our services out there.  The ESB have been singularly successful in the Gulf States and Saudi-Arabia.  However, they can expand.  Let them not plan any more stations until we see where our future supplies of energy will come from. That is a vital national problem which needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Recently, the French were offering electricity to Britain at 2p per unit.  If that sort of price is available in Europe, we <Col N="1057" /> are part of Europe and it is time we thought in European terms.  It is time we thought seriously about an inter-connector into Fishguard.  I know that the British Government are always reluctant on these matters.  Perhaps they want to keep us as an isolated island.  However, when one sees such electricity prices on offer in Europe and gas prices which are much less than we can offer at present, it is time we thought in European terms.  If we are part of Europe, let us get the benefit of it.  We can never have the economies of scaling electricity production or the nuclear power which they have in France, or the hydro power they have in Northern Europe.  The only way is to do it ourselves as far as we can and where we cannot, to link into a European grid, both in relation to gas and electricity. Those areas must be examined now. However, I see no signs of any new policy coming out of the Minister's Department. I hope that they will address themselves to some of the points I have raised, and I am sure that there are many more as well.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for legislation to give a statutory base to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  They have expanded their activity in Whitegate and should not be proceeding without such statutory base.  I have heard nothing about this in recent times and it is a couple of years overdue.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of the Whiddy terminal, I remember the Minister for Energy's nice, flowery announcement of the takeover of Whiddy on 4 February this year.  I happened to be down there not very long ago.  I would like the Minister to confirm or otherwise if planning permission to do any work there has yet been applied for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite recently, and it has been objected to in good Irish style.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the basis for that, so I cannot comment on it.  I would like to see this terminal renewed as soon as possible.  I hope the objections <Col N="1058" /> can be overcome because it is a development that we can do with, especially since that oil company got on so well in their settlement in the London courts.  They were able to point out that a 60 million dollar job would be done in Cork.  I hope that I am here on the day that job is finished.  I am making a visionary statement when I say that I do not believe for one minute that they will spend 60 million dollars.  It was a hiked up version.  The Minister knows it is much easier to prove a claim in a London court if you are able to walk in with a nice agreement between yourself and the Irish Government saying that 60 million dollars should be spent and that that amount must be taken into account in the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the overall value of the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It took only 35 million dollars in 1982 to restore the Whiddy oil terminal to its former position.  This is a half job.  I do not think anybody can convince me that in 1985, three years later, it will take double the amount of money to do half the job.  I do not think that inflation has been that rampant in the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the areas that have not natural gas and with all the areas of inactivity by the Minister and his Department.  I should like to be progressive in relation to new policy but do not get the opportunity because new policies are not coming out.  It may well be that I will have to start to write my own.  I have already written some, in case the Minister does not believe I do any work in this area.  Unless he is prepared to produce a policy for future energy direction, for promoting economic activity in the expansion of natural gas, for creating the right climate in which the horizons of our shores can be littered with rigs before it is too late, the alternative Government on this side of the House will show the direction, as we have often done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Energy Estimate. <Col N="1059" /> However, I am very disappointed at the Minister's speech here this evening.  The first thing which disappoints me, coming from the west of Ireland, is the western package scheme.  This was the subject of parliamentary questions here recently when Deputies from the west questioned the reason for the scheme being so rigid in its application.  The Minister told the House that he was hopeful that he could get some changes in that package, at least to restore the scheme to the position that obtained in 1983.  He knows that up to the end of 1983 when a second family house was built on a farm, the people in that house could qualify for a subsidy on electricity installation.  It is regrettable that that scheme was changed at the end of that year.  That seems very unfair.  I hope the Minister will have more success when he takes this matter up further with the EC Commission, as he indicated to us here a few weeks ago that he would do.</P>
      <P>The second difficulty that arose with regard to the scheme was the fact that many people were ruled out from benefiting under it.  For instance, where a farmer derived his sole income from the farm and where he got some social welfare benefits, whether unemployment assistance or some other aid, such a person was excluded under the scheme.  I had hoped that the Minister would have provided more money under the western package.  If we could remove these difficulties many more people would qualify. It is the duty of the Minister to renegotiate the scheme so that more people can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago I spoke in this House regarding the scheme as it applied pre-1983. At that time I had hoped it could be extended to local authorities to help them in their house building programmes.  I saw where they encountered difficulties in building houses in rural areas, particularly in remote regions, because of electricity costs.  It appears that the EC Court of Auditors were not happy with the way the scheme applied.  I am sure the Minister is confident about the success of the <Col N="1060" /> scheme but, as an indication of that, I had hoped he would provide more money in the western package.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the private bog development scheme is being continued. This is the only scheme in the west for providing roads and developing bogs. The conditions relating to the local improvement schemes have almost ruled out work under local authority schemes. Obviously it is important that this private bog development scheme should continue and I am glad that money has been provided for it.</P>
    <P>For me the major disappointment of the Minister's speech is that he gave only one or two sentences to the review of the Derryfada peat briquette factory near Ballyforan.  This review has been going on since May, even though it was supposed to be a short review.  However, he has not told us anything about the outcome of the review and no money has been provided.</P>
    <P>In 1979 this major development was sanctioned by the then Fianna Fáil Government and in the 1982 Estimate a sum of £5 million was provided.  In 1983 more than £8 million was provided and last year, even though the project was suspended, I understand that £4 million was provided.  This is the first year that not one penny has been provided in the Estimates for it, and the Minister has confirmed that fact for us this evening. It is obvious that the Government have abandoned the project because they have not been prepared to allocate money for it.</P>
    <P>It is rather ironic that in the last three weeks in Derryfada materials, machinery and plant for the Ballyforan peat briquette factory have been arriving in lorries.  That is in line with the announcement made in 1982 by the then Minister, Deputy Reynolds, that phase one would be in operation in 1985.  However, the machinery and plant arrived on a site that was cleared by the contractors when the contract was awarded but a building has not been provided.  Deputy Reynolds must be given credit when, as Minister, he named a target date for completion of phase one.  Obviously Bord na Móna <Col N="1061" /> went ahead in good faith, as I have always claimed, and they placed the contracts for the materials.  There was some controversy at the time that they had not placed these orders but it is obvious that they did so.  Some of the materials that were produced in this country were stored elsewhere in the meantime but now they have arrived at Derryfada.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been delayed each year and each of the delays has cost the taxpayer more money.  I understand that three reviews have been carried out.  It has been estimated by the ITGWU that the two year delay has cost in the region of £4 million.  If the delay is any longer it is obvious that we will have to spend even more money in the long term.</P>
    <P>In November 1983 I asked the then Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, the amount of money spent and the contracts entered into.  He told me the amount spent then was more than £4,500,000 and that Bord na Móna had gone ahead and had entered contracts for work on site development and on the entrance road, for the turbine generator, boilers, presses, screens for the factory, lighting, the intake system and the electrical works at the plant.  It was very encouraging at the time to see the work going on.  In terms of commitments, the figure I got from the trade unions was almost £20 million.  When one considers this amount, one has to ask what direction are the Government taking.  We have not had a decision from them regarding the outcome.</P>
    <P>During 1984 some 100 people were laid off from the Bord na Móna development works at Derryfada.  At the same time the Government told us they would review the project after a year.  It was most unfair to attempt to prejudice the review of this project.  There were 106 people working there but now there are only 56.  Some extra people were employed recently but some of them will be involved in building a tip-head to take away the milled peat from Derryfada and that is not an encouraging sign.  However I welcome the fact that some have been employed on developing the bogs.</P>
    <P>The Government decision to suspend <Col N="1062" /> the project for a year and have another review is a most unfair one.  People should not be laid off if the Government are to review the project.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why the decision was made.</P>
    <P>The first sod for the proposed Ballyforan briquette factory was turned in November 1982 and the first phase of the plant was to be in operation in 1985.  The factory was to have an output of 140,000 tons providing 110 jobs.  The second phase was to be at a later date.  While all the controversy went on about how big phase 1 and phase 2 would be, we did not even get a factory.  All that happened was that the site was cleared in 1982 but the civil engineering contract was withdrawn. The workers are uncertain about their future and the Minister owes them, and the local authorities in Galway and Roscommon who have carried out infrastructural work, an explanation.  What will be the outcome of the Ballyforan briquette factory?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Reynolds, I support any efforts made to reduce the cost of electricity. The ESB Officers' Association made a very reasonable request.  They asked the Department how in the proposed reorganisational plans savings could be made.  In County Galway we have a typical example of where a county will be divided into three areas.  The northern part of Galway will be administered from Sligo, the southern part from Limerick and east Galway from Dundalk. It is proposed to close the ESB headquarters in Galway.  The association commissioned two independent studies of the report carried out by Millar Barry, an American based company.  The association have stated that 60 jobs will be directly affected by closing down the ESB offices in Galway and that there will be a further 94 indirect job losses.  There will be a reduction in the level and quality of customer services.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to envisage how Galway could be administered by Dundalk.  The basic point made in the study is that there is no evidence from the report that there will be any cost savings.  The Minister should take up with the ESB the fact <Col N="1063" /> that we have a western package.  This is administered by the Tuam office in County Galway.  How could that package be administered from Dundalk?</P>
    <P>The request made by the association has not been answered.  We were told that if the report was implemented it would lead to efficiency and a reduction in the cost of electricity.  I have no information to indicate that that would be the case.  I am thankful to the Minister for sending me a letter stating there would be minimal changes.  I do not accept that 60 job losses is a minimal change.  If the Tuam office is closed there will be far reaching changes in County Galway.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister dealt with renewable sources of energy.  I am glad to see that money has been provided for these schemes and that the Department will promote the use of wind as an energy source.  I compliment in particular the Tuam engineering firm which provided a steel tower in the last few weeks.  It was switched on by the Danish Ambassador for the Agricultural Institute's Research Centre at Kinsealy.  Other areas such as the small hydro scheme are also worth promoting.  While the supply may be limited the cost is very reasonable.</P>
    <P>A lot of information is available about changing from oil to solid fuel systems. Many industries and, in particular, cooperatives like Waterford have had great success with these systems.  I am sure Deputy Kirk will have something to say about horticulture and how it can benefit that sector.  We all support the need to reduce the price of electricity but we must have facts and figures regarding organisational changes.</P>
    <P>The Department should look at the fact that we have such high energy costs in comparison with other EC countries. I saw a paper by the CII last year which stated that energy intensive firms have an annual electricity bill which is as high as their annual wages and salaries bill and that could cause any firm to make a loss. Many of the closures in 1984 were due to the very high cost of electricity.</P>
    <P>The Government's response was very poor.  At the end of 1984, when we should <Col N="1064" /> have been endeavouring to bring our costs into line with those of our European colleagues, electricity prices here increased.  According to the CII, electricity costs have increased from 44 to 51 per cent of our total energy costs between 1981 and 1984.  The fact that the case was taken up by the CII and of course by people in business and industry also is an indication of how seriously the situation was regarded.</P>
    <P>The domestic consumer, too, has every reason to be critical of the high cost of electricity.  In that regard, the very cold weather at the beginning of 1985 emphasised the importance of a low cost energy policy.  I trust the Minister will take up some of the points I have mentioned and that there will be more action in this area in the Department.  We have put forward our views in a constructive way but there is a need for much more activity on the part of the Department than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Estimate.  The Department of Energy are considered very important so far as my constituency of Louth is concerned.  The question of the extension of the natural gas pipeline to such towns as Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee is very much a live topic in Louth.  Much regret has been expressed in regard to the breakdown in the arrangements for the cross-Border pipeline to Belfast.  Many had regarded that arrangement as the beginning of a major step in the economic unification of the country.  Unfortunately, for reasons that are not very clear, the arrangement fell through.  In the meantime there had remained the hope that it could be activated but the indications are now that that will not happen. Our hopes were raised recently when a report of the two international firms of consultants &mdash; Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Congas Engineering, Toronto &mdash; indicated that the Kinsale gas project to the North was still a viable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the Minister and the Government will recognise the urgency of an extension of the natural gas line to <Col N="1065" /> County Louth.  As Deputy Reynolds has pointed out, there are many industries in Louth that would benefit immediately on natural gas becoming available there.</P>
    <P>Industries in that region and in the north-eastern part of the country generally have been struggling to continue in operation in the hope that the natural gas pipeline would be extended to the Border.  I appeal to the Minister to apply himself immediately to this question.  In recent times, as the spiralling unemployment figures will indicate, there has been a very considerable upsurge in industrial stagnation.  I am not saying that industrial promotion at this time is an easy task for anyone but there is a responsibility on the Government and on this Minister to ensure that viable projects such as the extension of the natural gas grid be given priority.  Finance must be provided to ensure that this sort of infrastructural work proceeds immediately.</P>
    <P>Recently, too, many commentators have been analysing the implications of population trends in Europe compared with the situation here.  These analyses would suggest that in some of the countries on the mainland of Europe there will not be sufficient manpower in between five and ten years' time to keep the existing industries in operation.  Therefore, the possibility of those industries relocating here should be pursued actively. However, any such move would involve our having regard to the state of our infrastructure.  We must consider such factors as production and energy costs. Our energy costs may be anywhere in the region of 25 to 40 per cent higher than the cost on the mainland of Europe.  The possibility of attracting industries to relocate here in such a high cost environment is a non-starter.  Therefore, we must tackle our energy costs immediately and bring them under control.  We must ensure that the forces that will control energy costs are brought into play without any further delay.</P>
    <P>In an American publication recently the President of the American Gas Association said that natural gas could move America away from over dependence on foreign oil, that it is an energy <Col N="1066" /> source that is available in growing volume.  Those sentiments could be applied to our country also.  If we had natural gas as an alternative source of energy, and if it were available at prices that would ensure lower production costs, we would be in a position to compete with our competitors in the market place.  That would give us immediately an advantage in the market place for our product.  As a small island country we are dependent to a large extent for wealth creation on our exports, so it is not unreasonable that our production costs be kept under control at all times. Our electricity costs can be between 25 per cent and 40 per cent dearer than on the Continent.  What chance have we of encouraging industrial development here while those costs obtain?</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to examine the programme of diversification of sources of energy, especially for electricity generation, and in particular the research programme for alternative sources of energy &mdash; and many people feel that the commitment of funds to that alternative energy programme by the Government is not what it ought to be &mdash; new forces could be introduced into the energy field. A notable success in recent times has been the generation of power by wind, the wind that blows freely along our western coasts.  Indeed, the Minister took pride not so long ago in unveiling one of those projects in the south.  It is a pity there are not more of those projects under way, because, the more alternative sources of energy we have the sooner will our dependence on imported oil be reduced.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to ignore the fact that we have the dearest energy in Europe, and that is not conducive to attracting industrialists here.  It may well be that in five or ten years' time we shall have a well educated, qualified workforce available to man the high technological industries and in other productive areas &mdash; a workforce that may not be available in the rest of Europe.  Surely we shall not allow a situation to develop in which our people will emigrate to take up the shortfall that may well apply in Europe? <Col N="1067" /> Rather we should examine the possibility of attracting such industries or having them relocated here.  We shall have to ask ourselves if our energy costs are not too high to render it attractive for such people to settle here, absorbing the many unemployed we have at present.  All the indications are that those unemployment figures will continue to increase in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>There have been fleeting references to energy costs for the horticultural industry by a number of speakers before me. Undoubtedly energy costs have devastated that industry over the last seven or eight years.  By way of example I should say that in 1977 we were producing approximately 121 per cent of the country's tomato needs whereas now we produce approximately 72 per cent. Inevitably this has led to an increase of imports of glasshouse crops.  The oil crises of the early and late seventies contributed to the near demise of our glasshouse industry.  We have in that industry people of tremendous commitment, who were prepared to work on, seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  Unfortunately, the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be farther and farther away.</P>
    <P>We did not appear to recognise that high energy costs were devastating their valuable source of employment.  We were prepared to see the industry go into decline, allowing more and more imports from countries such as the Netherlands, and that at a time when the Dutch Government were prepared to make natural gas available as an energy source to their horticultural industry.  We did not appear to identify what was happening or to formulate policies to reduce those imports.  Taking tomatoes as the prime example, they are still being imported in too great a volume.  Much media comment has been devoted to speculating on horticulutral produce being imported here and there have been many suggestions about how we should combat the problem.  We must first tackle the very high energy costs for growers here.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the grant scheme for conversion to solid fuel boilers offered <Col N="1068" /> a flicker of hope to those horticultural growers.  One must not overlook the huge investment of such growers in solid fuel boilers to burn coal.  A movement towards solid fuel inevitably carries inherent difficulties and dangers.  For example, there is the problem of coal imports &mdash; coal being the sole source of energy for these solid fuel boilers &mdash; when control will be out of the hands of the Department of Energy and our horticulturalists. Having made such huge capital investment the possibility of a transition to an alternative source of energy could pose real problems.  It could well push those growers, who have shown the grit and determination to remain in the business against all the odds, over the cliff into oblivion.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of the availability of natural gas to such growers should be examined immediately.  If the gas pipeline were to go northwards to Drogheda and Dundalk it would pass one of the main centres of concentrated horticultural production in the north Dublin area and on into my county of Louth, where there is considerable horticultural group also.  I do not see why we cannot make gas available at the right price to the industry, as was done in Holland, thereby ensuring the expansion of the industry and giving them the wherewithal to reduce imports.  The people in glasshouse production cannot wait for the Minister for Energy to make up his mind on this issue.  If they cannot be assured that natural gas will be made available to them, their businesses will go to the wall and we shall be left with a dead industry. Those who were prepared to make the capital investment in conversion have found that there is a possibility that natural gas will not be so attractive a proposition at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to address this problem in his summing up.  Both I and the horticultural industries will be glad to hear the Minister's views.  The Minister could throw a lifeline of hope to people in the horticultural industry if he told them that he is examining the possibility of having natural gas made available as quickly as possible.  If the Minister were <Col N="1069" /> to say tonight that he would make natural gas available in County Louth many people would be very happy.  We have 8,000 unemployed in the county and the unemployment figure will increase because we cannot get industries to set up in the county because of the high price of energy along with other factors.  I hope that the Minister, with his overall responsibility for what has become a very important Department, will recognise the policy changes and the measures required to give the economy the uplift it so badly needs.  Is our economy to continue to stagnate?  Are our young people to see that there is no hope of employment except temporary holiday work for a few months in New York, San Francisco or wherever it is available? That is a very bleak future for the many fine people coming through our educational system.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that there is no future for the economy but I do not subscribe to that view.  We are going through a difficult period but if we pursue the appropriate policies confidence can be generated by an enlightened Government and we can get out of our economic difficulties and proceed to be a great nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up the previous speaker's comments about the need for cheaper electricity for industry because I come from an area where one of our major industries, Irish Steel, is under threat and one of the major factors affecting the viability of that company is the high cost of energy.  Last week a number of speakers called on the Government to make cheaper electricity available to industry and specifically to Irish Steel.  If we make electricity available on a cheap basis to Irish Steel we must make it available to all industries.  I heard again this evening the call for cheaper electricity for commercial consumers.  If we drop the price of electricity to commercial consumers, because of legislation, we have to increase the price to the domestic consumer. Nobody has faced up to that.  Are the people who are advocating a drop of 20 per cent in the price of electricity to <Col N="1070" /> the commercial consumer prepared to face the protests that will come from the domestic consumer when the price to them is correspondingly increased?  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot demand a drop in price without picking up the tab elsewhere.  There is no way out.</P>
      <P>A figure of £87 million profit was quoted by the Minister as being the profit of BGE this year, despite the fact that a certain amount of natural gas was going to industrial consumers at a very cheap rate.  Is this equitable when another source of energy is very expensive with the result that some industries are coming under threat?  Could we not have the various types of energy under one umbrella and could we not divert some of the profits from BGE to subsidise electricity to commercial users?  I would like some answers on that.  Perhaps the £87 million profit from BGE is being used elsewhere?  Perhaps the Minister will address that problem.</P>
      <P>Since we have a very high price for electricity we must continue to look at the operation of the ESB with a view to making it more efficient and more competitive.  I was at a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure today and we heard a CTT executive saying that a lot of the difficulties facing our products abroad relate to high production costs.  That relates to high energy costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister's speech did not refer in more detail to the operation of the Nuclear Energy Board. I raised the question of the disposal of radioactive waste and the effects on the environment of the dumping of radioactive waste both at sea and on the land, and I have questioned the operation of the NEB.  Some months ago they invited the Oireachtas Members to see how they operate but unfortunately that invitation was extended on a day when Deputies from the provinces were out of Dublin and could not take up that invitation.  I would like the Minister to go into more detail as to how the Nuclear Energy Board are operating.  I know they monitor <Col N="1071" /> seaweed and waters along our coastline but the Windscale problem is becoming an international issue.</P>
    <P>Reports are coming from Europe that the European Parliament are now discussing the threat to our environment from Windscale and there is a promise of action at long last at European level. We should take a more active interest in that operation.  We should look at the effect of nuclear waste discharge not only on seaweed and water along the coastline but on human and animal life.  Zoologists told me recently that we could get strong evidence of the damage done by that operation if we carried out experiments on animals.  Some people might have a conscientious objection to that, but it must be examined and taken into consideration by the Nuclear Energy Board, and I  that the Minister has not attended to that in more detail in his speech this evening.</P>
    <P>Becoming more parochial in relation to the Cork Gas Company and BGE, I ask the Minister to use his influence and that of his Department to reverse the policies of Cork Gas Company in recent years because those policies have been to offload the domestic consumer and make an attractive operation available to commercial enterprise in the Cork region. Cork Gas Company have an obligation to the people of Cork, the domestic consumers who supported them down the years.  The policy is to take meters out of houses and impose quarterly accounts on people, and old people especially cannot cope with quarterly accounts.  The Minister should take that up on behalf of the elderly who are disturbed by the withdrawal of meters from their homes after many years.  I hope also that the roads that are potholed and marked around Cork because of leakages and breakages will be repaired.</P>
    <P>My contribution is short but I would like to hear the Minister's views on the major problem of high electricity charges to which there is no easy solution, and I would like him to deal with the role of the Nuclear Energy Board in more detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution of the Minister for Energy is typical of the present Government under whom we see nothing but cutbacks imposed right across the board consistently since they came into office.  The Minister's speech this evening on the Energy Estimate illustrates the Coalition's ongoing imposition on the people.  Energy is a vital resource and, as I said last year, the Minister has a vital portfolio.  If we cannot get the energy resources of the country right and use our natural resources to the maximum we cannot hope to create an upturn in the economic climate.  The most disappointing aspect of his speech is that the Minister gave only two lines to the west and in particular to the Ballyforan briquette project.  It seems now that the Minister, supposedly a member of a socialist party and a member of a Coalition Government, has put the final nail in the coffin of the Ballyforan project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Taylor-Quinn will have an opportunity to make her contribution on behalf of the Banner County later.  The Ballyforan project was going ahead on a commitment from Fianna Fáil.  We put it in motion and now we see that all that has been done is being terminated and it seems that the activity in Ballyforan and Derryfada will slowly grind to a halt, similar to what prevails in the Tuam sugar factory which has been closed by stealth because of failure of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture to put the necessary investment into it.  This is when unemployment is rife throughout the country and particularly throughout the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in office the workforce in Ballyforan was approximately 150 people.  This has been ground down, and in the past spring it was down to 40 jobs.  In the summer we had a seasonal improvement, bringing it up to 56.  The most important industry at the moment is building a tiphead to bring milled peat from Ballyforan over to Shannonbridge. This Coalition Government <Col N="1073" /> have no commitment to the project or the utilisation of our natural resources and are prepared to condemn the west of Ireland to the unemployment that is now rampant throughout the country.  Proposals were made and targets were set for 180 jobs in the construction of the Ballyforan project and thereafter permanent jobs for 110 people on the bogs and 300 people in the factory.  This would be in the region of 400 permanent jobs in an area that has high unemployment, great natural resources and small fragmented farms.  The small towns in the whole western region would be the major beneficiaries of capital investment needed for this project.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy for this area I say that we are disgusted and disappointed with the attitude of the Government, and the Minister for Energy especially as a member of a socialist party, towards the west.  He has no interest, politically or industrially, in the west.  That has been proved conclusively by the actions of this and previous Coalition Governments. Surely if they cannot utilise our natural resources and create every opportunity and make capital available for the creation of jobs through the utilisation of natural resources, we have no hope of creating any type of economic activity that would take this country out of the mess it is in.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to give £20 or £30 a week more to people in full-time employment than to hand them £100 or £80 in unemployment benefit or assistance as is happening throughout the country?  Is it not time for a new direction and change before it is too late?  The project is 50 per cent of the way.  Mechanism and machinery are purchased and space was rented in Dublin to preserve them and some of that machinery and mechanism have been lying out in the elements in Ballyforan.  Many of the services and much of the capital provided by the local authorities in Galway and Roscommon are going to waste and will be unnecessary if this Government continue with their attitude.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have a critical <Col N="1074" /> look at the situation with a view to creating jobs.  It does not matter where they are created, the gain will be made if the common good and economic good can be achieved.  I appeal on behalf of the many unemployed in the west and in the Ballyforan area that he have another look at the situation before it is too late.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the private bog development grant scheme.  Much tribute for the innovation and efficiency of this scheme must go to our spokesman on Energy, the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds.  This has been an outstanding scheme and I compliment the Minister on supporting and continuing to support it.  It is vital for the economic good and for the provision of natural energy resources and it creates an opportunity for people to provide their own energy resources. This scheme has been implemented and assisted for many years and I hope that the Minister's commitment will be given to it as long as he is in Government holding the Energy portfolio.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he had responsibility for other semi-State bodies.  The ESB are one of the big semi-State organisations under his wing.  Let me say that I admire the professionalism that operates within the ESB but it is important that the ESB recognise that they have and will have a commitment to the west.  If the people of the west happen to live in an area that has not seen the same type of resource and facilities as are in the rest of the country, there is no reason why any semi-State body or Government should discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>The ESB are bringing in American consultants to have a look at their operations. They recommend that there should be regionalisation in order to save money.  There are proposals before the ESB to close down certain sectors and operations in the west.  In my constituency the Tuam engineering headquarters are to be closed down, the Galway district headquarters are to be abolished and the area is to be run from Limerick.  What natural connection or commitment have the people of Limerick or the management of any semi-State organisation to <Col N="1075" /> the west?  Galway is the capital of the west, a famous historic city where many people like to work.  Were it not for this Government's decision to cut back on various regionalisation programmes we had, many civil servants, particularly from the Department of Defence, would be going to the west.  One of the most beautiful and sensible office blocks built on the verge of Galway city is to be closed, 60 people are to be made redundant and the rest of the staff deployed to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Something similar is happening in Athlone, the heart of the midlands, which is to be administered from Dundalk. There must be some sense in centralisation in the heart of the country and regionalisation but there is no sense in moving two headquarters from Athlone and Galway to Dundalk and Limerick. This is denying the people the services, resources and facilities to which they are entitled as citizens.  Staff are being made to pull up their roots and move their families to Limerick, while 60 people are to be put on the dole queue.  It is utterly ridiculous, especially in view of the fact that the major capital investment has been made by the ESB and by the State in providing beautiful office facilities in Galway city, Athlone and Tuam town.  I ask the Minister for Energy on behalf of the people of the west to reconsider the position.  If cutbacks are to be made, surely it should be at head office in Dublin or in the power stations where so many people are highly paid for doing very little.  The people of the west have suffered enough over the years and should not be deprived of services they are prepared to pay for and to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the western package electrification scheme negotiated by Fianna Fáil in 1982.  It was designed to stimulate agricultural growth and development in the west.  There was a commitment from the EC to provide £10 million over ten years but we were able to negotiate so that the money may be spent over a shorter time span if necessary. When we were in office people who <Col N="1076" /> worked on farms, farmers' sons who wanted to marry and build a house, were getting those grants from the Department of Energy.  Many applications have been rejected since this Government came into office and I have had correspondence from the Minister in this regard, as well as several parliamentary replies.  I welcome the decision to put proposals to the EC to review the scheme and I hope there will be an acceptance that in the west the farmers are in a difficult situation because farms are small and fragmented and there is a need for off-farm jobs in order to maintain any existence on the land.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything wrong in the Department of Energy subsidising an ESB connection in a case where a farmer's son has an off-farm job but works on the farm in the evening and at weekends and invests money in the farm in order to upgrade it and make it more productive.  If that man is through his personal efforts helping to stimulate the growth of agriculture surely he must qualify for these subsidies.  I could give many other examples.  Let us consider the case of a young farmer, a married man whose father died and left him half the farm, the other half and all the stock being left to his mother.  The young man works on the farm and operates it in his mother's name, yet because he has 25 acres in his own name and has built a house he is denied the subsidy.  It is a very unfair and discriminatory decision.  I have a number of similar cases.  It is totally unfair that the rules have been changed.  We should be able to spend money from Europe in the best way for the economy and the country.  When we get European money we must decide to spend it our way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>They give us the money and they make the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>They give the guidelines. It is up to us after that to operate that scheme to the best advantage of the farming community and the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make natural gas available to as many centres as possible.  It is time to look towards Limerick and Galway, two outstanding historic <Col N="1077" /> cities where the population is fairly large and where natural gas would make a major contribution.  There are other areas adjacent to the gas pipeline along the route to Dublin.  Natural gas should also be made available to farmers in north County Dublin, Meath and Louth, who are involved in horticultural production. They have been put at a grave disadvantage due to high energy costs.  The fact that the deal hammered out with the Northern Ireland authorities has broken down should not deprive farmers in the north east of the supply of natural gas. Increased production would offset many of our imports and make a major contribution to our balance of payments, putting these farmers on a viable footing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this matter and before he leaves office to make some major contribution in relation to natural gas for which he will be remembered and respected.  When a project is set up, it is financial lunacy to terminate it midstream.  The Ballyforan project and the natural gas works are well under way and the necessary capital resources should be put into both of these schemes to ensure that the natural resources available are utilised to the maximum benefit of the nation and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution on the Estimate for his Department.  The subject of energy has often caused controversy; nevertheless, since the Minister took over this portfolio he has acted honourably and taken care to look after as many interests as possible. Coming from the Clare constituency, I commend him for paying particular attention to the Moneypoint project and we appreciate the valuable contribution it has made to the economy of Clare as well as to the national economy.  This project was vehemently opposed by Fianna Fáil, and the workers in Moneypoint should remember that.  When projects of this nature are proposed they are intended to benefit the community by reliance on raw materials other than gas and oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great record of industrial <Col N="1078" /> relations on the site at Moneypoint and those who work there reside mainly in Clare or Kerry.  The Minister said that the first phase will be commissioned in October and that work is continuing on the other phases.  The ESB should publish their intentions for the future as this is necessary from the point of view of the community in Clare and the workforce. Any uncertainty should be removed and I urge the Minister to ask the ESB to publish a progress report.</P>
    <P>I came into the House because I heard Deputy Treacy mentioning a scheme for western electrification.  He castigated the Department for not catering for farmers in the west, especially part time farmers looking for assistance.  I, too, made representations for small farmers and I regret that they were not successful. However, the Department made the point that there was a certain amount of discretion given to them originally but when officials of the EC examined projects which were being undertaken with the help of subsidies, they found out that everything was not above board.  People were abusing EC money and Deputy Treacy should have mentioned that point.</P>
    <P>The flexibility which some Deputies and indeed leaders in society want in dispensing EC money has to be seen to be believed.  The Minister was forced by the EC to alter the guidelines in regard to assistance for schemes which is regrettable as many young, part time farmers have suffered as a result.  I am glad that the Minister will renegotiate the guidelines but the House should realise that this matter has been thoroughly examined and it was not successful because it was abused.  The EC is the piper and it calls the tune.  In other countries money is allocated properly and spent in the correct areas and I am glad the Minister will fully examine the matter.</P>
    <P>Other speakers made pleas in regard to the provision of gas, especially in the west.  There has been a successful lobby to bring natural gas to Limerick.  There is an industrial estate just outside Limerick which needs an alternative source of energy.  The estate, located at Shannon, <Col N="1079" /> has provided many jobs for the mid-west and people come to it from Clare, North Tipperary, Limerick and North Kerry in order to work.  If natural gas was provided in this area, it would attract major industries to the Shannon free zone.  It would also mean that the housing estates in the area could avail of it which would be a major asset to the residents.  There are certainly enough people living in the area to warrant bringing the gas at least as far as Clare.  Deputy Treacy pleaded Galway's case but the Minister should first consider the Clare claim.  Industrialists in Shannon want to peg their energy costs and the provision of natural gas is the proper way to do this.</P>
    <P>There has also been a discovery of natural gas in the south and we all hope that there will also be a discovery of oil which will be viable.  It is very necessary to have our own supply of oil in view of the volatile situation in the Middle East. With regard to the granting of licences, the scheme produced by the Minister was very complicated and many people do not understand it.  Why are we not in line with our competitors?  The exploration of the Porcupine Bank and other natural shelves around the coast should have the same conditions attached to it as those which apply to the exploration in British waters.  If we gave the same kind of terms, prospecting oil companies would make a greater effort to recover oil.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my congratulations to the Minister for the work he has done in his Department.  I hope that in the near future he will be able to sanction the piping of natural gas to Shannon and the rest of Clare.  I hope that if oil is discovered off our shores it is in the Porcupine Basin.  I appeal to the Minister to help us develop the road from Ennis to Kilrush which is deteriorating because of extra traffic to the Moneypoint station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I found some encouraging matters in the Minister's speech such as the bog development programme and the extension of the natural gas pipeline. However, we always have something to weigh us down and in this case <Col N="1080" /> it is the escalating price of electricity. That is causing a big problem in many industries.  The extension of the natural gas pipeline to Border counties with EC funding was not mentioned by the Minister. I understand it is proposed to extend the pipeline to Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo.  Previously the EC fund was allocated towards tourism, transport and accommodation.  I understand the work on the pipeline will be the responsibility of the Minister and I appeal to him to consult with other Departments to see how this cheap source of energy can best be utilised.  There is no doubt many industries will benefit.</P>
      <P>At county council level, and in the House, I asked the Minister to alert industrialists to the fact that the pipeline was being extended to those counties. Our spokesman on horticulture has explained how that cheap source of energy could be utilised for fruit and vegetable growing.  That industry is labour-intensive and a very adaptable workforce exists in those counties.  In advance of the work on the extension of the pipeline discussion should be held with the co-ops and other interests.  The House will be aware of the many successful mushroom growing projects in Monaghan and Cavan.  There is no doubt that that industry which has increased fourfold in recent years will benefit from a cheap source of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he was satisfied with the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the IDA report of June 1982, said to be a strategy for the development of the agricultural industry here.  In the course of his reply the Minister mentioned one sector that was not performing satisfactorily, vegetable processing, and he said this was due to problems related to economy of scale and changes in the structure of the industry.  Deputy Kirk outlined how we could use natural gas to heat glasshouses.  There is no doubt that not alone could we meet the home demand for tomatoes but that we could export the produce to Northern Ireland.  For years our supply of tomatoes has been <Col N="1081" /> imported and recently I read a report that 6,000 tons of tomatoes were imported by Northern Ireland.  That market could be exploited by growers in Border counties. It is regrettable that vegetable processing is not progressing.  We are all aware that in the beef industry targets for the nineties have already been met.  It is important that all Departments recognise the advantage of an extension of the natural gas pipeline to Border counties to ensure that that source of energy is used to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>The bog development scheme introduced in 1981 has been a success.  At the time of its introduction I explained how thousands of acres of bogland in north Monaghan could be developed and since then five operators have set up business. One of them cut 130 acres of peat, but unfortunately, because of the weather, prospects for this year are not very good. Many entrepreneurs have got involved in bog development.  They borrowed a lot of money and following some good summers are in a reasonably safe position. The Minister told us that approximately 150 schemes have been grant-aided to the tune of £3.3 million.  That is very satisfactory.  We must develop that natural resource.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of bog development cause me concern.  Under the scheme grants are available for drainage and the purchase of equipment but there is little to be had for road improvements.  In the north Monaghan region most of the roads to bogs are privately owned.  Some of them were improved during the emergency when councils cut turf for their institutions but little has been done since.  I have been pressing for improvement of those roads at council level but with little success.  Operators in north Monaghan have received grants towards the purchase of machines but they are having problems with the roads.  I have approached our county development team and suggested that money be provided to maintain those roads.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the mid-western electrification scheme, which has been very successful, and I am <Col N="1082" /> very glad to see the Minister is considering a number of other schemes.  A young man under 20 years of age came to see me.  He has been working for a farmer for the past two or three years and is building a broiler house.  This is a big undertaking for a young chap.  In my area all the farms have such houses costing about £60,000.  Because this young man works for a farmer he will not qualify for the EC subsidy.  This is regrettable because he must work until the unit is in production in a few months' time.  A man wishing to produce mushrooms could qualify for the 30 per cent grant aid if his application is made before he builds the necessary three or four house units, but he has to be a full time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to this Estimate since under the western development scheme this man will not qualify for a grant because he has an income outside farming.  We should encourage enterprising young men who are producing labour-intensive products.  There should be some formula by which these people would qualify for grant aid since they will devote themselves full time to these projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all talk about the amounts of money the Exchquer get from the gas finds and many people think gas should be provided at a cheaper rate.  Some industrialists claim that gas costs the same as oil and many feel they should be encouraged to use gas by buying it at a reduced rate.  We all admit it cannot be sold very cheaply but these people should be given a little encouragement.  The Minister said native fuels increased their share of primary energy requirements from 19.4 per cent to 41 per cent.  That is very satisfactory.  Not alone are bog development and natural gas reducing our dependence on imported fuel, but <Col N="1083" /> they leave us in a more secure position than we would have thought possible some years ago because no longer will we be so affected by oil strikes and the like.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any mention of gas development in the west Cavan and south Fermanagh areas but I hope such development will be proceeded with.  There has been talk of cross-Border economic development but regrettably the Northern Ireland authorities did not proceed with the deal.  Our interconnections between the two electricity boards have been severed but I hope we will be more successful so far as gas is concerned.  It appears there are good deposits of gas in south Fermanagh and perhaps something will come of that. Many of us have raised the matter of afforestation schemes by way of parliamentary questions.  The EC provided substantial sums of money for such schemes and I visited trial areas in Fermanagh and Carlow.  The Northern authorities seem to believe more in the viability of these schemes than we do and the trials they carried out seem to have been very satisfactory.  Their soil seemed ideal to produce a fairly high growth rate. Many of us believe we too could have availed of these moneys.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk mentioned solid fuel and grant aid in this area.  That was a good idea and should be pursued.  A number of Deputies visited Wexford where tomatoes were grown using a solid fuel system. There are great opportunities for future development in this area.  I hope the Minister will take note of the points I mentioned regarding those young people who might wish to apply for grant aid. We must have guidelines.  Unfortunately, the longer the western package lasted, the tighter it got until in the end it was not of much benefit.  I would welcome the Minister's review of this package and hope that he would give all possible consideration to the areas where there is a chance of helping young people.</P>

      <P>This Estimate of the Department of Energy affects people in <Col N="1084" /> every walk of life throughout the length and breadth of the country and is particularly important at the present time.  We must succeed in having a proper mix.  By that I mean that we must utilise to the fullest extent possible all our native, indigenous resources, so reducing the importation of fuels of every type.  We will thus reduce our dependence on fuels from outside Ireland and will create and maintain jobs here.</P>
      <P>We have an abundance of natural resources.  Our water supply was originally used for the generation of electricity and since then our bogs have been well developed.  However, there is room for further expansion of our bogs for electricity generation and also for fuel for home consumption.  Far too little emphasis is being placed on bog development now.</P>
      <P>We are lucky to have a sizeable quantity of natural gas off our coasts which is being developed and utilised to a very great extent.  Our coal resources also should be developed and utilised to their fullest extent.  There is a further source of energy to which the Minister did not refer tonight and that is timber.  That is an amazing source of energy, the development of which should be considered.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has reiterated the Government's objective in regard to energy policy.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Government policy on energy has as its main objectives the promotion of the use of domestic energy sources and the lessening of our dependence on oil by broadening our choice of fuels, together with initiatives to encourage exploration for additional domestic supplies of oil, gas and coal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not emphasise the importance of bog development. I draw the attention of the House to the question of the sale of Bord na Móna products and the importance of their continued output of fuel being purchased by the Electricity Supply Board.  The ESB should be directed to utilise these products.  The Government's commitment is reiterated by the Minister as follows: &ldquo;The Government are committed <Col N="1085" /> to the continued development of this valuable indigenous energy resource for electricity generation and for domestic use&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable concern in the midlands that the Government are not as committed to the usage of the Bord na Móna products as they should be and I am pleased that the Minister has repeated the commitment that he made to the House and the country approximately 12 months ago.  The Government are obliged to continue with this policy.  The five year ESB corporate strategic plan which was going to lead to the closure of a number of generating stations throughout the country was very serious for people in the midlands.  Far too little credit was given to the Minister for the major policy decision which prevented these closures.  He was landed with a very difficult problem in that Moneypoint was being developed to a very high level. The decision was made in the national interest at that time and I am thankful to the Minister for it.  It was of benefit not only to the people of the midlands but to all the people.  Let there be no doubt about it, any country which would use imported fuels when indigenous resources are available would be making a very great mistake.</P>
    <P>There are sufficient native boglands, not just in the midlands but spread throughout the country, to provide energy for electricity for another 20 to 30 years.  It is essential that we continue to utilise these boglands.  Sales of Bord na Móna products last year showed an increase with regard to moss peat and milled peat and the estimated sales of briquettes for 1984 will be bettered in 1985.  I am pleased with the continued expansion of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of ESB generating stations in connection with which capital developments will take place.</P>
    <P>I have visited most of the briquette factories throughout the country.  The Department, in consultation with Bord na Móna, should consider seriously the improvement and updating of a <Col N="1086" /> number of those factories.  I speak in particular of the Derrinlough briquette factory, where the station appears to be quite run down, and also of the Boora briquette factory, which is not being maintained at a proper standard.  I view this matter with great concern.  I am not happy about the conditions under which the staff have to work.  Because of the lack of proper maintenance by Bord na Móna, people have to work in conditions that are not satisfactory.  Due to the run down condition of the factories there is not a sufficient intake of air or light.  It is essential that there be a major overhaul of the factories at Derrinlough and Boora.  Thanks to Government policy, there will be continued development of our national resources.  They have also given a commitment regarding the bogs in the midlands.</P>
    <P>I have been in communication with the Minister and Bord na Móna regarding the engineering factory at Derrinlough.  I might add that, while I got little satisfaction from either party, at least I got a little more from the Minister.  In the Derrinlough machinery factory there is a highly skilled labour force.  This factory was set up a number of years ago and from it have come many highly skilled people who are qualified in light engineering work.  The factory produces machines for bog development.  Many of the patents and ideas were hijacked from Bord na Móna by some entrepreneurs who are now competing against Bord na Móna.  In fact, they are trying to sell back some of the machines to them.</P>
    <P>Much of the third development programme has been completed.  However, it is essential that Bord na Móna have their own machinery factory.  There must be some co-ordination among our semi-State bodies.  The ESB, the Sugar Company and other bodies should be directed to purchase some of the machinery produced by Bord na Móna rather than import plant.  The Minister should give some serious consideration to this point.  In this way he could play a major part in maintaining jobs that are threatened or even in creating new jobs.  I am disappointed that Bord na Móna have <Col N="1087" /> turned a deaf ear to the pleas of public representatives in the midlands and to the pleas of the workers in regard to this important matter.  There is a skill in the Derrinlough factory that is not being used properly.</P>
    <P>The first stage of the Moneypoint project will come on stream in October.  I have been accused by a correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Mr. Maurice Heron, of being parochial when I spoke of the problems that would be caused by the fall-out at Moneypoint.  I make no apologies for being parochial.  It is important that a person should represent his constituency in a proper way.  With regard to Moneypoint, there is the danger regarding air pollution.  The House of Commons in Ottawa carried out a study on the problem of pollution and they published a White Paper which detailed in a most comprehensive way the damage caused by coal-burning stations to the environment.  The cost of providing anti-pollutants at Moneypoint would be sizeable. The Managing Director of the ESB quoted a figure of £400 million but I have no idea what it would cost to make it safer.  However, as a person who hopes to live in this country for the rest of his life, I hope the ESB will take every possible safeguard to prevent damage to the environment.  I hope they will do everything possible to prevent damage by fall-out from Moneypoint to the beautiful parts of Clare and the midlands.  This is of immense importance.  Enough is being done to our rivers, streams and so on by pollution of one kind or another.  Too little too late is always the cry.  Look at the way our lakes have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>Before Moneypoint comes on stream I demand that every possible effort be made to prevent pollution.  If we do not prevent it in three years time the Burren, the lands of Cashel, the midlands, Offaly, Laois, the Golden Vale and right up to the Slieve Bloom mountains will be seriously damaged.  I am a backbench Deputy and cannot overemphasise how concerned I am about this matter.  There are 300 megawatts coming on stream and that represents a vast amount of coal <Col N="1088" /> being burned.  We all know the amount of fallout from one small chimney, but if that is multiplied by the fallout that will result from the amount of coal which it will be necessary to burn to produce 300 megawatts one realises the amount of damage that could be done.  The matter is not entirely in the hands of the Minister. The Government must become actively involved in immediate consultations. They should ensure the ESB take all necessary action.  I urgently request them to ensure that the environment of the midlands is not damaged.  Look at what happened in Canada.</P>
    <P>Approximately 78,000 acres of land are under afforestation.  The total acreage owned by the Department is now 966,000.  To save the Chair asking what relevance this has to the debate, I would point out that it is one of the greatest sources of energy which we have on tap. Bord na Móna should be given responsibility for the development of the forests. Thousands of acres of land are lying idle and these could be planted.  There is tremendous potential in the timber industry. In ten or 15 years after trees are planted they are ready for thinning and 20 years later they are ready for cutting and selling. It is an ongoing process, decade after decade, generation after generation.  At present we are importing vast amounts of timber, but we should utilise our natural resource to prevent these imports.</P>
    <P>When Bord na Móna was set up many people were critical of it as they were of the ESB.  People laughed at the ESB. They said Bord na Móna would not get their policies off the ground.  However, people came from as far away as Russia, Denmark and Sweden to look at Bord na Móna.  If they were given responsibility for the development of the forests I am sure they would be very successful.  There is great job potential in this area and we could save on our timber importation. We have people with the necessary vision and enterprise.  The National Development Corporation might look at this area. It is a vast untapped resource and the sooner someone looks at the development of it the better. <Col N="1089" /> In his speech the Minister referred to £4 million and said it was for the extension of peat fired stations at Lanesboro and Shannonbridge and for the new gas-fired combustion turbines at North Wall in Dublin.  The ESB station at Ferbane is operating far below its potential.  If it was upgraded a number of turbines which are not presently utilised could be put into production.</P>
    <P>The first inter-party Government developed bog roads.  There are many roadways leading into our bogs.  However, people are unable to get the turf out of the bogs because of the state of the roads.  I ask the Minister and the Minister for Labour to see how they could develop these bog roads.  A sizeable number of jobs could be created if these roads were developed.  People would be able to bring light machinery into the bogs.  I ask the Minister to look at this as the development of these roads would be of great social and commercial benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very difficult but most interesting task and I wish him continued success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Deputies who have contributed to the debate on the Estimates.  All the contributions were brief and to the point and were offered in a constructive manner.  I will reflect on the various points made and try to take them on board wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the Limerick gas project.  I should like to clarify the situation in that regard.  The Deputy referred to an agreement having been completed in Limerick.  An outline of an agreement had been looked at by BGE, Limerick Corporation and a private sector company.  This would have involved a price for gas and loan terms from BGE which I would have found impossible to approve, given the amount of public funds that would have been required for the project.  What is important about the Limerick gas contract now is that the agreement should be finalised within a matter of weeks, so that we can then go ahead with building the pipeline, expanding the grid and bringing natural <Col N="1090" /> gas to Limerick city, something that has been promised for many years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds suggested that no money should have been paid by BGE in respect of the acquisition by the board of the shares of the Cork Gas Company. The bid offered by the board was the average for the previous 12 months. From a commercial point of view, the important point was to ensure that the bid was sufficient to make it attractive because otherwise it might have been rejected and that would have led to the liquidation of the company.  It was in the interest of everyone concerned that liquidation be avoided so that BGE, the banks and the Department of Energy could monitor and control the development of the new Cork Gas Company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds asked why the debt was allowed run to the £4 million level. The alternative was to cut off the supply of gas to Cork city and I do not think anyone would have countenanced such a move.  While negotiations were in progress the obvious line to take was to allow the debt increase but what is important, as reaction on the ground would indicate, is that the gas supply to Cork city should not be interfered with in any way.</P>
    <P>Regarding further supply developments, some people have complained about delays.  Admittedly, progress has not been as fast as one might have wished but we are talking of a highly complex area especially when negotiations are involved and this would be the case whether we were dealing with the public or the private sector.  It is very important that at the end of the day we reach agreements in relation to the distribution of natural gas that would be of benefit to local communities and to the economy generally.  It is worthy of note that in many cases the utilities in question have been very run down.  I do not think anyone would say that the selling of the old gas was an attractive project.  It was an unexciting venture.  What is involved now is the question of rebuilding the entire gas industry.  That is an expensive procedure but it will be worth-while spending some months in order to have it right rather than to rush into agreements <Col N="1091" /> in the short term which one might regret later.</P>
    <P>I am confident that agreements will be reached in the Limerick situation and likewise in Waterford and Clonmel. Efforts will be made in the coming months to devise a work programme so that we may expand the national gas grid and I think there is unanimous agreement in the House that there should be such expansion so that we may maximise the benefit of the whole project in terms of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk and others referred to the extension of the gas pipeline to Northern Ireland.  They referred to the failure on the part of the British to see the agreement through.  At all times we dealt in good faith with our Northern counterparts but regrettably our efforts came to naught.  I am considering all possibilities that would enable to be put together a viable project northwards, whether within or outside the State.  What is important in this respect, too, is that we have a project which on a stand alone basis would meet certain economic criteria which we set at any given time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred also to onshore and off-shore oil exploration.  I must reiterate my earlier sentiments that the position relating to the third licensing round has been good and that we must take into account many adverse factors that are affecting this development. Increasingly less money is available for exploration.  In the US particularly the main thrust of oil company development seems to be to move by acquisition rather than by further exploration.  Given all the circumstances, including a softening of oil prices, we have had a good response and what is important is that there will be exploration in the next few years on the lines of the exploration of the past years.</P>
    <P>It is not correct, as Deputy Reynolds insinuated, in relation to the report on electricity prices that no action has followed the Jacobson report.  We have carried out the recommendation of the report which suggested that we look for the response of the ESB to the various suggestions in the report.  We await the <Col N="1092" /> response of the ESB in relation to the implementation of those recommendations. I have no doubt but that efficiency measures and price improvements will be among the steps to be implemented in the aftermath of the report.  That report was well worth commissioning.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Tara-Bula negotiations are continuing.  I do not wish to elaborate further in that regard.  As Deputy Reynolds has admitted, this is a very complex issue.  He understands that from his experience in the Department. However, I am confident that we can bring the deal to a conclusion that will be in the best interest of mining in this country and that we will be able to provide further development and expansion and for the job creation that will follow.</P>
    <P>Deputies Reynolds, Kirk and Leonard talked about the utilisation of cut-away bogs.  There has been research into the question of whether these areas would be more suitable for grass, for dry stock or for the growing of vegetables.  From the research carried out to date, it has been established that there is certain potential for these cut-away bogs.  There is also forestry potential and amenity potential in this area.  We will be bringing forward more concrete proposals when the research is more advanced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds suggested that we build a smelter.  Having regard to the proposed location in that respect I could go along with the project but discussions on such a proposal have not been taking place in recent years, so one might say that it is very much on the back burner.</P>
    <P>The question of an interconnector is something we always had in mind.  It is regretted that we have not been in a position to replace the interconnector in the electricity grid between North and South.  Most people are aware of the reasons that has not been reactivated.</P>
    <P>We are at present considering legislation on the INPC in relation to their statutory establishment and also in relation to their role in offshore exploration. Deputy Reynolds seems to be somewhat of a doubting Thomas in relation to the Whiddy Island project.  I can assure him that the project is going ahead, that quite <Col N="1093" /> a lot of detailed work has been carried out.  Planning permission has been applied for.  I am sure that will be of enormous benefit not just to the nation but to the people of the Bantry area in particular, an area which has been quite depressed since the unfortunate disaster of 1979.</P>
    <P>Most of us are in total agreement in relation to the western aid electricity scheme metnioned by Deputy Kitt. There is no doubt that there have been some hitches.  From my recent contact with the Commission I shall leave no stone unturned in endeavouring to maximise benefit for the farming community in relation to the utilisation of the provisions of the scheme.  I also take note of Deputy Kitt's and Deputy N. Treacy's comments in relation to it.  We shall try to maximise benefit.  If we get the co-operation of the Commission we should have little difficulty in so doing.  It is a scheme which has been an enormous success, the application rate still being very high.  We shall pursue that with vigour.  One hitch has been the question of the second house on the farm, the second family home. We have made a very strong case to the Commission to ascertain whether they would be prepared to allow the occupant of the second house also to qualify.  In most cases it is a question of a member of the family remaining on the family farm, working on the farm as well.</P>
    <P>I can to some extent understand the regrets expressed by Deputies in Galway constituencies in relation to the Ballyforan project.  I can assure them that if Bord na Móna come back to my Department, having carried out their assessment and review of the scheme &mdash; we can also safely say it is a matter for the board if they feel they have a viable project, a stand-alone project in terms of timing and marketing &mdash; then the Government will look at it in that light. I can assure both Deputies that such decisions are not lightly taken and it is not any lack of commitment by myself or the Government of which I am a member to the west or indeed to any place outside the Dublin area.  But projects have to be assessed at any given time in relation to <Col N="1094" /> many factors.  At the time of the deferral of the Ballyforan project Bord na Móna, in their judgment, felt that marketing and many other conditions were not suitable.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ESB and the Millar Barry report, obviously rationalisation is a matter for the board of management of the ESB.  I shall be happy to consider the views of the board in relation to the proposed restructuring.  It is quite obvious that decisions will have to be faced up to in relation to the whole question of regional organisation.  This will have to be done in a manner which is in the national interest and that of the regions as well as the whole interest of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Kitt's support for alternative energy projects.  In the long term it is in this country's interest to continue both the research and practical development of alternative energy sources because, even if it is only on a small scale, it will be of economic benefit to have alternative energy sources evaluated and ready as projects for the future. On the use of solid fuel my Department have sponsored the design of a multi solid fuel stove.  The NBST and the IIRS are currently endeavouring to commercialise this.  This is of major significance and, if we get the level of commercial interest hoped for, it will constitute a breakthrough in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk mentioned the whole question of the gas grid for Drogheda, Ardee and Dundalk.  In particular he requested an extension &mdash; and I can understand his concern in this respect &mdash; of the pipeline to the Border.  He expressed the belief that it would constitute an essential part of the infrastructure and be a cost cutter for industry.  In relation to Deputy Reynolds's comments, the whole question has to do with viability, in relation to having a project, and we have reapplied to the EC in terms of a stand-alone project.  A favourable response would allow us look at the whole project in a different light.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Kirk's concern in regard to the horticultural industry, particuarly in the Leinster and Border <Col N="1095" /> counties.  I should be happy to see a project for a supply of gas to this and other industries tested for viability.  It would be very difficult at this juncture to give any undertaking until all possibilities are explored and examined in detail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned the figure of £87 million in relation to Bord Gáis.  This is not a profit, it is a surplus, the extent of which is assessed.  The transfer of the amount is settled by myself with the Minister for Finance and laid down for Bord Gáis Éireann.  Deputy Allen also mentioned the high price of electricity, as did many other Deputies.  The best response I can give is to refer people to the actual report on electricity prices and the specific recommendations contained in chapter 16 of that report.  Only after a thorough examination of the recommendations and their implementation shall we start making progress on what we started last year when I sanctioned the reduction of electricity costs by 7 per cent for heavy users and 2 per cent for normal commercial users.  Some people might contend that that reduction was quite small but I believe it was a step in the right direction.  It does not happen too often and is something we shall continue given the right circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also voiced concern that I had little to say in relation to the Nuclear Energy Board.  I might remind Deputy Allen that during my time as Minister for the Environment I initiated meetings with my counterpart, the Minister for the Environment, in Britain, when we had discussions in relation to nuclear radioactive discharge in the Irish Sea.  Those meetings proved to be very beneficial. We initiated a joint inter-Government committee who meet on a regular basis and keep both sides abreast of what is happening in relation to nuclear discharge and, of course, in limiting the discharge from the Sellafield plant.  Significant progress has been made and the regular contact we have with the UK authorities is of benefit to us and can go a long way in allaying fears we have here in relation to discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Deputy Carey spoke about and was obviously very supportive of the Moneypoint project, perhaps influenced by regional location.  Certainly I can take on board what he said.  We do get progress reports from the ESB in relation to the project.  Deputy Carey expressed concern that natural gas would be supplied to Shannon.  Shannon could be looked at as a prospect for natural gas as soon as the Limerick project is up and running but it would have to be evaluated in terms of demand in the Shannon area.  Deputy Carey may have been trying to score some sort of a hat trick when he asked me to get the roads from Kilrush to Moneypoint repaired.  I suppose in Irish politics nothing is impossible, so we will try to get that done for him as well before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leonard, who takes a very active interest in the affairs of the Department at all times during the year, mentioned his concern in relation to Border county projects in County Monaghan.  As I said to Deputy Kitt in relation to the viability of the Northern project, it is based on the full assessment of the Northern project and the amount of EC support available.  It is only then that we will be able to have a look at the expansion of the grid northwards. Obviously the Border counties will be looked at in terms of its beneficial use in those areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard mentioned the private bog development scheme.  That has been one of the success stories over the last number of years and I intend to ensure its continuance to maximise the benefit throughout the country.  Many western areas have not had the full benefit of the grants available for the exploitation of turf.  I would like Deputies to advertise these schemes in any areas where contractors are available or co-ops can be established to exploit and develop undeveloped peat areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maintenance of roads was mentioned. Everybody is aware of the pressure <Col N="1097" /> on the Road Fund allocation in relation to county roads.  I will ask my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to consider that in the coming allocation for road expenditure because the maintenance of roads has fallen back so much that it will be very expensive to carry out repairs in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard suggested that there should be some relaxation of the qualifying conditions for the western grant scheme.  We hope we will receive a favourable response from the Commission in relation to our submission.</P>
    <P>In relation to short rotation forestry, as in Northern Ireland, we are launching a new test project in Leitrim.  One which was done by Bord na Móna in the EC proved rather poor but certain lessons were learned and I hope that the forthcoming project in Leitrim will be more successful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright, representing the views of the midlands, asked for even greater bog development.  I have already covered those points.  In relation to energy policy the utilisation of peat resources by the ESB has been settled and a balance in fuel mix in the best interests of the economy has been arrived at and it will get us through the next number of years.  The question of the refurbishing of the briquette factories is obviously a matter for the board and management.  The Deputy obviously knows the circumstances locally and the quality of the workmanship and the valuable experience built up in the locality.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and for the interest they have shown on the Estimate for my Department.  I assure Deputies that all their comments will be dealt with in the coming months and I hope we will see an exciting 12 months in my Department which will make a major contribution to the economy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Treacy has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of serious problems being experienced by farmers in County Galway as a result of TB eradication.  Deputy Treacy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  We have been fighting this case on behalf of the farmers for a long time.  The Department do not seem to recognise the difficulties being encountered by the farmers and the grave risk to their livelihoods that TB eradication is having.  There are six parts of the county that are very badly affected. One is the Portumna &mdash; Ballygrissane area which consists of the district electoral divisions Nos. 250, 251 and 254. About 7½ per cent of all the herds in this area are affected with TB reactors.  A total of 26 herd owners in this area north of Portumna have been the victims of this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area badly affected is an area south west of Ballinasloe in the Clontuskert/Kiltormer/Cappataggle area within the district electoral divisions Nos. 233, 234, 236, 237 and 238.  About 14 per cent of all the herds in this area are reactors.  The third area is an area north east of Ballinasloe which is the Ahascragh / Kilconnel / Ballinamore Bridge/Newbridge areas, district electoral divisions areas Nos. 215, 217, 218, 219, 220, 222 and 232.  About 7 per cent of all the herds in this area are affected. The fourth area is an area north of Tuam, the Milltown/Dunmore/Kiltevna area in the district electoral divisions areas Nos. 190, 194 and 195.  The fifth is an area south west of Loughrea, the Aille/Kilcreest/Peterswell and Gort areas, district electoral divisions areas Nos. 280, 299, 300, 301, 303 and 320. <Col N="1099" /> Twelve per cent of all the herds in those areas have been affected.  The sixth area is the district electoral divisions of Oughterard and Letterfore in the Connemara area of County Galway where the incidence is 15 per cent.  Other areas like Bullaun and Killimordaly are also affected.  The national average of affected herds is in the ratio of one to 400 approximately and in Galway it is one to ten.  This is very serious and disastrous for Galway farmers.  Some of them are in such a bad financial state that they may never recover and may have to opt out of farming and either dispose of their lands or let their lands.  It is now proved conclusively that 50 per cent of all the farmers who now find themselves in serious financial difficulty had diseased herds at some stage of their careers. Surely this is proof positive of an urgent need for proper and adequate compensation for farmers finding themselves the innocent victims of this dreadful disease.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the opportunity of raising this matter, I want to express my disappointment that the Minister for Agriculture is not here.  The man charged with responsibility for administering the affairs of the Department who at Cabinet level could have made, should have made and must make a case to ensure that the funds are made available to provide adequate compensation for the farmers who have to take all the risks in their careers and their livelihood in order to survive, that man is not here.  This Government and this Minister are not prepared to listen.  I am disappointed to learn also that the Minister of State with responsibility for western development, particularly a man representing the Galway East constituency, has not been sent here tonight to deputise for the Minister for Agriculture.  He should be in touch with this situation.  He has been in communication with the farmers but he has turned a deaf ear to them.  I appreciate the attendance here of the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty.  It is not his area of responsibility, but I appreciate his coming here to listen and I hope he will take the message back <Col N="1100" /> to the Minister, to the Department of Agriculture and to his Minister of State colleague, and that between now and the return of this Dáil in the next session they will come back with a proper package for farmers throughout the country who have been victims of this eradication scheme through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some recommendations to the Minister of State to take to the Department and to his senior Minister.  (1) It is vitally important that we have a uniform tuberculin used in injecting all animals for TB testing.  (2) There must be uniform reading and interpretation of the results and effects that these uniform tuberculins will have on our bovine animals.  (3) The removal of all reactors to the factories must be under departmental supervision and must be immediate.  This would entail proper departmental liaison with the veterinary surgeons and proper arrangements with the meat factories through the Department for acceptance of reactors on a regular basis.  (4) The Department must insist on factories paying the maximum price for reactors, especially for the uncontaminated parts of the reactor carcases.  Farmers are frequently paid minimal prices for reactor carcases, and much of these carcases goes for human consumption and the only effect on this consumption is the reactor stamp which the carcase bears.  Farmers are often ripped off in this way and it is past time that the Department had a constant adjudication and monitoring of this situation. The factories are not paying the proper price for contaminated or reactor carcases. (5) The Department must organise the collection of reactors and ensure that there are special days weekly for the acceptance of these reactors by the factories, and all the factories should be in a position to accept them.  At the moment some factories will take reactors for a certain period and other factories may not take them at all or may take them for a short period.  It is vital that there be a day in each factory when the Department will supervise the collection of reactors, get them into the factories, supervise the <Col N="1101" /> killing of the animals and supervise the adjudication and grading of these carcases to ensure that the maximum prices are paid to the farmers.  (6) All places of killing, be they factories or slaughter houses, must be monitored consistently by the Department.  I do not think that the conditions operating and prevailing in some of these slaughter houses and factories are up to the full standard and in some centres negligence may lead to the constant, ongoing spread of this disease. (7) The Department must tighten their controls on the transport and disposal of offal.  We often see offal transported through the country in open lorries.  This is bound to have a certain effect in contaminating and polluting the air.  Also offal is often spread on land adjacent to streams and rivers.  This must give further cause of spread of disease and contamination of the lands, rivers and streams, not to mention its effect on fish and wildlife.  It seems that in this area there is no departmental control.</P>
    <P>It is high time that the Department of Agriculture computerised their records to ensure efficient administration of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes, particularly TB.  The district veterinary officers should be in a position to press a button, read a farmer's herd, its track record and the various problems it has had over the years and, based on that information, necessary action should be taken to eradicate the disease, remove the reactor animals and ensure that proper payments are made based on prior payments and current prices of livestock in the livestock marts and factories.</P>
    <P>The Department should make grants available for proper boundary fencing, particularly in hilly and lowland bog areas where major difficulties are encountered by farmers trying to maintain boundary fencing.  The Department have given very simplistic reasons for the high incidence of disease in the county.  They blame fragmented holdings.  It is natural that we have fragmented holdings where the farms are so small, the topography of the soil so varied and the quality of the land so indifferent.  The Department blame bad boundary fencing, too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> The Department also blame the high density of mixed livestock farming throughout the county for the high incidence of disease. In a county where the farms are small, where the quality of the land is so indifferent and the dependence of many people on agriculture is high, it is obvious that farmers must have a mixed farming set-up, particularly a mixed livestock farming set-up.  Consequently, we see many farmers involved in both dairying and raising stores.  It is inevitable that, with two or maybe three different patterns of farming, farmers are at a greater risk.  The Department also blame common access roads.  Anybody who knows the midlands and other parts of the country but particularly the west where the land is so indifferent and the farms are so small, knows that common access roads are inevitable.  The west is not privileged to have the big, open farms of Kildare or of the eastern or southern parts of the country, consequently farmers there use the same access roads. The Department have given all these reasons, but have failed to ensure that where a local farmer has a reactor herd the adjoining farmers will have an immediate test.  I know of and can quote cases where farmers have requested tests and have not got those tests.  One farmer in the county had consistent TB and his adjoining neighbour asked for a herd test. The Department refused that test.  The man held a private test on six animals out of about 50 and one of his animals went down.  Immediately the Department conceded a herd test which revealed ten reactors and eight of these were eight of his 13 dairy cows.  This man is going to suffer a major loss this year.  Last year he supplied 8,500 gallons of milk; this year that could be reduced to about 2,500 gallons. How can that man survive and make a living and look after his wife and family in that situation?  I know of other farmers who have been paid as little as £28 and £30 for weanlings and young stock.</P>
    <P>A farmer may have a suckler herd on which he is totally dependent for his livelihood.  If some of those animals go down as reactors, that farmer has no hope <Col N="1103" /> of survival unless there is adequate compensation from the Department.  Many farmers in Galway are in dairying and the county has a very good record.  In the case of a farmer with a medium or small herd it would take two to three years to breed or purchase replacements.  A farmer may not be in a position to buy replacements since he may not be able to meet repayment commitments.  His credit may not be good enough to borrow more money and the grants are inadequate.</P>
    <P>Some farmers may lose their total herds.  A man in that position might have to wait 60 days or more before he can buy back any animals.  If most of his herd went down he would definitely be tied to that situation.  If he has a varied farm he will not be able to buy sheep because the land will not be suitable and he must wait to buy cattle.  The grants are not good enough and he loses three to six months grazing and becomes financially embarrassed. He may never recover.  I know of one farmer in the Portumna area whom I would regard as one of the best farmers in the country.  He has a medium-sized farm and his loss in 1984 as a result of reactors was £12,000.</P>
    <P>The Department have failed to recognise the contribution by the badger to the spread of TB.  They will not acknowledge that the badger is playing a major role and has the same traits and qualities as a bovine animal.  It is vital that the Department carry out proper research and pinpoint the areas where badgers are doing damage so that they can be eradicated quickly by giving farmers the necessary licences.  There is too much red tape involved in getting a licence and the Department should be in a position to have the badgers extinguished urgently in the interests of TB eradication.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and to the Department to ensure that adequate compensation is made available now and that proper social welfare payments are made to farmers who are the victims of this disease over the period of recovery from the depopulation of their herds and the removal of reactors.  A farmer must <Col N="1104" /> look after his wife and family and remain a viable unit within the economy.  He is entitled to the same type of benefits and assistance as people in other walks of life. It is vitally important that the Minister of State should go to the Minister for Agriculture and the Department and arrange if necessary for the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate in the autumn to ensure that farmers in County Galway and throughout the county receive adequate compensation for all reactors and diseased animals which have to be disposed of until the country is disease free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there is a serious outbreak of bovine TB in the south eastern part of County Galway and I can assure the House that I and my officials are seriously concerned about the problem.</P>
      <P>On a point of correction, I have responsibility for disease eradication, not the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton. The Minister for Agriculture has important engagements and I am standing in for him.</P>
      <P>The areas most seriously affected comprise three district electoral divisions north of Portumna and four district electoral divisions south of Ballinasloe.  I have to emphasise that the seriousness of the problem is confined to these particular areas, not the county as a whole.</P>
      <P>To keep this particular problem in perspective I would have to say a few words about the TB and brucellosis eradication scheme as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very little progress for several years in reducing the level of TB. This situation clearly pointed to the need for a fresh approach if we were ever to be rid of this disease.  It was because of this that very substantial funds have been set aside for disease eradication during the period 1985-87, £85 million to be exact.  This funding was conditional on the introduction of basic changes in the old eradication scheme.  As a result of the negotiations earlier this year with the Veterinary Union the new regime is now in operation.  This new regime is giving <Col N="1105" /> us more prompt and more rapid testing and the disease is being tackled systematically on an area or block basis.  Under the new system, swift and effective action can be taken by the district veterinary offices, in co-operation with veterinary practitioners and farmers, to ensure that testing deadlines are met.</P>
    <P>Increases in the reactor grants for lighter cattle as well as improvements in the terms of the depopulation fund have also been introduced, as well as a scheme for stock replacement for farmers who have to depopulate their herds due to heavy disease infestation.  These improved compensation arrangements provide a considerable degree of additional relief to herdowners whose herds become infected.</P>
    <P>The increased financial allocation and the renewed drive against TB are evidence of the Government's determination to rid the national herd of the disease.  Our new approach can provide the basis for significant progress and I believe that the full round of testing now going ahead will show good results.</P>
    <P>As regards Galway the overall incidence in the county is approximately 3 per cent of herds which reflects the national average.  In the problem areas already mentioned, where there is a higher than average incidence, intensive testing has already been carried out this year and will continue to be carried out during the coming months.  I am satisfied that this campaign of intensive testing will bring the TB levels in the problem areas under control.</P>
    <P>Serious concern has been expressed by herdowners that badgers have been a cause of TB breakdowns of herds in these problem areas.  An investigation into this possibility has already been undertaken by my Department.  This investigation has taken the form of the capture and humane killing of badgers under the supervision of the local district veterinary office staff and the carrying out of subsequent <i>post mortems</i> and laboratory tests. This investigation is still in progress and my officials would expect to be in a position to evaluate the results within the next few months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> I am confident that the planned intensive testing programme which has already commenced and which will continue during the coming months in these problem areas under the supervision of the district veterinary office will achieve the control and eventual eradication of TB from the affected herds.  This sort of intensive testing programme has been used successfully in other areas where exceptional levels of TB infection were encountered.</P>
    <P>If the investigation into the badger problem should show beyond doubt that badgers are a factor either in spreading TB or preventing its eradication in the area, then we will consider how best to set about reducing the badger population to more manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>I would urge herdowners in these areas to give their full co-operation to the DVO staff.  The completion of an intensive testing programme as rapidly as possible requires their co-operation and I am confident that the farmers themselves will help in any way they can.  Farmers must co-operate with the Department.  I agree with Deputy Treacy's remarks regarding the removal of reactors.  I suggested recently that farmers, in conjunction with the marts, should carry out the collection of diseased animals which could be done in a proper, supervised manner.  I am looking at a number of options at present which would help but there are problems which will take a little while to solve.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned bad prices and we are looking at the possibility of conducting a slaughter sale for diseased animals on a trial basis.  Obviously such animals would have to end up in a meat factory as they could not be brought back to farms.  Most slaughtering is done under supervised conditions.  Any other sort of slaughtering would be surreptitious and could not be condoned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy also mentioned the problem in regard to offal.  There is no mystery in the spread of disease.  It is spread by birds picking up offal and carrying it to other farms.  I have suggested that there should be a primary processing of offal at our major meat plants.  The <Col N="1107" /> Deputy also mentioned a computer service and we are at present tendering for a computer which we hope to have in operation in about six months.</P>
    <P>Many problems with regard to common access roads can be overcome by farmers getting together and admitting that they have a problem in regard to disease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>If one farmer admits that he has a problem we will take cognisance of the point made by the Deputy in regard to having neighbouring herds tested.  For instance, perhaps the farmer who has a diseased herd could keep his animals off the road until he gets the all clear.  When an infected herd is identified all contiguous herds will be tested as soon as possible but I must reiterate that until we get the full co-operation of the farming community, the problem will not be solved.  We have improved all levels of grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, in addition to the pension referred to in the question, the taxpayer is in receipt of a social welfare pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the other pension by means of the restricted tax free allowances. A certificate of tax free allowances for the current year, incorporating all the allowances and reliefs to which the taxpayer is entitled, by reference to his most recent return of income, was issued to him on 4 March 1985.</P>

    <P>Because of greater demands on the fund and the more stringent application of this criterion by the Commission of the European Communities it has been necessary, following a detailed assessment of the applications by the National Rehabilitation Board, to reduce claims for all health boards in respect of 1984 and 1985.  No decisions have, however, yet been taken by the Commission on the final amounts to be paid for these years. Applications for 1986 have not yet been formulated.

Following these inquiries a deciding officer in a revised decision assessed him with effect from 11 September 1984 with means of £38.45 weekly derived from beneficial occupation of his father's holding.  He is accordingly entitled to £33.80 weekly the appropriate rate £72.25 less means £38.45.  All arrears due were paid to him last week and weekly payments will continue as they become due.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 24 January 1985 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She then submitted a final certificate indicating that she was fit to resume work on 30 January 1985.  She submitted a further claim for disability benefit from 6 February 1985 with the same incapacity and payment was also disallowed on this claim.  A notice of appeal was received on 13 June 1985 and arrangements are being made to have her examined by a different medical referee at an early date. Her entitlement to further payment of disability benefit will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report following this examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.  It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to unemployment assistance recipients whose means derived from land were notionally assessed by reference to the poor law valuation system until this notional method of assessment had to be discontinued following a High Court decision in July 1982 that sections of the Valuation Acts were unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Following the High Court ruling, arrangements were made to have the means of all notionally assessed smallholders assessed on a factual basis.  The factual assessment of smallholders was commenced in May 1983 and accordingly statistics in relation to the numbers whose unemployment assistance payments were reduced or ceased following factual assessment are only available from that date.  The position at the end of May 1985 is that following review, payment of unemployment assistance had been reduced in 4,324 cases and had ceased in 3,074 cases.  Payment was increased in 3,116 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the expenditure effects of the change-over to factual assessment, the position is that expenditure budgeted for unemployment assistance for smallholders this year at £37.84 million is considerably higher than the £34.34 million spent in 1982, the last complete year in which payment was made on the notional basis of assessment.  The increased expenditure combined with the <Col N="963" /> lower number in receipt of payment means that the average payment of recipients has increased considerably.</P>
    <P>A desirable effect of the system of factual assessment of means is that it ensures that the available funds are concentrated on those most in need.  In addition the change-over to factual assessment ensures that all smallholders receiving unemployment assistance are now entitled to annual budget increases which they did not receive while notionally assessed.</P>

      <P>A person who has exhausted entitlement to unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until she has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Counted for this purpose are any weeks of employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn.</P>
      <P>The person concerned exhaused her entitlement to 312 days unemployment benefit on 3 December 1984.  She was employed intermittently during the period of her claim to benefit and inquiries were made to establish if the employment which took place after 156 days of benefit had been drawn was insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment.  Following the completion of these inquiries it has been established that her employment was not insurable at the appropriate contribution rate for the purpose of requalifying for unemployment benefit.  She appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her case determined by an appeals officer.  Her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The person mentioned received approval under the farm modernisation scheme on 23 August 1982 for the construction of a silage slab, effluent tank, fence and gate. The procedure is that the grant becomes payable on satisfactory completion of all of the items on the approval document and it is not, therefore, possible to pay a partial grant on completion of some of the items.  In any event there could be no question of paying a grant for a silage slab without appropriate provision being made for the effluent.  As the applicant will have completed the maximum period of six years in the other high category on 23 July 1985 the work must be completed to specification by that date in order to qualify for the rate of grant appropriate to the other high category.</P>

Apart from consultant's fees which will arise in the architectural planning process, the provision of funds for the project will not be in question until the tender stage has been reached.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to appoint shortly the first <Col N="977" /> allocation of teachers to cater for the educational needs of the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children for the 1985-86 school year.  These teachers, who will be fully qualified national teachers, will be given a short induction period on placement.  There will be ongoing monitoring during the first year of operation and the more long term training needs will be assessed in the light of the experience gained.  No formal training scheme is currently in progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the person in question sat for the leaving certificate examination in 1979 and that accordingly the higher education grants scheme applicable to him is the scheme for 1979.</P>
      <P>It is also understood that the person wrote to Dublin Corporation recently seeking a grant but that the corporation did not establish whether the academic and means test requirements of the 1979 scheme would be complied with in his case in view of the fact that the 1979 scheme contains a provision that a candidate who qualifies for a grant may defer the grant for a period exceeding two years only in exceptional circumstances.  The corporation did not consider the applicant's circumstances to be exceptional and were not prepared to defer grant for the period 1979-85.  If the person considers that he could qualify for a grant under the terms of the higher education grants scheme 1979 and wishes to appeal, on grounds of exceptional circumstances against the corporation's decision not to defer grant in this case, it is open to him to do so.</P>
