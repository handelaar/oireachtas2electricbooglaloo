    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Adjournment last Friday I was referring to the desirability of Fianna Fáil participating in this debate, a debate that surely is above party political matters.  It is very gratifying to see some members of Fianna Fáil here today, and I do not say that in a cynical way.  They should contribute to this debate and I am pleased that they are going to do so.  For some time I wrestled with my conscience as to whether I should come in and talk on this very tender subject, a subject that will evoke strong feeling on either side, but I feel I owe it to myself and my constituents to come in here and let them know where I stand on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the political world have a greater insight into the problems of marriage breakdown than many people in the world outside have because we are privy to many secrets in our clinics.  In that way we have some degree of insight into the unhappiness in many marriages today. The fact that there is that unhappiness is a source of great regret.  For hundreds of years the family has been the basic fabric of society not only in Ireland but all over the world.  The whole world has rapidly changed today and we have come a long <Col N="1468" /> way from the 1937 very laudable vision of Eamon de Valera of comely maidens. That is a long time behind us.  They were halcyon days for the family when although people had very little there was family security and greater happiness in the family unit.</P>
    <P>We must realise that the greatest social problem here outside of unemployment is the escalating breakdown of marriages. Several factors are inherent in that sad state of affairs.  The world of affluence in which we all participate has been the real reason.  There are other contributory factors such as gambling and drinking, and excesses in regard to them, which lead to terrible stress on families. Invariably it is the woman who is the main sufferer in such breakdowns.  The time has come for a realistic appraisal of the situation and for the introduction of some type of limited divorce.  I find that regrettable but it is inevitable and we have to try to find a formula which I hope will not bring the State into conflict with the Churches here.</P>
    <P>I am not very much into religion and, perhaps, I could have practised my faith more, but I do not resent the attitude of the Catholic Church towards this very thorny question or their attitude towards any question affecting the morals of their flock.  They are right to say what they believe.  If they do not they will not be looking after their flock.  However, the State should liaise with the Catholic Church.  Even if it takes a long time I believe in dialogue and negotiation and the State, in conjunction with the Church, should try to find some acceptable formula for a limited type of divorce.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdowns will always occur irrespective of the formula arrived at because of incompatibility.  We should try to devise some way to make it more difficult for people to enter the marriage state.  Many problems occur with early marriages, with young people who are no more than children, have not developed mentally, are totally immature but are sexually active and attracted to the opposite sex.  They meet and marry.  The bloom can sometimes rapidly fade from the rose and problems arise.  The problem <Col N="1469" /> is as I said, that many of those people are mentally immature.  In suggesting that it should be more difficult for people to get married I do not know how that could be done but I am sure a way could be devised.  Children of 18 &mdash; they are children at that age &mdash; are too young to get married.  It is my view that 21 years is a more desirable age.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago the question of divorce would not get a hearing in the House and Deputies must be honest and recognise the need for it now.  Various statistics have been bandied about but in my view they are just guesses.  It is not possible to estimate the number of people who are seeking a divorce or the extent of unhappiness in marriages.  For many people it is a private matter that is kept hidden from the world.  However, it exists and in the world of today more and more people are acknowledging that their marriages are in trouble.  Those people, many of whom are very good and respect and like each other, find that living together they are no longer compatible.  Some form of out should be provided for what can be a hell upon earth and can bring intense suffering not only to the two people concerned but to the immediate and greater family.</P>
    <P>Many anti-divorce people hold the view that divorce should not be permitted because of the children.  They ask, &ldquo;What will happen to the children?&rdquo; From my own observance of life and my analysis of the position it is my belief that the children of a marriage where there are problems benefit from the removal of the aggravation.  Psychologically many children are injured and hurt by being witness or party to recriminations, abuse and, sometimes, violence.  I sincerely believe that children can benefit from the removal of that terrible irritant in their lives in their formative years.  It is for that reason that I believe we should progress along the road to finding some solution.</P>
    <P>There is a God of love as well as a God of wrath.  For many generations Irish people have been fed on a diet of the God of wrath.  I have enough belief in God, a simple belief, to expect that nobody will be consigned to the dungeons <Col N="1470" /> of Hell because they failed to make their marriage work.  Many churchmen also share that belief.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see Fianna Fáil participating in the debate on this issue.  They should not lie in ambush for Fine Gael on it.  They should not seek to make party political progress from our possible mistake in promoting a referendum.  The recent statement from that party seems to indicate that they will not do so and I applaud them for that.  We should proceed to hold a referendum unemotionally and without any clarion calls from any political party.  We should let the people, having looked at the issue objectively, choose in a referendum.  I will accept their choice.  Referenda are useful and that process should be used more often by Governments on burning topics of the day.  I hope that Fianna Fáil will accept what I am saying and will join in seeking the will of the people on this very tender subject.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work done by the committee on this subject.  Most, like myself, are men with a very limited knowledge of marriage breakdown, as Deputy O'Brien eloquently said previously. However, we all have some degree of knowledge on that subject.  It is sad in many ways that we have come to this stage in our development, because the greatest blessing that one can have is a happy marriage and that is enjoyed by the majority of people in this country. However, there is a sizeable and growing number of people who have not that blessing and who are having great mental suffering.  The time has come to face reality and I would give all the support that I can to the question of a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the ameliorative words of Deputy McGahon and I assure him that our party have no intention of laying in ambush for anybody. I would make a most unlikely guerilla fighter.  I did not hear his previous contribution, but some of the points made by him today struck a chord in me, as matters I intended to mention.  He talked about the idyllic days of long ago <Col N="1471" /> with reference to a leader of our party. It may be only in retrospect that those days looked fine, sunny and bright, because there is always an aura and a patina surrounding times past which hides the truth, particularly in the matter of family life, its happiness and stability. We now have statistics and know the problems that we are up against and I often wonder how many of those problems were present then but not spoken of.  I wonder how many women suffered for so long and so secretly, putting up with much in their lives which was non-fulfilling, perhaps in many aspects degrading, certainly not compatible with their high hopes on entering marriage.</P>
      <P>There would always have been a degree of unhappiness in marriage but because of the environment and the times, certainly the women did not take it upon themselves to speak of their difficulties.  Women now play the role of partner in marriage and demand much more of it.  Many work fruitfully inside and outside their homes and, because of that contribution to the contract of marriage, they quite rightly demand the fulfilling role of partner in the true meaning of the word.  There is a raised expectation from marriage which is still entered into with the same joyful commitment.  I do not share the Deputy's view that one should be 21 years of age before marrying; the age of 18 years is appropriate.  If entered into in the right spirit, with proper education, knowledge, foresight and foreknowledge of what is to come, young marriages can be most joyful and invigorating because youth and vigour are present in helping to overcome many of the pitfalls which lie ahead.  Women now demand companionship, compatibility and fulfillment within the marriage partnership, That is only right and that is how marriage should be viewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many other speakers have done, I pay tribute to the many members from all parties who sat on the committee and gave so much of their time and energy to this topic.  They spent a whole Sunday in Athlone last year, when I met them as <Col N="1472" /> chairperson of the local council.  I marvelled at the dedication that enabled people to spend a Sunday in a town far from their homes in furtherance of their deliberations.</P>
    <P>Most discussions on divorce take as their point of departure the growing statistics on marriage breakdown and the torment caused to people by a marriage which has broken down or is on the point of breaking down.  These matters cry out for redress on humanitarian grounds.  It is a very hard person who could look upon such statistics and hear such stories without wishing to help.  One hears people decrying constituency work, but how can you know what is going on if you have not listened to the case histories of the people who come to you?  Since I have been in public life, particularly over the past three or four years, I have met, almost on a weekly basis, people who have had problems of one degree or another in this connection.  Those concerned with helping the victims cannot pretend for one moment that the issuing of the right to enter another marriage is either the sole or the most important consideration from the point of view of the victim.  It is one of the considerations, one which we come across very often in our constituency work.  One would not want to decry this genuine right.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to someone who very vehemently opposes divorce legislation of any kind.  He asked with incredulity: &ldquo;You mean that a women would want to go into all that again freely of her own will?&rdquo; Of course, women wish to partake of the intimacy, warmth and companionship which such a relationship would give them and many want to do this within the confines and strictures of their Church. That is one of the problems that we are discussing today.  It is important, however, that we do not rush headlong into uncritically copying the actions of other jurisdictions.  We come into this debate much later than most countries.  Digressing for a moment, I am thinking of the movement into curriculum development where we stand to gain from the successes and failures experienced in the United States, and Britain.  These countries have <Col N="1473" /> found many pitfalls.  We have come into the debate on marriage breakdown perhaps ten or 15 years later than many advanced countries and have the valuable experience of their successes and failures.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the available results of the opinion polls that this issue is exercising the minds of the people, but that they are still learning and want considerable reassurance.  Even among those who support the removal of the ban on divorce, there is overwhelming support only for divorce under tightly controlled divorce legislation.  I looked back on the results of many opinion polls during the week and found that some people say: &ldquo;Yes, in certain defined circumstances&rdquo;.  Deputy McGahon would appear to be of that opinion.  There would not be any Member of this House who would not agree if it resulted in the amelioration of sufferings in certain cases.  The case may not stay like that, taking into account the inevitable relaxation of prohibitions.  There is no guarantee that, even if we had a limited form of divorce, all or any of the 70,000 separated people would qualify for such divorce.  Would those people then form a more vociferous lobby when they found themselves excluded from the limited form of divorce?  This is a dilemma which must be discussed before we go any further.</P>
    <P>The State has a responsibility to ensure that wherever possible, the laws redress grievances, injustice and hardship experienced by individuals and it has a broader social and moral responsibility to ensure that by its acts it provides a support for the institution of marriage.  The State attempted to do so in legislation such as the Marriages Act, 1972, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Home Protection Act of 1976 and the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, and through the back-up provision of free legal aid centres.  Rural areas do not have the benefit of easy access to free legal aid.  In Athlone, for instance, there is an out centre which is run spasmodically from Galway.  Anybody seeking regular free legal aid must go to Galway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> Does divorce significantly alter the marriage contract?  If it does, could it, over a period, contribute significantly along with many casual factors to a decline in the general stability of marriage? We need to be open in facing what will be the consequences of divorce legislation. There has been a reluctance to admit a negative side to such legislation while, on the other hand, there may have been unjustified exaggeration of the impact of divorce.  Those who have made up their minds about the need for divorce have sometimes been impatient about the lack of progress and have put the obstacles down to what they see as religioius myopia.  Such a view is unhelpful. An uninformed decision will almost inevitably be a bad one.  A mutually respectful debate genuinely committed to finding answers to the problem caused by marriage breakdown would be the pathway to a better society.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a proper family courts system with meaningful conciliation services.  There is a need to tackle the issue of community property in marriage and underline the notion of marriage as a full partnership.  There is also a need to make the courts more quickly accessible, and to expand their powers to make them more effective in providing answers to the variety of practical problems which flow from marriage breakdown.  Despite our constitutional provision guaranteeing marriage, the State provides little more than an emergency fire brigade service to marriages which are embers by the time help reaches them.</P>
    <P>In Article 41 of the Constitution an onus is imposed on the Government to do all in their power to protect and support marriage.  That means providing a workable support structure for marriages right through the gamut of legislation affecting families.  It also means that the State should take a positive role in preparing people for marriage.  Many of the speakers in the debate touched on this issue of preparing people for marriage in a practical and emotional sense as well as in a spiritual sense according to their beliefs.  This issue will have to be faced <Col N="1475" /> more openly.  When one speaks openly about the need for relationship or sex education in schools, one is legitimately assailed with literature and lobbying by people wishing to express different points of view.  However, this lobbying should not be of the virulent variety which often follows any statement on this issue.  If one is eager to promote the stability of marriage, one advocates that young people should be prepared for marriage. There is no doubt that the correct environment for sex education is the home.  Parents can choose their own time, in moments of intimacy with their sons and daughters, to instruct them on how they should handle their growing emotions and the various stages of their lives.  One of the joys of parenthood is to deal with young people and welcome their emerging maturity.  That is not always easy for parents, having regard to the upbringing of many parents, and their inhibitions about having a free rapport with their children in these matters.</P>
    <P>Even with ideal homes where all of these matters are openly discussed, there is also a need in schools for a strong emphasis on relationships and sex education. Where there has been sex education in schools, it has benefited young people.  It has been most successful where there has been parental input.  Now that parents' councils are structured on a national level, through the initiative of the present Minister, they should take on this area of sex education.  There should be parental input into the formulation of a curriculum for such programmes and there should be parental input in the running of the programmes.  Parents should also meet with teachers to judge the efficacy of such programmes and consider where they might be changed or broadened.  Apart from relationship/sex education for marriage, there should be education in the practical end of things. I am constantly amazed to meet young women with brilliant academic honours, all set to embark on a prestigious career or on third level education, who know very little about practical situations, about mortgages, banking, house buying, <Col N="1476" /> budgeting, rearing children, relationships and communication.  This is a huge issue to be tackled.  I fail to see why whenever the subject is addressed in a responsible fashion there is such a hue and cry about it.  Education in schools should be geared towards the practical side of life as well as towards the academic side.  There should be education to equip people for relationships and for communicating.</P>
    <P>In our youth, and even later on, matters such as sex were discussed surreptitiously and in a fashion which bred a distrust and a feeling that all was not right with what you were talking about.  This is no preparation for what should be a natural and enjoyable part of a person's life.  There should be a specific, structured course on this matter and a programme of this nature would help young people to grow to maturity with a clear awareness of their own dignity and enable them to make informed and responsible decisions about their health and sexual behaviour.  Not only should they be given information regarding physical changes which occur, they should also be told of the emotional difficulties which they might encounter.  In conjunction with this there should be education regarding communication in relationships with others of both sexes.</P>
    <P>The physical, psychological, moral and emotional aspects of sexual behaviour should be understood; students should be encouraged to look at issues critically with independence of mind and to have the courage to make their own choice, resisting the pressure of their peers.  I know from talking to young people that very often they have to do things because their peers do them.  This applies to drinking, smoking and sex.  This behaviour is regarded as fashionable in some quarters but the type of education to which I refer would enable a young person to question these values.  This part of the debate has been dealt with in a peripheral way but it is of the utmost importance in relation to marriage.  It would be much more helpful now to talk about all that could be done to smooth the path of marriage before we move on to discuss divorce.  I mentioned the various Acts which were <Col N="1477" /> brought in, particularly in the seventies, in relation to the protection of the spouse &mdash; in most cases the wife &mdash; the children and the home.  However, there should be a meaningful conciliation service which will reach marriages in crisis before they break down irretrievably.</P>
    <P>We could learn valuable lessons from neighbouring jurisdictions who by ignoring these matters and concentrating on simply providing easy divorce, have created problems which are worse than those they set out to solve.  As the law stands marriages can, in some circumstances, be annulled.  This is a growing area of jurisprudence which is similar to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church.  There is no excuse for failure to update the nullity laws and to make access to annulments easier.  Such changes, although they would affect only a small number of people would, nonetheless, be an indication of a genuine commitment to tackle the problem of marital breakdown.  The concomitant issue of illegitimacy arises in this context and it is a pity that even the very limited provision in the new Bill has not yet been put through the House although I understand it will be introduced shortly.  The proposals for change are modest but they should open the door to changes in nullity which would, in turn, provide an answer for at least some of the 70,000 people whose marriages have broken down.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity now to study this whole issue and its implications as it enfolded in other countries.  We would be well advised to learn from them and to take preventive measures in regard to marriage breakdown.  Deputy McGahon spoke of the need for an early referendum and I agree with him.  However, it should not be rushed into.  Many of the issues to which speakers here have referred provide fertile ground for much closer examination. We all recognise that there are marriage problems which must be faced and nearly all of us have seen or know of very bad cases.  Some people think that the ideal solution is a limited form of divorce but I do not see how that could be implemented.  In any other area of law which imposed such a stricture it was <Col N="1478" /> found after a while that elasticity came in because of lobbying.  The same would apply in relation to divorce and people who see their case as relevant would be very forceful in demanding the same treatment, with the result that the problem would become greater.  I do not have the answers, I merely seek to express my thoughts truthfully and clearly before the House and everyone who speaks here should do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Rourke said, we should all express our thoughts clearly and frankly before the House but it would help in the public debate if we indicated, equally clearly and frankly, whether we are for or against a fundamental change in the law.  The debate will not have much point if Deputies hedge on that issue.</P>
      <P>We are debating the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I consider that the mechanism by which Deputies are enabled to make statements is a little euphemistic because everyone knows that we are debating the issue of divorce.  Indeed, the very setting up of the committee and the terms of reference, to consider the protection of marriage and of family life and to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage, tended to approach this thorny question in a somewhat less than frank manner.  It is time we faced up to the issue and we will have to make our minds up one way or the other.  The decision will be made by the people and that is the best way to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Divorce is now a live political and social issue and has been the subject of comment, debate, controversy and lobbying, all the things that precede new legislation or social change.  They have taken place in regard to this subject in an ever-increasing fashion for some considerable time.  Much of the reason for this enhanced awareness of the debate must go to the Divorce Action Group, a group who came into existence some years ago for the express purpose of securing a change in our laws on divorce and with the express purpose of having <Col N="1479" /> divorce available as part of our legal system.</P>
    <P>I recall about two years ago listening to a radio interview with one of the members of the Divorce Action Group &mdash; if I am not mistaken I think it was a founder member.  He was very frank about the objectives of the group and their method of operation.  He said they were founded to achieve divorce in our legal system and that their method of going about this objective was to mount a marketing campaign and to sell divorce as a notion or as a product to the people and in that connection to use all the techniques of marketing and lobbying.  He illustrated what that involved: publicity, good relations with the press and all the other tricks of the public relations world. It is a perfectly valid and acceptable part of modern society but I could not help feeling there was a cynical touch about an approach that wanted to sell something as serious as divorce in the same way that one would sell a soap powder.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, one has to acknowledge that the activities of the Divorce Action Group &mdash; they have canvassed me in my constituency &mdash; have highlighted the issue and public consciousness.  It is time that Irish society made up its mind one way or the other.  As the representatives of that society &mdash; I hesitate to say the leaders of it &mdash; we have an obligation to give our views frankly, without hedging and without putting conditions on what we might like to see.  The net issue is, are we in favour of permitting divorce as part of our legal system or are we against it?</P>
    <P>The debate has gone on for quite a time and the arguments for and against are well known and identified.  The main reason advanced by the proponents of change is that there is a large number of marriages where the parties have separated, the marriages have broken down and many of the parties have entered into new relationships with other partners, have begotten children and have set up other homes.  It is said that divorce should <Col N="1480" /> be available so that these new relationships can be legitimised, made respectable, validated or whatever term one wants to use in that connection.</P>
    <P>The size of the problem of marriage breakdown is not clear.  There are considerable discrepancies in the numbers claimed by the proponents on each side. In their submission to the committee whose report we are discussing, the Divorce Action Group guessed the number of broken marriages at that time to be 36,000.  However, the report of the committee stated that figures available from the CSO suggested the figure could be considerably lower.  There is an area of uncertainty here.  Obviously it is difficult to define precisely when a marriage has broken down and then provide a method of getting accurate statistics. The figure is a maximum of 36,000 and that is a significant number.  However, at 6 per cent of the marriages in the country it is far and away the lowest number of broken marriages in the western world. One has to ask if there is a connection between this low rate of breakdown and the absence of divorce or whether it is due to other social factors in our society and the predominant position of the Catholic Church which prohibits divorce and encourages marriage as a life-long commitment.  It could be a mixture of both and one could speculate for a long time without coming to a positive conclusion either way.  The fact remains that the percentage of marriage breakdown here is the lowest in Europe.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the number of people involved is substantial.  One can sympathise with the strongly emotional case made on behalf of these people, based on an appeal to the compassion that all of us have for people who may be in unfortunate marital circumstances that they should have the opportunity to form further marriages and that they are unhappy, unfortunate people who are the victim of circumstances.  That is possibly too simplistic an approach in identifying these people and in deciding if they are entitled to have a new marital regime provided for them.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could dispute <Col N="1481" /> that among the parties to broken marriages there must be a considerable number of people who, when individual cases are examined, could hardly qualify for our sympathy.  I am sure some of the partners in broken marriages have been deceitful, disloyal and, possibly, have been guilty of cruelty.  I do not think anyone could doubt that having regard to the knowledge we have of the causes of marriage breakdown.  Yet, those who argue that these people, the victims of broken marriages, should be entitled to enter into new marriages are arguing in favour of that kind of person equally as they argue on behalf of the innocent victim.  I do not know if one could pursue that argument very far, that people who were deceitful, disloyal or guilty of cruelty in their first marriage should have a right to call on the State to give them an opportunity to contract a further marriage. These considerations seriously damage the argument that the reason we need divorce is the number of broken marriages.</P>
    <P>There is an inherent, dangerously bad principle in legislating on the basis of hard cases.  There is an old adage that hard cases make bad law and I have no doubt of the validity of that saying.  Our legislative history, the history of judicial decisions, would tend to support the validity of the adage that in attempting to cure a case calling out for a compassionate response legislators or the Judiciary implement changes in the law that have totally unforeseen and harmful consequences in other areas.  Therefore, one has to be very careful of legislating on the basis of hard cases.  In essence, those proposing divorce base their claim mainly on the ground that there are hard cases and that something should be done for them.  We have to be very careful if we decide to legislate for those reasons that we do not introduce something that will produce even more difficult and hard cases, something that might do damage to the society body corporate.</P>
    <P>It might be something &mdash; this is one of the arguments used by those against the introduction of divorce &mdash; that might change the rate of marriage breakdown <Col N="1482" /> so that we would go from being the lowest in Europe and begin to approach the general average of marriage breakdown figures on this Continent.  What the country will have to decide is a net question: do we want to have a society which will acknowledge publicly that in our opinion marriage has changed from being a life-long absolute commitment to being a conditional contract between two parties, to be broken in certain circumstances? I was rather surprised to hear Deputy O'Rourke posing the hypothetical question: does divorce significantly alter the nature of marriage contracts?  I thought it would be common case now, that divorce totally alters the nature of the marriage contract.  In our society the marriage contract is a lifelong absolute commitment and what is now being proposed, if divorce is to be introduced into our legislation, is a fundamental change in that concept &mdash; instead of marriage being life-long and absolute it would be conditional at the suit of the parties to it.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution, the basic law of our society, provides that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack. That is a clear, unambiguous and specific statement of the State's and society's attitude to marriage and to the family.  As that Article states, marriage is the basis of the family, and right through the report which we are debating runs the theme that it is necessary to protect the family, that the family, as the basic unit of our society, at all times must be strengthened and protected.</P>
    <P>Those who drew up the Constitution believed that the way in which the family could be protected and strengthened was to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack. If we move to change the constitutional provision and introduce divorce into our society, we must be totally clear about what we are doing.  We will be making marriage conditional, and if marriage is the foundation of the family and its protection then, by extension, we are making <Col N="1483" /> that protection and foundation conditional. We are rocking the institution of the family.  The institution of the family is the very bedrock of society and if we disturb that bedrock then, surely, we are interfering with society itself.</P>
    <P>When one looks at modern western society one must be depressed at the state of it: violence is endemic, pornography is run of the mill in many countries, materialism is the be all and end all of life.  Possibly, in the perspective of history, one could say that it is a society that is disintegrating.  It could well be that the perspective of history could well mark the start of that disintegration with the weakening of the family as the basic unit of training and discipline within society. I do not know &mdash; I cannot answer that and I doubt if anybody contemporarily can answer that.</P>
    <P>It recalls to me when I was a student reading Roman law and dealing with the Roman law on marriage and the dissolution of marriage.  Roman jurisprudence eventually evolved to a stage when marriage could be dissolved by consent.  I do not know how it has stuck in my mind after all those years, but I recall a footnote to a page in which the author of the text drew attention to a statement by an historian whose name I cannot recall &mdash; a well known historian of the Roman Empire &mdash; that he could mark the beginning of the disintegration of that wonderful sophisticated society when Roman jurisprudence introduced into its marriage laws the principle, <i>consensus facit, consensus fraugit</i>&mdash; consent makes, consent breaks.  There may possibly be a warning in that anecdote.</P>
    <P>The net question to be decided is will the State here decide that marriage, instead of being lifelong and absolute, will be conditional, dependent on the wishes of the parties to it.  People may argue that restrictions can be put on how those parties will implement their wishes to separate and to break up marriages and allow further alliances.  Deputies contributing to the debate and persons <Col N="1484" /> outside speaking on this subject and writing about it frequently touch on the circumstances in which divorce should be allowed, assuming that we make the basic decision to change the nature of marriage. There is then a further decision to be made: in what circumstances should the parties be allowed divorce?</P>
    <P>In my opinion, if we decide to introduce divorce in our jurisdiction it must be on the basis of no fault.  The history of other jurisdictions shows that divorce started off in a limited way.  Originally it was available only in a very limited way. The fact that that was the thinking implies that the legislature and society were doubtful about divorce, worried about its benefits, and they sought to circumscribe very severely its availability.  About a century ago divorce was available only for the husband on the basis of adultery. That right was extended to the wife.  Then other matrimonial offences, cruelty, desertion and the rest, were introduced. The experiences of jurisdictions that had this type of divorce on the basis of fault were entirely unhappy.  There were cases of fraud and collusion.  I recommend to Deputies to read A.P. Herbert's famous satire, <i>Holy Deadlock.</i> It became clear that it was not practical to have divorce on a fault basis.  It led to collusion and to fraud.  There was a move then to a new concept of irretrievable breakdown.  This was the euphemism for consent because irretrievable breakdown can be established only by the parties to the marriage and, even then, can they say that the breakdown is irretrievable?  Nobody knows what tomorrow holds for him or her but at least there is probably a better chance of the party to the marriage than of the court being able to identify that the breakdown is irretrievable.  A court cannot identify whether a marriage has broken down irretrievably without the evidence of the parties to the marriage. If a couple wish to be released from their marriage, obviously the evidence they would give would be that the marriage had broken down irretrievably; but I hear people arguing that irretrievable breakdown can be assumed after a number of years' separation.  Various time intervals <Col N="1485" /> have been suggested, ranging from as low as a year to as high as five years.  These time limits are generally put forward on the basis that if we provide for divorce we must not allow it to be obtained lightly, that we must put impediments in the way of it and arrange matters so that people will stand back from their marriage, reconsider it and then decide whether they should be divorced.  After such an appraisal they may decide not to divorce.  That is a commendable and attractive argument in a facile sort of way, but it is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons put forward for divorce is that in cases where people have separated, have entered into alliances with new partners, begotten new families and set up new homes, these new arrangements should be validated.  Those who argue for divorce on those grounds and who say at the same time that divorce availability should be constrained, that there should be conditions attaching to it and that one condition should be that in the case of breakdown there should be a suitable waiting period, are hardly being fair to those who have entered into new alliances, who have established new families and who would have to wait the five years, say.  Whatever about being fair, it certainly would not be logical when the basis for the movement towards divorce is to relieve the predicament of those people.  That is why there is an inherent contradiction in that argument.  It is why I have reached the conclusion that it would be fallacious to attempt to introduce divorce on the basis of irretrievable breakdown.  Such a condition cannot be established objectively and to try to establish it by way of a period of separation is only to compound the fifficulties that have led to the demand for divorce.</P>
    <P>If we are to have divorce it must be on the basis of no fault and with the consent of the parties.  There has been a movement to some degree in all other jurisdictions in which there is divorce legislation towards that legal position and it is the inevitable logical conclusion that cannot be avoided and will have to be reached if we are to be honest in our approach to this subject.  We must admit that that is <Col N="1486" /> the type of divorce that eventually would have to be provided for.</P>
    <P>Another problem that would arise in the event of the introduction of divorce would be the question of maintenance. The present law is clear as to the liability to maintain and the entitlement to be maintained.  That liability and entitlement rest with the spouses.  If we permit divorce and permit a second marriage to be established, where are we to place the legal liability to maintain and the legal entitlement to be maintained?  People may say that that problem is there already if a marriage breaks up and if either or both of the parties enter into another alliance.  Of course there remains the obligation to maintain in such circumstances, but at present that is a moral obligation.  The legal obligation remains related to the first union.  If the parties concerned are of sufficient wealth to be able to maintain two households and two families no problem generally will arise; but if, like most of the population, the parties are hard put to maintain one household, the law would have to decide which household would have the legal claim to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Is the entitlement to remain with the first spouse?  If so, the second alliance will be in a weak position.  The first spouse may have attached the earnings of the partner concerned to provide for his or her maintenance and the maintenance of the children; but the second spouse, who would be a lawful spouse in an assumed divorce jurisdiction, would have no entitlement to be maintained by his or her spouse.  Therefore, a condition of marriage as we know it would be absent from that marriage.  It would be a different type of marriage and, obviously, that would be an unhealthy and unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>If the legal liability and obligation and the entitlement were to rest with the second marriage, who would be responsible for the spouse and children of the first marriage.  Would the responsibility rest with the State?  It probably would have to be the State.  Could the State be expected to maintain that spouse at the <Col N="1487" /> level at which he or she had been maintained during the course of the first marriage? Hardly.  If not, by removing the legal entitlement from the first marriage and reposing it in the second marriage, the State, by introducing divorce, would be prejudicing the innocent parties to the first marriage and that again would be an undesirable position.</P>
    <P>This dilemma and the possible resolutions of it point up another argument and a very real and practical difficulty in the way of introducing divorce.  There is also the politics of the situation, the politics concerning the attitude of the different political parties to the problem and concerning the methods that will have to be used to get the problem solved.</P>
    <P>The problem of divorce has been around the Irish scene for a number of years and there are protagonists on each side.  I think it is unsatisfactory that it be left a controversy, and the time has now arrived when the question should be put to the Irish people whether they want their Constitution amended or not bearing in mind that behind that question the real issue to be decided is, do they want divorce legislation or not?  If the people decide they want the Constitution amended, then there is an obligation on the legislature to bring in divorce legislation. I think the question should be asked and the controversy removed from the scene one way or the other.  I would like to see the question posed on an all-party basis, the matter then to go before the country and be campaigned for or against by people as they individually feel justified in doing.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the majority of Deputies in my party are against the introduction of divorce into our legal code.  I cannot be sure of that but from discussing the subject with them on a casual basis over some time &mdash; it is a political subject which comes up for discussion from time to time on an informal basis &mdash; I would be of the opinion that the majority would be campaigning against any change in our legal code.  I would be part of that majority because I have come to the conclusion that the <Col N="1488" /> introduction of divorce into our legal system would not be for the common good or for the good of society.  I consider that marriage as an absolute lifelong commitment should be maintained rather than be changed into a conditional commitment to be dissolved at the wishes of the parties to it.  I have come to that belief because of the importance of maintaining the family as the basic unit of society, of maintaining and protecting it, and the best protection of the family, which is so fundamental to the wellbeing of society, is a lifelong marriage, a marriage in which there is a lifelong commitment and in which there is certainty.</P>
    <P>I would be fearful of ignoring the practice not of decades or centuries but of millenia in regard to the nature of marriage. We of this generation may be more learned and more sophisticated, but are we any wiser than previous generations that we can arrogate to ourselves the decision to make this fundamental change in a fundamental institution of our society?  Every generation of people, and every generation of politicians, have an obligation to hand on to those who come after them, a society that will hopefully be in better shape, or at least as good as, the one they succeeded to.  I would be very doubtful that if we, in our time, were to legislate and to give the lead to our society to make a fundamental change in the nature of legislation, we would be handing on a society in better shape than the one we received.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I want to put my position clearly on the record.  I started off by saying that we have an obligation to be clear and unequivocal on this issue. I want to say quite clearly that I am in favour of the retention of the constitutional prohibition on divorce because I consider that the nature of marriage as a lifelong commitment should be retained and should not be changed and transformed into a conditional alliance to be dissolved at the wish of the parties to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the joint committee and congratulate them for their work which was spread over many months.  One must also appreciate <Col N="1489" /> the input of many organisations and individuals into the report which helped in a very big way.  Introducing this report the committee have set out the many problems in Irish marriages.  We are dealing with a very important social issue and all of us in public life have from time to time dealt with sad situations.  In my contribution I want to be constructive and positive. This debate gives Members a chance to express their views based on the facts they have dealt with in various situations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the unanimous decisions of the committee in setting up a new Family Court and with regard to education, counselling and the legal age of marriage. I hope the Government will take note of the areas where the committee were unanimous.  It would now be encouraging if legislation were introduced on these very important issues.  The overall report is very important as it provides much useful information that would not be available but for the work of the committee.</P>
      <P>One point comes through from the report, and that is, that the majority of the committee were not in favour of divorce legislation as being either essential or desirable at the moment.  I was surprised on reading the report that no effort was made to carry out a statistical analysis of marriage breakdown in our society.  Researchers must have been available for the collection of this most important data.  At present various figures for marriage breakdown are given, some say 36,000 people are affected and others say 70,000.  The truth is nobody knows for sure but if figures are repeated often enough people begin to believe them.  Nevertheless, we know there is a serious marriage problem. Some of the arguments made in favour of divorce do not carry weight or qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression given by people promoting divorce is that effective remedies are not available to deal with marriage breakdown. Certain groups suggest that the introduction of divorce will supply all the remedies for all problems arising from marriage breakdown.  This is misleading. <Col N="1490" /> Circumstances clearly indicate that if divorce were introduced here it would not provide a single solution to marriage breakdown.  It is also suggested that to solve the problem we should have divorce in unlimited circumstances &mdash; the usual expression used is &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown of marriage&rdquo;, known in other countries as &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce.  From the many submissions made to the committee in support of divorce it can be seen that there was general agreement in support of a no fault divorce system.  Where no fault divorce has been introduced it ends up with divorce on demand.  If we introduce divorce even in limited, well defined circumstances we will follow the same path as other countries, as we are no different from other people.  A population census in the UK in 1983 showed that divorced women who remarry are twice as likely to divorce as a woman marrying for the first time.</P>
    <P>One has to take account of the long term impact of divorce on children when they marry.  Research suggests a link between childhood and adult divorce. Family break-up is also a factor in juvenile problems, personality disorders and other related problems.  The basis of any Christian community is the family.  It has a special place in our Constitution and as such should be protected.  We should tackle the problems that lead to marriage breakdown and which undermine family life.</P>
    <P>In 1984 a survey was carried out in a Dublin constituency on marriage breakdown. It showed that in 67 per cent of cases excessive alcohol was the main reason.  Should we not tackle this problem which seems to be increasing every year, bearing in mind the increased admissions to psychiatric hospitals for drink related problems?  Should be not try to educate people to appreciate alcohol and not abuse it?  Should we not see to it that the present laws regarding teenage drinking are enforced?  After all, teenagers will be the married couples of tomorrow.  If alcohol is a major problem in marriage breakdown, surely divorce will not solve it.  There would be a second and even third divorce.  The legal age <Col N="1491" /> for marriage now is 16.  This should be changed to 18 and preferably to 21.  A leading marriage counsellor says that researches all over the world have shown that marriages made under the age of 20 carry a high risk of future marital problems.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 of the report, dealing with the protection of marriage and family life, is very important.  It deals with the preparation for marriage and suggests the addition to our educational programme of education for life and marriage.  The home is the prime educator and the State has an obligation to ensure that education for life will be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien, Chairman of the committee, referred in his report to a submission by Dr. Dominian who stressed the need for young people to learn about personal relationships, communication, affection and understanding.  He referred to these as the infrastructure for marriage and he is right.  The Government should take special note of that submission.  Perhaps more than anything else young people need counselling before marriage.  Many voluntary organisations provide preparation for marriage. Some of the Churches, particularly the Catholic Church run compulsory pre-marriage courses.  They do excellent work and are entitled to financial support from the State to enable them to carry on and expand this work.  After all, stable marriages are the concern not just of the Churches but of the State.  All couples who wish to marry in a church or in a registry office should be obliged by law to undertake a recognised premarriage course.</P>
    <P>I appeal for support for the counselling services.  The people involved have special training which gives them a qualification to work in the best interests of persons preparing for marriage.  They also provide counselling service after marriage.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the problems within marriage and of the many young people affected by them, but I hold that divorce is not the answer and that it is not in the best interests of society. <Col N="1492" /> Experience shows that divorce laws cannot be controlled.  In many countries where divorce exists the original intention was to have limited divorce in cases of hardship and injustice and attempts were made to prevent others from obtaining divorces.  Now it is universally accepted that attempts to confine divorce will fail.  We have only to take the UK for example.  Chapter 8 of the report refers to mediation and the committee believed there should be mediation services available at an early stage.  These services should be staffed by a combination of full time trained specialists and part-time voluntary workers.  The principle of these counselling services is that both parties should be given a chance to work out their problems with the aid of a professional mediator.</P>
    <P>It is for the people to decide by way of a referendum if the constitutional support for marriage and family life should be maintained.  The people have the right to decide and the onus is on the Government to legislate.  We in Fianna Fáil will approach this in a responsible manner having regard to the best interests of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the far ranging debate which has taken place on the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown with whom I was privileged to be involved.  I also welcome the fact that it has extended to this House the first opportunity since 1937 to debate the issue of divorce and the constitutional prohibition contained in the 1937 Constitution, which was last discussed in this House when that Constitution was being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I address the issue of divorce which seems to be central to the contributions of many Deputies I want to refer briefly to the areas in which there is no dispute on any side of this House, to what I would describe as the consensus aspects of the report about which politicians and Deputies on all sides agree and in relation to which we have been very heavy in supporting, in the context of political rhetoric, but which over the years we have been very remiss in providing in the <Col N="1493" /> context of legislative action.  The report is about both the protection of the family and marital breakdown.  It would be the universal wish of every Deputy in a utopian society that every couple who entered into marriage would remain happily married for their full life.  That is not a possibility in the real world.  Certainly this State has a duty to ensure that the conditions exist which make it possible for those who enter into marriage to have a successful marriage.</P>
    <P>I always find it interesting that those who must stridently oppose divorce, who evoke the benefits of the current constitutional provisions, tend to place all their emphasis on the protection of the family by the preservation within our Constitution of the article which prohibits divorce.  Those who talk about family life, about the unique place of our family in our society, tend to be very heavy in anti-divorce rhetoric but very slow to support or articulate the need to provide the social services and legislation necessary so as to ensure that marriages themselves work and that people enter into marriage in a state of mind which creates the possibility, in the vast majority of cases, for marriages to be successful.</P>
    <P>I found it curious to listen to my party colleague, the Minister for Defence, in his very articulate exposition of the anti-divorce approach, or his articulate plea in favour of retaining the provision in the Constitution.  It was noteworthy that he hung his whole commentary on this report on saying effectively in his view that we should retain the prohibition on divorce in the Constitution because that protects the family and that he had nothing to say about any of the legislative areas that should be tackled and which would provide real protection.  Listening to the contribution of the Minister for Defence I was jogged into remembering, in researches I did years ago, the contributions made in this House in 1937 when the current Constitution was originally enacted, in particular a contribution made by a former Taoiseach of a Coalition Government, Deputy John A. Costello, during the course of the debate on Article 41 of the Constitution when <Col N="1494" /> there was a certain amount of dispute between himself and President de Valera, as he then was, during the course of the debate.  In the Official Report of 4 June 1937, column 1859, Deputy John A. Costello remarked and I quote:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;Merely writing down high principles in this Constitution is not going to see that these things are in fact, achieved in practice.</P>
    <P>That encapsulates our approach to marriage and family life, that we have been high on constitutional rhetoric for far too long and slow on legislative and Government action for far too long.</P>
    <P>Despite all the constitutional provisions and the rhetoric supportive of the family, we still have not really come to terms with what is needed in the context of social policy to truly protect family life in Ireland and to protect marriage.  This report of the joint committee sets out all of the measures that are agreed unanimously on all sides of this House as to what should be done in this area.  There is now an onus on the Government to provide legislative action and social reform necessary to implement these provisions. The time has come for the rhetoric of concern to come to an end and for it to be replaced by governmental and legislative action.  Because these are not matters of controversy, are matters that I and all Deputies support, I am not going to dwell on them.  I shall merely list them and refer to them briefly.  I find it is extraordinary that those who oppose divorce seem to give these aspects of the report, which are so fundamentally important to what this committee have done, so little regard and so little mention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke, speaking earlier this morning very articulately supported the recommendations in this report for education within the schools in the context of our educational system that would provide an education for life, for marriage and an education about relationships. I agree wholeheartly with the sentiments expressed by her which mirror what is stated in this report.  We should now go about providing that type of education for life within our schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1495" /> The report refers to the importance of pre-marriage counselling.  One of the things that people who work in the area of marriage breakdown frequently say is that those couples who go to pre-marriage counselling are very often the couples who have the least need of it and that those who do not are very much the couples who do have need of it.  We cannot force people to go to pre-marriage counselling, practically speaking, or to take it seriously.  But Government policy has never encouraged it, has never effectively contributed to it.  Indeed, despite the constitutional rhetoric about the protection of family life, successive Governments have abdicated any role that they could play in encouraging and fostering pre-marriage counselling.  Fortunately, in recent years, Churches of all religions have taken up that role and are doing good work in these areas.  But there is not enough being done and there is a greater role that could be played by the Government in this area.  This report brings it out.</P>
    <P>The age for marriage in Ireland is still 16.  Is there anybody in this House who would seriously suggest that a 16 or 17 year old has developed to a sufficient degree of maturity as to be able to enter into a permanent, life-long union with someone of the opposite sex that one could, to any degree, predict would be a successful and functioning marriage?  The report recommends that the minimum age for marriage should be 18 years. Whereas people of the age of 28 can make mistakes as they can at the age of 16, when it comes to entering into marriage &mdash; people whom we still regard in this House as infants and minors, people whom we still regard in this House as too young to purchase property or to enter into contracts of a commercial nature &mdash; the idea that we can allow children of such tender years to enter into an irrecoverable marriage and that, indeed, until 1972 children of 12 and 14 years could do so, is quite extraordinary.  We should reform that area and stop simply engaging in rhetoric about it.</P>
    <P>Effectively when marriages run into <Col N="1496" /> difficulties the State has played no real role over the years, again despite the constitutional rhetoric.  Marriage counselling has been left to voluntary organisations and Church groups and, in some areas of the country, they serve us very well.  In other areas there are very few facilities available to assist people whose marriages run into difficulties.  This report emphasises the need for involvement in the marriage counselling area, for the State to put greater funding into this area, to structure it, and ensure minimum standards.  That is a positive way of trying to deal with preserving real marriages or marriages that run into difficulties before they irretrievably break down.</P>
    <P>The report also talks about mediation where marriages have totally collapsed, to provide a system, alternative to the court structure, away from the conflict inherent in the legal system we have at present, a forum within which people whose marriages have collapsed could at least try to work out the consequences of collapse in a civilised way.  This would at least enable them, as may often be necessary for years to come after the marriage has collapsed, to conduct relationships with each other in a civilised way, for no other reason than the absolutely essential reason of ensuring that they can co-operate with each other where there are young children.  When the marriage of parents of young children collapses they may cease to live with each other.  Spouses as parents need to co-operate with each other for many years thereafter, and the courts system that operates at the moment drives a greater wedge into the relationship that has collapsed than was ever necessary.  A mediation service could seek to provide a far better system to deal with this area.</P>
    <P>This report deals in detail with the need to provide mediation services and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs and family law reform, my constituency colleague, then set up a committee who apparently produced another report on this report.  If we are committed to dealing with this area there is no reason why we cannot establish a nationwide mediation service using the <Col N="1497" /> skills and expertise within the social work teams operating within the community care designated areas in each health board area.  We should provide within those community care teams specialist training for social workers and others who could work in the area of both marriage counselling and mediation.</P>
    <P>Finally on this, as someone who works and has worked for over 15 years with people whose marriages have collapsed, I find it very difficult to take seriously the rhetoric of concern about the family in Ireland when I see the facilities available to families&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Brady for his repetition of the childish and somewhat hysterical contribution he made last week.  This attitude of calling quorums during the course of a debate is an eloquent testimony to the real concern of the Fianna Fáil Party in the context of debating this issue.  I welcome the fact though, that my sitting in the Leader of the Opposition's chair last week brought members of that party into this House today to participate in this debate.  That is a welcome addition to parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying when I was interrupted that I find it difficult to take seriously the protestations of concern about the family that emanate regularly from some Members of this House and, indeed, from Governments over the years.  As someone who worked in the area of family law over the years and has dealt with people who suffer from the tragedy and trauma of broken marriage, I have never ceased to be appalled by the extraordinarily Dickensian conditions into which people are thrown to try to resolve the consequences of marital breakdown. They are thrown into going to courts that <Col N="1498" /> have not changed since the last century. For example, visit the Circuit Court any Monday morning and you can see anything from 20 to 40 married couples, husbands and wives, not talking to each other, whose marriages have collapsed, standing along the corridors talking to lawyers with no opportunity to discuss their problems in privacy, their names being called out as their cases are called. Despite all this concern that we show for the family, as the courts system operates, while they are standing around in a state of shock and distress that the collapse of their marriage has led them into court, they are likely to find themselves pushed or bustled aside by members of the Garda doing their job pulling people in handcuffs through the corridors into the neighbouring court for criminal trials.  That scene that is acted out in the Dublin Circuit Court every Monday is a very eloquent testimony to the hypocrisy of Members of this House and of successive Governments who profess concern about the family and talk about the family having a special position.  The position in which people in those circumstances are placed is demeaning, degrading and demoralising and should not be tolerated, yet it is to be seen and on display publicly on a weekly basis in the Circuit Court in Dublin and is mirrored by similar happenings in District Courts and Circuit Courts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This report talks about the need for family courts and the family court system. That is another issue on which everybody in this House is in agreement; everybody is in favour of family courts.  The difficulty is in providing the governmental commitment to introduce the legislation to provide such a court system.  I threw my hands up in despair when I read the contribution made by a Minister of State in the House on this debate.  She suggested that the issue of family courts, having been raised in this report, should now possibly be referred to the Law Reform Commission, presumably for another report.  If this report and our commitment to marriage and family life are to be taken seriously, we should establish immediately a legislative task force to prepare <Col N="1499" /> the necessary legislation to bring before this House the legislation required to introduce comprehensive and far-ranging reforms in the whole area of marriage and marital breakdown.  We need that task force.  In my four years in this House I have been very conscious of the total inability of successive Governments and parliamentary draftsmen to produce badly needed legislation as speedily as it should be produced.  There is something wrong with the system and with the way we operate it.  There is no reason why the recommendations contained in this report, that deal with all the areas excluding the divorce area, which I will deal with in a moment, could not be dealt with by way of legislation during the course of the first six months of 1986 if we have a genuine commitment to do it.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the issue of divorce which has been debated here with Deputies expressing their views as to whether there should be a constitutional referendum and whether divorce is or is not desirable.  It is very easy to get caught up, when dealing with this issue, in some form of academic debate where one talks about marital contracts and that when one enters a contract one is bound into it.  It is very easy to forget that marriage is not simply about a contract, that the essence of any marital relationship is the existence of a viable personal relationship between the couple who are party to that relationship.  It is very easy to talk about preserving a contract but it is interesting to note that even the Roman Catholic Church's concept of marriage as a contract radically changed with Vatican II and the relationship concept of marriage has since then been very much emphasised.</P>
    <P>If we lived in an Utopian society where everybody who entered into a marriage contract lived happily married together thereafter we would not have to talk about the issue of divorce but, listening to those who are dealing with the issue of divorce in this debate, I wonder whether they realise that they are living in a society where there are thousands of adults who are contractually tied into <Col N="1500" /> marriages that factually have long ceased to exist.  I also wonder if they understand the impact on an individual of a marriage breaking down.  There seems to be a sort of caricature type of approach to the divorce issue in the debate where the suggestion is that, if we permit divorce, adult people will be running around the country willy nilly having a succession of different relationships which would produce marriages, divorces, more marriages, more divorces and so on.</P>
    <P>I have never come across an individual who has looked with equanimity and happiness on the breakdown of his or her marriage.  I rarely come across an individual spouse who is the only person at fault for a marriage breaking down.  In most instances it takes two people to contribute to marital breakdown.  Marriages are few and far between where the husband or the wife individually is the sole and only guilty person, if &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; is the right word to use.  When a marriage breaks down the personal devastation and trauma suffered by those who are party to that marriage are evident to anybody who deals with couples who have problems of marital breakdown or with people whose marriages have collapsed.  There are tremendous feelings of grief and personal feelings of loss.  Very often there are tremendous feelings of personal guilt. The vast majority of people start asking questions such as: &ldquo;Why has my marriage broken down&rdquo; or &ldquo;what have I done wrong&rdquo;?  Very often that can descend into bitterness and feelings can run very deep as to the view taken of the other party to the marriage.  Nevertheless, everybody who is a party to a broken marriage feels deeply the distress, devastation and trauma of a breakdown.  That needs to be understood and realised.</P>
    <P>What we have to ask ourselves as a society is, where somebody is distressed, where a marriage is dead with no possibility of a couple living happily together, is there any advantage to us in saying to that couple that, despite their marriage being dead, we will preserve the fallacy that it still exists.  Is there any point in saying that we will irrevocably tie that couple into what is a marriage in name <Col N="1501" /> only?  The Minister for Defence said that the main reason given for change by those who propose divorce is that the existence of new relationships demand that those relationships be given legitimacy.  He talked about divorce providing for what he described as a conditional contract. The problem with that approach is that, if one wants to talk about marriage in a legalistic term as purely being a contract, one could ask: if the contract is frustrated to the degree that it ceases to operate, is there any purpose in tying people into it? A more eloquent and sensible response is that marriage is not about a contract; it is about a relationship.  It is the relationship aspect of marriage that is all important.</P>
    <P>When we talk about marriages being viable, about education for marriage, we talk about people being sufficiently educated and having a degree of understanding to be able to enter into a relationship that will work.  We do not talk about people being educated into understanding how to enter into some form of legal contract.</P>
    <P>A very old debating mechanism is that one throws up a contention and then one knocks it down without looking at the real reason why those who propose change, want it.  The first reason why there should be divorce is that there is a need to extend legal recognition to the factual death of marriages.  Let nobody pretend in Ireland that we have a society where all marriages are functioning.  We have a society in which we have &mdash; statistics vary on this &mdash; thousands and thousands of adults who are no longer living with their spouses and never again will live with them, but the law says that they are still married to each other.  I fail to see in what way society is advanced by retaining that type of inaccurate and dishonest view of a relationship that is dead.</P>
    <P>There is a need to uphold the dignity of individuals whose marriages have collapsed. Why tie in somebody and tell them that they are still married when in reality they have lived apart from their marital partner for more than 20 years? In what way does that enhance society or <Col N="1502" /> protect society against marital breakdown? The retaining in existence of marriages that are marriages in name only is effectively undermining the institution of marriage and bringing marriage into disrepute. When the law becomes irrelevent people have a unique ability to find ways to get around it that may not be legally acceptable but are socially recognised as valid.</P>
    <P>Today we have a whole series of alternative forms of remarriage for couples whose first marriage has collapsed.  We have thousands of people getting decrees of divorce outside the country &mdash; which are not recognised here &mdash; and then remarrying.  Those people return here with their second spouse.  In law they are still married to their first spouse but the social reality is that they are regarded as married to their second spouse.  For practical legal terms the second marriage is bigamous and they can be criminally prosecuted.  Of course, we have adopted an Irish solution to that problem and the law officers of the State bury their heads in the sand, fortunately, and do not proceed to prosecute.  We have people getting Church annulments and remarrying. We have the rather odd position where priests of the Roman Catholic Church are celebrating marriages of people who are still in law married to their first spouse and such marriages are bigamous and invalid.  We have people concluding deed polls where they change their names in order to go through what they regard as a form of marriage.  Other people do not adopt such an approach and simply co-habit with each other.  That is happening in Irish society where people have been parties to a first marriage which has collapsed.  Many of those people who enter into second relationships do not do so until many years after the collapse of their first marriage.  I do not see how preserving that legal position upholds the dignity of marriage.  It was suggested by Deputy Cooney that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence disagreed with the idea of painting the picture of people who are parties to broken marriages as being victims.  He asked how one could allege that the adulterous husband was a victim or how could we suggest it would accord with justice to extend the facility of remarriage to such persons.  He also asked how we could extend it to someone who has been guilty of cruelty.  He did not, however, ask the counter questions which are: &ldquo;What about the spouse of the husband who has committed adultery?  What about the battered wife who has been the victim of cruelty?&rdquo; Are we to say to that battered wife: &ldquo;Because we want to punish your husband for battering you, we are going to deprive you of the right to remarry and of the right to the happy prospect of a viable marriage with somebody who is not violent or who does not commit adultery behind your back&rdquo;. They are the true victims of the current law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What advantage is there to Irish society to tell a 27 year old battered wife left with three children and managing on her own that, because she made a mistake in marrying a particular man, for the rest of her life she will be prevented from remarrying? What purpose is there in saying to the deserted husband left to care for three or four children that because his wife has run off with another man he is going to be prevented from remarrying?  I fail to see society's interest in saying that to anybody.  Whereas one may not wish to support the behaviour of the spouse who batters or who commits adultery, in common humanity what about doing something for the real victim of that behaviour?  I am afraid that the concept of marriage of my ministerial colleague <Col N="1504" /> is one of a constitutional sentence of life imprisonment handed down to punish those whose marriages fail.  Marriage should not be seen like that.  It is difficult to reconcile a desire to uphold the dignity of the family with the concept that marriage is a form of constitutional sentence of life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that if we introduce divorce into this country it will result in a greater degree of marriage breakdown than at present.  Any research done on that aspect indicates quite the contrary, despite the popular myth that some persist in articulating.  Marriage breakdown is not caused by the availability of divorce; it is caused by a complex series of matters that relate to the structure of individual societies, their cultural and economic backgrounds and their general concept of personal relationships.  It has been noted by other speakers in this debate, but is worth repeating, that divorce has been available in Northern Ireland since 1939.  Yet there the rate of marriage breakdown is put at 6 per cent which, by a strange coincidence, happens to be the current rate of marriage breakdown in the Republic in so far as one can unravel the statistics.  On the logic that divorce creates marriage breakdown, there should be a higher rate of breakdown in the North of Ireland than there is in the South, but that statistically is not the case.  On this issue it is worth quoting Dr. Jack Dominian who has been referred to previously.  In the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown minutes of evidence, page 47, the question was put to Dr. Dominian whether divorce would give rise to additional marital breakdown.  His answer was as follows:</P>
    <P>I have to say that if this room was filled by the Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland and they were pushing me very hard about divorce, I would have to say very clearly that their fear that civil divorce will make marital breakdown worse or enhance it or facilitate it &mdash; my answer would have to be: no, it will make very little difference&rdquo;.  But in justice I think a society needs civil divorce and that the real concern of <Col N="1505" /> the Church and the community should be to work at understanding prevention. We have done very little in that area in the whole of western society.</P>
    <P>We have done very little in that area in this State since its foundation.  Dr. Dominian is not merely a well known expert in the area of marriage and marital breakdown, but a well respected Roman Catholic theologian who has written extensively about marriage and the problems of marriage.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of a referendum, I believe that one should be held, primarily because domestically the extent of the problem of marital breakdown within this State demands that we face up to that problem.  I believe it demands that we extend the possibility of remarriage to those whose marriages have collapsed and who wish to remarry.  I believe that we should also extend human right and dignity to those whose marriages have collapsed and who have no wish to remarry, through a law which recognises the fact that their marriage is dead.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy that in the submissions received by the Committee on Marriage Breakdown, the principal minority churches within this State sought to have the prohibition on divorce removed from the Constitution.  In the context of our seeking, within the Republic of Ireland, to play a role in protecting the rights of the minority within Northern Ireland, we lose a great deal of credibility if we are unprepared within this State to protect the rights of the minority that live in this State.  We cannot operate a dual standard, saying to those in the North that they must be aware of, have regard to and be sympathetic to the rights of the minority within the Six Counties of this island whilst we ignore and pay no regard to the rights of the minority within the Twenty-six Counties as articulated by their Church representatives before the committee.</P>
    <P>I find it distressing that some members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy do not deal with this issue in a more sympathetic, understanding and tolerant way than appears to be exampled by the occasional <Col N="1506" /> theological Exocets which emerge from Limerick and Drumcondra.  Within the oral hearings that took place at the Forum, the hierarchy were clearly articulating a need to respect the rights of minorities and clearly saying that they did not require this State to implement the theology of one particular Church.  It is unfortunate, when we talk about the specifics of this issue, that the message coming across is that it is only the theology of one Church to which the Members of this House should pay regard.  It is ironic and something that nobody in this debate has yet come to terms with, or even referred to, that the current constitutional ban on divorce does not even reflect the theology of the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>To those members on all sides who spoke on divorce and opposed a change in the Constitution and to those members of the majority church on this island who oppose such a change, as a mere legislator in this House I would ask a number of questions.</P>
    <P>How do they suggest that I, as a Member of this House and a legislator, should deal with or cope with the laws of the Roman Catholic Church in so far as the Church itself permits divorce and dissolution?  How should I deal with the fact that in Canons 1141-1150 in the new code of Canon Law entitled &ldquo;The Separation of the Spouses,&rdquo; article 1 entitled &ldquo;The Dissolution of the Bond&rdquo;, there is specific provision within the Church for divorce?  How should I, as a legislator, deal with the fact that within this country there are decrees of divorce granted by the Church in respect of marriages that are regarded by our State laws as irrevocable and binding until death?  To those who oppose the provision of civil divorce, how should I cope with that?  To those within the Church which represents the majority on this island who oppose the provision of civil divorce, how as a legislator should I deal with the fact that there are in the region of 100 decrees of annulment being granted by the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunals each year, the vast majority of such decrees being granted in respect of marriages that our <Col N="1507" /> laws regard as irrevocable and indissoluble? What should I do when those annulled marriages result in one or other of the parties to the annulled marriage being remarried in Church?  Should we recognise the second marriage?  Should we provide for divorce?</P>
    <P>Even the representatives of the Marriage Tribunal in Drumcondra, in a very articulate and informative contribution to the working of the marital committee, acknowledged in their oral hearing that the State law could not extend nullity in a way that would be compatible with recognising the nullity jurisdiction of the Church.  What are we to do with that anomaly?  Very few people who have contributed to the debate have directed their minds to the fact that our State laws are far stricter than the laws of the Church.</P>
    <P>Minds have not been directed to the fact that we should have a different concept of a minority than one basically of a theological or sectarian identity.  When we talk in this House and on this island about minorities we tend to presume minorities of individuals who come under particular religious flags.  One of the realities in this whole area is that the vast majority of people within the Republic who seek divorce are not members of the Church of Ireland or the Presbyterian, Methodist, Jewish or Moslem faiths.  The vast majority are members of the Roman Catholic Church.  The vast majority of couples whose marriages have collapsed are members of the Roman Catholic Church.  The minority of 60,000 or 70,000 adults a sizeable group of individuals whose marriages have collapsed, are members of the majority Church, yet they all want divorce.  We have a duty to look to the position of that minority as much as we have a duty to look at the position of any theologically identifiable minority.</P>
    <P>Some people have referred to the fact that the number of people whose marriages have collapsed represents only about 6 per cent of the total married population and they suggest that in a sense perhaps we should sacrifice that 6 per cent for the greater good, because <Col N="1508" /> they see divorce as a threat.  In this House in 1972 we passed a Bill to give validity to marriages celebrated in Lourdes, primarily motivated by the fact that it was the custom of certain Members of this House to take planeloads of people from their constituencies to Lourdes to be married. This was during the late sixties and early seventies.  They all came back to Ireland and discovered that their marriages were not valid and they were all free to marry somebody else if they really wished to do so.  If this House took seriously the plight of about 100 individuals, politicians and non-politicians, to enact legislation retrospectively to recognise invalid Lourdes marriages, do we not have a greater duty to recognise the plight of the 70,000 people whose marriages have collapsed within this State?</P>
    <P>I believe a referendum should be held. I believe it will succeed if politicians say in public what they say in private.  I will not arrogate to myself the right to speak on behalf of any other Member of this House, but I believe that a majority of politicians in this House not only recognise that divorce is necessary to deal with a major social problem but recognise that it is inevitable.  I am slow to take it upon myself to speak on behalf of any colleague but I would not agree with the assessment of the Minister for Defence that the majority of the Fine Gael Party would agree with his view and oppose the enactment of divorce legislation.  I will merely say that I do not believe his view would accurately reflect the views held by a majority within the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party or, I suspect, accurately reflect the views of the majority of the Fianna Fáil Deputies if they were given the full freedom to say publicly what they privately say and think.  If we have a referendum I hope that no political party in this House will seek to use the victims of marital breakdown as a weapon to gain some perceived political advantage over any other party.  I would hope for a true referendum in which everybody across the political divide could publicly and openly express their views.  At the end of the day I believe the <Col N="1509" /> Irish people will see the essential need for reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the chairman, members and staff of this committee on the very difficult task which they undertook.  I commend the chairman in particular for the patience which he displayed in the course of the many deliberations which were necessary, especially where they involved sensitive and fairly divisive issues.  He is to be congratulated for seeing this task through on behalf of the House.</P>
      <P>The committee was embarrassed by a very slow start.  The committee was set up on 7 July 1983 and it was ordered that the report of the joint committee be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a period of one year.  The report of the proceedings of the committee on 26 October 1983 indicates that at that stage the committee were still seeking basic staff, a clerk and a typist, somebody to get things under way.  It was very poor form on the part of the Government to set up a committee and order a report within a specific time without providing the necessary staff.  If in future committees are to undertake such important work within a limited time scale the staff should be available at the outset.</P>
      <P>There is correspondence on this subject dating back to 26 October 1983, four months after the committee were set up with a 12 month time scale.  The committee were pleading then with the Minister for the Public Service for the provision of staff and it went on for some time after that.  It was almost six months after that before the minimal staff were supplied to the committee.  Subsequently, comments were made about the time the committee took to do their work but it is grossly unfair to set up such a committee and not to supply adequate staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect embarrassing to the committee was that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste made statements after the setting up of the committee which tended to pre-empt their work.  The Taoiseach said in a television interview on 23 October 1983 that he had already decided <Col N="1510" /> to hold a referendum to remove the ban on divorce and he made other statements along that line.  This was embarrassing for the committee because members considered that there was not much point in trying to tease out the problems if the Taoiseach had already decided on the issue and that the relevance of the committee's work was not appreciated by the Government.</P>
    <P>We want a firm commitment from the Government to implement the positive, agreed recommendations in the report and the resources provided to implement those recommendations.  The smoke-screen should be blown away.  The Government are dishonest in their handling of the report which is the most important and by far the most comprehensive study of marriage and the family to come before the House in almost 20 years.  It goes into many of the problems and questions which Members of the House have been discussing in considerable detail.  The report puts forward many agreed solutions to current difficulties in marriage and also deals with the divisive question of divorce.</P>
    <P>However, the report stops short of the task of framing a possible referendum or even alternative referenda for consideration by the Oireachtas as they considered that they had neither the expertise nor the time to draft such proposals. This was seen as a task for the Government with their legal back-up and constitutional expertise.  It will also involve grave political policy decisions in the area of constitutional law.  This is the point to which the committee brought the work and the next step is in the hands of the Government, and has been for some time.  They must now prepare the wording for the referendum which they are recommending and must make clear when proposing any amendment to Article 41 the nature and extent of the constitutional amendment which they propose, the degree of protection for the family and the form of divorce legislation which the Government have in mind following a referendum.  The ball is clearly in the Government's court.</P>
    <P>Many people may favour a referendum <Col N="1511" /> but they are entitled to know what is proposed in such a referendum.  The Taoiseach and some Members of the Government repeatedly say they want a referendum on divorce and, if that is so Fianna Fail will not oppose it, but we reserve our position on the wording until we see what it is.  The Government are now trying to sell to the media and the people an unscripted bill of goods and the old saying <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash; let the buyer beware &mdash; applies to this package. We will not buy a pig in a poke; we want to see the full and exact implications of the proposals.  Public relations hand outs from the Taoiseach and his Ministers have been simplistic and misleading. They appear to be designed to develop a climate of opinion which favours divorce at any cost and without question.</P>
    <P>This is not acceptable because eight months have elapsed since the report was published and the Government are still talking as if the committee had never reported.  We are getting the same publicity handouts which we got before the committee undertook their task and during the period when they were sitting. This was scandalous but that is how the Government do their business and the House must accept it.  It was fair enough in the initial stages to talk in general terms, but they must now set out clearly and specifically what they are talking about.  They are not talking to fools. People want to know what is involved before they make a decision.</P>
    <P>The Government must know that any referendum which paves the way for the introduction of divorce involves not just the removal of the constitutional ban but the removal of some of the other fundamental protections for the family enshrined in the Constitution.  At present there is clear constitutional protection for the institution of marriage and the family based on marriage.  The Taoiseach must realise that, yet he issues statements which camouflage the position.  He must come clean and say what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>Article 41 establishes the family as <Col N="1512" /> being legally and constitutionally the fundamental unit of society.  It goes further in that it expressly describes the family as an institution derived from marriage and guarantees the family in its constitution and authority.  This article clearly and unambiguously represents a unique commitment to the family.  We chose this line in the past and in this country we have constitutional guarantees which do not exist anywhere else.  Perhaps in other countries these issues may be covered by legislation, but we have this unique commitment to the family which the Government cannot ignore.  The wisdom of the policy underlining Article 41 cannot be open to question.  It is there for the best of reasons and it has been seen to be valuable since its inception.  If the Government are making proposals which will alter the Constitution they must say how they will deal with it.  Do the Government intend to interfere with or dismantle the protection given in Article 41?  If so, they should come clean and put their cards on the table so that people will be in a position to make an objective assessment of any proposed changes.</P>
    <P>The Government should make clear their intentions in relation to Article 42 which guarantees and underwrites the role of parents and the family in the sphere of education.  The ball is now in the Government's court.  No one is preventing them from bringing forward an appropriate proposal to amend the Constitution and placing it before the people. If the Government brought forward an appropriate proposal Members of this House could discuss it in a sensible way.</P>
    <P>The time for generalisations has gone. The time for generalised phrases was before the work of this committee was undertaken.  The committee was composed of Members of both Houses who deliberated and noted the divisions and the various points of view.  They indicated the difficulties in relation to the Constitution and suggested that they be given appropriate consideration in any proposals subsequently brought forward. The Government have had that report for some time but still they are speaking <Col N="1513" /> as though the committee had not reported.  If the Government are genuine and honest in their approach to the matter they will put their proposals forward for discussion so that Members will be aware of the position.</P>
    <P>An outstanding feature of the report is that it contained so many proposals for which there was unanimous support and agreement.  That did not come about accidentally: it took a good deal of discussion and deliberation by those concerned.  If implemented, these agreed proposals would have a significant impact on the problem of marital breakdown and if the Government are genuinely concerned about the matter they should arrange to have those proposals implemented.  Did they not want the committee to come forward with those agreed proposals?  All they are talking about now is divorce. That is what they spoke about before the committee started their work despite the fact that the terms of reference of the committee were to consider the protection of marriage and of family life, to examine the problems that follow the breakdown of marriage and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The protection of marriage was fundamental and many of the agreed proposals provide for that protection.  If implemented they could prevent further cases of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>A question that arises immediately is why the Government are not going ahead with those excellent proposals.  The committee's report was published eight months ago.  The Government made a lot of noise about the urgency of getting a report and they put tremendous pressure on the committee.  First, they were given a time scale of 12 months but there was a lag of six months because the Government did not provide the resources in the first instance.  In my view that was scandalous.  Then, in the second six months they put pressure on the committee to issue a report.  They got the report containing positive proposals but they have done nothing in the intervening eight months.  I was a member of the committee and I am very disappointed the Government did not proceed in the <Col N="1514" /> meantime with the agreed proposals.  It was the wish of members of the committee that this should be done.  Deputy Shatter was also a member of the committee and he considered that the positive proposals should have been proceeded with without delay.  He suggested that a legislative task force was needed but I do not agree with that.  What is needed is for the Government to go ahead and to act.</P>
    <P>I accept that a certain amount of work has to be done to finalise matters into legislative form but the main work is done.  The task force was the committee and their work is completed.  Now it is a question of implementation.  Although members of the committee disagreed on various points, I am sure they are of the opinion that agreed elements should be implemented as quickly as possible. Many people came before the committee and suggested various remedies that would help their situation and they pointed out that if action were taken the rot could be stopped now.  Can the Government not help to stop the rot now by taking the actions recommended in the report and then proceed with consideration of matters on which there was not agreement?</P>
    <P>In considering how to prevent marital breakdown, the committee made specific recommendations.  They recommended the use of the basic educational system to prepare young people for marriage.  It has been shown elsewhere that this has had an impact on the rate of marriage breakdown.  The committee also recommended that the State should ensure that an effective and acceptable counselling service is available to couples preparing for marriage.  The committee considered that the State had a responsibility in this matter.  We know there are excellent counselling services operating largely on a voluntary basis that are starved of resources and money.  The way is clear but the resources are not being provided.  Much benefit could be obtained if those services were improved and extended to areas in which they do not exist at present.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this the report recommended an immediate increase in the <Col N="1515" /> minimum age for marriage to 18 years with limited stated exceptions.  Nobody will disagree with that.  The matter was debated and considered thoroughly.  The stated exceptions have been catered for. Members on both sides of the House are prepared to accept these and want measures taken immediately to deal with them.  Why are we not going ahead with them?</P>
    <P>The committee recognised that marital breakdowns occur, and they made valuable recommendations to improve and update existing legal remedies.  They suggested new measures which would alleviate the misery and hardship of those whose marriages are in difficulty.  Among their new proposals are the setting up of a mediation service to assist couples whose marriages have broken down and to resolve problems and disputes which inevitably arise.  We have seen through pilot schemes how valuable such a service can be.  Such a service is urgently required.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended the setting up of a new family courts structure which would deal with disputes that couples themselves cannot resolve, the adjudication to take place in an atmosphere which would reduce tensions and antagonisms to try to rescue marriages from final breakdowns.  We know that the whole environment, with which Deputy Shatter dealt in his own way from his experience, in which two antagonistic sides meet through their solicitors, is wrong and should be adjusted.  The other night we had the Courts Bill which provides for extra judges.  Here we are, eight months after the publication of this report, still talking about family courts but not making provision for them.  When speaking on the Courts Bill I said the Government should be making provision to cater for family courts attached to both the High Court and the Circuit Court. This is a matter of urgency, so why postpone it?  The Government come in with legislation to deal with crises.  There is a crisis in this area.  We know many of the solutions and we should set about them now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> My third point relates to the law on nullity and the reform procedures involved in obtaining a decree of nullity. The committee spent much time on this and found that the courts have gone ahead to clarify and to develop the law on this matter.  Legislation on nullity has fallen a long way behind the courts and the Church.  Consequently, there is considerable confusion.</P>
    <P>We have had many commissions and reports of studies over the years and the action that needs to be taken can be seen clearly if the will were there to take them. Deputies on both sides are anxious to get ahead with these things.  Why are we not doing them?  Why have we not got proposals before us?  Separation, barring orders and various other matters are all dealt with in detail in the report.  The committee suggest improvements.  The committee gave details of the day-to-day practice on family law in our courts and stated that it was abundantly clear, from many submissions made to them and the body of knowledge presented to them about experience elsewhere, that positive measures must be taken before divorce is considered.  The committee accepted that these supports and remedies must be available.</P>
    <P>The right time to take these steps is now.  Even though we had people with different points of view on the committee, even those who were strongly in favour of divorce &mdash; many Deputies who favour divorce have spoken here &mdash; recognised readily that various steps need to be taken in agreed areas in order to protect the family so that breakdowns would be reduced.  Experience in other countries has shown that these early remedies were not there when divorce was introduced.  Lack of such remedies led to breakdowns and in other countries when they provided such remedies the situation improved.  There is no disagreement here about the need for such remedies. Though we may have disagreements about questions like remarriage, there is no doubt that though a referendum might be introduced and passed, these measures are necessary first.</P>
    <P>There is agreement that the remedies <Col N="1517" /> I have been speaking of need to be taken in advance of any other steps, and therefore I do not understand Government thinking in this area.  They should be very anxious to go ahead with a ligislative programme to deal with the positive proposals in the report.  Why are they not introducing those?  The reason is base and hypocritical.  There is no immediate kudos in these constructive measures &mdash; the Government only pay lip service to them.  We only see headlines on divorce. This was borne out during the committee deliberations: media concentration was on our deliberations on divorce &mdash; the highly controversial question &mdash; but the other areas did not command the same media respect, though they relate to the hardship and sufferings that had been brought to our attention in the committee. Therefore, there is an onus on the Government to go ahead with the provision of these remedies immediately. They would have our wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that the Government will not brush those positive measures aside in their headlong rush for headlines.  It is our duty to ensure that the constitutional status of the family will not be diminished. The Taoiseach has said he wants divorce.  He must tell us how proposals to achieve that objective will affect the constitutional position of more than 600,000 Irish families, or 1.2 million people.  There is a difference of opinion between the Central Statistics Office and the Divorce Action Group and I will not get into that.  The Divorce Action Group speak of 70,000 people or 35,000 families and the Central Statistics Office put the figure at fewer.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on the Taoiseach to say how his proposals will affect the marriage breakdown problem.  He cannot go on ranting and raving in public relations statements without saying how his proposals will alter the situation.  He is being simplistic without being honest.  We have had our deliberations and we want to know exactly what the Taoiseach is talking about.  We are not all fools here, <Col N="1518" /> though the Taoiseach treats us as if we are.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the report Members of the House have teased out most of the elements involved.  They understand the pros and cons, though they may have different views on the various aspects.  The question now is to determine what kind of solutions should be proposed.  There is agreement on many of the changes that should be made. The area about which there is likely to be most disagreement and division is that area which involves the protection of the family as provided for in the Constitution. It is not sufficient for the Taoiseach to continue to make bland statements.  He must say what his proposals are.  He must reveal whether he intends to substitute legislative protection only for the present constitutional guarantees to the family because this is one of the issues involved.  If this is what he has in mind, he should tell us how that legislative protection is to be substituted before he causes further confusion among the people.  If there is to be a referendum it will be essential that the nature and extent of the amendment proposed is understood clearly by the people.  In his recent bland announcements the Taoiseach has not been helping to create a climate of understanding on this important issue.</P>
    <P>The clear and informed choice of the people must be allowed to prevail. Members of the Oireachtas, including the Taoiseach, should assist rather than hinder this process and we should make it clear that essentially this is a social question.  Deputy Shatter reminds us that the issue is not all about legalities, that there is a social side to it.  I would turn that around and say that essentially the question is a social one, that we should approach it as such as that we should not be allowed drift away from those basic social considerations.  Some will say that the question is a religious one, a legal or some other kind of question.  All these red herrings will be brought into the debate but they will not change the fact that the basic question is a social one. Members may say, for instance, that <Col N="1519" /> while they are Catholics they will legislate as Members of the Oireachtas but they need not say that because all they have to do is to say that this is a social question and that we must consider what the social implications would be for the future. There will be people of differing religious views who will put forward those views, as is their right; but the question for us as legislators relates to the social implications of any proposals that might emanate in this area.</P>
    <P>The question is one about the kind of society that people wish for for the future.  The issues involved and their potential influence on future generations of Irish men and women are much too important to be trivialised by shallow thinking and political posturing.  The people deserve better than that.  It is all too easy for Members to establish a political posturing but I am anxious that the debate be realistic.</P>
    <P>We have had the phase whereby people made offhand proposals even before the committee met and very often these proposals were made in the absence of much knowledge of the detail of what was involved.  We have now had the benefit of the committee's deliberations and their report so that we have that very wide reaching support which covers a very complex area.  Members of the House are in a position to consider the issues as they really are and in that way to reduce to a very small number the areas of difference. There are areas where there is instant agreement, where there is well developed and well thought out agreement, where we have agreed on the steps that should be taken.  These agreed measures would receive support on all sides of the House and would have a very immediate influence in the area of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government, without further committees or task forces, to proceed immediately with those measures.  A certain amount of work on the drafting side of the programme can be begun.  The agreement that has been reached was reached with the co-operation of Members from all <Col N="1520" /> sides of this House and from the Seanad. Therefore, the path is clear in that respect, but there remains the underlying elements of the social question that has to be faced in relation to the legal remedies. This area has been teased out to the extent to which the committee consider themselves competent without taking on further consultants and taking over the job of the Government in relation to the drafting of referenda or of alternative referenda.  That would be a specialised task but it is one that should be tackled now if the Government intend pushing ahead with a referendum.  They must put their cards on the table now so that we will become aware of the kind of referendum they have in mind.</P>
    <P>The people are much more developed in this area than the Government might seem to give them credit for.  This is due partly to the media coverage of various events and issues and due also in some part to the various discussion programmes. I should like the media to recognise the position at this stage and to try to convey to the people what the position is.  The time of the throwing out of the catch cry has passed.  For some years the catchcry has been a good political ploy.  Certain people have been getting a lot of media coverage from that sort of behaviour, but we are now concerned with the serious business with which the Government are entrusted.  Therefore, the Government must take on the task and not be leading the media or anyone else astray.  On 23 October 1983, while the committee were in session, the Taoiseach said on television that he had decided to hold a referendum on the matter of removing the ban on divorce. That tallies with what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The Government must know that that is not all that is involved, that it is not just a question of removing the ban, that if the ban is removed the protections in the Constitution for the family are so strong that the Taoiseach could not go ahead with his proposals in relation to divorce.  The people must be allowed see both sides of the coin and then make up their minds.  Our position is that we will not oppose the holding of a referendum <Col N="1521" /> but we must reserve our position in relation to the wording until we have examined whatever wording the Taoiseach is talking about.  So far there is no indication from him as to what that wording might be.  At this stage he should either put up or shut up, in other words, put forward the wording or stop talking as if we were all fools and did not understand what is involved.  Following the report and the discussions on this subject, increasing numbers of people are coming to realise exactly what is involved and, if the facts are put clearly before them, I have no hesitation in saying that the people will make the decision they want and that is what Members of this House should be seeking.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods made much play of saying that the ball is in the Government's court following the committee's report.  He also acknowledged that, while much was agreed unanimously by the committee, some items were not agreed.  He is being less than honest to go through this report and at no stage to touch on the vital issues that were not agreed by the committee.</P>
      <P>The committee assembled the arguments for and against proposed changes in divorce legislation but at no stage did Deputy Woods comment on them.  It is unfortunate that the Fianna Fáil attitude to this issue is to sit on the fence and try to gain political capital out of the uncomfortable position the Government find themselves in.  It is clear that the Government parties are not entirely agreed on the substantive issue.  If we are to make any progress in this House, as being a proper institution able to consider social changes, then parties in Opposition must be willing to face up to their responsibilities to discuss the issues for and against social change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that our attitude to marriage has changed dramatically over the past number of years. I suppose there are many reasons behind this.  No doubt women entering marriage have different expectations than they had years ago as regards career and so on, and men too have a different attitude to <Col N="1522" /> marriage.  We have seen an increase in the use of contraceptives; there are more working wives; sex before marriage is much more common; we have seen stable relationships outside marriage develop; and it has become acceptable in many areas to have children outside wedlock. As a result of all these changes there is no doubt that people make less effort to make marriages work than they did before and there is a movement towards the break up of marriage either with or without a legal way out that we did not see here some time ago.</P>
    <P>In some of these areas it is not of great relevance what this House decides about marriage law.  The growing preparedness of people to live together rather than get married will continue regardless of what this House says.  We have to face up to the fact that there are dramatic changes in social attitudes regardless of the marriage laws.  However, we have to face up to the great weakness that exists in the way the State deals with marriage and with marriage breakdown.  The report is very emphatic in its criticism of our existing attempts to support marriage and to deal with marriage breakdown and the fact that we permit people to enter into marriage far too young and ill-prepared.  We know from studies of marriage breakdown that breakdown is closely associated with young people entering marriage or shot gun marriages and the committee have recognised the failure of our State institutions to provide any remedy for this.</P>
    <P>They also detailed the fact that we do not have a mediation service to help people who are separating to make arrangements for custody, access, finance and property in a forum that does not lead to difficulty and bitterness.  It would be very helpful if we had a mediation service that would be supportive of people who are faced with breakdown and who would be very conscious of the children's needs as well as the needs of the two partners.  In many separations the partners are probably preoccupied with their own problems and overlook the needs of the children.  We have failed <Col N="1523" /> again in this area by not having a mediation service.</P>
    <P>The committee are highly critical of the fact that the only legal remedy we have in this State is based on judicial separation and that requires the establishment in court of adultery, cruelty or unnatural practices.  There is no doubt that such a situation must be acutely painful for people faced with marriage breakdown. Again the State have failed to provide proper support services in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee point to the fact that our courts deal with family cases squeezed between criminal or civil cases.  There is no specialised court dealing with family matters with judges specially chosen and trained, with support services and a sympathetic environment for families in what must be an acutely traumatic situation. These and other related issues about maintenance are a very important criticism from this committee of the way in which the State deal with the issue of marriage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods rightly said there is a great deal in the committee's unanimous recommendations on these issues that would give proper support before and during marriage, and, if necessary, after the marriage breakdown.  The committee have succeeded in putting forward a great deal of value as to how the State should support marriage and deal with breakdown without touching what is the raw nerve of divorce.  Clearly this report has isolated the issue of remarriage, whether by nullity or divorce legislation from the broader issue of dealing with breakdown. It has detailed proposals on the change in judicial separations founded not on cruelty or adultery but on irretrievable and established breakdown.  In that way, the committee have isolated for us as legislators the question of remarriage from the question of breakdown.  Often people are too quick to associate the two and not to see that the State has gone a long way towards recognising breakdown, even though it has not been willing to recognise the possibility of remarriage.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat curious that the <Col N="1524" /> opponents of divorce favour relaxation of the grounds for nullity.  It is somewhat ironic that that is the position at present.</P>

      <P>It is very curious that the people opposing divorce are advocating a relaxation of the grounds for nullity. That illustrates that the main opposition to divorce legislation is not fear of its effects on children because the effects of nullity where there are children would be the same.  It is somewhat dishonest for people to argue that the worry about divorce is centred on the effect on children. In the case of nullity the children would go through the same trauma.  It also illustrates that the fundamental objection to divorce legislation is not an objection to people having a second chance because nullity would also give people a second chance.  We must recognise that the damage to children is the fact of breakdown, and that neither divorce, separation agreements nor nullity orders are the remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key objection to divorce is its possible effect on other marriages.  Another objection is its moral repugnance to Catholics.  Those objections deserve careful consideration by the Oireachtas. It is certainly true that marriages are fortified by hard times and if divorce diluted the willingness of people to try to make a marriage work through the difficult times it would be a very unfortunate outcome. However, it would be wrong to insist on the misery of some people caught in irretrievably broken down marriages in order to encourage others.  We can find another way to make sure that people going through hard times in their marriages do not opt for divorce as the <Col N="1525" /> easy answer.  The committee referring to the type of divorce legislation required are quite clear that divorce would be a long, onerous path and not something for which a couple would quickly opt at the first encounter with stormy waters.  The committee in dealing with the type of divorce legislation needed quite clearly says that it should not be divorce on demand, that there should be financial protection for the dependent spouse and children which means a heavy financial burden on the earning spouse, and that it should be based on the established breakdown of a marriage and only after a judicial separation.  The committee talked about four or five years of established breakdown before divorce could be considered and remarriage possible. Divorce will not be something that a couple would contemplate as a quick solution rather than facing difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that people advocating a change in the legislation are rejecting the fundamental nature of the family.  We can accept the fundamental nature of the family and recognise the need for a dissolution of marriage in special circumstances.  It is important to realise that as a legislature we have not shrunk from regulating separation.  This committee go further than ever before in relaxing the terms under which separation can be granted.  We have not shrunk from regulating maintenance where marriages have broken down, from family home protection or from barring orders. If we have not shrunk from these items which could be said to recognise marriage breakdown, we will not shrink from the possibility of dissolving marriage in irretrievable circumstances.  It would not undermine the fundamental nature of marriage to do that any more than do the existing provisions for separation.</P>
    <P>The other line of argument by those who oppose a change in the legislation is that we could quickly proceed to divorce on demand.  This betrays a belief that society has a very shallow commitment to the family and suggests that our Christian values are so fragile that they must buttressed by blind legislation prohibiting <Col N="1526" /> dissolution of marriages in all circumstances so that we will not rush headlong for divorce on demand.  I have more confidence in the respect and commitment of people to marriage than to expect that they would rush headlong to divorce on demand.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that it is not essential, as Deputy Michael O'Leary's proposed legislation made clear, that a limited form of divorce would leave the legislature free to relax its restrictions on divorce without coming back to the people.  If the people do not trust the Legislature, and it is unfortunate if that is the case, we can introduce the sort of constitutional amendment envisaged by Deputy Michael O'Leary, as an alternative.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise why the Oireachtas put consideration of the issue of divorce into the much wider context of protection of marriage and strengthening the family as well as simply considering marriage breakdown.  The concern of the Oireachtas in all of this is to try to create a better environment for marriage. I believe the Church would be wrong to concentrate on a last ditch resistance to relaxation of the law on divorce.  The Christian message was never one of prohibitions. It was the much more difficult message of making positive efforts to improve society.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that, when He was on earth, Jesus savaged the Pharisees who saw morality in very rigid, legalistic terms.  He was never content with halfhearted morality.  He preached forgiveness and not punishment.  He taught compassion for people who were caught in difficulties and he told us that God is the only judge, not man.  While Christians do frown on divorce, it would be very disappointing and very wrong of them to seek to enshrine Christian morality into a legal straitjacket.  It would seriously undersell Christian marriage to try to enshrine Catholic teaching on moral behaviour into the civil law where it would be the State's courts and judges who would be deliberating on moral issues.  It would be flying in the face of <Col N="1527" /> the message that Christianity should be giving to us.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of what the Oireachtas is trying to do in this report is to create a better environment for marriage.  It would be sad if this degenerated into a Church-State conflict.  There is a common, shared belief between Members of the Oireachtas and the various Christian Churches that we should be seeking a better environment for marriage. There are circumstances in which that better environment can be created also by a provision for dissolution of marriages where they have broken down.</P>
    <P>The contribution by the Irish Theological Commission to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown reiterated what was stated at the proceedings of the New Ireland Forum, that they do not see it as the role of the Oireachtas to enshrine in the law of the State the principles peculiar to the Catholic faith.  It is welcome that we have got that clear statement once again from the Catholic Church.  As legislators we must bear in mind the cogent fears of those who oppose divorce, but we must also respect that what we are trying to achieve is the maximum degree of personal freedom consistent with public good.  Even back in 1967 the Oireachtas committee, reporting on the constitutional ban on divorce at paragraph 126, recognised that this ban was in need of change.  I quote from their report where they said:</P>
    <P>It can be argued, therefore, that the existing Constitutional provision is coercive in relation to all persons, Catholic and non-Catholic, whose religious rules do not absolutely prohibit divorce in all circumstances.  It is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could, in our view, be regarded as being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberty as declared by the Vatican Council and elsewhere... </P>
    <P>Even back in 1967 a unanimous decision of a Dail committee recognised that our present situation is not defensible and that we should be changing it. <Col N="1528" /> But much has changed since then that the Oireachtas must also recognise.  We must recognise that there are many practices that the Legislature must adapt to, or else the law will be thrown into increasing disrespect.  We must recognise that there are very many non-marriage relationships in the State at present, that these are totally unprotected, that people enter into them quite flippantly and are unprotected within them.  We must recognise that the possibility of a second chance, where people have taken that up, has not created new relationships that are invariably bound to fail, that they have been successful and have been able to provide the people engaging in them with happiness without damaging the pursuit of happiness by others.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the properly regulated breakdown of marriage, where it has irretrievably broken down, is better than misery inflicted on those who are caught in a marriage that does not work. It is basically a dishonest approach to protecting and supporting marriage to proceed as if the only way in which marriage can be strengthened is by locking the door and throwing away the key.  That is a very negative approach.  Equally, as the 1967 report made clear, we must recognise the freedom of other religious views than the Catholic one.</P>
    <P>For those reasons we need to change the present constitutional ban on divorce and introduce some positive legislative change.  The 1967 committee offered a solution of sorts to this problem.  They suggested that the Constitution should permit divorce to people who married into a Church that permitted divorce but deny divorce to people who married into a Church that denied divorce.  I do not believe that to be a satisfactory solution. Certainly it deals with the rights of minority Churches and with constitutional difficulties with nullity in the Catholic Church.  However, this very legalistic, contractual approach to the issue of marriage breakdown is trying to deal with breakdown before it occurs at all.  It is not tackling the problem that breakdown is something that occurs after marriage, perhaps a long time after marriage.  Such <Col N="1529" /> a change, as was envisaged by the 1967 committee on the Constitution, would make it illegal for lapsed Catholics to remarry and uphold the lack of civil legal protection for new alliances that might be created by such people.  Therefore, I do not believe it is meeting the present difficulties we face with marriage breakdown, whatever about the situation that prevailed in 1967.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael O'Leary offered a very constructive idea to the House when he proposed a limited referendum.  It is very much worthy of study.  In my view there is nothing wrong in recognising the concern of the people about excessive drift once legislation is introduced.  Some people seemed to take the view that this is a fundamentally wrong approach to the way the Oireachtas should operate.  I would not agree with that.  While believing that the Oireachtas would behave very responsibly with any power given to them by the people, it is quite acceptable to give people the extra guarantee they may require, that any further change in the provisions for divorce would have to go to them for their approval before it would occur.</P>
    <P>This type of amendment would deal with the very cogent objections by people who are now opposing divorce, that is, that it would become a reason people would enter flippanty into marriage.  The present proposals are not ones that would allow or encourage people flippantly to enter into marriage because divorce would be available only after four or five years separation.  Therefore perhaps the most satisfactory way to approach this issue would be to go along with Deputy O'Leary's approach to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not believe that this issue can be dealt with by Private Members' Bills solely.  We cannot go to the people asking for authorisation to legislate on the basis of a free voting Government and an abstaining Opposition.  We can go to the people and ask for a change in the present prohibition on divorce only if there is some proposal for a change in the substantive law that has a reasonable prospect of success in the Oireachtas. That means that some members of <Col N="1530" /> Fianna Fáil must be willing to come off the fence and face up to this issue which in private they say is in need of change. They must indicate the sort of legislation they would be willing to support if a change was made.  There is no point in going to the people with substantive proposals when there can be no confidence in them being approved by the Oireachtas.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil not to treat this in the very partisan way they have today by offering a blanket abstentionist approach to the issue; rather they should face up to the issue and say where they would stand on substantive change in the legislation should the people be agreeable to amend the Constitution.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I thank the chairman and members of the committee for submitting this report on marriage breakdown.  I listened with great interest to many Deputies who have spoken here, and I must agree with Deputy Glenn that the terms of reference of the committee were to consider the protection of marriage and family life. Most of the people who spoke here spoke about divorce, and we all know that divorce is the death knell to a marriage. This is a very serious and complex problem. Marriage breakdown is always a human tragedy.  It is always a confession of failure, a death &mdash; not a true death because the partners live &mdash; it is a death sometimes worse than a true death because at the physical death of a spouse sorrow enhances the memory of those moments which those two people have been through together.  Bitterness follows the death of a marriage.  The breakdown of marriage brings in its wake the end of the home and the break up of the family.</P>

    <P>I want to consider how marriage breakdown affects individuals compared with those who are single or are average in their marriage relationship.  Those involved in marital breakdown have a higher mortality rate, a higher suicide rate and, seemingly, increased ill-health. Most people who have marriage problems seem to take more time off work than those who have not.  The children of <Col N="1531" /> a broken marriage are the ones who really suffer.  Surveys reveal that such children show symptoms of depression and repression and lack of responsibility, and develop negative reactions such as hostility, anger and self-loathing.  These defects endure and in later years delinquency and alcoholism are closely related to those experiences.  Marriages in the next generation face a higher risk of breakdown if the partners are from broken homes.</P>
    <P>How does marriage breakdown affect society?  The family are the natural, fundamental group in our society and are entitled to protection by society.  Marriage has a powerful influence on society and is the true measure of the greatness of a nation just as the dignity of man is the true measure of civilisation.  Our Constitution states in Article 41.3:</P>
    <P>1º The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>2º No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are about 600,000 married couples in the Republic. It is claimed that 70,000 spouses are affected by broken marriages.  That could be estimated as about 35,000 marriages, and we are told that this number is increasing. The percentage of marriage breakdown represents a level of human tragedy which is totally unacceptable in a caring society.  Marriage breakdown becomes a great social evil and unless a solution to the problem is found the situation will become much worse in ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>There are always ways in which the problem can be tackled in order to alleviate or prevent it.  Some of these ways demand a change of law but most of them demand a change of heart.  For the State there are a number of ways.  Annulment allows the partners to enter into another relationship since it declares that there was never a previous marriage in either law or fact.  The State as well as the <Col N="1532" /> Church grants annulments.  With separation neither partner is free to marry again.  However, it gives legal support and protection to those who cannot live together in harmony in marriage.  When the marriage relationship has broken down and one or both partners have entered a second relationship certain legal and social arrangements may be made to accommodate the situation. Divorce is one of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>Prevention is thought to be better than cure, and this is true with regard to marriage breakdown if Article 41 of the Constitution is implemented.  Most religions have a concept of marriage as sacred and special.  The Christian religion sees it as a calling or vocation and a Sacrament. This approach to marriage and the living out of the concept is the best guarantee against marriage breakdown.  The Roman Catholic bishops are described, and, indeed, have been so described here this afternoon by Deputy Shatter, as not caring in their approach to marriage breakdown and not appearing to understand the situation.  I have no doubt that that Catholic bishops and priests are very much aware of the hardships and misery brought about by marriage breakdown. The position of a couple who marry in the Roman Catholic Church is that marriage is a Sacrament.  The couple in marrying receive the Sacrament which was instituted by God and neither the Pope nor his bishops and priests can change the law of God.  In the Church down through the years there have been many laws which could be described as man-made and which have been changed by the Vatican Council, but the Vatican Council or any other council can never change the law of God.  Many people criticise the clergy, the Pope and the bishops in this regard.  Indeed, the Archbishop of Dublin came under much criticism from public representatives and the media but, thank God, he was strong enough to overcome that criticism and has been seen by Catholics in this great Archdiocese to be speaking the word of God.</P>
    <P>The State must support the concept of marriage as a life long commitment. Former Deputy Brendan Corish when <Col N="1533" /> Minister for Health and Social Welfare in 1973 said:</P>
    <P>We in Ireland esteem the family as a source of many social and personal values.  We believe the family to be the basic unit of society.  It is not enough however merely to state the value we place in the family as an institution. We must go beyond that statement and deliberately create policies and programmes which reflect the value in human terms.</P>
    <P>That statement contradicts the view of the Minister for Health who in the course of his speech said there was an urgent need for divorce.  The legal fact that divorce laws give to every person who marries the right to marry again under certain conditions changes the whole legal concept of the position of marriage. This law supports what is really a contractual relationship.  Marriage, which is a life long relationship, would be legally obsolete if there was divorce.</P>
    <P>The first divorce law in Great Britain was available to husbands only on the grounds of adultery but in 1923 the British Government introduced an Act under which wives could apply to courts for divorce but on adultery grounds only.  In 1937 an Act was introduced to include desertion, cruelty and insanity while in 1969 an Act included irretrievable breakdown as grounds for a divorce.  Applications for divorce by one partner against the wishes of another were allowed only after a period of separation.  In the United States they have what is called &ldquo;no fault divorce&rdquo;.  The prevailing opinion among lawyers and legislators is that a no fault divorce law is harmful and vindictive to those concerned and does not serve any useful purpose.  The international trend is towards a no fault divorce system.</P>
    <P>The number of divorces in Great Britain has increased since 1920.  In that year there were 2,953 divorces and that figure had increased to 4,784 by 1935.  In 1945, the figure had risen to 16,075 while by 1961 it had doubled to 31,900.  In 1972, the figure had increased to 110,700 while by 1981 it had gone up to 200,000.  In 1978, 33 per cent of all marriages in Great <Col N="1534" /> Britain were involved in divorce.  In the US the divorce rate in 1981 was one in every three marriages.  Divorce there doubled in the years between 1967 and 1977 while the normal European divorce rate was one in every five marriages in that year.</P>
    <P>When divorce was first introduced in Great Britain a period of five years had to elapse before either of the parties could bring a divorce case before the courts. Following pressure on the Government that period was reduced to two years.  At that time every divorce case before the courts was dealt with individually, but I understand that the period has since been reduced to one year and that divorce cases are not dealt with individually.  I understand that the clerk of the court reads out the names in each case and, when all the cases have been called the judge asks if there are any objections.  If there are no objections all the divorces, whether there are five or 500, are granted without any questions being asked.</P>
    <P>We may be asked if divorce is necessary in order to safeguard the rights of children for maintenance and succession and my response to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We may be asked if divorce is necessary to obtain a separation and my answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The question may be asked if divorce is not needed in order to prevent the situation that pertains with marriage breakdown and my response to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Divorce does not prevent a marriage from breaking down.  Divorce has made the concept of marriage as a life-long commitment legally obsolete from the point of view of the State.  This not only makes life-long marriage as a legal concept obsolete, but it also makes divorce obsolete from the point of view of the State.  The only other alternative would be for the State to revoke its divorce laws.  That would cause a major social revolution and amount to political suicide.  Once divorce is introduced into a country it is an irreversible process.</P>
    <P>The average length of marriage in the US is now about six years which means that many young children there are affected by divorce.  More than 100,000 children were in care in England in 1981.  In <Col N="1535" /> the US one out of every three children lives in a one-parent family.  Two out of every five children born in this decade in the US will live in a single parent home for at least part of their lives.  In the US in 1980, 18.2 million children under the age of 18 lived in homes headed by a single parent.  One out of every four children there had divorced parents.  In 1973 there were one million run-away children in the US and in that year 33 per cent of all marriages in Great Britain ended in divorce.</P>
    <P>Married women in Ireland at present have some rights to maintenance from their husbands.  There are enforcement procedures including attachment orders to earnings.  The effect of divorce would be to reduce these rights, limited as they are.  The experience in countries that have divorce laws based on marriage breakdown is that men are released from their former level of obligation and responsibility to maintain their wives. The problem is passed on to the taxpayer to maintain the family.  Many husbands in England try to avoid paying maintenance to their ex-wives.  In 1978, 2,439 men went to prison for refusing to pay maintenance to their ex-wives.</P>
    <P>In England in 1980, the number of children in care cost the State £2 million. In the same year 144,000 divorces cost the State £2 billion in the payment of social welfare, prison and housing costs. The cost for the upkeep of the wife in the home and the husband in prison had to be borne by the State.  In that year also one-parent families cost that State £800,000.  It is a fallacy to think that a divorce law affects only those who are in favour of it.  It makes marriage less stable and affects everybody.  It can be established that the causes of marriage breakdown can go back as far as the preparation for marriage.  The age of those who get married may have a bearing on this.  Another consideration is how mature couples are when they get married.</P>
    <P>In the past many marriages took place due to pressures being put on the couples and sometimes this contributed to the <Col N="1536" /> breakdown of those marriages.  There have been cases of girls being forced to marry because they have become pregnant. People have married to escape from homes where there was great strain on the parents' marriage, in some cases caused by the father beating up the mother and the family.  A couple planning to get married become engaged and decide to pool their savings in order to buy their home.  Their earnings qualify them for a mortgage and then they marry. They then have the problem of furnishing their homes and many avail of hire purchase to do this.  They have a plan for life which they think is very safe and well thought out.  They both plan for a number of years to continue working, but suddenly the bottom falls out of this plan. Without much notice, the husband's firm can go into liquidation and the real pressure and strain arise then.  We have all witnessed such cases among our own constituents. Let us take the example of Irish Shipping.  Many men after giving to that firm a lifetime of service of perhaps 40 years found themselves out of a job. They did not get much sympathy from the Government because all that the Government did was call in the liquidator. Deputies all over the country meet such cases every week of companies closing down suddenly and they call on the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost sympathy with those whose marriages have broken down and there are many such cases.  For the most part, we meet deserted wives who have gone through the trauma of marriage breakdown, including being beaten up by their husbands.  The majority of these women that I have met had no interest in becoming divorced.  They said that they would not want to go through that experience again.  Many would say that our laws are not sufficient to deal with the husband who beats up his wife and children, deserts and refuses to maintain them. Many leave their wives to live with women some of whom are deserted wives and are in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance.  They find this very profitable. Many of these women, as well as being <Col N="1537" /> in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance, are working in well paid jobs.  This Government and the Governments of the future should be dealing with such problems.</P>
    <P>This is a very important debate which gives people the opportunity to state their views on the question of marriage breakdown. I would deal with the matter in that context, rather than in the context of divorce.  A number of cases were brought to my attention recently of women who had married in England, whose marriages had broken down and who had obtained divorces there.  They decided to come to live in this country and found that they would have been better off financially if they were not divorced.  One such woman told me that she was now in receipt of £33 per week social welfare assistance to keep herself and her child, pay the rent and all the other bills.  If she had not been divorced she would have got double that amount as a deserted wife.  The Members of this House should be guided by the views of the people outside.  It would be very unfair for us to make any decision on divorce.  I would be quite happy, as would my colleague, Deputy Woods, if the Government were to decide to hold a referendum.  Our only reservations on that aspect would be as to the wording of the referendum.  Such wording would have to be examined in great detail by our leader, our parliamentary party and our front bench before we could agree to it.  One must ensure that the cure is not worse than the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may begin my remarks by doing as other Deputies have done, by paying tribute to the joint committee for the commitment they have shown in advancing a very delicate task.  As they did, I single out for mention the chairman of that committee who brought to that task all the skill and experience of a politician and, indeed, of a professional diplomat.  Having said those words of praise, I must express some disappointment at the manner in which the report is structured.  The <Col N="1538" /> debate which has taken place in this and in the other House indicates that there were two reports.  There was the report which dealt with the vexed question of divorce and a second report dealing with the wider questions of matrimonial law, remedies, procedures and so on.  The consideration of those issues by the Oireachtas would have been helped had we been given separate reports.  That would have allowed people to focus on the different issues that arise.  That was not to be and we had been presented with one omnibus report.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances a number of Members of the House have complained that the debate has become somewhat unbalanced, with undue concentration on the question of divorce.  They point out that the divorce issue represents perhaps one-fifth of the report in terms of space. I must say that those criticisms are a little disingenuous.  The committee were established because the question of divorce was seen as a difficult, sensitive one, as an issue capable of arousing deep passions in Irish society, as being potentially divisive.  It was considered that it should be the subject of a consensus approach.  Were that not the case, this committee would never have been established in the first place.  It is thus incumbent on all of us contributing to this debate to say, as requested by the Minister for Defence this morning, clearly and unequivocally where we stand on that issue.  While I share his view that people should be clear and unequivocal I hope that those who address this subject will do so without arrogance and in an undoctrinaire way, with charity and understanding for those who have reached a different conclusion.</P>
      <P>Before going on to give my own views on the subject, so muddied have the waters become at this stage that I am giving once again the view of the committee. This view is set out in chapter 7 at page 89 of their report.</P>
      <P>The view of the committee is set out in chapter 7.8.29 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered submissions and bearing in mind the factors set out <Col N="1539" /> above, the Committee is of the view that a referendum should be held; this was a decision of the majority of the Committee.  A minority of the Committee believes that this matter should be decided by the Oireachtas as a whole without a recommendation from the Committee.</P>
    <P>So as to ensure that no constitutional ambiguity results from any such referendum, the Committee feels that any amendment to be voted upon should be in a positive format. </P>
    <P>The starting point for any discussion on this area rests with the Constitution where in Article 41.3.1 the State undertakes a constitutional obligation to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack.  It is put more briefly in Article 41.3.2 which states that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage. Despite those commitments and solemn obligations, Irish marriages are breaking up in increasing numbers.  Other Deputies have already supported the committee in bemoaning the fact that reliable statistics are not available.  However, there are enough statistics to establish that it is a problem of serious dimension.  Of course it is a minority problem since the majority of Irish marriages are and, please God, will continue to be happy and fulfilling.  The very fact that it is a minority problem increases the obligation on us as legislators to take the issue seriously, to respond to those who suffer and who cannot seek or expect relief simply because of their numerical strength.</P>
    <P>If I have a criticism to make of the committee's report it is that the full trauma of marriage breakdown is absent from its pages.  Perhaps they took the view that there was no real need because every Member of this House is aware from his or her political activities just how frightening and awful the situation can be.  It was described with great compassion by Bishop Cassidy in his address to the New Ireland Forum on 9 February 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> It is worth making the point that marriages can and do break up in societies with a divorce jurisdiction and in societies without a divorce jurisdiction.  It is also the case that it is not the fact of marriage breakdown which causes passions to run high but the threat of divorce.  The fact of marriage breakdown is recognised in our legal system and a range of remedies are available which include decrees of nullity, decrees for the restitution of conjugal rights, injunctions, barring orders under the 1976 Act, to name but a few.  The existence of none of those remedies has given rise to the divisions which we associate with the divorce debate.  An examination of the minutes of evidence published by the committee shows a fair consensus on the way in which those remedies could be developed.</P>
    <P>A different situation arises when we come to divorce.  Divorce, we are told, is an attack on family life.  I cannot accept that.  I borrow the words of William Duncan in the publication by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic,</i> that the right to divorce is based on humanitarian grounds.  He says that the case for divorce is basically a humanitarian one, that divorce is needed to enable unhappily married people to free themselves from situations which have become intolerable and to give them, if they want it, a second chance.</P>
    <P>What is so special and unique about divorce that separates it from all the other remedies and gives rise to such vigorous opposition?  It is not the recognition that marriages break down.  That recognition is already provided in many aspects of our legal and administrative practice. Neither is it the fact that where marriages have foundered people are to live apart. Our legal system not only permits that but for many years has sometimes involved directing couples to live apart. The argument is believed to centre on the right to remarry.  How curious that distinction really is when one thinks about it.  Those who successfully petition for a decree of nullity are free to enter into a new union.  The jurists and the <Col N="1541" /> theologians will object to that and say that what is involved is a first marriage since the decree of nullity amounts to a statement that no earlier marriage has ever existed.  That kind of reasoning is straight out of <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> It is not a question of what the words mean but who is the boss around here.  The truth of the matter is that many of those who seek nullity decrees have lived together as husband and wife, often for many years, and reared families.  Differences have arisen and the parties seek a way out by reference back to the moment of marriage.</P>
    <P>The arguments against divorce are set out in the report at page 80.  First of all it is suggested that the introduction of a divorce jurisdiction would, as it were, open the flood gates and that the incidence of marital breakdown would be greatly increased.  I continue to be surprised at how anxious those advancing that argument are to draw parallels from societies which appear to have little in common with the Irish experience, while ignoring what has happened in those societies closest to us.  One thinks most particularly of Northern Ireland but also relevant must be the experience of countries like Italy and Greece which have strong traditions of religious adherence. The &ldquo;flood gate&rdquo; argument indicates an extraordinary lack of confidence in Irish society.  I refuse to withhold my confidence in that manner.  Those who make such arguments usually do so in the context of the suggestion that any restrictively drafted provision will inevitably be loosened in time.  Later in my remarks I will provide an answer to that suggestion. The nature of society rather than the legal code which governs it determines the level of breakdown.  The statistics made available in the report, for example, show an interesting contrast between the situation in England and Wales and Northern Ireland at a time when the divorce jurisdiction in these areas was identical.</P>
    <P>The other argument is that the introduction of divorce would fundamentally change the nature and perception of marriage by making it into a temporary or conditional as opposed to a permanent <Col N="1542" /> union between husband and wife.  The Minister for Defence put forward this view in his remarks earlier.  I fail to see what reality underlies that proposition. For any marriage to be valid a necessary prerequisite is that both parties have an intention to establish a permanent union in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer.  Were that intention of permanance to be absent, that of itself might provide grounds for a subsequent nullity petition.  The extent to which divorce would be available would impact on this area and that would obviously relate to the particular provisions which one would prescribe.  I have already indicated that I do not believe it to be beyond the wit of man to draft appropriately restrictive provisions.</P>
    <P>The third argument cited by the committee was that the introduction of divorce would reduce the protection at present given to the institution of marriage and the family under Article 41 of the Constitution.  That is the central argument and it is one to which I will return.  Suffice to say at this stage that far from having that effect, I believe the introduction of divorce could in some circumstances actually serve to support family life and to stabilise the very institutions of marriage.</P>
    <P>The fourth argument advanced is that the introduction of divorce would cause people having difficulties to work less hard at their marriage.  That is a fundamentally offensive argument, totally lacking in any sense of charity.  I do not believe that people in Ireland, overwhelmingly of Christian persuasion, who have entered into a relationship in good faith determined to make it work, will begin terminating their relationships now on grounds of convenience.  In contrast I find the suggestion that those whose marriages have broken up should be allowed suffer to encourage the others, as it were, or to discourage them, quite a bizzare notion.  It is worth thinking about that for a moment.</P>
    <P>Just which breakdowns are we talking about?  By definition we are not talking about the breakdown of anybody who might conceivably be applying for a <Col N="1543" /> divorce, their marriages are already over. Instead it is suggested that as long as they are condemned to perpetual misery that condemnation will have a salutary effect on others.  I refuse to believe that but, even if I did, the proposition is morally repugnant.</P>
    <P>The next argument cited by the committees &mdash; one that deserves great attention &mdash; is that children are the losers and it is the argument which has caused me to ponder long and hard.  Children do not suffer because of divorce but because of the absence of love in the family relationship. I was pleased to find support for that view from Monsignor Sheehy of the Dublin Regional Marriage Tribunal who, in answer to Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn on 21 June before the committee, said:</P>
    <P>We do not see the children very often but we do see the effects.  It is not the effect of a nullity procedure or divorce procedure, it is the effect of a marital breakdown.  That is the problem. Anyone who has worked in this field will know the appalling inhumanity of parents who can use their children once they get into conflict with one another. It is one of the awful effects of marital breakdown.  It is not the question of one procedure or another, it is the question of how one deals with it.  The problem is there before you get there and the only way to deal with the problem is to get in ahead of it.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that our attitude to marriage breakdown exacerbates the difficulties in regard to children.  Judgments that young children very often make about their parents are substantially based on how other people judge them.  The State's failure to allow for divorce for permanent and stable settlement of a broken marriage may somehow contribute to reinforcing the feeling that their parents are bad people who let them down.  They see that their parents appear to be judged by the community, Church and State and I am not sure that there can be any more effective way to undermine a family unit than by contributing to the <Col N="1544" /> destruction of the relationship of trust which binds parents and children.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday two books, <i>How It Feels When Parents Divorce</i> and <i>Marriage and Divorce</i>&mdash;<i>The Real Issue</i>, were reviewed by Charles Mollan.  In the course of the review he quoted the words of one 12 year old boy who said:</P>
    <P>If anything's bothered me, it's been my religion's attitude towards divorce. I'm Roman Catholic, and besides being very active in my Church &mdash; I'm an altar boy &mdash; I go to parochial school, where most of my teachers are nuns. ...After all, the Catholic Church has been able to make some changes in recent years &mdash; like allowing girls to be altar boys &mdash; so I cannot see why they cannot be a little more broadminded in their attitude towards divorce.  People are going to keep on getting divorced no matter what....  I think kids of divorced parents would feel a lot happier if their Church could recognise not only divorce but remarriage as well. Being divorced is bad enough, but feeling God is mad too only adds to the feeling of guilt and makes the situation worse.  For kids to go to school and be taught that divorce is a terrible thing, it's like being told that your parents are bad people and that they've offended God's feelings.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to speculate that the social pressures here are just as effective and repressive.</P>
    <P>The next argument advanced against divorce is that women and children are the financial sufferers.  That argument cannot be lightly dismissed but I do not think it takes account of the fact that in countries which have divorce a substantial majority of the applicants are women. Equally, it ignores the fact that as things are women, children and indeed husbands suffer financially as a result of marriage breakdown.  The blunt fact is that an income which it was contemplated would provide for one household sometimes has to provide for two.  It is already the case that the taxpayer is called upon <Col N="1545" /> to mitigate the effects of marriage breakdown where a spouse finds that the partner is not fulfilling his or her responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Another argument is that the introduction of divorce would be contrary to the religious views of the majority of people here.  That raises some very basic questions about the nature of the Irish State. Suffice at this stage to comment that a great majority of those whose marriages are breaking down are Roman Catholics and that a great majority of those who would avail of divorce if it were to be introduced would also be Roman Catholics. It is a sad simple fact that many individuals facing this tragedy in their personal lives find themselves unable to live up to the high principles set for them by their Church.  In those circumstances I cannot believe that it is the function of the State to ensure compliance with the teachings of any one Church.  It is also worth commenting that the submissions received by the committee established that every minority Christian Church expressed support for the introduction of civil divorce.  The only dissent from that unanimity came from the Church of Latter Day Saints but they had a somewhat unusual perspective as they are committed to polygamy so, no doubt, that affects their view.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the arguments in favour of divorce.  I was about to say &ldquo;to the arguments for the introduction of divorce&rdquo; but that would not be right because divorce is already a reality of Irish life.  The back pages of newspapers contain advertisements from agencies offering to arrange divorces, Irish style. There are several variations on the theme.  Some of the divorces obtained would be recognised in this country and some would not.  There are second marriages following the granting of a decree of nullity.  In some circumstances, the decree of nullity was obtained from the Church courts only and the second relationship, therefore, is irregular.  In some instances the parties would have gone to the trouble of getting a State annulment as well.  Sometimes a divorce will have been obtained on the basis of <Col N="1546" /> domicile and in that situation the divorce would be recognised here.  In other cases the divorce would have been obtained on other grounds such as residence or something of that sort and the divorce would not be recognised.</P>
    <P>There are other approaches, the possibility of name changes, or assuming a common name to give the appearance of being a married couple.  It is interesting that people go to such elaborate lengths to circumvent the prohibition on divorce because it shows how high the status of marriage is in society when people want to clothe themselves with the security of marriage in their second relationship. The first argument for introducing divorce is based on humanitarian grounds.  It is giving a second chance to people whose marriages have failed and who now seek a chance to find happiness in a second relationship which they hope will be a loving, secure and permanent one.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I believe the introduction of divorce in some circumstances may have a stabilising influence on family life.  Nobody who has contributed to the debate had disputed the fact that there are a very significant number of unions involving a partner who had earlier been involved in a marriage breakdown. The absence of divorce means that the second union is denied legal protection and the children are illegitimate with all the consequences that flow from that. The family are discriminated against in the tax and social welfare codes.  If difficulties arise in the second relationship the weaker spouse and children will be left entirely defenceless.  I cannot but believe that the existence of so many irregular unions represents a much more serious threat to the institution of marriage than would the existence of a tightly controlled divorce jurisdiction.  That last comment, of course, begs the question which is disputed by those who want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> as to whether it is possible to have a tightly controlled divorce jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I said I thought the case was essentially a humanitarian one.  I do not believe the Irish people are lacking in humanitarian <Col N="1547" /> instincts.  The evidence of umpteen opinion polls at this stage suggest that a sizeable majority of people are prepared to accept divorce in some circumstances but they also show that when people are asked how they would vote on any proposition that opinion is much more evenly divided.  It seems that must be because some of the people who say they would favour divorce in some circumstances go on to say they would not vote that way because they would fear the circumstances would be wider than they would wish.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the session Deputy Michael O'Leary presented to the House two Bills dealing with divorce.  He did so on the basis of his interpretation of the opinion polls which was that while public opinion would be anxious to respond to cases of real hardship that opinion was anxious that there would be no loosening of the legislation.  I would have found such an approach unacceptable at one time.  I would have taken the view that the Constitution should not find itself concerned with points of detail, particularly when those points of detail are the subject of disagreement between different Churches.  However, if one stops to think about it, our Constitution is a very detailed document and in a number of instances it takes a position on controversial issues.  For example, in relation to private property many people on the left in Irish politics believe that the Constitution affords private property too great a protection while others would argue that it goes scarcely further than the constitution of Yugoslavia and that greater protection is required.  The Constitution is not neutral: it takes a precise view of matters.  Likewise, in relation to trade union law, some people suggest that the unions have too much latitude under the Constitution and others say they have not enough.  Again, the Constitution takes a view on a subject of controversy and political debate.  So, too, can be the case with regard to divorce.</P>
    <P>The fact that any specific provision will be criticised, even by those favouring <Col N="1548" /> divorce, is no reason for excluding the issue from the constitutional domain.  Its presence in the Constitution would provide a degree of security and reassurance that the public require at this stage. Objections will be made.  Some people will say it would represent a vote of no confidence in the Legislature but the fact that we have a written Constitution is because we say there are subjects so basic that only the people can determine them and that Parliament is not sovereign.  We say that in relation to questions dealing with liberty and property and I do not know why we cannot say it in relation to the central question of how we support family life.  Many would be reassured in the knowledge that whatever restrictions were first provided for could not be relaxed without the people being consulted again.  That reassurance is more important than questions of constitutional elegance or nicety.</P>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee went on to say that they were anxious to avoid an adversarial situation and for that reason they took the view that any legislation should be on the basis of irretrievable breakdown.  In putting forward that suggestion I am not sure if the committee took into account that questions of conduct would arise in any event in relation to property, custody of children, maintenance and so on.  There is also the difficulty that if a divorce jurisdiction is based on any test other than one of proof of objective fault, to some extent at least the question of whether to divorce then falls within the competence of the parties themselves and one then has a situation where there is divorce by consent on demand.  That is not an easy question to resolve.  I take the point that proof of fault can often be unpleasant and that it might lead to some of the bizarre escapades that were the norm in Britain when their divorce system was based on fault. I simply put down a marker at this stage that I do not think the case for no-fault divorce is as clear-cut as the committee seemed to believe and when we come to decide on the form of divorce jurisdiction the question will need to be considered more thoroughly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> I said that the report was really two reports.  It dealt with divorce and a whole range of other measures dealing with preparation for marriage, support for marriage and remedies for marriage difficulties.  On these issues where there is consensus we must move expeditiously to give effect to the report of the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee considered the question of the age at which marriage can be validly contracted.  There is abundant evidence linking marriage breakdown with marriage at an early age.  It strikes me as extraordinary that people can enter into this most solemn contract &mdash; the only contract from which one cannot withdraw &mdash; at an age when they would not be allowed to enter into a normal commercial contract.  It is quite extraordinary how that can be justified.  The committee recommended increasing the age and that should be done immediately.</P>
    <P>The committee were concerned to provide for education for marriage.  Again, this has to be looked at in the context of the role of the schools and also in terms of what the State can do to support the various voluntary bodies involved in marriage guidance, counselling and the organisation of pre-marriage courses. There was also the question of a mediation conciliation service.  In all of these matters I should like to think that the State would operate through existing voluntary bodies, in many cases based on the Churches, rather than to set up an elaborate bureaucracy itself.  It is likely that greater flexibility and sensitivity can be got by involving people from the voluntary bodies who have established a commitment in the area for many years. The committee also concerned themselves with the other remedies available for marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The sad thing is the lack of urgency with which the House has approached these matters for many years.  Let us consider the area of nullity.  In 1974 the then Attorney General &mdash; now Mr. Justice Declan Costello &mdash; published a White Paper on reform and subsequently it was the subject of examination by the Law Reform Commission.  It is a subject that <Col N="1550" /> is crying out for reform.  The committee's report makes the point that at this stage the law has become so hazy and so complicated that no one can advise people with any certainty whether they are married. That is an absurdity and it is something that must be regulated quickly.</P>
    <P>I heard some suggestions that reforming the law on nullity could be a substitute for divorce.  Any such approach would be a highly dishonest one.  To pretend that marriage difficulties can always be solved by reference back to the point of marriage is not on.  An overwhelming number of those who gave evidence to the committee agreed that the present court system is inadequate, that there is a case for the establishment of a family tribunal. That point linked people who held sharply differing views on other issues.  Groups that had nothing at all in common in relation to divorce were united in their view that there was a need for a reform of the legal system.  We should get on with this as fast as possible.</P>
    <P>We were well served by the committee. I hope there will be agreement from all sides of the House in regard to the non-controversial aspects of the committee's recommendations.  In relation to the vexed question of divorce, this cannot be pushed under the carpet further.  We must confront it and this should be done through a referendum.  That should be done in the way Deputy Michael O'Leary suggested when he indicated that the grounds on which divorce would be available should be enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the matter in two ways.  The committee were given terms of reference which set out to deal with the protection of marriage and family life and to examine the consequences of marriage breakdown.  I should like to take a look, first, at the protection of marriage and family life.  There are many ways in which the Legislature have been negligent in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout the committee's deliberations, there was continuous emphasis in submissions that there should be some structure dealing with preparation for <Col N="1551" /> marriage.  We were very much aware in the committee of the constitutional protection of family life, and we agreed that the State has a specific responsibility to provide education for marriage.  However, much of the work has been left to the Churches, schools and voluntary organisations, whom I commend for the excellent job they are doing with very little financial resources.  The State should augment and develop pre-marriage courses and, if necessary, subsidise them.</P>
    <P>Jack Dominian who visited the committee, made an oral submission stressing preparations for marriage and its vitally important role:</P>
    <P>I have said again and again that in addition to the three &ldquo;Rs&rdquo; I want a fourth &ldquo;R&rdquo; which stands for &ldquo;relationship&rdquo;, to be an essential part of education in schools.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Education and the Curriculum Reform and Development Committee to introduce the fourth R, education for relationships, in our schools because we have been totally lacking in this area.  All social commentators agree that one of the risks to marriage is marrying too young.  A large majority of those who marry very young are putting their marriages at risk.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that the age for marriage be 18 years.  The minimum age for marriage is 16 and people can apply to the High Court to get exemptions if they are younger.  When the age of majority was reduced to 18 I pleaded with the Minister for Justice to have the marriage age reduced to 18.  I appeal to him again in this respect because most people agree that the minimum age for marriage should be 18 years.  If people are between 16 years and 18 years they should have to apply to the High Court so that personal interests could be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The causes of marriage breakdown should be examined.  They are many and they have been dealt with many times in different submissions and booklets.  They were best summarised in a submission <Col N="1552" /> to the committee by The Family Life Research Centre, Knock, County Mayo, as follows:</P>
    <P>Housing &mdash; high mortgages, small flats, high rises.  Estates &mdash; designed without social and leisure amenities. Housekeeping &mdash; bad planning, poor quality, poor management.  Unemployment &mdash; time on hands, non-achievers, &ldquo;in the way&rdquo;, unfulfilled.  Work &mdash; workaholic, pressure by firms, career put before marriage.  Income &mdash; financial necessity, often, for double income.  Money &mdash; not enough for essentials, living beyond means, waste. Leisure &mdash; no time spent together, T.V. silences, &ldquo;outside&rdquo; activities. Alcohol &mdash; overemphasis on its use, singing pubs, alcoholism.  Children &mdash; no agreement on discipline, education, pocket money, leisure.  Abdication &mdash; parents abdicating their responsibilities to others.  Ideals &mdash; no time for reflection, marriage courses, prayer, renewal.  Ideas &mdash; trends from other countries influencing attitudes.  Status &mdash; overemphasis on status, social climbing.</P>
    <P>Basically, in the words of Jack Dominian, prevention of marital breakdown is primarily the work of appropriate psychological safeguards in the development of the personality.  According to that submission, the causes of marriage breakdown can arise from the environment, and he gave this list:</P>
    <P>Psychiatric problems, neurosis, psychosis; sexual deviations, frigidity, impotence, etc; selfishness expressed in immaturity, insensitivity and greed; self-discipline absent, anger, illtemper and violence present; domination of one partner over the other; pressure to get married because of pregnancy, parents, etc.; age &mdash; marriage at an age of emotional and psychological immaturity; getting married to escape from parents, environment, on the &ldquo;rebound&rdquo;; poor self-esteem, poor self-image; inability to communicate at any deep level; inability to give or receive love.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" /> The Knock group say that these problems can continue into marriage if they are not arrested at an early stage.  The likelihood is that they will not be arrested because in Ireland we have an absence of adequate counselling services, no back-up counselling service for doctors, wife battering and child battering covered up, an inadequate service for the alcoholic and for his or her family, and reluctance to attend psychologists or psychiatrists.</P>
    <P>The State is failing abysmally to provide a support system for family life.  It is not providing adequate pre-marriage facilities or adequate counselling facilities. Neither is there available adequate psychological, social or psychiatric advice.  For so long as this continues, one can only expect increasing marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>In addition, the present high unemployment rates and such factors also as the lack of planning in the building of housing estates are causing tension and strife in homes.  Where, then, is the State fulfilling its role in the area of family life? We have neglected that role and should attempt without delay to put matters right.  There is no need for delay because there is consensus among all parties that we should provide in so far as possible the necessary safeguards and supports to ensure that there is preparation for marriage and that there is protection of marriage and family life.</P>
    <P>However, these changes would not cure all the problems associated with marital breakdown.  Let us consider some of those problems as they manifest themselves in a legal way.  Perhaps I can do this most easily by posing a series of questions. First, is our law on nullity adequate or sufficient?  Is our law on judicial separation the correct and the best one?  Are our grounds for maintenance sufficient? Are they justified and are they fair?  Are our laws on custody adequate?  Are our laws on matrimonial property discriminating against women?  Do we need divorce and have we an adequate court system for dealing with family problems?</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of nullity, for many years this has been a fossilised area of law, so much so that between 1970 and <Col N="1554" /> 1980 only 25 cases of civil nullity were granted in the High Court.  In recent years, though, this has been a developing area of law but there is much ambiguity in regard to it.  Largely it depends on the subjective judgment of judges as to whether a marriage is determined to be valid or otherwise.  This is no criticism of judges because they are trying to operate with 19th century legislation which does not take account of social and psychological developments.  Therefore, the law needs to be changed and modernised.  It for the Legislature to ensure that this is done quickly and that we have a clear statement of the law in relation to nullity. It is deplorable that, time and again, we must be prompted by the decisions of judges into introducing legislation that is necessary.  The area under debate is an example of our failure in this regard.</P>
    <P>Divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is a Latin tag which means very little.  All it means is that where there is not agreement to the obtaining of a legal separation, the judicial separation can be granted by the courts.  One of the problems associated with judicial separations is the cost factor.  The person seeking a judicial separation is likely to incur costs of up to £6,000 or £7,000 and this is because the other spouse will not agree to separate. This position cannot be allowed to continue, especially when we do not have sufficient free legal aid.</P>
    <P>The other factor is that judicial separation can be granted on three grounds only.  These are adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices.  In order to obtain judicial separations applications must endeavour to base their case on one or more of these factors.  This is not conducive to the satisfactory resolution of problems.  At chapter 7 of their report, the committee recommend that:</P>
    <P>The Court should grant a decree of Judicial Separation if it is satisfied that the marriage of the person to his or her spouse has irretrievably broken down. Irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground for the grant of a decree of Judicial Separation. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> In considering whether or not a marriage has irretrievably broken down, the court should be satisfied that such a breakdown has occurred if an applicant proves one of the following:</P>
    <P> (a)  That his or her spouse has behaved in such a way that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to co-habit with that other spouse.</P>
    <P>(b)  That his or her spouse has been guilty of adultery.</P>
    <P>(c)  That his or her spouse is in desertion or in constructive desertion of the Applicant.</P>
    <P>(d)  That the Applicant has been living separate and apart from the other spouse for a continuous period of not less than one year and the other spouse consents to the making of the decree.</P>
    <P>(e)  That the Applicant has been living separate and apart from the other spouse for a continuous period of three years.</P>
    <P>(f)  That such other facts and/or reasons exist or existed which in all circumstances make it reasonable for the Applicant to live separate from, and not co-habit with, the other spouse. </P>
    <P>It is a matter for this Legislature to change the law in respect of judicial separation but again we have been sitting idly by hoping that perhaps the problem will go away.  It will not go away.  It is causing untold traumatic damage to the couples concerned, apart from the trauma of the marital breakdown itself. That is why I make the appeal that we set about changing the law on judicial separation with the maximum speed.</P>
    <P>On the matter of custody, the law in this area is more up to date than is the case in the other aspects of marital breakdown. This is due to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which provides that the courts shall be governed solely by the consideration of the child's welfare.  The <Col N="1556" /> committee observe that, however, a large number of custody and access disputes continue to be determined in the lower courts where the judges do not have available to them professional advice.  They recommend that all custody and access decisions should be decided only on the basis of professional advice and that both parents should play a full role in the upbringing of the child thereafter.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to maintenance has been updated also, but it is proving unsatisfactory in some ways.  For instance, there are times when it is impossible for a spouse, within the terms of the current legislation, to obtain maintenance.  The State needs to consider the question of whether in some cases it would be cheaper for the State to make a contribution towards the maintenance of spouses who are deserted and neglected.  In some cases husbands may have fled the country.  A contribution from the State might prove to be a more successful way of dealing with such problems than the way they are dealt with now.</P>
    <P>I shall consider now the area for divorce.  This is an emotive matter.  There are those who are strongly for divorce and those who are strongly against it. One view seems to be held strongly as the other.  I would not wish for another bitter, abusive and divisive debate.  That would not be of any benefit to anyone.  It is likely that if we put an amendment to the people merely to the effect that the prohibition on divorce should be removed, the result would be somewhere in the proportion of 50-50 and the debate would be very divisive.  When an amendment is being put to the people we must state the type of divorce we intend to introduce.  Unfortunately, many members of the public do not have faith in the Legislature.  They do not trust the Legislature.  Asking the people to remove prohibition on divorce and to give the power to decide to the legislators will frighten off many people and cause them to vote against.</P>
    <P>When an amendment is put to the people it should be worded in a definite way, asking the people if they would like a certain type of divorce to be introduced. <Col N="1557" /> This would be a matter for a constitutional lawyer and far be it from me to suggest what type of amendment should be put to the people.  Even though the timing may not be right, one thing is clear: the Catholic Church has a very definite teaching on marriage, what God has joined together let no man put asunder.  Whenever a referendum is held the view of the Catholic Church will remain the same.  If the majority of Dáil Éireann decide on a referendum and should the people decide that they want some form of divorce &mdash; and in the final analysis it is for the people to decide &mdash; then two marriages should be introduced into this State, a Church marriage and a State marriage.  Those who want to be married by Church and by State would be free to do so and those who wanted to be married by the Church or by the State only would also be free to do so.</P>
    <P>There are arguments for and against and I will go into them again because the Minister of State has covered them adequately.  There are convincing arguments and superficial arguments for divorce and there are trivial and superficial arguments against, but it will be for the people to decide.  One thing I know is that the people are sick of politicians sweeping the issues under the carpet. There are lives involved, children's lives, and we cannot put off the evil day forever.</P>

      <P>I can take it for granted, I suppose, that this is going to be a political debate. This is very sad because there is a total lack of understanding of marital breakdown. People who are happily married and snug seem to have no understanding, no empathy, no compassion for the people whose marriages have broken down.  Many people whose marriages have broken down told me that society looks on them as failures.  That is an attitude I totally resent.  If a person makes a mistake on one area of his life, and his marriage breaks down, then he is branded a failure forever.  It appears a person can make a mistake in all areas of life but one.  That is tragic.  We should not be hypocritical about this.  Each human being is as good as the next.  If a marriage breaks down, if a person is separated, deserted of happily married, it should not matter.  All human beings are equal and should be treated equally.</P>
      <P>The present structure for the hearing of family cases is totally inadequate.  We need a family tribunal with judges trained in family matters.  I call on the Government to introduce a family tribunal as fast as they can.  We can be blamed for sweeping the question of divorce under the carpet and we can also be blamed for not providing the necessary support and services for the protection of family life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very sad that we are not getting contributions from both sides of the House and that only <Col N="1559" /> Government speakers are offering.  This shows a lack of interest and sincerity on the part of the Opposition on this very important issue.  I was a member of this committee and we took this matter very seriously.  All members, Government and Opposition, worked extremely hard to bring out this report and everyone expressed concern about the problem confronting us.  I believe this is one of the best reports ever presented in this House, but I am concerned about the line of discussion which has emerged in this House.</P>
      <P>This is a report on marriage breakdown, but many Deputies have discussed divorce rather than marriage breakdown. This report deals very specifically with marriage breakdown.  It is divided into four sections.  We dealt with the causes of marriage breakdown, the type of preparation which should be made before marriage, the support which should be given to newly married couples especially in the first five years of marriage, and, in the unfortunate event of the marriage breaking down, the legal remedies that are available and those which should be considered for the future.  Many speakers did not address themselves to the entire report but merely to a section of it, and it would be very unfortunate if some of the very important recommendations were pushed into the background and lost in a contentious debate.  That would not serve the purposes for which the committee were set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing became very clear when we were examining this problem and that was that the State does very little to support the institution of marriage &mdash; in the preparation for marriage, the marriage itself and later.  In our recommendations we dealt initially with the preparation for marriage and the type of education people should receive.  It was the agreed opinion of the committee that there was a definite need for education of youngpeople towards marriage.  We need a fourth R in our educational system.  We need not just reading, writing and arithmetic, we need also to teach about relationships.  People should be taught <Col N="1560" /> now to relate, to communicate, to be tolerant, understanding and considerate. These are just basic civilised attributes in a relationship but some people need to be made aware of the necessity for these important ingredients.  This can be done through the educational system.  There is a definite need in this area.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the State to do something to prevent further marriages breaking down.  We must start with the educational system so that people can be taught to respect each other.  After formal schooling one must face the world and it is at this stage that people consider marriage.  The State has no formal counselling or advisory service for people contemplating marriage.  One must commend the Churches for providing such a service.  They are doing a very good job but it is time the State faced its responsibility and provided such a service in conjunction with the Churches.  It became evident, in the course of our deliberations that many people enter marriage without a full understanding of the responsibilities involved in marriage. Many broken marriages would have had a much better hope of surviving if people had been aware of their responsibilities on entering marriage.  The Department of Education and the Minister must introduce courses for people as a matter of urgency, perhaps in school level schools, and the Minister for Health could provide counselling services through the health boards.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that Deputy Andrews did not see fit to come in and speak over an hour ago.  We have had three consecutive Government speakers and Deputy Andrews not sees fit to call a quorum.  That shows the lack of sincerity with which he takes this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the prime problems in relation <Col N="1561" /> to marriage breakdown is the age at which people get married.  There is a much higher proportion of breakdown in marriages contracted under the age of 20. It is ludicrous that 16 is the legal age for marriage but a person is not legally entitled to form a contract or purchase property at that age.  The Department of Justice should introduce legislation to raise the marriage age to 18.  This is something which is recommended in the report.  When speaking on the Age of Majority Bill I said that it would have been appropriate to introduce a Bill increasing the age of marriage to 18.  This should now be considered urgently by the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for marriages breaking down.  One of the most obvious reasons is that over the past 25 or 30 years there has been a change in the nature of marriage.  The emphasis is more on relationships than on the contract.  This is due considerably to the emancipation of women in the past 25 years.  Many women who previously would have had to stay in a marriage are now working and are in a financial position to move out.  This has increased the number of separations.  It is now a part of society. Years ago marriage was seen as a contract in which the man was the head of the household and the woman was there to bear children and act as a housekeeper. The emphasis has now changed in relationships and there is more communication between couples.  In addition, people are now expecting more from marriage.  People feel a deeper need for personal fulfilment.  It is part of modern society.  We as legislators must cater for this new awareness.  Marriage breakdown, for the people concerned is a major truama.  It causes major hardship and upset.  It would be great if a situation emerged in which this trauma was dealt with in the most harmonious way possible. We in this House have a duty to introduce legislation ensuring that such happens.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of our report is the establishment of a mediation scheme.  The reason we used the word &ldquo;mediation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo;<Col N="1562" /> was that we feared many people would confuse conciliation with reconciliation. For that reason we deliberately used the word &ldquo;mediation&rdquo;.  A mediation service helps copies solve difficulties following the marriage breakdown.  It is important that a service is provided whereby professional people can talk to the respective couples so that their problems can be ironed out in a civilised fashion, in particular in the interests of the children.  In this respect we considered as a priority the interests of the children in such a situation, that it would be in their best interests that such mediation would be carried out in a peaceful, harmonious way with little aggravation, bitterness and viciousness. Many of the problems that arose in the past did so because of the tension, pressure and nastiness resulting between the respective parties which in turn, were not good for the children.  Therefore, there is a real need to have a mediation service provided immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, has set up a pilot scheme.  It is now up to the Government to provide the service.  People need to be given some type of direction to enable to have some professional service provided and the sooner that is done that better it will be for all parties.  The Government have the facilities available within the various Departments, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, to perhaps a lesser degree the Department of Social Welfare, and there are social workers working around the country. What is needed are more counsellors with a certain amount of expertise to conduct this mediation service.  This is something that could be implemented fairly quickly and I hope the Government will take heed of this recommendation.  Certain previous speakers &mdash; people in very responsible positions &mdash; have chosen to ignore some of what I would consider to be very serious recommendation.  I hope these people will go back and read this whole report, and just one section, and arrange to have various Departments respond to our recommendations.</P>
    <P>At present once a marriage breaks down, in many cases, the parties go to <Col N="1563" /> their respective solicitors and immediately the situation becomes argumentative. That is most unfortunate.  From there on it enters a court situation and, once one moves into the courts, one is confronted by what I consider to be an absolutely appalling position.  We must remember that we are talking about people, about children, about very personal difficulties.  These people are brought down to the Four Courts, the Circuit Courts or District Courts around the country and are left out in corridors, given no privacy whatsoever.  They are then brought before justices who in many cases &mdash; I have to say this &mdash; do not possess the expertise to deal with the problems with which they are confronted.</P>
    <P>It is known that certain lawyers will try to have certain cases brought before particular judges because they know that judge X will be more sympathetic in a certain area than another.  That is most unfortunate.  There is need for conformity of approach among our judges.  It has been very evident, particularly in recent years, that there is not consistency in decisions taken by our Judiciary in relation to family law cases.  There is an onus on the Department of Justice &mdash; I acknowledge that they are subjected to certain constraints in relation to the Judiciary &mdash; to ensure that a clear line is adopted by all judges in similar type cases.</P>
    <P>This became very evident to the committee in the course of our discussions and examination of a number of cases which proved what we had already suspected, that the Department of Justice need to examine the situation urgently. In that area we dealt with judicial separations, barring orders, matrimonial property and the manner in which all of those are dealt with.  The lack of uniformity in judicial interpretation of the law in relation to family property, for example, was very distressing.  The committee believed that there should be set up urgently a Family Tribunal.  I hope the Department of Justice will act immediately in that regard.</P>

      <Col N="1564" /> The other serious matter at present is in relation to barring orders.  As a result of the O'Brien case there has been a change in the slant or attitude to the granting of barring orders.  Following the O'Brien case the judicial interpretation has moved towards the refusal of making an order unless physical violence occurs. That is a very serious move for the Judiciary to have taken.  There is now real need to have all the law in relation to barring orders replaced by a clearer statement of the law.  There is need for the Department of Justice to introduce amending legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to divorce, the present position is that a citizen does not have the right to remarry because of the provisions of Article 41.3.2º of our Constitution. In the course of the preparation of our report, we carried out a detailed examination of the constitutional prohibition on divorce, on the arguments for and against.  The committee ultimately were of the opinion that a referendum should be held on that Article of the Constitution.  This is the question that appears to have created much divisiveness. However, it is something that should be faced in a constructive, positive manner and a responsible manner by this House.  The people have a right to decide what they want and that can be done only by way of a referendum.</P>
    <P>The Committee were of the opinion that a referendum should be held on this issue.  It is unfortunate that people are adopting a somewhat political approach in this regard.  There are many people who want an opportunity to voice their opinion or to have it made known by casting their votes.  There is a strong body of opinion who want to vote in favour of the removal of the ban or divorce.  There is also a strong lobby who want to retain it.  This House has not the right to deprive those people of their constitutional right to voice their opinion on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10 December 1985.</P>
