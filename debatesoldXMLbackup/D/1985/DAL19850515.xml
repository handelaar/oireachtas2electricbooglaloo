    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 42 I am a little confused about what is relevant and what is not because some of the items are dealt with in later sections but all are <Col N="980" /> dealt with in this section with regard to VAT.  Amendment No. 44 refers to VAT on fuel and on building materials which is currently at 5 per cent and in accordance with this section will be raised to 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>Fuel is vital in the household budget of many people and represents a high proportion of the outgoing payments of elderly people and people on social welfare benefits, particularly the long term unemployed who are now on assistance. Their fuel bills, particularly in winter, constitute a considerable portion of their incomes.  People on unemployment assistance are not entitled to fuel vouchers. The court decided that they should be entitled to them and the Minister brought in a regulation in February and we did not succeed in being allowed time by the Government to put down a motion opposing this regulation.  In accordance with that regulation the Minister has overcome the High Court decision. Therefore those on assistance, the long term unemployed or unemployed for two years &mdash; and the number is increasing and up to 75 per cent of the unemployed now are on assistance &mdash; are not entitled to fuel vouchers and their fuel bills will be going up in accordance with this VAT provision.  The VAT is being doubled. Whereas I am quite aware that the term &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; covers all sorts of fuel for all sorts of people, the Minister could have made a provision whereby fuel in smaller quantities &mdash; in bags, for instance &mdash; would be zero-rated for VAT so that those who are buying bags of coal or a container of gas would not be charged 10 per cent VAT on that.  It is not very difficult for the Minister to make exclusions in regard to VAT and in this case he should have made exclusions which would allow people to purchase smaller quantities of fuel without having to pay 10 per cent VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also refers to VAT on building materials, and of course there is another provision which also affects the building industry.  The effect of amendment No. 44 is to exclude fuel and building materials and to leave those at 5 per cent, and the effect of amendment No. 45 is to <Col N="981" /> include them in the 5 per cent rate.  The two go together; one depends on the other.  I am proposing these two amendments to section 42 because of the effect the section has on those on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendments proposed here would be to retain the 5 per cent VAT rate for certain fuel, building and building services and concrete ready to pour, and to reduce the rate of VAT on concrete blocks to 5 per cent.  The amendments in themselves would reduce revenue by £45.5 million this year from 1 March or by £86.7 million in a full year.  That level of reduction in revenue could not be accommodated within the revised three rate VAT system which we have now.  It is very clear that the system itself is far better than what we have had before now, and a move towards the amendments that Deputy Mac Giolla has put down would make it impossible to operate that three rate system.  For that reason I must reject these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's main argument is the effect on revenue. As I have said, unfortunately I was unable to formulate the type of amendment which would cover what I had in mind; therefore the amendment covers everything and the loss in revenue is much greater than I would want to have it in my amendment.  However, I hope the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment which is to endeavour to exclude from the VAT increase those who are purchasing just their personal requirements in small quantities.  The quantity probably would cover what I have in mind without going to particular people because these are the people who are unable to purchase large quantities of fuel at a time.  My concern is that the fuel would not be increased in price for those who currently are unable to pay the current prices for it and who are excluded from the free fuel scheme.  If the Minister could see a way to provide a clause in <Col N="982" /> regard to fuel in quantities above a certain amount being included for VAT and others excluded for VAT that might cover this.  This is what I have in mind.  I hope the Minister will take this on board and see if it is possible or feasible to have such a qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would not be possible to distinguish, for VAT purposes, between different lots of fuel sold in different quantities to different people. I understand Deputy Mac Giolla's concern and it was to meet that concern that we provided in the budget this year for an increase from £4 to £5 &mdash; a 25 per cent increase &mdash; in the value of the fuel vouchers.  That will more than offset the effect of the increase in VAT on fuel for those who get fuel vouchers.</P>
      <P>At a more general level, the increase in the VAT on fuel from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will increase the price of fuel by a shade less than 5 per cent.  I would like to remind the House that the total effect of the budgetary measures on the consumer price index is around one quarter of 1 per cent.  Taking it altogether that represents only a very marginal change in the cost of living and, as I said last evening in relation to another amendment, the increases we have provided over the last two years and again from the middle of this year in both long term and short term rates of social welfare payments and assistance more than cover what has been happening to the cost of living over that period.</P>
      <P>Even for those who will not benefit from the fuel vouchers, the direct effects of the budget on their standard of living is very limited, an increase of one quarter per cent of consumer price index overall, and the effect of the measures we have provided on their incomes will be such that they will be kept ahead of the rate of inflation.  For that reason the concern Deputy Mac Giolla expressed for putting forward these amendments has been met by the combination of the budgetary measures we have taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives effect to the new VAT rates announced in the budget.  I want to tell the House the position of our party in respect of the VAT rates, and particularly the additional VAT rates, that will apply when this Bill is enacted.  I am particularly concerned about the VAT on footwear and above all the increased VAT rates on the building industry.  Before dealing with these in detail may I remind the House that, in the first instance, the Minister claimed in the budget that he was acting in accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in reducing the ranges of VAT bands from six to three.  The commission recommended that we would move gradually and eventually to one single VAT rate.</P>
      <P>It was the Minister himself who, even since the recommendations of the commission, increased the number of VAT bands to the maximum level of six.  It was the Minister himself who so overcomplicated the VAT system as to cause headaches for traders and the Revenue alike.  It was the Minister who increased the level of VAT at every range, and particularly the total take from the VAT to the point that our indirect taxation between VAT and excise duties is the highest in the European Community.  It was the Minister and this Government, particularly in their first budget, who added the highest levels of indirect taxation between VAT and excise duty for which he now claims some credit for reducing to a limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest people run away with the impression that after the adjustments in the VAT bands this year the levels of VAT impositions and the amount of VAT paid will be reduced, let me make it clear that from the figures provided by the Minister, far from the VAT burden being reduced as a consequence of this budget, it will be significantly increased in money terms <Col N="984" /> and, even allowing for inflation, in real terms.  The Minister may counter with his usual argument that the position is better than it would have been if he had taken another course and he may say that the VAT estimate this year is less than it would be if he had left the same ranges of VAT as existed last year, but we are not in the business of fiction.  We are dealing with facts.  What we are concerned about is the overall burden of VAT and what its impact on the community, the trade and the economy will be when this legislation is passed, and how that compares with the total VAT take after last year's legislation.</P>
    <P>Last year the VAT total was £1,361 million and this year the projected figure will be £1,484 million, an increase of 9 per cent over last year's figure.  Are we really going to try to continue with the fiction that when VAT jumps to that astronomical figure &mdash; £1,484 million this year, a 9 per cent increase over last year's figure&mdash;that the level of VAT this year will be considerably less than it might have been if the Minister had taken different steps?  The public are only concerned with how much they paid last year, and that was too much and the trades concerned &mdash; electrical, building, those on the border regions and so on &mdash; know how much they paid last year.  They will realise that they will be paying a further 9 per cent in money terms this year, or 3 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the areas which will be hit by these impositions.  Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned fuel for the old and the deprived, and I agree with him, but if we look further we will see that there will be an adjustment on the VAT on clothes from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.  One might say that a 2 per cent increase is a marginal rise on something which was zero-rated a little while ago.  However, this will create hardship for many families.  Indeed the family seems to be the target all the time in terms of income tax, excise duty or VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase to 10 per cent will add a very considerable extra burden to the average low income family, especially those in receipt of social welfare.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister introduced a 10 per cent rate of VAT on adult footwear.  We can remember all the nonsense that went on some time ago in relation to determining when a child ceased to be a child and how to distinguish between a strong ten year old and a weak 13 year old.  The application of 10 per cent on footwear will cause very severe difficulties to an industry already in deep trouble, especially in Dundalk. Footwear is an essential item in any household budget and the bigger the family the more expensive it will be.  It also explains why the Minister will be getting considerably more from VAT this year despite his claim regarding adjustments in VAT bands.</P>

    <P>The 10 per cent VAT rate on the building industry demonstrates the total lack of awareness by the Government of the impact of their new tax impositions on one of the most fundamental labour-intensive national industries.  Deputy Molloy will be dealing with this in considerable detail and I am sure many other Deputies who have been listening to building contractors will also contribute. The building industry has an almost exclusive domestic input.  The materials are purchased and processed almost exclusively at home and the level of employment is 100 per cent home based. The labour intensity of the industry should single it out for special favour at a time of such great unemployment.  It should not be a target for the Minister's arrows.  It is just another symptom of how the Government think and it brings out our strongest possible opposition. Yesterday, during the debate on venture capital, the Minister deliberately and coldly refused to even consider the application of the venture capital scheme to the service sector including the building and hotel industries.  One or two of the Minister's colleagues supported me in the debate but voted against me in the division.  I suppose that is the way this <Col N="986" /> House works but they must be very frustrated when they realise that the Minister did not listen to their arguments and were forced to vote against what they said.  At least they came in to speak and I must give them credit for that, unlike the absent Labour Deputies who have no interest, good, bad or indifferent in anything going on here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Labour Party have not been here for even one minute of this debate.  I want to give examples of how the Government have singled out the labour-intensive construction industry for especially harsh treatment in the last two years.  The increase of VAT from 3 per cent to 10 per cent is one example.  Effectively, there has been a 30 per cent reduction in the public capital programme and the introduction of the nonsensical residential property tax has discouraged the private house sector in the middle class environment of the city.  It yields very little money, £1 million gross, and, if the cost of administration is deducted from that, it amounts to nothing. If that tax were abolished, there would be increased sales in secondhand-houses which would bring in much more revenue in stamp duty than the property tax.  This tax was the price of staying together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The virtual abolition of section 23 from April 1984 and the reduction in mortgage interest relief also had a detrimental effect on the building industry.  The Minister's colleague abolished the wet time scheme but I will not go into that in detail. However, they all caused damage to the industry.  We also had the withdrawal of the industry from the employment incentive scheme and I am sure that rural Deputies have memories of the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme. It is supposed to be coming back but in a diluted form.  CRV and planning charges have also increased.  We all know what the impact of all this has been on the building industry.  We may choose to <Col N="987" /> ignore it but we should listen to people in that industry.</P>
    <P>The increased PRSI charges on employers is particularly onerous for a labour-intensive industry.  Everybody will tell you that taking on an employee is a very expensive undertaking because of income levies and PRSI charges.  If you have to shed labour you may then be faced with an unlawful dismissals case.  It means that the employer now takes the view that he will not add to his costs or run the risk of being penalised for shedding labour.  As a consequence, he does not employ anyone.  Our major construction companies are having a limited degree of success elsewhere.  Because the climate is so hostile here, their only option is to go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>People came to see me.  If the Minister likes I will give him their names, but not publicly in the House.  They wanted to tell me as Opposition spokesman what investment plans were.  The major construction companies are making 85 per cent of their investment outside this country to maintain the skeleton 15 per cent at home.  I have not dreamed up these conversations.  I did not invite these people.  They came to me without any suggestion from me to convey to me as Opposition spokeman the depth of the recession in the industry and the consequences of it.  We like to see our people being mature enough, confident enough and successful enough to go abroad and engage in construction activities and compete with the best.  Some of the ones I am thinking about can do that.  We like to see that as a choice or an option in normal times.  We do not want to see it as an obligation forced on them because of the hostile tax climate at home.</P>
    <P>I want to give the lie to what the Government are saying about emigration. It is of the order of 30,000 per annum.  Gay Byrne hardly needs to have his programme proclaimed in this House. Emigration is now a matter of such considerable concern that on Thursday or Friday morning next those who want to tune in can hear an expert on American emigration for a full hour.  He will answer <Col N="988" /> questions and tell people how to get into America in the short term and the long term, how to get in quietly and stay permanently. The same can be done in the case of Australia and Canada.</P>
    <P>In the face of all that we are being asked to ignore the fact that the Government are hell bent on killing the industries which have always generated employment.  They singled out the building industry, the clothing industry and the footwear industry in the name of rationalisation as they see it.  The Government have turned a blind eye to the ruinous state of the construction industry and its associated trades and professions. The Minister has only to consult with any architectural firm or any firm of quantity surveyors, or any group of consultants in that area, and he will find that a firm who employed up to 50 professional staff three years ago are now employing eight at the maximum.  They have closed offices all over the country. I do not want to mention their names in the House but, if the Minister chooses to take issue with me on that, I will give him the details of each firm and he can ignore the realities if he wishes.</P>
    <P>It is clear from all that that the Minister has turned a blind eye on the ruinous state of the construction industry.  In the budget this year he reduced the public capital programme by £50 million and added £2,000 to the cost of a private residence.  The housing market was already very depressed and the profit margins of the industry at a dangerously low level.  The subsequent increase in the grant of £1,000 was totally inadequate to compensate for the harsh measures imposed by the Government which the Minister is now asking us to pass in this Bill.  I do not know why but the Government seem to be deliberately hostile to the construction industry.  Having regard to the track record of the industry in the past and its employment potential at this critical time, the deliberate dismantling of this major domestic industry has the most critical social and economic consequences. This applies to employees, customers, suppliers, associated professions and traders at large.  When they go into <Col N="989" /> liquidation what happens?  Inevitably as they keel over they crush down on top of others who are already heavily burdened themselves.  There is a continuing spiral of liquidations.  Instead of confining his discussions to the staff of the Department of Finance or within his own very limited consultations which do not seem to be in contact with reality, I wish the Minister would listen to his own backbenchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If progress through this Bill is a measure of the relevance of the House, we have made some progress this morning.  Because of the importance of section 42 we have decided to focus to a considerable extent on the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of the burden imposed by the Government on the construction industry bears heavily also on traders, suppliers, customers and perhaps most of all on employees.  Even the banking sector and the financial institutions have been affected badly by the general running down of the construction industry. The decline in the industry in 1984 in volume terms was at least 7 per cent. The decline was particularly acute in the private housing sector where it was at least 8 per cent.  There was a reduction of 28 per cent in private house completions for the final quarter of 1984 compared with the final quarter of 1983 and in 1983 as a whole private housing output was 2,000 fewer units than the figure for the previous year which was 18,000. Unfortunately, the problem was not confined to the private housing sector. It extended also to the commercial and industrial sectors where the decline in volume in 1984 was almost 20 per cent. <Col N="991" /> One need only have regard to the number of &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs on private houses around this city to realise how bad the situation is in that sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's harsh measures have resulted in a continuing and disastrous decline in output in the industry and that input is now 25 per cent less in volume terms than the 1981 level.  The construction industry has been regarded always as the measure of prosperity and activity in the economy.  The decline in the industry as I have outlined reflects almost exactly the rundown in investment in the economy in every other sector. That rundown is of the order of 20 per cent less in real terms compared with 1981.  This is a measure of the depression which the Government seem deliberately determined to maintain.</P>
    <P>Despite the warnings issued by us in the past number of years, but especially last year, the Government have continued to fail to respond and have not introduced any incentive to encourage private sector investment in construction. They deliberately excluded the industry from the scheme introduced in the 1984 Finance Act to promote capital investment. Even to have included the hotel industry might have stimulated construction in that area.  Some of our hotels are in need of refurbishing and that work must be undertaken if we are to exploit the great potential in the tourist industry. If the purpose of the 1984 scheme was to generate employment in native industry there can be no explanation for excluding from the scheme the labour intensive building industry, especially since the equivalent British scheme included deliberately the construction industry within the ambit of the programme and we know that the building industry does not represent as much to the British economy as it represents to our economy.</P>
    <P>Despite all these factors and the potential of the industry for employment, the Minister chose to ignore it.  Not only has the industry been damaged severely by these disastrous decisions but State revenue has decreased and State expenditure <Col N="992" /> has increased as a consequence. Revenue has decreased because of decreasing returns from the industry and because of huge increases in terms of social welfare payments to the unemployed. The level of unemployed in the industry is more than 50,000.  This is costing the Exchequer almost £150 million per annum in social welfare payments but yet the Government are determined to continue with the demolition of an industry engaged essentially in construction.</P>
    <P>There was no hope for the construction industry in the <i>Building on Reality</i> document. Despite the Minister's puerile attempt last evening to defend that plan, he demonstrated that it has been totally discredited.  It is obvious that the Government are determined to continue their tax on the construction industry because public investment, even in terms of the plan, will fall by 3 per cent per annum in volume terms up to 1987.  Where, then, is there any sign of hope for the industry? There is no signal from the Government that investment in the industry should be encouraged and renewed.</P>
    <P>The final blow for the industry we are debating has been the doubling of the VAT rate from 5 to 10 per cent.  Prior to the budget it was estimated that construction output would decrease by 3 per cent in 1985.  This was to follow declines of 11 and 7 per cent in 1983 and 1984 respectively. However, the effect of what is being done in this legislation will be to reduce the output by at least a further 3 per cent.  The Minister seems determined to continue the slow but unfortunate consistent slide of this industry into total collapse.  The impact of this throughout the economy is disastrous because of the reduction in the level of work that can be financed now through the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>Another consequence of what is being done is that those who are not registered for VAT will have to fund the higher costs themselves.  The implications of this will be severe, particularly for new house purchasers.</P>
    <P>There will be consequences of all this, too, so far as the black economy is concerned <Col N="993" /> and which as I have said many times is now the only growth area in the economy.  Many times the Minister has referred to his determination to deal with those who operate the black economy but by his measures he is encouraging participation in that economy.  By way of the changes in the rates in respect of concrete blocks and other materials the Minister will give even a further boost to the black economy because bona fide firms will find it impossible to compete with those operating in the black economy.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Government's attack on the construction industry can be gauged from the fact that activity in the industry has declined by almost 30 per cent in four years.  For that reason we urge the Government even at this late stage to withdraw this penal burden of an extra 5 per cent by way of VAT on the industry and instead to make a determined effort to restore the industry to its former state of health.  The abolition of some of the measures that have been introduced by the Government, the restoration of schemes they have abolished and the introduction of incentives to promote private sector investment in the industry are essential if the huge potential of the industry <i>vis-á-vis</i> the economy is to be realised.</P>
    <P>The burden of taxation is affecting everyone but it is affecting particularly badly the labour intensive industries. Bona fide firms must be allowed compete on fair terms with those operating in the black economy.  Therefore, the Government must reverse their disastrous decisions and restore some degree of health and activity to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to make two brief references to other matters affected by the new VAT rates.  I refer first to the question of magazines. We welcome the reduction in VAT on newspapers.  However, magazines in one way or other cater for the same market and we cannot see much justification in equity for or any great impact on revenue from not applying the same decision to magazines as to Irish newspapers. If the Minister wants to raise a point of order, it is covered in this section. <Col N="994" /> I shall at some time take the opportunity of familiarising him with the legislation which he himself has introduced here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make the point now on this section.  We shall be dealing with the amendment in greater detail later.</P>
      <P>Last year there was an outrageous reaction from the Minister who accused me of indulging in shamrockery when I referred in our own language to the imposition of VAT on hurleys.  If he has that attitude towards it, I shall not tempt the same response this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall match the Deputy's attitude to the language any day without the slightest difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be judged as regards our attitudes to it, how we use and respect it.  The Minister's reaction to my using it was contemptuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am miles ahead of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave that for someone else to judge.  It certainly is time that the Government responded to the case for the abolition of VAT on hurleys. Nothing is required to bolster that argument beyond this, that if we are trying to get a renewal of some of the characteristic spirit &mdash; and every nation has its own characteristic spirit and we do need a renewal &mdash; we would try to promote our culture in every possible way.  An essential aspect of that culture is our native games, particularly hurley &mdash; not just the game itself but the association that promotes it.  If the Minister were aware of what it represents in our towns and villages, he would see something very important in its contribution to a healthy social environment.  He would note particularly the cost of hurleys for young people and that this great game &mdash; which I have had the privilege of playing for a considerable number of years, if not all too skilfully &mdash;<Col N="995" /> would warrant special privilege.  I would not apologise to any other sport here, no matter what it is, for giving special privilege to that game, for all the reasons which I have mentioned.  I hope the Minister may relent at this stage.</P>
      <P>We shall be dealing with each of these matters in greater detail in the relevant sections, but this is the section which introduces the new rates.  I thought it appropriate to give a broad approach to what the Minister has claimed to be reform but is, in fact, an increase in the VAT level and in the burden on industries such as the clothing, footwear and, above all, the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to the case being made by Deputy O'Kennedy regarding increased VAT levels and the changes in VAT rates announced by the Minister in the budget contained in this Finance Bill.  If we get beyond the sections, subsections and legal jargon and look at the reality of what is being done, it is almost inexplicable to people looking at it from outside the House.</P>
      <P>The fundamental reality facing our economy is this: Our major problem on the economic front, from which most of our social problems derive, is that of unemployment.  Everybody accepts that. The breakdown in law and order, crime, vandalism, the undermining of family life all spring mainly from that problem of unemployment.  Even the Government and their economic and social advisers, handlers and public relations men accept that.  At least they have had the decency to pay lip service to it on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the reality that the major problem facing the country is unemployment, what are the Government doing in the Finance Bill?  They are increasing the imposition of taxation on four or five of our most labour-intensive industries.  The gap between what they are doing and the reality on the economic and social front is simply unbelievable.  For example, the rate of VAT on footwear is being increased from zero-rating to 10 per cent. The footwear industry is one which has <Col N="996" /> been particularly badly affected by the recession.  It is significant that on the very day the Minister announced this increase in the Dáil in his budget speech one of our main footwear firms closed down, with the loss of from 350 to 370 jobs. That is an ominous portent of things to come.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry is labour-intensive. It has been devastated and ravaged by the recession over the past few years. The Minister's response to these difficulties and declining employment in this industry is to increase VAT on clothing by 25 per cent &mdash; from a rate of 8 per cent to 10 per cent.  The Minister has congratulated himself and brought his backbenchers in to congratulate him on changes made in VAT to correct the situation whereby people were finding it more attractive to do their shopping across the Border.  This problem also applies to the clothing industry.  The net result of this increase means that it is 2 per cent more advantageous to cross the Border and purchase clothing there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 15 per cent up there. The Deputy slipped up there for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can anticipate the Minister's response.  I shall come to that in a moment.  The motor trade has also been affected by the changes being brought about by section 42.  The rate of VAT on motor repairs is being increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent &mdash; that is a 100 per cent increase.  I am open to correction on this, but I think that at one stage the Minister advanced the reduction in VAT on motor vehicle parts from 25 per cent to 10 per cent as part justification or part compensation for the extra imposition on the motor repair trade.  This is a novel concept, to increase VAT on one section of an industry and reduce it on another section and justify the increase by referring to the reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has become very mixed up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had any <Col N="997" /> concept or knowledge of how this business works, he would know that in reducing VAT on motor parts he was aiding the black economy.  He is reducing the cost of these parts to people not registered for VAT.  The increased VAT on service is putting those who are not registered for VAT in a more advantageous position than those who are.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has dealt at great length with the increase in VAT on the building industry from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  As we have an amendment down for section 49, I shall come back to this in more detail later.  The Minister congratulated himself in his budget speech and on a number of occasions outside the House and within it on the fact that he had reduced the number of VAT bands and simplified the system somewhat from the administrative point of view.  I shall not condemn him too harshly for congratulating himself on undoing something which he and his Coalition colleagues, but largely he himself, did, but it must be put on the record that that is all that he has done.</P>
      <P>Most of the items which prior to the July 1981 budget were charged at 10 per cent are still charged at 23 per cent and I defy the Minister to deny that.  The present 10 per cent rate applies, for the most part, to items previously either zero-rated or rated at 3 per cent.  The Minister is talking about reducing the number of VAT bands.  Was it not he himself who increased the number of VAT bands in all directions?  It was either this Minister or Deputy Bruton who introduced the 8 per cent and the 18 per cent bands.  If the Minister now sees his mistake that is good, but it is hardly something about which he should spend a great deal of time congratulating himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net result of all this manoeuvring and tinkering about with VAT rates is that the old 10 per cent rate has become 23 per cent and the old 3 per cent rate has largely become 10 per cent, with the addition of fuel, footwear and clothing.  The net overall effect of the budget changes is that the VAT system will take in £122 million more than it did in 1984. <Col N="998" /> People who know nothing about economics but who have commonsense know that what is needed is a reduction in the VAT burden, not an increase.  When Fianna Fáil introduced the concept of self-financing tax reductions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil never found one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they were sneered at by the Minister and by the Government but now the Minister seems to have suffered a partial conversion.  Last year he told me in this House that VAT on newspapers could not be reduced.  He told me in very forceful terms that this could not be done because of the disastrous loss to the Exchequer.  This year the Minister gave such a reduction.  This year he told Deputy Haughey that his suggestion regarding a reduction in the excise duty on spirits was ludicrous.  He said it could not be done, that the economy would collapse.  However, eventually the Minister saw the light and gave the reduction. I congratulate him on what he did in that instance and I only hope that in the interests of the country, and particularly of the young people who cannot find jobs, he will see some more light as he travels along the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take issue with some claims made by the Minister, particularly with regard to VAT.  In respect of the reduction in the 35 per cent rate to 23 per cent he said it would &ldquo;ease the cash flow burden of VAT for industry, both at point of import and for domestic transactions since many inter-industry goods have been liable at the 35 per cent rate&rdquo;.  This is correct in so far as it relates to imports but they constitute only a tiny part of the picture.  If the Minister or his Department had taken the time to work it out, they would have come to the self-evident conclusion that VAT within our domestic borders is self-cancelling as between the different industries.  One industry pays VAT on output and another industry claims it on input.  Regardless of the change in rates, there is no overall cash <Col N="999" /> advantage to industry from that reduction. That gives the lie to the Minister's claim in his budget statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better talk to a few more accountants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting eagerly for the Minister's response.  These views are not just mine but the views of many independent and respected commentators. The Minister also claimed that the budgetary changes, mainly the alterations in the VAT system, would &ldquo;substantially improve the employment capacity of Irish commerce and industry&rdquo;.  That is a ludicrous claim.  One commentator described it as &ldquo;public relations gone too far&rdquo;.  How will these small mediocre changes in the VAT system contribute to that situation?  Where is the increased spending power going to come from to give any significant boost to sales and create employment?  The net effect of the VAT changes will be only £9 million in a budget of more than £7,000 million.  The Minister should face reality.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the unemployment situation in the building industry.  Clothing, footwear, the motor trade and building are labour-intensive industries.  Surely the Government must accept that the main problem facing those who wish to solve the unemployment crisis is the level of taxation on productive and labour-intensive industry?  The Government, both expressly and by implication, have accepted that and, therefore, the question must be asked why are they persisting in pushing through this Finance Bill which will increase the tax on those labour-intensive industries?  It does not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The self-evident thing to do is to reduce the tax imposition, that is, if the Government want to create employment.  If they accept that one of the main barriers to employment creation is the tax burden, why are they exacerbating the problem by increasing taxation?  Why not reduce it or at least maintain the VAT levels at their present rate rather than increase them in those vulnerable industries?  I <Col N="1000" /> cannot understand the attitude of the Government, and nothing the Minister has said in connection with the budget or in this debate has explained it to me.  If the Minister can give me a rational, logical explanation for his proposals I will be happy to hear it.  I would feel a little more secure leaving this House tomorrow evening if the Minister could explain to me how increasing tax on labour-intensive industries will help to solve the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>Most of the points have been covered, particularly the effect on the building industry which is of vital importance in view of the enormous unemployment problem and the consequent expenditure by the Exchequer.  I wish to deal with the effect of the increase in the cost of footwear and clothing. When I spoke about the effect of the increase in the price of fuel, the Minister said the total effect of all the VAT changes on the cost of living would be one quarter of 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very convenient figure for the Minister but he should relate that to households where the greatest proportion of income goes on food, clothing and fuel.  These items will probably take more than one-quarter of one per cent of a household's expenditure. It is estimated that 140,000 people are now on unemployment assistance and the payments in such cases will leave those families well below the poverty line.  In their case the VAT increases on fuel, clothing and footwear will be much more than a quarter of 1 per cent of their expenditure and that is what the Minister must take into account.  The Minister has not compensated the lowest paid in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that later on, and under this section also, there is provision for an increase from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent in what is sometimes referred to as a VAT refund to unregistered farmers. In the explanatory memorandum it is explained as a raising of the flat rate <Col N="1001" /> credit intended to compensate unregistered farmers for the increased tax borne by them because of all the changes in VAT rates.  Apparently there are only 700 farmers registered.  Therefore when one talks about unregistered farmers, one is talking about probably 160,000 to 170,000 households.  All of them are compensated for the increased tax borne by them because of the changes in VAT rates.  There is no compensation whatsoever for the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed.  The VAT increases generally, particularly those proposed in the building industry and on footwear and clothing, will increase the numbers of unemployed but there is no compensation for them for such increases which will have a tremendous effect on their household budgets.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain on this or the next section, which deals specifically with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels that the next section would be the more appropriate one for the contribution the Deputy is now making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  But under this section I am sure the Chair will accept, as he seemed to accept from Deputy O'Kennedy, one could deal with anything in connection with VAT because it is all covered there, including the 2.2 per cent rate which applies only to the supply of livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but section 42 seems to deal specifically with farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  Each will arise specifically on other sections. For example, section 48 will deal with theatrical or musical performances while footwear will be dealt with under section 47.  I know there are separate sections for them but this one covers all of them.  I hope the Minister, on this or the next section, will explain why unregistered farmers must get this compensation which, incidentally, in respect of the last year for which I have figures, 1983, <Col N="1002" /> amounted to £53.70 million.  That figure rose from the year 1979 at £6.8 million to £53.70 million in the space of those four years.  I do not know what was the figure for 1984; probably it had risen to £60 million.  The Minister now proposes increasing that from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent, representing another 10 per cent increase, when it should be reduced.</P>
      <P>The other matter with which I should like to deal is the decrease in VAT on newspapers which was welcomed and had been called for over a long number of years, which we had supported and thought would be implemented when the VAT rate on books was altered.  There has been a major reduction in VAT on newspapers from 23 per cent to 10 per cent which was widely welcomed.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to what the newspapers have done with this reduction.  They had been arguing that the VAT rate should be reduced to render newspapers here competitive with their British counterparts which were outselling them.  VAT on newspapers was reduced, but what did the newspapers do?  They did not pass on this reduction to their readers.  For example, <i>The Irish Times</i> cost 50p before the reduction in VAT, which was reduced to 47p thereafter, where as that reduction should have brought the price of that paper down to 42p.  Effectively this meant an increase of 5p on the price of that newspaper.  Similarly the <i>Irish Independent</i> cost 45p before the reduction, was reduced to 43p whereas it should have been reduced to 40p, representing an increase of 3p.  Therefore those two papers did not pass on to their readers the reduction in VAT which they claimed was necessary to render their papers competitive. <i>The Irish Press</i> which was probably at rock bottom anyway at 35p before the reduction, remained the same thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this occurred in other areas the newspapers would be very quick to draw attention to this quick profit taking.  When VAT is increased all products immediately register the full VAT rate in their prices, but when VAT is reduced that does not happen.  The Minister should ask <Col N="1003" /> why when VAT is reduced the consumer does not receive the benefit, why, instead of the money going to the Exchequer, more than half the money saved by the newspapers goes to their proprietors. That is of no advantage to consumers and does not bear out the point about which the newspapers were screaming, the headlines that they were not being allowed to be competitive with their British counterparts on the market here.  That goes for many other products also.  The Minister can examine the situation but there are many other products that have had a reduction in VAT and in respect of which the relevant loss to the Exchequer has not meant a saving to the consumer. In most cases 50 per cent, or a large proportion of it, goes in increased profits to the industry or the industrialist concerned.</P>
    <P>I might ask, as have other Deputies, why not a reduction in VAT on magazines also?  What is so special or different about them that they must continue to bear the high rate of VAT?  I know there are flashy magazines.  There are all types of magazines, those in the commercial and industrial sector, but generally they afford people who have something to say an outlet therefor which books or papers do not.  Some magazines are of interest or importance to a minority only &mdash; for example, their articles might refer to birds, animals or insects, or to a commercial area or product, to the arts or culture, or even to the political area.  They play a major role in our society, our culture, our development and in giving information to people.  Will the Minister explain what is so special about them that they must pay VAT as against newspapers and books?</P>
    <P>The reduction in the VAT rate to theatrical and musical performances was widely welcomed but I should like to know if the Minister realises the effect of the exemption from VAT as against a zero-rating.  I have written to the Minister about this matter, particularly in connection with the Gate Theatre.  That tiny theatre is finding it very difficult to become commercially viable although in <Col N="1004" /> recent years they have had a lot of success in that area.  It was felt that the exempting of them from VAT would be of tremendous benefit but it has transpired that exemption from VAT means that the theatre cannot claim VAT refunds if they purchase equipment for the stage, erect buildings or engage in refurbishing.</P>
    <P>The Gate Theatre indicated that, while they will save in the region of £20,000 by the abolition of VAT, they will lose approximately £30,000 by virtue of the fact that they are unable to claim VAT refunds.  This year a major refurbishing project is being considered for the theatre and I understand that the VAT refund could mean as much as £46,000 in the current year; but by virtue of the fact that they are exempt rather than zero-rated they cannot claim that amount.  While they are saving £20,000 on the 5 per cent VAT exemption they will lose this year £46,000.  I understand that in an average year they will lose £30,000.  Even if the Minister increased the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent this year the theatre would be £6,000 better off than by being exempt.</P>
    <P>This is a technical matter.  Up to now I did not understand the difference between exemption and zero-rating.  I found the Minister's reply to my letter about this matter unsatisfactory.  It appears that the Minister did not remove VAT from theatres as a cultural effort to help theatres and live performances but because if he did not exempt them he would have to increase the rate to 10 per cent.  He was afraid of the flak that would result if he increased the rate to 10 per cent.  The Minister decided to exempt theatres without considering the effect on them.</P>
    <P>The VAT change will affect theatres more than live musical performances that are staged in different areas.  Those involved in live performances would not have the same opportunity of claiming VAT refunds as theatres.  Theatres could claim a VAT refund for different jobs carried out in the theatre before but they cannot do that now because they are exempt from VAT.  Will the Minister tell the house why he cannot zero-rate theatres? <Col N="1005" /> Is something preventing him doing so? Is my information about zero-rating and exemption wrong?  I hope the Minister will explain the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his budget speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The changes which I will propose today have been carefully designed to have the maximum possible beneficial effect on employment.</P>
      <P>I read that slowly so that there would not be any doubt what the Minister said on 30 January in his budget speech.  He told us that the changes were designed to have the maximum possible beneficial effect on employment; but, a few months on, I should like to know what beneficial effect the Minister was talking about.  Surely he must realise that some of the proposals in the section under discussion have had the opposite effect, particularly in regard to the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said in his budget speech &mdash; it was divided so handsomely into two sections, the first a public relations exercise indicating massive goodies people were led to believe they would aspire to in the second section &mdash; under the heading, Relief for Building:</P>
      <P>In order to reduce the effect on the building industry of the increase in its rate of VAT, the Government will introduce a number of special measures.</P>
      <P>I do not know what special measures the Minister intended or if they have been introduced.  The construction industry is aware, and the Minister should be aware from the many submissions he has been given by the federation, by public representatives who called to him on behalf of that industry, and from the contributions of Members of this side of the House, the effect his proposals have had on an already ailing industry.  The industry had been decimated up to January and has been further damaged by what the Minister described as special measures introduced for the benefit of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody, that is everybody with the exception of the Minister and the Government, must be aware of the plight <Col N="1006" /> of the building industry.  The ridiculousness of the doubling of the rate of VAT on housebuilding by the Minister in his budget should be entered into the Guinness Book of Records for its insensitivity. Even allowing that anybody can make a mistake &mdash; the person who never made a mistake never made anything &mdash; and allowing that the Minister made an error of judgment in doubling the VAT on house building, he has not done anything since he introduced his budget to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>We had hoped that the Minister would see the light and the effect of the doubling of the rate of VAT on house building materials.  We had thought the Minister would restore the VAT rate to 5 per cent. We are unhappy that the Minister has sternly opposed any suggestion from anybody who knows anything about the construction industry about reducing the VAT rate.  For the construction industry all other provisions in the budget have been overshadowed by the proposed increase which will have disastrous and far-reaching effects on the building industry.  The Minister has been told that it will undoubtedly put some contractors out of business.  The Minister must be aware that since the beginning of this year at least 14 house building contractors have been deregistered.  The effect of the doubling of the VAT was surely one of the principal reasons for their going out of business.</P>
    <P>This increase will escalate the cost of new houses.  A house costing £25,000 plus the 10 per cent VAT will now cost £26,190; a house costing £30,000 will increase by £1,428 giving it a new selling price of £31,428.  As we go up the scale the increase becomes greater.  That occurred when the economy was at its lowest level since the mid-1950's under a Coalition Government.  Surely the Minister in discussions with the representatives of the construction industry must have been made aware that they have not suffered so badly since the dark days of the mid-1950's under a Coalition Government. Our depressed economy is the result of policies being pursued by this <Col N="1007" /> Government.  The Government have totally ignored our promptings and encouragements and the advice given to them by people with practical knowledge in Government and practical knowledge in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>A Government never had so many advisers as this one.  Some of those advisers should be made redundant like all the other people who have been made redundant since this Government came to office because their advice is having far-reaching, damaging effects on the economy generally and more seriously on the construction industry.  The construction industry is the best vehicle to create employment at little cost.  Many of the raw materials used in building are home produced.  The basic materials, sand, gravel and so on, are a natural resource.  Do the Government realise even at this stage the value of the construction industry and its spin-off industries? Why are the Government not encouraging the development of the construction industry to create employment? What is the Government's thinking, when they can allow this vital industry to be so severely restricted?  One of the first acts of this Government on coming to power in 1982 was to take £200 million out of the capital programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>The increase in the grant for first time house buyers from £1,000 to £1,750 was an announcement made by <Col N="1008" /> the Government, only short of trumpets blaring.  That will go nowhere near making up for the increased cost due to the VAT increase even in the case of lower priced houses.  An increase of £750 will not cover the lowest increase I quoted which was £1,190.  When will this Government get off the stage with their public relations exercises trying to persuade the public that by adding £750 to the grant it will make up for an increase of £1,190 on a £25,000 house?  Despite the juggling of figures, no propaganda will distort the facts.  The Government can fool some of the people some of the time but cannot fool all the people all the time.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the increase will further widen the gap between the purchase price of the house and the loan available. It must be remembered that only 60 per cent of purchasers qualify for the first time grant.  Forty per cent of purchasers do not qualify for one reason or another and 40 per cent accounts for a significant number of house buyers.  It would be as well for the Government to remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have the Government realised that the increase in VAT will reduce the amount of Government and local authority work which can be done since it will now cost more to build any project?  This will affect all aspects of public work including schools and local authority houses.  The increase in VAT means an effective reduction of approximately £50 million in the public capital programme.  The Minister talked about reducing the VAT on concrete blocks as a help to the construction industry.  What naivete.  The increased VAT will also encourage further activity in the black economy.  The difference between VAT charged on materials and VAT payable by registered contractors has been reduced and even eliminated in the case of some materials and this will increase activity in the black economy.  The effects of the items I have outlined can only lead to reduced demand, reduced employment, when already 50 per cent of operatives, trades people and professional people attached to the construction industry are out of <Col N="1009" /> work.  Nevertheless, I keep reminding the Minister that the changes he proposes were carefully designed to have the maximum possible beneficial effect on employment.  In order to reduce the effect on the building industry of the increased rate of VAT, the Government will introduce special measures.  Maybe these measures will be announced when the Minister is replying.  Up to now neither I nor anybody else on this side of the House or in the construction industry or any of the operatives are aware of the measures to be introduced to maintain existing employment in the construction industry and to restore to it the proud tradition, the quality of service to the economy that it had until this Government came into power in December 1982 after the November election when right away confidence disappeared in the building industry, and the effects continue to be apparent day after day.</P>
    <P>Depending on circumstances, house purchasers may have to pay the increased cost due to VAT but will not be able to avail of the increased grants.  As I have indicated, that number in my reckoning comes to about 40 per cent.  At present the workforce in that industry are 50 per cent unemployed.  The budget was introduced on 13 January and since the start of this year that trend of increased unemployment in the industry has continued unabated and all the indications are that more and more construction workers will be on the dole queues between now and the end of this year.  Everybody knows that at this time of the year construction projects normally begin to avail of fine whether and this would have the immediate effect of giving employment to the trades people, the general operatives, right down to the man who puts on the last brushful of paint.  Now projects are completed and very few projects are starting up.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the professional people in the construction industry.  Anybody who has knowledge of the industry knows that for projects to commence, work on the design stage, the bill of quantities <Col N="1010" /> and so on must be done by professional people between 12 months and two years prior to the commencement date. We are all aware of the numbers of professional people who are not working at the drawing boards at this time, who are not studying the quantities, who are not doing the surveys.  If and when these people get back to work we are talking about a start-up date to show the effect of their work 12 months and in some cases two years afterwards.  How long will it take builders' suppliers firms so carefully developed over the years to supply the needs and services to the construction industry?  Some such concerns have no representatives at all on the road now and many of them have reduced their counter staffs to the minimum because of the reduction in demand. These are simple, basic facts.  Why can the Government not see this?  Have the people who are advising the Government, be they civil servants or outside, put their heads in the sand that they do not see what is happening?  While all this is having immediate effects on employment within the industry the full effect of the lack of confidence in the industry and the drastic effect of this doubling of the rate of VAT will not be felt until the third quarter of this year when the projects that are now nearing completion will be completed and no new projects will commence despite all the work that is there to be done.</P>
    <P>The trend in the reduction in the number of new private houses being built was aggravated by the doubling of VAT and is accelerating.  Let me be parochial and quote the figures of housebuilding in my constituency.  The number of new private houses completed there in 1981 was 2,486.  In 1983 it was down to 1,700 and in 1984 it was 1,313.  That is a clear indication, if such is needed, to the people responsible, of where we are going with housebuilding.  It is difficult to be accurate at this time of the year but I forecast that the number of private houses to be completed in 1985 will be very much below last year's level.  The real effect of the budget on housing construction <Col N="1011" /> will not be felt until 1986. Another significant thing could happen in 1986 when the real effect of the doubling of VAT on housebuilding will be shown.  I am sure that will be when Fianna Fáil return to Government.  We are hoping for that not just for our own sake but for the nation's sake and for the sake of the industry because they know and can tell anybody who wishes to listen to them that when Fianna Fáil were in government the construction industry was always, in their own words, flying, up and away.  With Coalition Governments they are even below the bottom.</P>
    <P>I have said that the effect of this silly, ill-conceived, unconsidered doubling of VAT on housebuilding had put at least 14 construction companies out of business. Hundreds of these firms are suffering because of closures.  Sub-contractors are very badly affected as every public representative &mdash; except those on the Government side &mdash; knows.  This is particularly true of those self-employed who are servicing the construction industry and do not qualify for unemployment benefit, redundancy payments or any of the social welfare benefits.  Do the Government realise the difficulties these people are facing?  Have they any conception of what is happening?  When will they wake up and bring some semblance of reality into their policies and operations? The effect of the doubling of the VAT rate to 10 per cent cannot be over-stressed. Actions speak louder than words.  It is very difficult to find words to describe the Government's inaction at a time when action is needed to restore the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The Government's document is ominously titled <i>Building on Reality</i>.  How unreal can the Government be when the building industry is being decimated, is being bludgeoned into inactivity, because there is a lack of incentive and encouragement for those involved in this industry? But the sledgehammer blow must be the doubling of the VAT rate on house building from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to accept what we are saying in <Col N="1012" /> the interests of thousands of workers. Allowing for the fact that we are approaching 20 June, this Government should encourage the workers in the building industry and the supporting services. They should throw them a lifeline and maybe, just maybe, this will be seen as one of the most effective public relations exercises we are likely to see from the Government.  The people from Cape Clear to Malin, from Clifden to Ireland's Eye, abhor this Government's policies. Throw a lifeline to the building industry. Remove the doubling of VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  This would be worth all the handouts, all the goodies and all the public relations exercises we will see from now until 20 June.  I ask the Minister and the Government very seriously to consider this section of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

      <P>May I make a general comment about the VAT rates which I believe have helped people to understand the VAT system?  This has simplified the system for people in business, industry and commerce.  The move towards the three rates, and hopefully one or two rates, is wise and prudent and has been welcomed.  Inevitably there will be difficulties when VAT changes are made because certain categories will be regraded upwards or certain sections which were previously exempt from VAT or who paid lower rates may find that they are now eligible to pay VAT.  They are the people we will hear about in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons referred to the building industry.  We all know that industry is going through a very difficult time but that did not start when this Government took office.  There is a world recession.  It would be more beneficial to the building industry and the country at large if we got away from the idea that if one party or other were in government things would be different.  A change in government does not mean that the new party will bring a pot of gold with them.  There are no leprechauns in this House as far as I know who can produce pots of gold to pay out this extra money.  It is time to stop this nonsense. <Col N="1013" /> The building industry held a very good briefing session for Deputies before Christmas.  I was not able to attend but I got their written documentation.  I doubt if any non-party card carrying members of the building industry taking an objective view of the problems they face would say that changing a party from one side of the House to the other will solve their problems because it will not.</P>
    <P>The doubling of the new house grant from £1,000 to £2,000 has helped to remove many of the difficulties which arise because of the changes in VAT rates.  In addition to that grant is the £5,000 grant to tenants of local authority houses or flats with three years standing, who surrender their local authority house or flat and buy their own house.  That is a great incentive.  Already I have assisted a great number of people to apply for this grant and many local authority tenants have surrendered their flats and houses and bought their own dwellings.  This has to be a boost for the building industry. There are people who can qualify for the £5,000 grant for surrendering their local authority house or flat, the £2,000 new house grant and the £3,000 subsidy, £10,000 in grants, to buy their own houses.  This move has been brought in by this Government in the middle of a recession.  Let us cut out the tripe about one side of the House being more avuncular than the other to the building industry. I should like to see a more liberal view taken of who qualifies for the grant of £5,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If we took a more liberal view in that regard it would work wonders for the building industry and local authorities.  The VAT changes have cushioned the building industry to some extent.  Perhaps a toll could be applied to house or other building and if the building industry could come up with more suggestions, we might help employment in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the newspaper industry welcomes the changes in VAT.  However, <Col N="1014" /> we must ask if the newspaper industry is giving the sort of employment it has traditionally given and if the changes in VAT will be reflected in the number of people employed in the newspaper industry or will it be simply reflected in the size of dividends paid to newspaper owners?  Let us be constructive and objective in this regard.  We depend on the media for reporting events but these are people of integrity and we respect their independence.  If the newspaper industry is to have a zero rating, there should be an arrangement that they will maintain a certain level of employment and that we are not just providing an added dividend for newspaper owners. They should not be allowed to use the money for buying new machinery to the detriment of employment.  The Minister should give some thought to deregistering newspapers rather than bringing them down to a zero rate.  Deregistration would not cost the Exchequer very much and would be a great help to the industry. However, in return for any moves in that direction we should be seeking the protection of employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in regard to VAT on theatre tickets and I should like the Minister to extend this facility to cinemas. The cinemas bring people into the city at night and keep it alive.  It also helps to keep down the crime rate and perhaps the Minister could extend the facility to cinemas.  Dublin Corporation have taken expensive steps to provide housing in the inner city and changes in the rate of VAT on theatre and cinema tickets can certainly help to keep the city alive.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity of making a short contribution on the most penal section of the 1985 Finance Bill.  Everybody accepts that there are difficulties facing the Minister for Finance in preparing a budget and the various ways by which he must produce revenue.  It is a long process and many submissions are made, some of a vested interest nature, covering building and many other facets.  Submissions will also be made from within the Minister's party, <Col N="1015" /> the Civil Service and by many well meaning and well intentioned people throughout the country.  I am sure that, among the groups I mentioned, nobody submitted that he should increase VAT on footwear, the building industry or clothes. I suspect that even his colleagues in Government would not have suggested these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell made a very strong case as to why the 5 per cent rate should not be doubled for the building industry. He outlined their difficulties and said that they had to be faced up to.  If Deputy Mitchell is honest in continuing his argument, he will agree that a Minister for Finance should not introduce such a penal measure.  The Minister obviously does not realise the serious consequences it will have on an industry which has served the country well through good times and bad.  We have always been told that the building industry is a barometer of the economy.  The Minister said that the difficulties of the industry are being overcome because they have increased the public capital spending programme. The problem is&mdash;and the Minister knows this&mdash;that increasing the public capital spending programme does not, unfortunately, necessarily mean one extra job because automation and mechanisation have taken over to a large extent and the number of jobs are decreasing each year. This imposition on building is hitting most at the people who have been traditionally employed in that industry.  It had its tough, difficult origins, it was known as the hire and fire industry.  Luckily, because of organisation at worker and management level, it became a much better organised industry and gave good, steady employment in addition to providing the badly needed infrastructure of society, housing, roads, bridges and so on.  The industry gave good, strong, steady employment to fathers of families which allowed them to live in reasonable comfort and provided them with a worth-while income in a steady secure job.  They worked hard.  Many of them served long apprenticeships.  The Minister will be regarded as the person who sounded the <Col N="1016" /> death knell of the industry.  He was ill-advised to do that.  I am sure no submission was made to him, but he must have had consultations.  The argument that it is in the interest of harmonising taxes or reducing the number of groups is not adequate for all the people who are unemployed and those who will be unemployed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I said in this House that in my own city and county the building industry was on its knees and that by October it would be flat on its face. Nothing I have seen or heard in the intervening weeks has changed my opinion.  I believe it will be flat on its face by the end of the year unless there is an urgent change of direction by the Government. It is tragic to see so many people losing their jobs.  Places like Verolme in Cork provided employment for many skilled people.  Men are now coming into my clinics and asking me how they can get to projects in the Middle East.  These are all fathers of families.  This is tragic.  It is forced emigration on a scale which will grow and grow while the Government continue with their present policies.</P>
    <P>I could go into great detail about the excellent character of the people who worked in the building industry.  I had long associations with the industry in my pre-political days.  It was not the easiest of work but they were hardworking, good people who contributed to the welfare of the State.  They played their part in society.  They built their own homes and became part of the community.  They reared families and tried to educate them.  Now they see their jobs being eroded.  With the help of the European Social Fund we invested substantially in training young people, and rightly so. There was great co-operation between trade unions, employers and successive Governments to ensure that the best possible training skills were available for our young people.  How right that was.  It was true in particular in relation to building crafts.  The standard of workmanship and skill implanted in those young people was very high.  What is the future for those fine young people who have been trained?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> The Minister's decision on the building, industry was wrong.  He would be making a very wise decision if he decided to change it.  We often have U turns but the Minister would be very wise if he reversed the 5 per cent decision for the sake of the many jobs which could be provided in the industry.  I welcome and encourage the decision about the person living in a local authority house.  The increase in the grant is but a fraction of the added increase in costs because of the 5 per cent.  The Minister would make a very big name for himself if he changed direction on that one.</P>
    <P>I referred to the increase in the price of footwear and clothing for adults.  The increase in the cost of footwear is very substantial.  It was zero rated prior to the budget and it is now rated at 10 per cent. That imposes a substantial charge on families who are already hard hit by the recession which is deeper than anybody expected.  The Government are tending to plan in direct opposition to how jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>In the British Conservative party 20, 30 or 40 solid party members have decided that the British Prime Minister is on the wrong course.  Our Taoiseach and Government are trying to out-Thatcher Mrs. Thatcher.  Those solid sensible people consider that there should be a change of plan by their government. The Minister should consider my appeal to reverse the 5 per cent decision on the building industry.</P>

Deputy Mac Giolla has put down amendments which would reduce revenue by £145 million in a full year.

      <P>It includes food, electricity, books, medicine and medical aids, children's clothing and footwear, and the vast majority of the goods which were in the 23 per cent rate up to the time of the budget.  Products that are subject now to great reductions or exemptions include all of the former 35 per cent rated products. The reduction in the first year in VAT revenue from that move is £67 million. There is a reduction also in the rates applying to newspapers, hotel accommodation, car hire and concrete blocks and there is an exemption in the case of theatre.  The reduction in revenue in respect of these changes for the first year will be £14.1 million.  In areas where there are increases in the rates, first, there is <Col N="1020" /> building.  The increase in revenue from the change in that respect is £42,500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The changes in the rate in respect of car repairs will result in an increase in revenue of £2,500,000 while the increase in respect of the change in the rate in fuel will be £9.4 million.  The additional 2 per cent on adult clothing increases the revenue by £5.7 million while the bringing of adult footwear into the VAT net at 10 per cent will raise £6.9 million in the first year.  The net effect of all that so far is to reduce VAT revenue by £14.2 million.</P>
      <P>There is a further £6,500,000 reduction from the deferment of the application of the 10 per cent rate of VAT on private housing from 1 May.  The net effect of the increase in revenue resulting from reductions in the ratings, from purchases diverted back here from north of the Border and from the first year or one-off loss in terms of VAT at the point of entry represents a net increase of £5 million in revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall total effect of all these measures is to reduce VAT revenue in the first year by almost £16 million.  The reorganisation in itself has dynamic effects which are worth-while achieving and which can be achieved for a revenue loss of the order I have outlined.  Deputy O'Kennedy returned to what is apparently one of his favourite diversions of confusing tax rates with tax take.  Properly he produced a copy of the table for current revenue, 1984-85, and read from that that the 1984 outturn in revenue from VAT is £1,361.6 million and that the post-budget estimate for 1985 is £483.9 million.  The Deputy says that means there is a 9 per cent increase in VAT revenue, that there is a 6 per cent inflation rate and that consequently there must be a real increase in the VAT burden.  That is utter nonsense.  The increase in VAT revenue reflects a number of different factors.  First, inflation has an effect on VAT revenue.  If the price of goods <Col N="1021" /> increases and if VAT is being charged on a percentage basis, it follows that VAT revenue increases, too.  Inflation will not add a lot this year because we expect price increases to be a little less than 6 per cent.  Therefore, with an unchanged base and with a general price inflation of 6 per cent, there would be an increase of about 6 per cent in revenue without any change in the rates and without changing the base.  That does not represent an increase in the burden of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

Deputy Mitchell expressed the hope that this was a step along the road to a single rate of VAT.  That is something we will have to think about but in any event there is a reduction in the overall burden.</P>

I am perfectly prepared to agree with the Deputies on the other side that there were two rates in the system which I brought in.  One was the 8 per cent rate on clothing, which was part of the process of bringing clothing into the system, and the other was the 18 per cent rate on hotel accommodation, having given a reduction previously as a relief in order to assist that sector.</P>

Since then there have been no new rates introduced whatsoever, so Deputies may take it quite seriously when I say that I am, to an extent, following the advice given by the Commission on Taxation there.</P>
      <P>I dealt with Deputy O'Kennedy's continuing difficulty in distinguishing between tax rates and tax take.  He made a number of remarks about the effect of these measures on specific industries. Indeed, a number of other Deputies mentioned this also.  They mentioned, for example, the effect on the footwear industry of an increase in our VAT rate. The rate of VAT on footwear in this country is not the rate that affects our footwear industry.  Most of the footwear manufactured here is exported.  Indeed, the firm to which Deputy O'Dea referred exported, as far as I am aware, over 90 per cent of their production to the UK. The rate of VAT that affects most employees in Irish footwear manufacturing enterprises is the 15 per cent rate charged in the UK, not our rate.  Deputies are picking the wrong targets.</P>

Of course, VAT will affect domestic production sold here, there is no doubt about that, but by far a more important influence on the Irish footwear industry is the rate of VAT charged in the market to which they are exported, which is the UK.

      <P>There was comment on the effects on the building industry of the VAT changes.  I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald who said that we have been told for years that the building industry is the barometer of the economy.  That may well be.  We all use barometers to tell us what the weather is like and what the climate is doing to us, but there is one <Col N="1027" /> sure thing and that is that you are not going to improve the climate by tinkering around with the barometer.  There is a principle there that Deputies on the other side of the House should remember.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have absolutely no difficulty whatever in accepting that the building industry is a very important part of our economy.  Nor have I any difficulty in accepting that for many reasons there should be a very high public input into the construction sector.  That is why, taking this year's public capital programme, some £7 out of every £10 spent on construction here is public money provided by the taxpayer or borrowed on behalf of the taxpayer by the Exchequer through the public capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not a massive commitment to building and construction, I do not know what is.  In addition, the total amount of money available in this year's public capital programme for building and construction will exceed last year's by about £180 million.  Even taking account of the effect of VAT on those bodies which cannot reclaim, where it becomes a net extra charge, there is more than enough provision in this year's programme to provide for the VAT and for extra leeway for more work to be done within the framework of the public capital programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ignore Deputy O'Kennedy's remark.  If that is all that he has to say about the Finance Bill, he is not making much of a case for himself. Deputy O'Dea asked a fairly fair question: why some of the things which Deputies had wanted me to do last year and I would not do last year are now being done this year.  I remind Deputy O'Kennedy that the VAT rate on hurleys is now reduced from 35 per cent to 23 per cent. Deputy O'Dea wondered specifically why, when I would not last year reduce the rate of VAT on newspapers, I would do it this year.  I think that was very clear last year as it is this year in relation to a number of amendments.  There are quite a number of things that I would consider desirable to do, and the Government also, but which cannot be fitted in within the budgetary constraints of a given year. That is a difficulty that we always have when discussing a budget or a Finance Bill.  Deputies in Opposition see all the desirable things.  They do not want to be saddled with making choices between what is desirable and can be done this <Col N="1029" /> year and what will have to wait for a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not want to know about the business of deciding on options or on priorities.  It was very clear that there was not room last year for a reduction in the VAT on newspapers.  That fact that we were having a fundamental re-organisation of the system this year presented us with the opportunity and occasion to do so.  I do not intend to pursue the newspapers and find out what exactly they did with the change to their revenue arising from the VAT changes. We do not have detailed price control on newspapers.  Offhand I cannot think of a way in which we could make a specific deal in relation to tax changes versus employment.  However, knowing the situation in which the major newspaper groups find themselves these days, there are very few people who will find themselves getting a lot fatter as a result of the reduction in VAT on newspapers.  I hope the extra leeway this will give them will allow them to make progress in improving their financial situation.  I do not think it would be appropriate for me to chase after them with further detailed controls or to ask them precisely what they did with the funds they have saved as a result of the change we have brought about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in favour of exempting them, which is what I think the Deputy means.  As a general rule it is better to keep newspapers and products generally within the normal VAT system rather than make exceptions in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla wondered why theatres were exempted rather than zero rated.  The choice was not between exemption and zero rating.  It was between exemption and a 10 per cent rate.  Under EC law we have no scope <Col N="1030" /> for introducing new zero rates and that applies to a number of comments made during the debate.  As I have told the House on previous occasions, if anything, we are under pressure from the EC to restrict the scope of our zero rates and I do not intend to add to the pressure that is on me from that point of view by bringing in new zero rates and thereby stirring up a hornet's nest.</P>
    <P>That covers the main substance of the remarks made by speakers on the opposite side of the House.  The VAT structure now is a more efficient and constructive one than what we had before.  A further simplification in future years would be desirable.  I have my own views about where I would start but I do not intend to bring them into this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister has given misleading information to the House regarding the amount of the public capital programme.  He said there was a sufficient increase in the money allocation for the public capital programme to absorb the VAT increase.  I put it to him that in the public capital programme affecting the construction industry there is in real terms a drop of 3.5 per cent before one takes into consideration the increase in VAT which the Minister has added.  Following the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the VAT rate, there wil be a drop in real terms of 6.5 per cent in the public capital programme affecting the construction industry.  If that is so, how can the Minister say he has provided a sufficient increase in moneys for the public capital programme to absorb the VAT increase which, on his own estimation, will amount to an extra £42 million of a burden on building in respect of VAT.  In fact, even in money terms the increase in the public capital programme affecting the construction industry is only £39 million as compared with last year. That is the amount in money terms but in real terms there is a 6.5 per cent drop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Minister who can say that the impact of increasing consumption is being taken into account in the levels and yield from VAT is capable of making any outrageous statement.  All the evidence is that consumption is dropping considerably for obvious reasons such as the growth in unemployment, continuing emigration and the economic depression.  The figures demonstrate that the Minister is not relying on buoyancy based on consumption.  He is relying on buoyancy based on increasing VAT levels.  If he is going to increase the VAT take by 9 per cent this year, he cannot get away from that fact by referring to increased consumption and that kind of nonsense.  When one considers that inflation will probably be about 6 per cent, it is obvious the VAT take will be at least 3 per cent more this year in real terms than last year.  The section singled out for crucifixion is the building industry where the Minister is proposing to take an extra £42.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to disappoint the Deputy but all the forecasts agree on a projection that the volume of private consumption expenditure will be up by about 2 per cent this year.  There is no way that that will not have an effect on VAT revenue.  When that is added to the effect on prices, one gets a double effect that will increase the amount of VAT revenue by more than the rate of inflation.  The overall effective rate of VAT will be slightly less this year than last year.  It will apply to a bigger base which will have been increased by the increase both in the volume of consumption and prices.  That is where the increase in total VAT revenue comes from.</P>

      <P>In relation to the reply of the Minister with regard to newspapers and the theatre, I fail to see how an argument that can be applied to the theatre in respect of exemption, and therefore deregistration, cannot be applied to the newspaper industry.  The Minister gave a one-line reply to that suggestion.  He spoke of people being outside the VAT area but the same argument could apply to the theatre.  I am sure the Minister has not got it in mind to increase VAT rates on newspapers at some time in the future.  I cannot see why exemption and deregistration could not be given to newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The Deputy has misunderstood the position.  The system is one that has been introduced and is operated by the Department of Finance in relation to the whole range of public spending by Departments and in relation also to tax receipts.  It involves the setting out of a profile of the likely breakdown, month by month throughout the year, of the revenue estimate and expenditure for the year under a large number of headings.  It makes it possible each month, cumulatively, to compare actual revenue and actual expenditure with the profile up to that point.  The results of these cumulative studies are in fact communicated publicly at the end of each quarter.  The interim figures are available to the Government for checking the position for the period within each quarter.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated at a meeting in Cork that he has available to him, and that they are of importance and significance, monthly figures which monitor the emerging budgetary position. I want to ask him if he is prepared to make those monthly figures available to the House.  Naturally, the House and the general public are very interested in the manner in which the budgetary situation is developing.  If the Taoiseach has these figures &mdash; he told the people of Cork that he had them and that they were significant, important and helpful &mdash; why is it that he will not make them available to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are of internal use to the Government in the intervening period.  The fact that we now have them enables us to avoid the kind of incredible overruns of expenditure or underruns of revenue which led to deficits running into hundreds of millions of pounds greater than those forecast by the Leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach.  The system we now have is one which in its operation has enabled us to control the budget within £60 million of the budget deficit forecast.  The method is operating satisfactorily and is reported upon in public at quarterly intervals.  We intend to continue that practice.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach cannot resist any temptation to be tendentious and politically insulting.  I am asking a simple straightforward question.  The Taoiseach acknowledges that he has this information, monthly information, available to him and the Government as to the manner in which the budgetary situation is developing.  I am entitled to demand that if that information is available to the Government it should be made available to the House.  I cannot see why the Taoiseach will not make it available.  Does it disclose some very damaging and unsatisfactory position?  If so, we should know it.  The Taoiseach, when he was elected here some time ago, indicated that he was always going to go in for open Government and disclose everything but now we have him this <Col N="1040" /> afternoon refusing to answer legitimate parliamentary questions and not disclosing valuable, important and crucial information about the budget which is available to him.</P>

      <P>The total cost involved in preparing the reports of the Sectoral Development and Sectoral Consultative Committees on the beef industry, including the cost of the consultancy report prepared by GIRA SA, and associated expenses amounted to £147,400.</P>
      <P>The Sectoral Development Committee is an independent tripartite committee established in 1981 and representative of employer-industry bodies, the trade union movement and Government Departments and State agencies.  The committee was established to evaluate and report on the current problems and potential for development of economic sectors and encompassed the proposals for sectoral industrial committees which were agreed between the employer organisations, ICTU and the then Government as set out in the First National Understanding for Economic and Social Development.  The committee, in operation, is independent of the Government.  The work of the committee is funded mainly from an allocation from the Employer Guarantee Fund. The Employer Guarantee Fund was established under the First National Understanding of 1979 and was initially jointly funded by employers and by the Government.  Arising out of the Second National Understanding an additional contribution to the fund was made by the Exchequer in 1981.  Allocations from the fund were made following consultation with employer and industry and trade union bodies.</P>

This is a good point to raise in the House because very often there is no penalty in the case of lesions.

I made it clear at Question Time yesterday that on disease issues we had plotted our course for the next three years.  The Deputy suggested that we might have some latitude with regard to partial depopulation.  One can find good reasons to do a lot of other things as well but the fact is that the funding has been set out and has been earmarked to do a certain job and there is little latitude within the present scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in his initial reply to this question that 151 animals in 1984 got the basic reactor grant.  Could the Minister say how many animals did not qualify for the grant and who got the minimum <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £50 and who did not get any <i>ex gratia</i> payment?  Does the Minister realise that an animal proving inconclusive initially, going down to the factory and proving to have TB lesions means that the farmers' herd is locked up and he is subject to the same standards and criteria as if initially the animal proved to be a reactor?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak in question resulted from the rapid spread of infection from a residue of TB in the area. Spread was facilitated by inadequate boundary fencing, intermingling of herds and the use of common water supplies. The outbreak has now been brought under control and the payment of special compensation to herdowners in the area is not envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there was a serious outbreak of TB in this area where 257 in-calf cows went down with TB, special compensation should be made available to farmers. Some of the inspectors in the Department in Tralee could not come up with a reason <Col N="1048" /> why those cows came down with TB.  The Minister suggests a water supply but the feeling in Tralee is that the water supply was not the cause of the spread and special compensation should be made available to the farmers especially in view of the fact that there are very small farmers in the area owning only ten and 15 cows each.</P>

It is now under control and the good news is that quite a number of the restricted herds will be cleared shortly.  Where there was depopulation the farmers will get a depopulation grant of £100 per animal up to £6,000 and they will also get a restocking grant of £400 per animal.  That is the best I can do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Compensation has always been inadequate.  Compensation for disease is never adequate and I never said it was.  I will run briefly through the existing compensation provisions: cows and in-calf heifers non-pedigree, £225; <Col N="1049" /> pedigree, £285; other cattle under 182 kg, non-pedigree, £210; pedigree, £250, other cattle over 182 kg non-pedigree, £85; pedigree, £125.  The depopulation fund, £100 per qualifying animal subject to a maximum of £6,000.</P>
      <P>That depopulation would include animals which were removed from the herd in the previous 12 months. The stock replacement scheme as announced recently is intended to provide further relief for herd owners who have to depopulate because of heavy disease infection. Payment is at the rate of £40 in respect of each animal on which a depopulation payment has already been made. The payment will be £60 per head where a herd owner who was in dairying opts for an alternative type of animal husbandry &mdash; for instance sheep or tillage.</P>

Can the Minister of State indicate whether a farmer who loses a small number of animals on one test and subsequently loses a small number of animals on every three, four, five or six subsequent tests, and eventually loses half or all his herd, will be paid right from the very start from the first test either the depopulation or the restocking grants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said during the last few days, it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of an outbreak.  One thing seems to be quite clear.  Where an outbreak takes place in a region as distinct from a farm it would appear to be lateral spread of disease.  The practice of selling off animals to traders who very often do not deliver on time to factories and often let diseased animals out to pasture and all that sort of thing has contributed to the spread of bovine TB.  One could say that we are all at fault here, that nobody is taking it seriously enough.  If we are to get rid of this disease that will mean an enthusiastic campaign by the Department, the veterinary surgeons and the farmers.  I hope that, with the drive to get rid of TB, farmers in areas such as referred to by the Deputy will get together as a group and admit that they have a problem and then go about taking every precaution to solve it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>On accession to the European Communities we were obliged to accept the Community legislation in regard to imports of live animals and meat but we were afforded a temporary derogation to maintain our own national controls until the end of 1977.  We subsequently obtained extensions of the derogation until the end of 1982, the end of 1983, June 1984 and finally December 1984.</P>
      <P>We must now apply permanent trading arrangements based on Community legislation but we are not required to dismantle all our import controls immediately as we have been given until 30 September next to adapt our legislation and to introduce the necessary inspection and other controls for imports. While the ending of the derogations will mean that we will no longer be able to prohibit imports of live animals and fresh meat, we will nevertheless be entitled to certain guarantees which will minimise the risk of importing disease and will ensure continuing access to the valuable export markets developed over the years on the basis of freedom from disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister's reply does not deal with <Col N="1059" /> reality.  Of course there are serious consequences and the Minister and his departmental officials should be aware of them in regard to our herds if this derogation is not upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly familiar with the situation because I was in Brussels when it was being worked out by our veterinary officials.  There will be no change in the case of live animals because they will be kept in quarantine and subjected to tests.  There will also be pre-export isolation.  We will only accept nonvaccinated animals and most EC countries vaccinate against foot and mouth disease.  They must also have a very intensive test for foot and mouth and a serological test before they are allowed in.  On their arrival here they are quarantined for 21 days and, if we wish, we can repeat these tests in quarantine.  All this applies to the white listed countries, including Canada.  There has been no incidence of foot and mouth in the EC due to trade in fresh meat.  The Community rules have proved adequate to protect member states from foot and mouth in trade of fresh or processed meat.  Where an outbreak occurs in certain member states we are entitled to certain guarantees in regard to maturation and deboning until 31 March 1987.  By &ldquo;maturation&rdquo; I mean that meat will have to be hung for a certain length of time and deboned meat is considered safe.</P>

The Deputy will be glad to know that for the last two years they have broken even or made a small profit mainly due to the fact that, in conjunction with An Foras Talúntais, they developed the new varieties, Cara and Clada, which are highly successful, especially in Egypt, Cyprus, Portugal, Israel and Spain.</P>

Grant aid is available under the farm modernisation scheme for onion storage <Col N="1062" /> facilities and aid is also available for the formation of producer groups.</P>

      <P>Some of our growers had a few bad years because of disease and other problems which caused them to move into other areas, but the Deputy will be glad to know that something is being done about it.  The main problem is that there is a very short growing season, including the difficult period of spring weather.  The Sugar Company, with help from some of our advisers, have now developed the technique of growing the seed under plastic and then transplanting which should certainly help the commercial production of onions.</P>

It is noteworthy that in the Netherlands funds for the promotion of agricultural products are provided by the industry itself rather than by the State.

      <P>I have received notice from the Taoiseach that he proposes to make a statement under Standing Order 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I feel it is appropriate that I report to the House on the outcome of my visit to Canada and the United States over the last couple of weeks.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that it was both a busy and a very successful visit, and one which I believe will contribute substantially to furthering interests shared by all Members of the House, especially the interest we have in the major issues of peace on our island and progress towards the goal of reducing unemployment.</P>
      <P>A highlight of the journey was, of course, my official visit to Canada at the invitation of the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Brian Mulroney.  This was the first such official visit by a Taoiseach since 1949 and I was very warmly received by Mr. Mulroney and the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr. Joe Clark, at the Federal House of Commons in Ottawa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relations between Ireland and Canada have not, in my view, been sufficiently developed over the past 35 years despite the many common bonds of history we share and the numbers of our people who have made their homes there.  My visit improved the understanding and cordiality of the relationship between Ireland and Canada.  This process will develop <Col N="1105" /> further when the Prime Minister, Mr. Mulroney, makes his visit to Ireland at my invitation some time in the future.</P>
    <P>At my meeting with the Prime Minister we discussed the recent Summit of major industrial countries in Bonn, from which he had just returned, with particular reference to the emerging danger of protectionism as it could affect our countries and world trade generally.  I explained to the Prime Minister the current position of the Northern Ireland dialogue and was extremely glad to hear from him that he would be prepared to contribute to the maximum of his ability to any steps which we might find it possible to devise, leading to a peaceful and durable arrangement in that area.</P>
    <P>We discussed other matters of mutual interest including the supply of Irish beef to the Canadian , industrial development policy  Canada and Ireland, budgetary arrangements and strategies and the exchange rate policies in both countries.  We also discussed East-West relations and world trade.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with Secretary of State Clark, we talked in some detail on Central America and on the Middle East, including the place of UNIFIL there, and the role of the Irish contingent in that force.  I invited the Secretary of State to Ireland for further discussion between our two countries, on the major aspects of foreign policy in which our two countries have a common interest.  Arrangements are in hand to formalise contacts on certain of these aspects to an even greater degree.</P>
    <P>I briefed the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Canadian media on the achievement of the parties to the Forum report which I presented as the first real movement made by any of the three parties to the crisis: the British, the Unionists and the Nationalists in Ireland. I will be returning to this topic later in my statement as it refers to various aspects of my work both in the United States of America as well as in Canada.</P>
    <P>In a message after my departure from Canada I remarked on the fact that so much of our time in the discussions, both <Col N="1106" /> with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, was devoted to issues of peace, both in Northern Ireland and in other parts of the world, reflecting the particular vocation of our two countries to peace.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this topic, I feel obliged to express my revulsion at the comment from Fianna Fail made on the first day of my official visit to Canada, referring to engagements &ldquo;of no consequence&rdquo;.  This graceless remark can be interpreted only as a gratuitous insult to the people and Government of Canada, and is one which I hope Fianna Fail have come to regret &mdash; and for which the Leader of that party may, perhaps, wish to express contrition in his statement later.  I remain eternally optimistic.</P>
    <P>In relation to one of the two major themes of my trip, namely the question of attracting foreign investment to Ireland, and the jobs it can create, I am glad to be able to tell the house of two very successful meetings with leading American industrialists.  The first of these was in New York on Thursday, 2 May when I met a group that included the chairman of a dozen of the 100 largest corporations in the United States, including several of the biggest companies of all.  In Boston on 6 May I met the leaders of 20 companies from the New England area, most of whom are discussing projects with the IDA.</P>
    <P>Many of the companies whose chairman or chief executives I met are now in the process of deciding to locate projects in Ireland.  The projects now at the final stages of decision-making involve over 1,000 jobs, despite Deputy Haughey. Many other companies I met are involved in serious discussions about prospects for future investment in Ireland, and several of my discussions were with chief executives of companies already located here who are considering the possibility of expansion.</P>
    <P>The importance of these kinds of contact cannot be overestimated.  Ministers on this side of the House, and indeed former Ministers now sitting on the benches opposite, and likely to remain there for some time, will know only too well <Col N="1107" /> how seriously such contact is taken by the companies involved.  They want to know directly from members of the Government what Government policies are and in what way they are likely to develop; how their investments are likely to be viewed in the countries in which they decide to locate; and they have questions covering a multitude of areas, ranging from industrial relations to legislation covering safety at work, which can best be dealt with at the political level.  The assurances they can receive from Government Ministers &mdash; especially from the highest level, that of Taoiseach &mdash; are often of critical importance in the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>I was able to develop for those I met, both in the United States and Canada &mdash; and in an interview devoted to this subject specifically on prime time television on the NBC To-Day Programme &mdash; a number of important points about the welcoming environment of Ireland for new industry and investment; our young and well-educated workforce who are mobile, innovative and encouraging of change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;our system of low corporate taxation accepted by all the major parties in this House and which offers industrialists a secure advantage at least to the year 2,000.  I was able to demonstrate the political stability of our State and to outline the range of grants and other facilities which are on offer for those who wish to join us in facing the future.</P>
      <P>Taking all the contacts I made together, I am confident that several thousand jobs will be developed in time. Indeed, I note with pleasure that one of the companies I met is about to announce a high technology project which will bring 145 badly-needed jobs to Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred at the start of this statement to the issue of peace on our island.  This visit presented me with an invaluable opportunity, both in Canada and the United States, as well as with the media and more general audiences, to outline the achievement of the parties to the Forum report.  I explained on every occasion that it was on the basis of the Forum report that the current Anglo-Irish dialogue is proceeding.</P>
      <P>I told the American and Canadian leaders and the audiences whom I addressed that I believed that the Forum's call for equal recognition of the rights of the nationalist and unionist traditions in Northern Ireland is the <i>sine qua non</i> for progress, and that this is, in the words I used in addressing the Press Club of Canada &ldquo;a problem which must be addressed by both governments through joint co-operative arrangements if a fair and durable solution is to be found&rdquo;&mdash; something that can be done only in the wider context of Anglo-Irish relations through the kind of discussions now proceeding between the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presented the Forum report as an expression of nationalist philosophy articulated on behalf of 90 per cent of nationalist opinion in this island, which completely cuts the ground from under the IRA and <Col N="1109" /> INLA, because it draws a clear and fundamental line between constitutional Irish nationalism and the nationalism that the terrorists have distorted and besmirched with innocent blood.  I stressed that the terrorists have thus been denied by representatives of the overwhelming majority of nationalist opinion in the island any possible shred of political legitimacy for their campaign of intimidation and murder which, in the words of one of their proponents is, as we all know, designed to move on to the `the destabilisation of the south.'.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House if I mention briefly the people I met and with whom I discussed the importance of the Forum report as I have outlined it above. Apart from Prime Minister Mulroney and his Secretary of State, I had very helpful and positive discussions with Speaker O'Neill and Senator Kennedy, Governor Dukakis of Massachussetts, Governor Cuomo of New York and Mayor Flynn of Boston.  In Boston I addressed the House of Representatives on this theme and I had a meeting with Cardinal-designate O'Connor in New York.</P>

      <P>Because of the importance to Ireland of the friendship and support of Irish Americans, I make a point on my visits to the US to have the closest possible contact with Irish American organisations.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Leader of the Opposition and as Taoiseach, I have availed of every opportunity to meet with, talk to and listen to those Irish Americans who have in so many ways shown their support for the achievement of Irish political, economic and cultural objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this visit I had an opportunity for informal contact with a representative gathering of Irish Americans at a reception in Boston.  In New York, I invited to what was in fact a very cordial meeting at our Consulate General representatives of almost a score of organisations which <Col N="1110" /> included: AFL/CIO; Irish American Labour Coalition, Ancient Order of Hibernians, United Irish Foundation, Grand Council of United Emerald Societies, The Corkmen's Association, The Kerrymen's Association.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of the Opposition I might add that in some places there seemed to be hostile querying about the fund raising activities in the US of that party but that at that meeting <Col N="1111" /> I defended them.  I have a bad conscience about that.</P>
      <P>I should say that on all of these occasions I was encouraged by the support, so evidently growing now, for solutions to the problems of Northern Ireland and which reject the doctrine of violence. There is now much more awareness of, and support for, policies which seek peace through dialogue and the democratic process.</P>
      <P>This growing perception among Irish-Americans is due in large part to the unremitting efforts of Irish leaders &mdash; including my predecessors in this office for the past 13 years or so &mdash; to sow the seeds of a commitment to dialogue and to peaceful means in all of their travels to North America.  I consider it important that I was able to further that process.</P>
      <P>In my absence abroad, the Leader of the Opposition criticised my presentation of the Forum report and of the Irish Government's position in relation to this report in the United States and Canada on the basis of press reports of my remarks at one function.  Had he checked the record he would have found that what I did at that function was, first, to quote verbatim from Paragraph 4.15 of the Forum report to which both our parties subscribe, namely,</P>
      <P>The solution to both the historic problem and the current crisis of Northern Ireland and the continuing problem of relations between Ireland and Britain, necessarily requires new structures that will accommodate together two sets of legitimate rights:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the right of nationalists to effective political, symbolic and administrative expression of their identity, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the right of unionists to effective political, symbolic and administrative expression of their identity, their ethos and their way of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then went on to say that the solution to the accommodation of these two rights has to be found in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1112" /> which is where the problem of accommodating these two sets of rights exists, not in this part of Ireland.  That is blindingly evident.  But &mdash; and here I quote the words that were omitted from the very middle of that sentence as it was published here in this country &mdash; I added &ldquo;obviously the two Governments have a fundamentally important role to play in resolving it&rdquo;.  If the Leader of the Opposition had checked, he would have ascertained that that was what I said.</P>
    <P>I then went on in the immediately following sentences to describe the acceptance of this principle by the British Prime Minister in the Chequers communique and I continued by referring to the task facing our two Governments in turning this principle into practical form in terms of actual political action on the ground; and the need for the two Governments to find together the right approach to the task.</P>
    <P>Everything I said about Northern Ireland on that occasion, as on others, related to the fact that this problem can be resolved only by the two Governments working together, not by the British Government alone acting within Northern Ireland.  No one at that meeting nor at any other meeting or discussion I had during my visit to North America could have been in any doubt about my insistence that the problem cannot be resolved within the narrow context of Northern Ireland but requires, as I reiterated over and over again, radical action by the British Government to end the alienation of the Northern nationalist minority from the system of government, the security system, and the legal-judicial system in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That the Leader of the Opposition should have chosen to launch an attack on me as Head of Government, while outside the country, on the basis of one sentence of press reports of one speech which was both taken out of its context of the Forum report and which committed the central part of the sentence itself complained of, is a measure of his gross irresponsibility so far as our national <Col N="1113" /> interest and the Northern Ireland problem are involved.</P>

This was attended by representatives of such major New York and US media as the <i>Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, Newsweek Magazine, New York Daily News, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, America Magazine,</i> and also representatives of the major television networks and in Canada I addressed the Press Club of Canada in Ottawa.  I was the guest at a luncheon hosted by the publisher of the <i>New York Times,</i> Mr. Arthur Sulzberger, at which I had an opportunity to meet the editorial board of that newspaper and to explain Irish Government policies with particular reference to the Northern Ireland situation, and I had a similar meeting in Boston with the editorial board of the <i>Christian Science Monitor.</i></P>

We discussed the situations in the Middle East, the Iran-Iraq War and its consequences, as well as the situation in South Africa and particularly Namibia.  The Secretary General outlined his views on Central America and I briefed him on the outlook in relation to Northern Ireland and the Anglo-Irish process.

      <P>In relation to the Bilderberg Meeting which I attended on 10 and 11 May in New York, the idea that this meeting represents a sinister &mdash; or even a secret &mdash; plot to undermine the neutrality of non-members of the North-Atlantic Alliance or democracy in the West would come as a very big suprise indeed to the members of government of other neutral countries &mdash; such as former <Col N="1115" /> Premier Palme of Sweden and former Chancellor Kreisky of Austria&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The purpose of establishing the Bilderberg Meetings, was in fact &ldquo;to provide an opportunity for regular off-the-record discussions which would help create a better understanding of the complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For my own part, I regard the meeting, my attendance at which was included in the programme for my North-American visit made available before my departure, as an extremely useful place at which to make contact with, or to renew contact with, influential people whose goodwill can be of considerable benefit to this country.  For instance, at this year's meeting I had useful discussions with the new Secretary General of the OECD, with Ministers of such countries as Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, with all of whom we share many interests and aspirations, and with two members of the British Cabinet, the Secretary of State for Industry and Trade, Mr. Norman Tebbitt, and the Minister without Portfolia, Lord Young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the agenda, while I missed the opening session on social and economic developments on both sides of the Atlantic, I attended a very informative session of the meeting on relations <Col N="1116" /> with developing countries.  I contributed to this debate my own view that the debt problem of some of these countries, which is as much a problem for the lending as the borrowing countries, was being given undue attention there, at the expense of recognition of the desperate need for increased aid by the least-developed countries of south-east Asia and Africa.  I also urged recognition of the scale of public support in many of the developed countries for aid, as exemplified not just by the official aid levels attained in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, but by the voluntary response in Ireland to the Ethiopian famine, which I pointed out was the equivalent to a sum of $1.5 billion in the United States.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity of listening also to informative discussions on the East-West problem, and on the US budget.  I did not attend, nor was it ever my intention to attend &mdash; although Ministers from other neutral countries did so without any problem from their point of view &mdash; a session on NATO, which took place on the last day of the conference when I was on my way home via Halifax, Nova Scotia.  There I had conferred upon me a Honorary Degree by the University of St. Mary's which since its foundation by an Irish priest has had close links with this country.  I noted with interest that of the graduates on that occasion from several faculties between a quarter and one-fifth had Irish names.</P>
    <P>Only the deepest of inferiority complexes could induce the kind of reactions that some persons have displayed to my attendance at this meeting, the participation in, and agenda of which are, incidentally, always available to the press, contrary to an impression that some people have sought to convey.  I do not share this kind of paranoia and have no intention whatever of allowing it to inhibit me from furthering our national interests by maintaining and extending the range of international contacts, which during the past decade and more I have developed and from which this country has, I believe, benefited.</P>

      <P>In concluding, a Cheann Comhairle, I would emphasise my absolute conviction of the great importance of Government Ministers even at the highest level, travelling abroad to promote the Official Government view on the national questions and to promote as vigorously as possible the economic and commercial interests of our country.  Our far flung race give evidence of the degree to which we have had had an open relationship with the world throughout the centuries and beckon us to avail of the great opportunities with which it now presents us in commercial and investment terms.</P>
      <P>We must develop and cultivate our contacts and relationships with the Governments and peoples of friendly countries and must mobilise their support for our various national concerns.  This is a duty that falls particularly on me as Taoiseach, on the members of my Government and, indeed we would say, on every Member of this House.  It is our duty jointly to represent our people and our country well abroad, and to have a sense of national solidarity in this regard. The traditions of the past, whereby a Taoiseach, travelling abroad on the nation's business, was fully supported by all at home, needs to be reasserted in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I do not object to and have never resented criticisms of Garret FitzGerald.  I have a duck's back.  But when those criticisms are directed at me in the office I occupy while I am visiting two of the most powerful nations in the world &mdash; one of them on an official visit &mdash; endeavouring to secure investment and jobs for this country; fostering and developing the strong ties that bind us; clarifying and spelling out the message of the New Ireland Forum; trying to turn the concern of those with an interest in Irish affairs away from support for the shallow and destructive men of violence &mdash; when I am trying to do all of these things through contact with opinion formers and people of real media influence in both countries, with the one and only purpose of striving to further the interests of this country abroad, then those criticisms are no longer attacks on Garret FitzGerald, the man.  Then they constitute an attack on the office I occupy, and on the country and the people I am proud to represent. In this context, the criticisms by the Opposition can be seen only for what they are &mdash; a mean, narrow and warped attempt to gain short term political advantage at the expense of the best interests of the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any detached observer of today's proceedings must be impressed by some features.  First of all, there was the refusal of the Taoiseach to deal with parliamentary questions and to answer <Col N="1119" /> specific questions addressed to him and to deprive myself and other Members of this House of an opportunity of cross-examining him, as is our parliamentary duty and right.  The second aspect which must strike a detached observer is the way in which the ranks of the Fine Gael and the Labour Parties have been brought in here for once.  Deputy De Rossa had occasion in the past few days to try to assemble a quorum for the Finance Bill but today we have had the Members assembled in order to engage in barracking, shouting and in very unparliamentary behaviour.  All of these things indicate a certain nervousness on the part of the Taoiseach which, as far as I can ascertain, derives from a very definite feeling of guilt about his serious neglect of duty in the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>I also direct the attention of impartial observers and Members of the House to the fact that in the course of his speech he has used very personally abusive terms.  He finished his contribution by describing the Opposition as mean, narrow and warped.  He spoke about inferiority complexes.  Some of the remarks he caused to be sent back to this country from his very high-minded and statesmanlike tour of America were very much directed to personal abuse.</P>

Everyone is conscious of the fact that the well-paid, well-heeled handlers were in here last <Col N="1120" /> night in great numbers.  They, too, must have been aware that there was something particularly reprehensible to defend here today.  Most reasonable people would feel that only major and compelling reasons of State would justify the absence of the Taoiseach for a fortnight in the middle of a parliamentary session. No such reason exists in this case.  The Taoiseach's meanderings around America have caused widespread feelings of irritation, annoyance and resentment among the general public.</P>

      <P>Public morale is very low at present.  People are depressed, worried and anxious about the future.  It was particularly insensitive of the Taoiseach to undertake this kind of tour against that background.  In my view it indicates a serious lack of comprehension and a failure to understand the mood and the feelings of our people at this time.  It is not as if the Taoiseach was going away for two weeks and leaving behind a satisfactory state of affairs, with everything in reasonably good shape: exactly the opposite is the case.  He left behind a Government who obviously can govern no longer and an economy that is in a shambles.  We have mass unemployment, tens of thousands of young people having no hope of finding a job, crushing taxation, bankruptcies, closures, redundancies and an economy that is literally falling apart.  We have rampant crime and lawlessness.  How can any Taoiseach in conscience absent himself from his office for a protracted length of time in that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's schedule, which involved him going backwards and forwards across the American-Canadian border in a rather erratic itinerary, had all the appearance of hasty improvisation.  Many of the engagements were of a trivial nature.  The Taoiseach has read them out for us.  They seem to have been undertaken for no purpose other than to fill up gaps in the programme.  Certainly they <Col N="1121" /> were not of sufficient weight or importance to justify extending the visit by even half a day.</P>

      <P>One of the main reasons I went to Libya was to try to undo the damage that was done.  Everyone knows that the IDA are a very efficient body who are assiduous and alert to any opportunities that arise.  Any Minister, and indeed most TDs, who happen to be in the United States or anywhere else will invariably find him or herself pressed into service and asked to deliver a speech or attend a gathering.  We have all done that.  It is standard practice but to try to <Col N="1122" /> elevate that routine type of meeting into a major industrial promotional effort as the Taoiseach has been doing is nothing more than a &ldquo;try-on&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I tell the Taoiseach and Ministers that the people have become very cynical at the prospect of returning Ministers announcing many hundreds of jobs as a result of their visits abroad.  It has become a particularly debased form of coinage and that aspect of the Taoiseach's visit has been added on <i>post factum</i> to try to defend the indefensible.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned some of the visits he made and the meetings he had to promote Irish industry.  I see in a report in <i>The Boston Herald</i> that he visited Mr. Dukakis &mdash; I think the Taoiseach mentioned that in his speech.  The newspaper reported as follows:</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald is also visiting Massachussetts to stimulate business investment in Ireland.  He met privately with Dukakis but a spokesman said nothing major was discussed.</P>
      <P>I hope that is not typical of his general performance.  I should like to direct the attention of the House to the Taoiseach's remarks on Northern Ireland as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10 May.  In reply to a question at the Foreign Policy Association, he said, &ldquo;It is not a problem between Britain and Ireland basically&rdquo;. Those words have not been denied.  The Taoiseach has glossed over them and has built statements around them but the basic comment he made has not been denied.  On any reasonable interpretation of the meaning of the words, the Taoiseach was saying the problem of Northern Ireland did not require what the Forum report very specifically said it required, namely, a reassessment by Britain of her role in this situation.  Such remarks contradict the entire basis and thrust of the Forum report and statements made by the Taoiseach.  Paragraph 4.16 of the New Ireland Forum report states and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> A settlement which recognises the legitimate rights of nationalists and unionists must transcend the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Even in his considered, written statement here to us today the Taoiseach did not quote that simple direct principle enunciated by the Forum report because I do not think he believes it.  As recently as 3 May last he went on RTE and said that he did not think that a purely internal settlement would be workable.  This Taoiseach keeps contradicting himself.  It is very difficult for anyone to understand exactly what he is after, what he means, what his objectives are.  I describe the Taoiseach's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's comments in America used phrases like &ldquo;the achievement of peace and stability in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, &ldquo;measures which would involve progress in Northern Ireland&rdquo;, &ldquo;to reconstruct society in Northern Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; all carrying clear indications of what was in that statement to which I took exception, namely, that the Taoiseach is prepared to settle for an internal settlement.</P>

Everybody in this House recognises the crucial importance of American opinion, particularly the support of Irish Americans in persuading the British Government that they must take action on the problem of Northern Ireland. Therefore in my view it is extremely misguided of the Taoiseach to go around the United States pretending that the British Prime Minister and himself are in full agreement and that in fact Britain has no particular responsibility to remedy that tragic situation.</P>

Could he have said much less?  What great advance is it for the Canadian Prime Minister to say that he will support an agreement reached between the British and Irish Governments?

      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have foolishly claimed in America and elsewhere that the British and Irish Governments have a common perception of the problem, that there is real progress.  Let us examine the Taoiseach's proposition in America that the Anglo-Irish talks have a 50:50 chance of success.  That is what he told his audiences all over the continent of America.  We know very little of what is going on on the Irish side.  The Taoiseach has not publicly defined our position except in vague and elastic terms, terms which very qualified and reliable journalists seem to have difficulty interpreting.  However, the British Northern Secretary of State has no such inhibitions.  Let me read a few headlines from <i>The Irish Times:</i> 18 April, &ldquo;Talks do not include joint authority, Hurd&rdquo;; 25 April, &ldquo;Security is top of British Policy List, says Hurd&rdquo;; 13 May, &ldquo;Hurd says Future of UDR not for Negotiation&rdquo;&mdash; that was said within 24 hours of the Taoiseach's claim that a third of the UDR was very dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach examined the evidence contained in successive British newspaper articles recently that the Anglo-Irish talks are on the verge of collapse? Is that the position?  Following that now infamous Chequers Summit last year the Taoiseach said in this House that there would be another summit meeting &ldquo;early in the New Year&rdquo;.  Then, according to a briefing given to <i>The Irish Times</i><Col N="1128" /> repeated on 24 January, the next Anglo-Irish meeting would be just before or after St. Patricks Day.  Then the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10 February said it would be some time before Easter.  Then, according to <i>The Guardian</i> of 18 February, it would possibly not be until the summer between the local elections and the marching season.  In today's <i>The Irish Times</i> we learn that it is likely to be put off at least until the autumn.  This House is entitled to know what exactly is the position, what is happening, if anything.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of articles appearing in the British press over the last few days suggesting that the meeting should be cancelled altogether. I should like to direct the Taoiseach's attention to them because he seems to have gone to great trouble to mislead our American friends on this issue.  The influential <i>Economist</i> magazine last week, for instance, stated that peace in Northern Ireland does not need another Thatcher-FitzGerald meeting.  It went on to state that the British want more antiterrorist co-operation but they may already be getting most of what the Irish Government have to give.  It stated that <Col N="1129" /> the two Prime Ministers would do better to cancel their summit and carry on working sensibly together at a humbler level. That is very interesting.  In other words, the British Government have got all they want.  American opinion having been mollified by the combined efforts of the Taoiseach and the British Minister. Everything in the garden is now lovely &mdash; the British garden, of course.</P>

Monday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i> suggested that in view of the Taoiseach's remarks that one third of the UDR was very dangerous the next summit should be postponed for a very long time.</P>
      <P>In the light of all that I want to ask the Taoiseach does he really believe that there is a 50/50 chance of success?  Was he, or was he not, with his prattling about Anglo-Irish relations and a 50/50 chance of success, deliberately misleading Irish-American public opinion?</P>

      <P>I am afraid that most of the Taoiseach's remarks in the United <Col N="1130" /> States followed the old negative condemnatory approach and he made no attempt whatever to offer genuine Irish-Americans who wish this country well any clearly defined legitimate constructive objectives.  The Taoiseach also met the Cardinal-elect, Archbishop of New York, John O'Connor.  The meeting was described in the press as one of mutual incomprehension.  Many of us who have to listen to the Taoiseach from time to time do not at all doubt that, but surely that is an extraordinary and at the same time depressing development?  What Irish leader before ever brought about such a negative outcome of such an important meeting?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also used his visit to America to attend this secret Bilderberg Conference, a group about which many people have grave doubts.  It does not matter how the Taoiseach comes in here to shout, bluster and use personal abuse, because we have grave doubts about this organisation and its conferences.  I have always had the impression that the Taoiseach had strong views about secret societies; yet he belongs or has belonged to a number of very powerful international bodies and groups whose aims and objectives, methods of operation and meetings are definitely secret and none more than this Bilderberg group.  How can the Taoiseach justify attending a Bilderberg meeting?  If it is wrong for a Taoiseach, and I believe it is, or a Minister to be a member of the Free Masonic Order, the Knights of Columbanus or Opus Dei, why is it all right for him to be a member of an arguably far more powerful secular secret society like the Bilderberg Conference?</P>

If some of us had any doubt about the nature of the Bilderberg Conference, what was going on and the Taoiseach's presence there I think the whole manner in which the Taoiseach approached that conference confirmed any doubts we might have had.

It is a matter of record that NATO has been regularly discussed at Bilderberg meetings since the fifties, when on occasions whole meetings were given over to it.  In 1978, for instance, the topic was Western defence and its political implications. In 1977 the NATO Secretary General attended.  The US National Security Adviser, the leading American arms negotiator all attended.  When the facts emerged the Taoiseach claimed that he did not have the agenda with him.

I challenge the Taoiseach to say what other serving Prime Minister or Foreign Minister of a neutral country was present this year.  We did not get an answer to our parliamentary questions but I want to repeat them now.  In his statement the Taoiseach has not given us any of the hard information for which we are looking.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to place the agenda of this conference on the table of the House?  Is the Taoiseach prepared to place the attendance lists of those who attended, their rank and the offices they hold?  These things are of great importance to the Members of this House and we are entitled to this information? The Taoiseach went to that meeting as head of the Irish Government. This is a meeting which we know has certain connotations and which has a certain background.  We are entitled to know the agenda, who was present and what was discussed and if any commitments were made by the Taoiseach on our behalf to that secret meeting.  Our neutrality unlike the neutrality of other countries has been put under pressure in Europe not least by the lukewarm, equivocal and ambiguous attitude of this Taoiseach and his Minister for Defence among others of his party, particularly Deputy John Kelly who is no longer with us but who just came in to hurl a few insults and then in a proper professorial manner left us.</P>

How can the Taoiseach credibly object to NATO matters being discussed for instance in the European Council when he voluntarily attends this type of meeting.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is the entitlement of this House to know precisely what took place and to have all the important relevant documents laid on the table of this House.  By that I intend to judge the Taoiseach.  If the Taoiseach does that and we have an opportunity to consider the documentation, all of us, in fairness, will have to review our accusation of secrecy about the Bilderberg conference.  If those documents are not placed on the table of the House and if we are not given this vital information we will have to form our own opinions and confirm ourselves in our worst suspicions.</P>
      <P>Apart from the NATO aspects the purpose of bodies like the Bilderberg group and the tri-lateral commission is to foster an international élite and to promote the interests of huge multi-national corporations. I am absolutely certain that at that gathering with all those bankers and heads of huge multi-national corporations and others of that ilk, the position of the unemployed in my constituency of Coolock did not rate as a very high priority.  It would have been far more appropriate if our Taoiseach were devoting himself in any international forum to this type of problem rather than these very dangerous subjects and discussions which take place at things like the Bilderberg Conference.  I suspect that the Taoiseach remains a member of that organisation for some personal political reason.  I understand that that type of organisation is prepared to support particular politicians in their objectives in their own countries.

      <P>Many among the general public agree with me that the Taoiseach has done considerable damage by <Col N="1138" /> this trip.  The Taoiseach has given an impression of confusion, muddled thinking, top of the head injudicious comments. Whatever the cause, it has resulted in a serious undermining of our national position and our interests in many different areas.  No one can understand why this trip was undertaken.  It did not seem to have an identifiable purpose. The conclusion is inescapable.  Our Taoiseach was engaged in trivial pursuits.  This country has an enormous fund of goodwill in the US and Canada and it was wrong of the Taoiseach to abuse that fund of goodwill by this misdirected, misguided type of trip, this fumbling erratic carry on he has engaged in.</P>

      <P>In replying to the Taoiseach's statement in relation to his visit to Canada and the US I want to put on record in the strongest possible terms my protest at the manner in which the Taoiseach refused to answer any questions on his visit during Question Time. The Taoiseach's decision to make statements under Standing Order 38 on the visit instead of dealing with it at Question <Col N="1139" /> Time is a shabby parliamentary trick which does no justice to this House or to the Taoiseach himself.  There is no opportunity in this process under the Standing Order under which these statements are being taken to question the Taoiseach directly on different aspects of his statement and to get replies arising from those questions.  There are fairly large implications for the conduct of the business of this House in the manner in which it has been dealt with.  The parliamentary question is one of the few rights which individual Deputies have in this House to get responses from Ministers and from the Government of the day.  It adds nothing to the standing of this House to deal with it as it has been dealt with today and, indeed, it adds to the disillusionment of people outside in relation to this House and the relevance of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech referred to the Bilderberg group in terms which would indicate that they were some kind of cosy social club or debating society in which occasionally great men of some stature come together for a cosy chat about the world, the weather and what have you, but anyone who has any knowledge of the way that the various institutions operate in our world today would not accept that explanation of what the Bilderberg group are.  I must admit that I knew nothing about the group prior to a press report that the Taoiseach intended to attend this conference.  Arising from that and from some information I received subsequently about the nature of this group I put a question to the Taoiseach before he left on his visit asking him to tell the House here what the Bilderberg group were and so forth. The reply I got was from the Ceann Comhairle, that the Taoiseach had no responsibility to the House for this matter.  I assume that that was based on the view that the Taoiseach was attending this conference in a personal capacity.  As Deputy Haughey has said, there is no circumstance that I can see in which a Taoiseach can separate his personal capacity from his public capacity or his <Col N="1140" /> public functions particularly when he is attending conferences abroad of the nature and stature of this group.</P>

      <P>I have here a quotation from <i>The Irish Press</i> of Friday, 10 May 1985, which in turn quotes from a book called <i>Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World Management,</i> edited by a person called Holly Sklar and published in 1980 by the South End Press in Boston.  This is the only source I have come across which indicates precisely what the Bilderberg group is all about.  I quote:</P>
      <P>In 1958 the whole meeting was given over to &ldquo;the future of NATO defence&rdquo; and in 1961 the question of leadership of the West was split into discussions of &ldquo;NATO in the world, policy of the member countries&rdquo; and &ldquo;the role and control of nuclear weapons within NATO.&rdquo;&ldquo;Problems arose over the creation of common nuclear policy for the alliance without a `European finger on the trigger.&rdquo;  Page 174.</P>
      <P>Here is a further quotation:</P>
      <P>By the 1970s, Bilderbergers were regularly discussing trilateralism.  But, while the Trilateral Commission emphasised economic matters, military/strategic discussions were commonplace at Bilderberg.</P>
      <P>Such differences reflect changed historical conditions.  Bilderberg originated as part of the thrust toward Western co-ordination in the midst of the Cold War.  Anti-communism provided the ideological justification of joint military planning through NATO.  Successive secretary generals of NATO have all been regular Bilderberg attendees.  The Trilateral Commission emerged at a time when intracapitalist economic and north-south (industrialised West-Third World) problems were threatening to tear the system apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission have somewhat different <Col N="1142" /> modes of operation.  While both organisations have closed meetings Bilderberg is far more secretive in its activities.</P>
    <P>Bilderberg does not publicly lobby for its views as an organisation in the way the Commission does.  Page 176.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Press</i> report continues:</P>
    <P>The conspiratorial type of operations undertaken by the Bilderberg group are illustrated by the following quotations from the same book:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The object is not to `draw the attention' of the greater population to Bilderberg activity.  Bilderberg's existence is often denied, even by foreign ministry officials.  Apart from planted newspaper articles, no Bilderberg publications are available to the public.  The extent of media blackout is remarkable; insight into how this is achieved comes from a confidential memo of the steering group meeting in preparation of the 1984 conference at Williamsburg.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Standing Orders treat the situation where the Taoiseach or any Member of the Government can come into the House and address himself to a point.  I am familiar with the Standing Order and I know that, while it is not expressed in the Standing Order, there is a tradition in the House that the Taoiseach or the Minister of the day who makes the statement does the House and the two speakers who are entitled to speak the honour of listening to them.  Let me say in passing that I am unhappy about the situation that gives The Workers' Party the right to speak at all, but on the other hand in so far as a spokesman for that party is entitled under the Standing Orders of this House to address himself to a statement, would you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle guide me as to the precedent existing in respect of the Taoiseach or the Minister remaining to hear that speaker?</P>

      <P>Perhaps he has urgent business elsewhere.  I was quoting from this book to indicate that there are sinister undertones to the Bilderberg group, that it is not a cosy social club or debating society and that the people involved have very specific political objectives in mind in coming together. When the Prime Minister of this State attends such a conference this House is entitled to questions and answers about what took place and in what way the conference and the views expressed there either agreed with or diverged from the existing foreign policy being pursued by this State.  The Taoiseach owes this House a further explanation about Bilderberg and I do not think the matter should be let lie.  I intend to pursue this matter through parliamentary questions so far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the Taoiseach's visit to the United States and Canada was the issue of the statements he made at various points in relation to Northern Ireland and <Col N="1144" /> the talks taking place between the Irish and British Governments.  The Taoiseach said today that he would never harm the interests of Ireland abroad.  I have no doubt he means that, but he must accept that what he sees as the interests of Ireland are not necessarily the same as I see them or as other Members of this House might see them.  Therefore, whether he is Taoiseach or not, he is open to criticism for what he said in either the United States or in Canada.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland I propose to comment not so much on what he is reported to have said but on the direction in which I think he is trying to move.  As I understand it, he is trying to achieve an accommodation in Northern Ireland between the divided community to enable them to retain their aspirations, whether they be to unionism or nationalism, and to enable them to pursue their aspirations peacefully and democratically while at the same time securing peace on the island as a whole.  How that can be attained is a matter for debate.  Many long months were spent putting together the Forum report by the three major nationalist parties.  It is fair to say that at present the Forum report is in tatters.  It was presented as a concensus view of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the SDLP.  Since it was published there have been wide divergences of opinions as to what it meant and how it can be expressed or analysed as between the Coalition parties &mdash; the Fianna Fáil Party and the SDLP on the one hand, supporting the Fianna Fáil line; and, on the other hand the Coalition line on the Forum report.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the three options put forward, at least in terms of achieving a short term settlement, are not on.  Whatever about the brutal way Margaret Thatcher said,&ldquo;Out, out, out&rdquo;, it is very clear that the question of a unitary state is simply not a realistic option, the question of a federal arrangement is not a realistic option and the question of joint sovereignty is not a realistic option.  This means the Government are left with the situation of trying to use the Forum report as a vehicle to make some progress <Col N="1145" /> with the British Government on the analysis and realities set down in that report.  I broadly support the Government in attempting to do that, but I do not necessarily agree with everything they are doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have for a long time stressed the need for a democratically devolved Government in Northern Ireland.  It is our view that it is impossible to achieve peace or reconciliation either in Northern Ireland or between the people in Northern Ireland without the people there having a democratic forum in which they can discuss and order the affairs of the State.  It is fundamental to the solution of the situation there for the people in this Parliament to accept the reality of the existance of the State of Northern Ireland.  It does no one any good, in terms of the hopes of reaching a settlement and in many senses leads to death and destruction in Northern Ireland, to pretend it is possible to acheive a 32-county all-Ireland State in the foreseeable future.  The irreconcilable constitutional differences that exist between those who are nationalists and want a united Ireland and those who are unionists and do not want a united Ireland cannot be overcome simply by expressing aspirations and declarations, and it cannot be achieved by wishing that it will happen.  It has to be done on the basis of careful negotiations and consideration not only of the rights of the nationalist population but also of the unionist population.</P>
    <P>In supporting the direction which I think the Taoiseach is moving I stress that he needs also to involve the people in Northern Ireland in his deliberations with the British Government.  He needs to ensure that all the democratic parties in the North are involved in whatever agreement is reached.  Otherwise he is pursuing a road which will prolong chaos, destruction and death.  He should be aware that a power sharing arrangement, under whatever guise, which would simply institutionalise the sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland is not a solution <Col N="1146" /> either in the short term or in the long term.</P>
    <P>The sectarian divisions are prolonging the agony in Northern Ireland.  It must also be stressed that all parties in Northern Ireland &mdash; The Workers' Party are active, organised and working there &mdash; agree that there is an urgent necessity for a Bill of Rights up there.  There may be different concepts of what a Bill of Rights should contain but there is broad agreement across the spectrum that there is a need for this, which would guarantee the rights of all sections of the community. That would be a basis for going forward in that State.  Clearly, also, there is a need in talking in terms of arrangements &mdash; I speak of arrangements rather than solutions in Northern Ireland &mdash; to include a strong emphasis on dealing with the deplorable social and economic situation there where more than 20 per cent are unemployed, a situation which affects the Protestant community as much as the nationalists.  There is no discrimination in relation to unemployment.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach will accept, privately if not publicly, that he made a serious error in attending the Bilderberg Conference as Taoiseach and that he owes the House an explanation as to what went on there.  He should also give an undertaking that as long as he is Taoiseach he will not attend further conferences of this nature.  The second aspect which arises is the effort being made in relation to achieving peace in Northern Ireland.  I broadly support the moves being made on the basis that they are an attempt to achieve a settlement which will involve all the people in that State.  They should be involved in the process of reaching agreement and, in the long run, if the Taoiseach does that he can be assured of our support in the House and in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the building industry and the lack of interest which the Government have displayed towards that industry by the penal doubling of VAT to 10 per cent.  It will put thousands of skilled, dedicated and committed people out of work and lower the living standard of their families. There will also be less money in circulation and more people will be forced on to unemployment assistance, which is causing so many problems at present.  In Cork one of the major problems is in relation to unemployment assistance &mdash; people who lost their jobs in the building and other industries and who are now assessed for the payment of unemployment assistance have their superannuation payments taken into account.  This <Col N="1148" /> is a penal imposition on people whose standards of living have been eroded through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>I said that the building industry is a barometer of the economy and is normally taken as such.  I do not agree with what the Minister said in that regard. We should try to relieve the situation no matter what caused it &mdash; bad weather, bad Government or bad decisions.  The Minister has a duty to help and one way would be to leave the VAT rate at 5 per cent.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 48</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 48 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which relates to the promoting of and admission to live theatrical performances. I wish to say a word on behalf of cinemas within the terms of the section. The first point is that most cinemas throughout the country and in the cities also are family owned businesses. Secondly, in addition to the showing of films, cinemas have a social context in rural Ireland.  When a cinema closes, very often there is no other cinema in the town and this means that there is no other outlet in terms of social contact for young people apart from discos which do not open until late in the evening, or perhaps gaming saloons which do not always enhance the character of an area but which sometimes give rise to problems of one kind or another.  There are public houses but the law requires that people under 18 must not be served with alcoholic drink in these premises.  However, in many instances it is difficult to know <Col N="1151" /> by looking at a young person nowadays whether he has reached 18.</P>
      <P>For those reasons we should ensure that in everything we do here which does not involve major revenue implications, we should encourage the maintenance of what one might refer to as the family cinemas.  Perhaps I should declare in this regard an interest, albeit a historic interest. My late father was the proprietor of a family cinema.  Young people congregated regularly at the cinema.  Sometimes they would have a certain understanding as to when they would pay and when payment was made it was not always by way of what might be called coins of the Realm.  It could be by way of anything from jam jars to any other commodity. However, a tradition grew up around those cinemas.  Parents could rest assured when their children had gone to the cinema that they were in a secure environment.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from the cinema proprietors regarding that exemption and pointing out that the Minister must be aware of so many family cinemas having to close.  The Minister will appreciate that I am not making a political case in this instance.  If he tells me that the change being sought would involve revenue implications, I shall be prepared to listen but I am presenting the case as it has been presented to me and I have been impressed by that case.  There is no cinema to be found in many towns but where cinemas are maintained they make a major contribution to the healthy social climate of the area.  At least they have the effect of keeping young people out of harm's way though I am not one who subscribes to the view that young people have a natural tendency to put themselves in the way of harm.  It may be good in some cases that numbers of young people congregate at the cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment factor in regard to cinemas is a matter also of considerable importance.  In particular the family firms who are engaged in the promotion of the independent cinemas should be encouraged. Deputy Mitchell made the point today that where there is a place of social, <Col N="1152" /> cultural or entertainment value in the centre of a community, even in the city, that facility tends to maintain, if not renew, the social and cultural character of the place.  I acknowledge that I have no amendment tabled in this respect but in the circumstances I have outlined I am making a special case to the Minister, having regard to revenue implications, to consider granting the same facility to the cinemas in respect of VAT as apply to theatrical performances.</P>

      <P>In any case the amendment did not give much indication of what it is about.  It is technical.  I made the main argument on section 42 when I argued for a zero VAT rate on theatrical performances instead of the exemption rate.  I was thinking of the theatres as distinct merely from performances in the sense of the purchase or the refurbishing and so on of the buildings.  I was asking that the VAT in such cases be zero rated but by way of reply the Minister said that because of the EC position in this regard, there is no scope for further zero rating, that the EC restricted the amount of zero rating.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister explain how there is no scope for exemption from VAT if there is no scope for zero rating?  What is the specific EC position on this?  Why do they allow unlimited exemptions but have restrictions on zero rating?  If the Minister has some other way of overcoming the problem of theatres that actually lose by virtue of the Minister eliminating the 5 per cent VAT, I should like to hear about it.  I do not believe that the Minister would have intended that, when, rather than raising it to 10 per cent, he decided to cut the 5 per cent altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the sixth VAT directive of the EC, member states were allowed to keep in place virtually <Col N="1153" /> all the zero rates that they had in operation at the time the directive was passed, but they were not allowed subsequently to introduce new zero rates.  That is, they were not allowed subsequently to extend zero rating to other areas which had not been zero rated at the time.  The general thrust of Community policy, particularly as the Commission would interpret it and apply it in these cases, is to restrict as far as possible the application of zero rates. I think I mentioned earlier that the Commission are now looking rather critically at some of our zero rates on other products, following a line which I am not disposed to accept too readily.  However, that is the situation at the moment.  The essential point as far as this section and Deputy Mac Giolla's question are concerned is that there is an undoubted limit to our ability to introduce new zero rates or extend zero rating to cover products or activities that are now subject to a positive VAT rate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked how we could exempt theatres and not exempt cinemas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of cultural and artistic activities, the EC law allows scope for exempting those from coverage of VAT.  That addresses one of the questions put by Deputy O'Kennedy.  In the interpretation or application of that, theatrical performances are regarded as artistic and cultural activities and cinemas are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this an EC interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is basically the difference between the two.  I am familiar with the case that Deputy O'Kennedy was making about the cinemas.  I have <Col N="1154" /> over the last couple of years had a number of meetings with representatives of cinema owners as a group and with numbers of them individually.  I have had representations about their position from individuals in the trade and from a number of Members of the House.  If we were to exempt cinemas, the reduction in revenue would be about £8 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I have said to various people who have talked to me about the position of the cinemas that I do not think it can validly be claimed that the difficulties that cinemas are now experiencing can be attributed either wholly, or even mainly, to value-added tax on cinema tickets.  There are quite a number of other factors which have affected the position of cinemas and attendances at them.  We could mention just a few.  Television has been one.  The growth of the use of large screen videos in public houses has been another.  It seems that when people are faced with a choice of going to a cinema and seeing a film on the one hand or going to a public house and seeing a film and having a drink at the same time, on the other hand, they tend to go for the pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That practice is dying out.  They do not drink enough. That is being cut out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From conversations that I have had with quite a number of people in the business and connected with the business, it seems that it is one of the most important factors affecting cinemas over the last few years.  Since, therefore, it appears that the reduction in or elimination of VAT on cinema tickets would not deal with the main part of the problem, other adjustments in the VAT system would have priority over that, as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the application of the EC directive absolute, or does it allow any degree of discretion to the member state?  My impression is that the member <Col N="1155" /> state is allowed discretion, which must be subject to confirmation by the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in this sense. Obviously, the European Community have a special interest in VAT revenue, having regard to the manner in which the European Community are funded by a percentage of VAT &mdash; which was up to recently 1 per cent but is now proposed to be 1.4 per cent.  They are interested in total VAT revenue.  Where products or articles which hitherto were zero rated &mdash; and I mention, for instance, clothes, which are now liable to VAT &mdash;one could make a case which would have to be considered favourably by the European Community.  Where you are bringing more into the tax net from what was previously zero rated there should be some accommodation, I would have thought, for introducing some small element into a zero category which would still ensure that VAT revenue would be greater than it was before the original change took place.  I think there is some scope for discussion with the European Community in this context.  Even if the Minister does not feel disposed to meeting our case, I should like clarification on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the application of the EC VAT directive is concerned, VAT revenue and its effects on the EC budgetary situation are not considerations. As the Deputy will recall, the contribution raised from each member state is based on the application of 1 per cent, soon to be 1.4 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the total defined assiette, as they call it, of VAT.  Whether you are actually collecting the VAT or not is not a consideration as far as revenue is concerned.  I take the point that Deputy O'Kennedy is making in a political sense.  That is, if we are bringing new things into VAT which were previously zero rated, there is an argument, in terms <Col N="1156" /> of a political discussion, for having some leeway elsewhere.  I am very conscious of that fact and have been giving effect to that line of thinking in discussions that I am already having about pressure on me about zero rates.  To an extent, some of the credit is already used up.</P>
      <P>Let me revert for a moment to another point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla which I overlooked a moment ago. It is in relation to the theatres.  There was a feeling that in one or two particular cases exemption would produce a situation less beneficial than the application of the 5 per cent VAT rates.  I am a little constrained in talking about this because I do not like speaking, even in the House, about the affairs of individual taxpayers.  There are two cases in relation to theatres where a difficulty would tend to arise.  One of them should be dealt with in a different way.  In the other case it was felt at the beginning there was a problem, that the theatre would lose out as a result of exemption rather than the 5 per cent rate, but on examination that proved not to be the case.</P>

      <P>Section 48 (viii) (b) states as follows:</P>
      <P>Performances in conjunction with which facilities are available for the consumption of food or drink during all or part of the performance of persons attending the performance.</P>
      <P>I presume the section has in mind not to allow this exemption to cabaret lounges and so on.  In most theatres there are at least bar facilities during the interval. Practically every function nowadays has bar facilities, otherwise the attendance suffers.  I am not sure if it is necessary for the Minister to insert that clause.  I could imagine an inspector of taxes telling the theatre management that as there were bar facilities available during part of a performance they would not get the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also refers to live theatrical or musical performances.  There will be a major musical performance at Slane in the near future.  I am referring to the Springsteen concert at which at least £1 <Col N="1157" /> million will be collected at the gate.  Will this section mean that live performance will be exempt?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, this section exempts from VAT the activities that up to now have been subject to 5 per cent. The terminology to which the Deputy has referred is designed to exclude from the benefit of the exemption cabaret performances because the intention was to give this specific treatment to the theatrical or live performing arts.  For example, the fact that a theatre would have a bar or a coffee bar to which people could go during the interval would not defer it from the benefit of this exemption.  The language here is intended to exclude from benefit places where food and drink are available during a performance to people while they are watching a performance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, concerts such as the one at Slane would benefit from this exemption.</P>

    <P>(xviaaa) blocks, of concrete, of a kind which comply with the specification contained in the Standard Specification (Concrete Building Blocks) Declaration, 1974 (Irish Standard 20: 1974);&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was some merit in the case put forward by Deputy Mitchell in so far as the effect would be to exempt from VAT security alarms for senior citizens.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that case.  We are now coming to the end of Committee Stage and the Minister is about to achieve the distinction of not accepting one amendment put down during the debate.  Probably he would be more disposed towards accepting an amendment in the name of one of his own Deputies rather than an amendment put down by me or my colleagues.  Perhaps this is the time to break the duck, and even though Deputy Mitchell is not present at the moment, perhaps the Minister will tell him he accepts that amendment.</P>
    <P>My amendment deals with the issue we have raised during the main part of the debate on the new categories of VAT.  I was speaking about the new rate of VAT on building services and the distortion that will occur as a result of what is proposed with regard to concrete blocks. The Minister will be encouraging some people who are not within the bona fide trade to stay outside that trade.  Secondly, the consequence will be that builders who are already under severe pressure may tend to go outside the normal regulated economy.  If there is anything we should have in common here I should have <Col N="1159" /> thought it would be a common determination to ensure that we so do not encourage the black economy.  This is becoming a problem not just for revenue but for the whole social environment and the law and the stability of the country.  I will not overstate its significance at this point.  We have argued this on many occasions and in view of the time constraints now I do not intend to repeat the arguments at length.</P>
    <P>The case we have made with regard to the building trade is unanswerable.  When the Minister indicated he expected to raise an extra £40 million as a consequence of this adjustment, that was the most cogent, telling argument in favour of our proposal.  To put that extra burden on the backs of any sector is more than they can sustain.  Not all of them will have the same physical capacity as the Taoiseach.  Today he boasted he has a duck's back &mdash; I did not think I would ever hear a Taoiseach make such a boast&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very poor quack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but the Taoiseach said that today.  The building industry has taken too much and it cannot sustain the burden being placed on it.  The Minister has imposed an extra burden amounting to more than £46 million on that sector and that speaks for itself.  That is too big a burden to impose on an industry that needs so much and is now experiencing unemployment at a level of 50,000.  That is close enough to one quarter of the total number unemployed in this economy, and that is going on the live register only.  That constitutes a huge element of the unemployment problem and an indication of the significance of the building industry to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take issue with the Minister when he says that we have offered no alternative in terms of saving on expenditure. If the figure for unemployment benefit for those in the industry is of the order of £158 million or £150 million, which is almost exactly the figure the Minister gave of the cost of accepting <Col N="1160" /> all the amendments we propose, then I would have thought the likelihood was that if unemployment benefit for 50,000 people would cost an amount of that order and if he looked at the credit side and what he would save in respect of social welfare payments, then on pure economic terms alone, leaving aside the social argument altogether, which I believe is a very cogent one, the Minister should reconsider his position.  Of course, the figure the Minister has quoted is a gross one in terms of the revenue.  Having regard to what would be yielded in indirect tax, the net cost would probably be closer to £30 million than £45 million or £46 million.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the Minister should, if not immediately respond to the case we have effectively made, then at least show a readiness to consider it on Report Stage.  I plead with him, in the interests of the overall economy and not just of the building industry, to reconsider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support as strongly as possible the case made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The reality here is that VAT on the supply of immovable goods, namely houses, on or after 30 April 1985 is increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  As Deputy O'Kennedy has pointed out in great detail the building industry is an extremely depressed one at present and is perhaps our most labour-intensive industry.  Therefore, from an economic point of view it does not make any sense at all to increase VAT by 100 per cent on that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and various Government spokesmen have argued that the balance is corrected to some extent on the other side by two factors &mdash; first, that the £1,000 new house grant has been doubled and that VAT on cement blocks has been reduced.  In no way can those factors compensate for the devastating blow delivered to the building industry by increasing the rate of VAT on them by 100 per cent.  The Minister will be well aware that the £2,000 new house grant now applies to first time purchasers of new houses <Col N="1161" /> only.  It does not apply to people who purchase secondhand houses or that category of people purchasing new houses who are already house owners.  My information from the Construction Industry Federation is that that category constitute approximately 40 per cent of purchasers of new houses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the reduction of VAT on cement blocks, I should say that not alone will that not compensate for what the Minister has done in regard to the main increase but will have detrimental effects <i>via-a-vis</i> the black economy.  It must be remembered that its effect is two-fold.  First, it makes materials cheaper for a builder who has not registered for VAT.  Second, it places a builder who has not registered for VAT and who is selling a house in a better and more competitive position <i>vis-a-vis</i> his registered counterpart.  This means that, whereas heretofore he could sell that house for 5 per cent less, he can now sell it for 10 per cent less because he does not have to collect any VAT.</P>
    <P>There have been some arguments about a cash flow advantage that might arise for builders from the reduction in VAT on cement blocks.  My information is that there will be no such cash flow advantage because the refunding of VAT charged is normally effected within the credit period operating within the building industry generally.  In those circumstances we on this side of the House have no doubt but that the blow delivered by the Minister to the building industry in relation to the increases in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on the supply of immovable goods constitutes a truly devastating blow with profound implications for employment in that industry. Certainly its effect will be that no new employment will be created in the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take cognisance of the fact that new houses will now be taxed at 10 per cent whereas secondhand houses are taxed at between 4 per cent and 6 per cent only.  By that I mean that stamp duty applying to secondhand houses valued between £20,000 and £50,000 is at a rate of 4 per cent and on <Col N="1162" /> houses whose value is in excess of £50,000 the rate goes up to 6 per cent.  That means there is a distinct bias in favour of secondhand houses.  In the case of non-grant aided houses, which constitute 40 per cent of new houses, the bias will be particularly severe and the situation badly out of balance.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this amendment very seriously.  He should look first at the implications of what he has done by increasing VAT on the building industry by 100 per cent, at the reaction that has caused throughout that industry and the building unions. Nobody will fault the Minister in any way if he stands up and admits that he has made a genuine error and accepts Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  In fact people would praise him all the more.</P>
    <P>There is one technical question I want to pose to the Minister, something which has given rise to a certain amount of dispute and correspondence in the media. Is the 10 per cent VAT rate on new houses inclusive or exclusive of the £2,000 new house grant?  I want the Minister to give me a clear and definitive answer to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out one other matter to the Minister, which is that this extra imposition of 5 per cent will cost the Exchequer on the provision of local authority houses, which we are told will run at approximately 6,500 this year, something in the region of £750,000.  Therefore, bearing in mind the sum set aside in the Government programme, the imposition of the extra 5 per cent will considerably cut into the number of houses the Minister and his colleagues would hope to have constructed under that programme.  We should remember that that figure has risen 8 per cent over the last two years and has dealt a devastating blow to the building industry.  Unless something drastic is done, such as what is proposed in Deputy O'Kennedys amendment, what will happen is that more and more people will operate within the black economy, will start to build for themselves, will start to build houses not up to standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> I cannot see how people building houses for themselves will be able to comply with the building regulations which the Minister for the Environment has before the House.  This will lead to the erection of many houses of inferior standard.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to the pleas of other Deputies, as one who was associated with the building industry for many years.  I would ask the Minister to change his mind on this most important issue.  It should be remembered that, in addition to the amount of unemployment assistance being paid to the unemployed in the building industry a boost to the industry in the form of a reduction of 5 per cent would give the industry confidence.  It would also result in more people being employed in building construction and more revenue for the Minister because quite a number of people involved in building at present are not paying taxes. Those people are operating in the black economy.  If the Minister gives registered contractors the reduction sought in Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment he will be doing something positive for an industry that can make such a tremendous difference to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  We are all aware that the proposal to increase the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will have a devastating effect on the construction industry.  It will add from £1,750 to £2,000 to the price of a new house costing £30,000.  I do not think the £2,000 new house grant will compensate buyers because builders will pass on the increased VAT rate to purchasers.  It is an injustice that secondhand houses are not grant aided.  In the area of new houses purchasers can avail of the £2,000 grant, the £3,000 mortgage subsidy and, if they give up a council house, a further grant of £5,000.  Unfortunately, it appears that those who buy a secondhand house are penalised.  The Minister should take into consideration that many people buy <Col N="1164" /> secondhand houses under the impression that they will get grant aid.</P>
      <P>The zero rating of blocks will only add to the black economy.  Genuine builders who pay their taxes and VAT cannot compete with cowboy builders.  Those on the dole who have jobs on the side can quote a cheaper price for jobs.  They get the cash up front and do not pay tax or VAT.  That is the reality in country areas and builders cannot compete with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  One of the biggest issues since the introduction of the budget has been the increase in the VAT rate on building materials from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  The Minister may ask, if he makes adjustments in this area, where will he find the revenue he will lose but this was the worst possible area to increase the VAT rate.  In recent months there has been a lot said here and outside about the building industry but we are all aware that the number unemployed in that sector is alarming.  The industry has been crippled for the last couple of years but the VAT increase is the straw that is breaking the camel's back.  It is generally accepted that one way to prime the economic pump is to put money into the construction industry. Such an investment has a spin off effect in building that occurs quicker than in any other sector.  When the Government were making the decision on where to increase VAT they chose the worst area to hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that adjustments have been made since the budget &mdash; there was an extension of the date when people could close deals to 1 May &mdash; but there has not been any change in regard to VAT on building materials.  The effect will be severe on a crippled industry.  The Minister is aware of the number of building workers in our constituency who are unemployed.  This move will put more legitimate builders out of business.  Small builders are giving up and people are going to cowboy builders who do not pay proper tax.  Those individuals are getting a boost as a result of the change in the VAT rates.  I should like to know if VAT is applied before or after the new house <Col N="1165" /> grant.  Immediately after the budget there was a lot of confusion about the issue.  I hope the Minister will clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  There seems to be a lot of confusion on the Government side about this.  There is no consistency in the policies of the Departments of the Environment and Finance in relation to new and secondhand houses.  In the budget the Minister gave £2,000 with one hand but took it back with the other hand.  This resulted in a net loss of £1,000.  The Minister has added £2,000 to the cost, has increased the grant by £1,000 and they balance out.  The whole thing is pointless. We should consider that there is a net loss of £1,000.  We have all heard of the policy for refurbishing dwellings but, on the other hand, we have discrimination against those buying secondhand houses. There is no coherent policy in the Department of the Environment, from whom the Minister presumably got advice on his tax proposal, or in the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give the House the figures to show the net effect? What is the net intake to the Exchequer on the whole deal?  Is the whole thing a waste of time?  Is it just a question of keeping people going sending in forms without any net benefit to the Exchequer or the construction industry or improvement in secondhand houses or encouraging the building of new houses?  There is no clear policy.  One would expect a consistent policy between the taxation relief measures and schemes promoted by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to make about the amendment is that it proposes the zero rating of building services, ready-mixed concrete and concrete blocks.  The cost of the amendment would be in the order of £79 million this year and £142 million in a full year, to get what Deputy O'Kennedy regards as the ritual statement of the financial position on to the record first.  I also have to make the point, and it follows on from considerations we discussed on a previous <Col N="1166" /> section, that zero rating on this scale would certainly fall foul of EC directives in the matter.  They are two very important points but, nevertheless, not the ones that are uppermost in Deputies' minds although they should be given their proper importance.</P>
      <P>I should like to make some remarks about the rest of the comments made. The rate of VAT on houses applies to the gross price as quoted by the builder.  The price the builder quotes is the gross price inclusive of 10 per cent VAT at this point and it is after that that the purchaser gets whatever grants or other assistance he may be entitled to.  I can understand that Deputies have this question in their minds because there was at one stage, in discussions between myself and representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, consideration given to removing the grant payment, or a portion of the grant payment, from the VAT base.  As it turned out on further examination that proved not to be a very convenient kind of arrangement.  Instead we increased the grant to the present level of £2,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned the reduction in VAT on concrete blocks in connection with the black economy particularly.  A point which is often overlooked is that one of the reasons for VAT on concrete blocks was the representations made to me by people involved in the manufacture of concrete blocks who said that their position as manufacturers and sellers of concrete blocks was being undermined by people unregistered in the same business.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that there has been a bias towards secondhand houses because we have a VAT rate of 10 per cent on new houses whereas for secondhand houses the rate of stamp duty is 4 or 6 per cent.  I am not sure of the line on the benches opposite because Deputy Browne seemed to be taking a different view.  Deputy Browne seemed to feel that there was a bias in favour of new houses, which there is.  For the majority of new house buyers, when one takes account of the fact that they can get the grant now £2,000, the mortgage subsidy and, in certain circumstances, the other £5,000 grant we have introduced, there is a bias in their favour.

The two opinions do not go together and I was trying to point out the facts so that we can draw the appropriate conclusions. For the new house market, particularly for the first time buyer who usually buys a grant-qualifying house, the buyer qualifies for the £2,000 grant, for the mortgage interest subsidy, for mortgage income tax relief which applies to almost everybody and, in the appropriate circumstances, for the £5,000 grant.  Taking all of that together and the 10 per cent VAT on the new house it seems that for the first time typical young house buyer there is a definite incentive to buy a new house.</P>

Deputy Mac Giolla feels that he has detected inconsistencies in treatment and made a number of remarks about money being put in on the one hand and taken out on the other.  Deputy Mac Giolla is talking only about housing.  We are talking here about the application of the value-added tax system to all of the construction sector and housing is only one part of it.</P>
      <P>Of course there is inconsistency.  If we treated everybody in the same way that could only be on the basis that we did not think there was any particular need for involvement by the State in assisting people or encouraging them to do one thing or the other.  Governments for a long time have taken the view that we should assist or encourage people to buy their own accommodation and equally for some years past Governments have taken the view that we should encourage people to make rented accommodation available, and in the efforts to promote those objectives we have adopted different strategies.  If we are talking about encouraging people to buy houses we have a mixture of direct grants and tax reliefs as in the case of mortgage interest. On the other hand, if we are talking about stimulating people to provide extra accommodation the decision has been to encourage people by granting them tax reliefs as in the famous section 23 modified by section 29 and in the measures we discussed here yesterday.  The fact that we adopt different approaches to different parts of the problem does not indicate inconsistency.</P>

      <P>The cows will be a long time coming because the Government and the Minister will not even have the cows to send out, much less wait for them to come home.  What has been staring everyone else in the face up to this moment and the Minister has at last seen is that we are seeing a real growth in the black economy as a consequence of the levels of taxation.  It is a huge growth area which is serious for the economy and also for the whole social and business order in our society.  Apparently we can look forward to further growth in that characteristic of our society because, with total tax revenue this year forecast to grow by over £400 million over last year's outturn, there is no doubt that those engaged in that activity are looking forward to better times.</P>

      <P>They are the only ones who can look forward to better times.  Part of the problem is that the Minister does not wish to recognise that. We have been highlighting that not just in this debate but since he first took up responsibility as Minister and decided to follow policies of trying to bridge a deficit by heaping on extra inflation.  Let me say in that context that in a sense I wish to dissociate myself from those of my <Col N="1173" /> colleagues who accuse this Government of being Thatcherite because I understand that Thatcherite policies are geared to bridging the current budget deficit by reducing public expenditure and keeping the levels of taxation low and if possible reducing them.  This Government are doing no such thing.  This Government are increasing levels of taxation.  They are attempting to bridge the deficit not by reducing current expenditure but by increasing levels of taxation to the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

With levels of taxation such as have been heaped on the building industry there is no hope. We will not bridge the deficit.  The projection at the beginning of this year, as far as I remember, was £4 million.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as surely as you are sitting in that Chair and the Minister will not be too long sitting in his chair, we will not even be able to stay within that very soft target.  If you set such a soft target that you can boast at the end of the day that you have kept within your target, that is some achievement.  I am prepared to bet 2p &mdash; and I was right last year and the previous year &mdash; that we will not be staying within the soft target.</P>

      <P>If we are to stay within it we will have a further supplementary budget.  We will not be staying within it because we are placing impositions on perhaps the most important elements in our economy, in this case the building sector.  I want to conclude on this because we could have anticipated the Minister's reply.  If he were really as interested in creating the conditions for economic growth and renewal as he seems to be in juggling with words which <Col N="1174" /> issue from this side of the House to misrepresent the various positions of Deputies &mdash; he likes to do that when he finds a point on which perhaps a Deputy is wrong or when someone may say something with which I disagree or when Deputy Mac Giolla and I may seem to be arguing &mdash; he would get down to doing what he has been elected to do, which is to create conditions in which the vital elements of our economy, particularly the building industry, can begin to breathe again.  If he is satisfied that his way is right then I am afraid they will begin to suffocate and have little chance of ever being restored to health.

      <P>I do, but it will be some time before any Minister for Finance, having regard to what the current holder of the office has done, will be able to look for buoyancy again when projecting his figures for the budget outturn. We are dealing with children's footwear.  This is a major imposition on poorer families.  The poorer families have some characteristics which the middle class and upper middle class families of Dublin 4, and perhaps part of the Minister's and part of my constituency, may not have.  First, there tends to be more of them and, secondly, the cost of clothing and footwear for the poorer families is always a major element of cost.  The two parent two children family is more a characteristic of the well-to-do than the poorer section of the community.  Whenever we heap extra charges on clothing or footwear we are hitting those who can least afford it.  I make my case on grounds of equity and social justice.  One would not meet a person in Dublin 4, an area the Taoiseach frequents so often, complaining&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I do not confine my advice and discussion to that area. Fortunately, I have other more real contacts, most of them the unemployed in my home town Nenagh.  The real burden falls on the poorer families.  The Minister has ignored these people by taking into the VAT band a commodity which had been zero-rated.  We hear about social tensions, family and marital problems and so on, but most of the marital problems in the well-to-do areas derive from different causes than the marital problems in the poorer sections.  In the latter case marital problems arise almost exclusively because of lack of financial resources.</P>

      <P>This is a problem which arises all over the country, because if a women cannot buy clothes or shoes for her children but her husband buys himself a few pints this can start a row. This is reality.  I am asking the Minister to look at this again on social and economic grounds.  The few remaining footwear businesses rely on the home market.  The people I am talking about are not wearing Swiss Bally shoes.  They buy the most durable, inexpensive Irish footwear.</P>
      <P>When it comes to taxation it is time to show that we have a social awareness.  If people are to be hit hard by these taxes, as is happening here, we run the risk of even more serious consequences for the poorer classes and the industries concerned. I appeal to the Minister, not with any great degree of confidence, to look at this again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy O'Kennedy said about the VAT on footwear.  In 1982 the Coalition Government were defeated because they tried to introduce VAT on clothing and footwear.  An election was held and the electorate threw them out because of the introduction of that tax.  Now, using their <Col N="1177" /> majority, they are pushing through this tax against the wishes of the people.  In an earlier budget, the Government succeeded in putting VAT on clothes and in this budget they succeeded in putting VAT on footwear and increasing the VAT on clothes.  This is an extraordinary attitude when the people made their views so clear three years ago and since then.  Because of the biting recession and the increasingly vicious budgets each year, people are less able to pay for footwear.  We see the type of footwear people are buying &mdash; the cheapest possible. In the long run this is probably the worst thing they could do because it will cost them a lot more over the years than if they bought footwear which would last a year or two.  They are buying the cheapest footwear because it is all they can afford.  They are not prepared to pay £20, £30 or £40 for footwear.  The VAT on footwear and the increased VAT on clothing is one of the gravest personal impositions in this budget and is seen by many people as extraordinary following the opposition to a similar tax some years ago.</P>
      <P>Long before this recession the shoe and leather industry was in a very bad state, mainly as a result of our entry to the EC and the fact that the industry were not geared for this type of competition &mdash; they no longer had protection and they had not invested in new machinery.  The recession has put further burdens on this industry, which needs a boost rather than to be penalised.  This industry should be encouraged by giving them incentives to use Irish leather and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lower paid workers and those on welfare and unemployment assistance will see this tax as a very great imposition. Parents have to buy shoes for children of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 because teenagers need new shoes more often than at any other time in their lives.  This is a very big outlay for any household with four, five or six children.  The lower income group seen to have the bigger families, a higher percentage of them are unemployed and they are not well educated. It is the socially deprived group who are being penalised most because <Col N="1178" /> they spend a much higher proportion of their income on shoes and clothes than the people in the higher income group. This tax is seen as a major imposition on their standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with a 10 per cent VAT rate on shoes and increasing the VAT rate on clothing from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.  This is seen as an anti-family and anti-social measure. The people hit hardest, as other Deputies have said, are the less well off members of the community.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>How is an 11 year old to be identified to avail of the provision that up to that age shoes are VAT-free?  Many 11 year olds take a larger size than average and children of 13 and 14 years of age take a smaller size than average.  This measure will also bear heavily on the already hardpressed footwear industry.  I am thinking of Clarks in Dundalk and other footwear businesses are also under severe pressure. The Minister is ill-advised in increasing the VAT on clothing and footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern addressed himself to the position of those who may be over that age and how that is to be determined.  If you are unlucky enough to be eight or nine years of age and have a foot size of a child of ten, 11 or 12 you will be caught in the trap.  I have to declare a personal interest because I have an eight year old child who takes the same size as a 13 year old in clothes and shoes.  However, the Minister need not worry about me but should concentrate on those who are more important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputies O'Kennedy, Ahern and Mac Giolla in the case they made.  We have pointed out at some length the effect of these impositions.  On an earlier section of the Bill the Minister advanced an extraordinary argument when he said that the rate of VAT on footwear did not affect the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most extraordinary but I will let it rest.  Deputy Ahern referred to the situation regarding footwear appropriate to children of 11 years or under.  No country in the civilised world has more ludicrous legislation than that which applies one rate of tax to footwear appropriate to children over 11 years of age and no tax at all on footwear for children under 11 years of age.  That provision should be withdrawn in the interest of sanity, if nothing else.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister this morning how he proposed to tackle the unemployment problem by increasing the burden of taxation on most labour-intensive industries. I do not recall him replying to that and I should like to get the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The imposition of VAT on footwear seriously affects the living standards of poor families.  The Minister must realise that those families are already suffering as a result of the high cost of living and serious unemployment. I do not know how the Minister arrives at the cut off point of 11 years of age.  It baffles me because children of all ages go through many pairs of shoes and boots in a year.  Indeed there should be an incentive for parents whose children are approaching the teenage stage instead of penalising them.  There have been many job losses in the footwear industry over the past few years and it is in need of a lift instead of the imposition of an extra 10 per cent in VAT which will kill it.  I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the position in this regard.</P>

There is also a VAT rate of 23 per cent on hurleys which is also relevant and perhaps the Minister could let us know how much it would cost the State if he removed VAT on hurleys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has come down very hard on young children, not just in relation to clothes and shoes but also in regard to the games they play. If a youngster goes out to kick football in his boots it will cost a lot more now.  If he brings his hurley also he will get no sympathy from the Minister.  The poor mothers will have to find the money for clothes and shoes.  In rural areas, children do not normally tog out in football gear but play in their own clothes and shoes which wear out very quickly.  I can anticipate the Minister's response, his track record is so consistent that if he was a horse in training for the Derby, he would be past the post.  He has been more consistent than any previous Minister in his pace and in his stubborn resistance to change.  He is determined to ignore advice or suggestions from any quarter. The case which my colleagues made so well will now be ignored.  He ignored poor Deputy Conlon yesterday and we have no hope at all.  I see Deputy Yates coming in.

As Deputy Mac Giolla said, we are now talking about something which brought down the Government some years ago when apparently some Members of this House had some degree of social conscience, although they were not to be found in the Labour Party.  They will not be found there now either.  They have not come into the House to express an opinion.  I am serious.  I would welcome their support.  I am not a hypocrite. They are.

It is a source of regret to many Members of the House that in all the amendments he has tabled he has not tabled one which was complementary to another.

      <P>Small businessmen had to do a considerable amount of form filling.  They had to complete seven different columns of VAT rates.  I did it myself in a drapery business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment last night I was making the point that while <i>Building on Reality</i> still remains, or seems to remain, the official policy document of the Government, the reality is that individual Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, have changed course and altered the targets of that plan on a number of occasions since its introduction.  The Minister knows well that the Government's seeming adherence to the plan is at this stage merely a public relations exercise.  Indeed, if there is any one area in which this Government have been successful, surely it is in the area of public relations.  It has been one <Col N="1190" /> of their greatest and most successful achievements since they came to office.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for this country, government is not about good essay writing; government is not about good media management.  It is about economic planning and economic management.  At present, in the life time of this Dáil there is no credible plan in existence and everybody knows that there is no economic management of any kind.  The truth is that the Taoiseach and the Government are now beginning to recognise that their economic projections have gone drastically wrong, that the plan which they put before this House will not in any way achieve its economic objectives.  They know that time is now running out and that the politically sensible thing to do is for individual Ministers to abandon the plan and to embark on a politically motivated course of political self-preservation. That is exactly what is happening at present: we are now debating a plan that does not exist.  Last night I was challenged by the Minister to give one example of where the Government changed course. One would only have to go back two or three days to find one major area where the Government changed course, namely, the most recent statement of the Minister for the Environment when he wrote to the county managers and told them to be lenient in regard to local authority service charges.  When one contrasts that statement with the earlier circular to the county managers demanding immediate action to collect the charges, it is obvious that is an immediate example of where the Government changed course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government now realise that the introduction of service charges was wrong and immoral.  They know those charges are not a suitable means of providing adequate finance for local authorities. The decision to introduce them was poor political judgment on the part of the Minister who introduced them.  We know that decision was a panic measure at a time when the Government had decided officially to abandon the local authorities. Therefore, the statement by the Minister last week, coming at this time on the eve of the local elections, will be seen by <Col N="1191" /> the people as a political ploy in order to regain some kind of political credibility.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that the dedicated and committed public representatives will have to face the electorate embarrassed and humiliated because of the almost total failure of the system in the past six years and particularly in the past two years.  During that time finance has been denied to the various local authorities by the Minister for the Environment.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that in the past two years the Government have almost totally dismantled the local Government structure and in so doing they have abandoned the rural community because the rural road network is almost impassable due to inadequate finance.  The local authorities have not had the necessary finance even to fill the potholes.  This Dublin-based Government have treated the rural community with absolute and total contempt.</P>
    <P>The Government should now officially abandon this policy document because it is being abandoned daily by individual Ministers.  They should replace it with some document entitled &ldquo;Facing Reality&rdquo;.  If they are to have any credibility they must spend the next two years or whatever time is left to them in facing the reality of the economic situation and in endeavouring to find credible solutions to some of our problems.</P>
    <P>I agree we must have economic planning. I understand that sometimes it is difficult to reach set economic targets. However, the Government should not blindly follow a plan that has failed.  Even more important, they should not embark on an uncharted course with no destination in sight, as seems to be happening now in relation to the document before us tonight.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to the Minister for Finance embark on a top-rate public relations exercise.  Anyone who did not think too seriously about what he was saying might imagine that somehow this country and this Government were making progress.  I jotted down a few areas where the House can judge if the Government were successful or were failures. <Col N="1192" /> I do not think anyone will deny that we have the highest level of unemployment ever recorded and which is continuing to increase under the stewardship of this Government.  I do not think anyone will deny that never in the history of the State was law and order at such a low ebb as it is at present.  I do not think anybody will dispute that the number of factory closures and liquidations in the past two and a half years have been the greatest ever recorded in our history.  Most important, and where I think the Government have done the best public relations exercise, somehow or other they have sold the idea that they have been engaged in trying to apply financial rectitude to deal with what they call was the misspending of the previous administration. The reality is that this Minister, the man who talks so much about financial rectitude, has borrowed more in two and a half years than was ever borrowed by any Minister for Finance in the history of the State.  That is saying something, particularly when one sees the public relations exercise carried out here last night for the benefit of this House and the nation.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the local authorities who are at the point of collapse. Members of this House know it is an embarrassment at the moment to be a member of a local authority.  The Minister for Health is present in the House now and it is worth nothing that in almost every hospital for the past two and a half years public wards have been closed and beds have been left unoccupied because adequate finance has not been available to the health boards to provide a full range of hospital services.  It is also true that patients have been denied essential operations.  I say that particularly with regard to hip replacements.  This operation is essential for many old people, many of whom are on very lengthy waiting lists.</P>
    <P>It is also true that local authorities at present have to cope with the situation where more and more mortgage holders are being brought to court and their houses repossessed.  These people have worked hard but because of unemployment they cannot meet their mortgage <Col N="1193" /> repayments.  Yet, there is not one word about them from this Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture and the super-levy, it is despicable that the Minister for Agriculture has spent the past number of weeks in Brussels negotiating a case that should not have had to be negotiated.  However, this was necessary because the Minister and his Department did not make the proper calculations in regard to milk output for 1983.</P>
    <P>One area to which I must refer relates to the breakdown of law and order.  It must be placed on record that the increase in crime and violence, rampant throughout the country, is a direct result of the economic policies being pursued by this Government.  It is a well established fact that the high level of unemployment contributes in a large way to the increasing incidence of crime and lawlessness, which have brought about a situation in which old people feel insecure in their homes and one in which property, public and private, is no longer safe.</P>
    <P>In the context of what I am saying in terms of law and order it is important that we recognise and give full credit to the Garda and prison officers for the very difficult task they perform on our behalf. This is not an area for political point scoring and I wish to be as constructive as possible.  I would say to the Minister for Justice that he should recognise the difficult task of the Garda and of prison officers, that he should not use the authority of his office to make these important and indispensable employees of the State feel subservient to his office, as the prison officers feel at present.  We owe them an extreme debt of gratitude.  They perform an extremely difficult task and we should not be seen in this House to embarrass them in any way.</P>

      <P>When the national plan was being prepared last year the title was carefully chosen as an accurate description.  The plan builds on the reality that when we assumed office we were confronted by unsustainable high levels of borrowing and debt.  The plan is built on the reality of internationally <Col N="1194" /> high unemployment levels especially in Europe and on the reality of Ireland's uniquely high rate of increase in its working population.  It is also built on the reality of a small open economy very much affected by international trade and economic trends and able to survive only if fully competitive in the world economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>By contrast, the major critics of the plan are, in differing ways, not as closely in touch with the reality of the current situation as we are. There are two distinct strands in the criticism which the plan has received.  The first is an understandable and praiseworthy aim to have the social and economic ideals to which we all strive set out in any planning document.  Thus we would all agree that low unemployment, a more efficient use of the resources which we have and a reduction in the inequalities, poverty and social hardship in our country are all aims to which we aspire; although many of us would have very different views about the best ways to achieve these aims.  In the context of the starting point for the plan, however, especially the now familiar general economic problems, the most immediate and pressing need had to be preventing the insolvency of the country and turning around the disastrous trends in the major economic indicators which had emerged in the latter part of the 1970s.</P>
      <P>This Government refused, when preparing the plan and refuses again now to hide the truth from the people: that the country was in severe crisis, that unpleasant and unpalatable measures would need to be taken and that movement away from the critical situation which we were facing would be painfully slow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of criticism which stresses the major ideals of our society is, however, to be entirely welcomed and must be continued.  For we need to be reminded continually of those ideals which we share and which we are seeking to achieve, however, slowly and inadequately in the face of immediate crises and difficulties. <Col N="1195" /> I suggest that any Government which has no underlying coherent social philosophy is not worthy of the basic idealism of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The differences which arise between us and the Opposition are those inherent in the job of shifting from an unpleasant, present reality to the hoped-for ideal situation of the future in trying to resolve that issue.  We in the Labour Party welcome and look for open, honest, interchange of opinion in this area.  We realise that in so doing the whole concept of that approach is totally foreign to Fianna Fáil and is almost incomprehensible to them at this point.  There is nothing but reaction from Fianna Fáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It emanates from a party which allows freedom of speech and action to its leader only and insists that all others must merely accept the leader's views.  There is dissension in the Labour Party.  There is honest controversy within the Labour Party.  I welcome that but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil take that as a sign of weakness, that has to be suppressed as it is suppressed in their party.  Open discussion is the basic strength of Labour Party organisation, is a sign of some maturity within our organisation and a reflection of the truly democratic nature of our party.</P>
      <P>The other part of the criticism the plan has received, I suggest, is not based on idealism or indeed any philosophical discussion about different approaches. The criticism of the plan which we have heard in this debate, from Deputy Haughey in particular and earlier from Fianna Fáil, owe absolutely nothing to principle or ideal, nor even to a reasonable standard of intellectural debate. They are merely destructive, misleading, dishonest and are based on the fallacy that it is possible for a Government to spend more and more while at the same time taking in less and less money in taxation and simultaneously reducing borrowing.  That is the basic approach of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Deputy Haughey came in here last evening advocating £200 million for the construction industry with a simultaneous reduction in taxation.  When the public service pay agreement was being negotiated Deputy Haughey said he would spend £300 million on a 14 per cent increase in public sector pay with a simultaneous reduction in taxation.  Deputy Haughey has launched horticulture departments and marine resource departments, at £30 million and £40 million a piece with a simultaneous reduction in taxation.  That approach is a total, absolute and abject contradiction in terms. Even the simplest arithmetic on the need to relate Government income to Government expenditure appears to be beyond the understanding of the Opposition at present.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the basic structure of the document <i>Building on Reality</i> itself. It simply was that Ireland has a mixed economy, containing both the public and private sectors and is based on the fact that the State will have direct control over aspects of the public sector and a direct influence over the multitude of individual decisions taken in the private sector.  Furthermore it is based on the reality that we are an open economy, as every Deputy knows, an open economy, as in which sustainable growth is dependent almost exclusively on exports to the world at large.  That is the basis on which that document was prepared, is the basis on which our policies are working and will continue to work for the remainder of our term of office.  Indeed I might suggest that that thrust will have an impact throughout the remainder of the eighties.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly the Opposition fail to understand the essential ingredients of the world trading system in which we live, and continually harp on and criticise in a totally negative way the features of planning set out in the national plan. I suggest that the important feature of <i>Building on Reality</i> is the extent to which it has now become a working document of Government rather than a report to be published in triumph and then forgotten totally, as happened in the case of the <Col N="1197" /> Opposition's last plan, <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>

For the first time in the history of the State the basic framework for the capital programme for 1985, 1986 and 1987 is set out in a document.  That was never set out in a Fianna Fáil document in the history of this State.  We have set out the current Estimate figures for 1985 1986 and 1987 and they were never published by Fianna Fáil.

      <P>There is a conflict and Deputy Reynolds, a former and somewhat distinguished Cabinet member, is well aware that such conflicts arise.  All policy objectives are in conflict with one another no matter what Government are in power.  We have to reconcile <Col N="1198" /> the various conflicts.  The attempt to halt and reverse the upward trend of unemployment is in conflict in many respects with the decision to spend more and more money on the public sector side, or to provide more relief to the private sector or to reduce taxation.  There is a conflict in terms of the decisions that have to be taken.</P>
      <P>We have to ensure that the burden of taxation is kept as low as possible.  That is difficult to achieve bearing in mind the amount of unemployment we have.  We have to halt the ever-rising burden of interest payments on a mounting public debt at home and abroad.  Simultaneously we have to ensure that we still have money for such services as health, education, social welfare and housing.  They are difficult issues to reconcile.  The Leader of the Opposition came in to the House and in a dishonest political presentation suggested that we spend more money on housing, that we give the construction industry £200 million.</P>

      <P>It is a contradiction on the part of the Opposition to advocate additional public spending.  At the moment they are on the £600 million mark per year.  It is not £600 million in terms of capital expenditure but £600 million annually in terms of current expenditure be it on social welfare, hospitals, housing, or education.  During the course of last night's debate the Opposition criticised the current budget deficit as being <Col N="1199" /> too high, 7.9 per cent of GNP or £1,200 million.</P>

      <P>We now have the Fianna Fáil Party putting forward another con-trick.  We had a cry from Deputy Haughey last night that the current budget deficit was too high and that foreign borrowing was too high.  He suggested that we should reduce public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Coalition promised.  Why did the Coalition say that they would wipe out the current budget deficit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance asked Deputy Haughey if he was suggesting that we should lay off more gardaí, reduce the size of the Army, reduce the number of teachers or reduce the number of persons employed in the health services in order to reduce public expenditure.  However, there was not a twitter of response from the Opposition <Col N="1200" /> in terms of controlling public expenditure. Fianna Fáil, notably Deputies Haughey and O'Kennedy, keep saying that our public expenditure is too high but when they get anywhere near the wire of saying where the expenditure should be reduced, in CIE or in other areas, they run away and will not under any circumstances give the slightest indication of where they will get the reduction. That is the type of political dishonesty with which the Opposition hope to gain support.</P>
      <P>One of the factors the Opposition have ignored is the extent to which the plan, and the policies pursued by the Government, have impacted on the level of inflation.  Inflation has been declining with a few reverses since 1982.  From 1983 onward the decline has been steady and consistent and currently the rate of inflation &mdash; at 6¼ per cent for the first quarter of 1985 &mdash; is even lower than predicted in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  After so many years of high inflation it is difficult for many of us to adjust quickly to this most welcome change.  Few people remember accurately the prices of all the goods and services they buy because it is not so long ago, 1981, when the rate of inflation was 23 per cent.  The annual rate has been reduced by us since then to rock bottom.  It is the policy of the Government to keep the rate of inflation low because that has three advantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By reducing the rate of inflation our competitive edge on the export market gains considerably.  Secondly, a low inflation makes life easier for those on fixed incomes whose pay is no longer seriously eroded by massive price increases.  Thirdly, it makes it possible for more moderate wage demands since the cost of living is rising much slower.  I was appalled to hear Deputy Haughey last Christmas saying there was no problem about granting a 14 per cent increase in the public sector, amounting to £300 million.  It must be remembered that every increase of 1 per cent in public service pay costs £20 million.  When Deputy Haughey was asked where he would find the money he said he would cut public expenditure in other areas. <Col N="1201" /> He forgot that 70 per cent of all public expenditure in the current Estimates is for pay.  That hypocrisy puzzles me. Unfortunately the performance of the Fianna Fáil Party in that area is something which I have great difficulty in assessing from time to time.</P>

      <P>The volume of industrial production, which increased by 13½ per cent last year, is a very substantial increase while the volume of industrial exports last year went up by 19½ per cent. I doubt if that could be equalled on any record of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Ireland's record for industry is very encouraging.  It augurs well for the future and the Central Bank in its latest report predicts a volume increase in industrial output of 9 per cent in 1985.  There has been a slight fall in industrial employment largely because of better labour productivity within our export industries and, therefore, the international competitiveness of our industrial products has increased markedly in recent years.  I will conclude my observations in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude my observations.  Work is being done by the Youth Employment Agency on the employment side; work is now being done under the social employment scheme, which has already proved to be extremely popular and to which there has been a massive response; work is being done under the enterprise allowance scheme, introduced in January 1984, which has already enabled 5,000 unemployed people to establish themselves in their own work using that scheme; and, indeed, work is being done in many other areas.  In education there has been a continuing investment of State funds.  In 1983 the taxpayer provided a basic £550 for <Col N="1202" /> every primary school child, nearly £1,000 for every post primary school child and between £2,100 and £5,000 for every third level student, depending on the course of studies.  These are record money transfers into the education system in the lifetime of this Government and there have been very few complaints from very few Deputies in that area.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that last year, for the first time in ten years, we constructed 7,000 local authority houses.  In addition we introduced the £5,000 scheme for local authority tenants who wish to proceed to private dwellings and we introduced the doubling of the housing grant to £2,000.  Therefore, we now have a situation where there are thousands of local authority tenants getting £5,000 to vacate their dwellings so that the local authority can allocate them to somebody else.  These people also have the £2,000 new house grant and £3,000 in mortgage interest subsidy.  In total £10,000 is available and that is being taken up at local authority level.  For the first time in the history of the State we have an excellent scheme which is working and which is to the credit of this Government.</P>
      <P>With an inflation rate of 6¼ per cent increases in social welfare payments have matched inflation.  Despite the recession and the fact that every other Minister for Social Welfare in every other European country is reducing social welfare payments, we have matched inflation on every single rate.  The long term unemployed have had a 33 per cent increase since we took over, with inflation at 23 per cent in that period.  There has been a real allocation of 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;noting that <i>Building on Reality</i> is basically a restatement of unsuccessful social and economic policies pursued by successive Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments, calls for the withdrawal of the plan, and urges the Government to recognise that private enterprise cannot provide full employment and that productive State enterprise must be the engine <Col N="1206" /> of growth to create jobs and get the economy on the move again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Desmond, is right in saying that this is a repeat of a debate which took place last October and November and for that reason much of what I have to say may be a repeat of what has already been said many times. The debate between the Coalition and Fianna Fáil is basically about who will manage the existing economy and system better.  One side argue that they are doing it correctly and the other side argue that they would do it better if they were in.  I and, I assume, the Labour Party Members of the Coalition would argue that the system needs complete overhaul and change and that it is not simply a question of who is to manage it more effectively but who is capable of altering it in such a fundamental way that the doctrine of profit and private enterprise is overtaken by the doctrine of socialist planning of the economy.</P>
    <P>Various Governments, both Coalition and Fianna Fáil, have issued various documents from time to time which they called plans.  The most notable thing about all of these plans is that they are not plans, they are a series of aspirations strung together with incentives tacked on to encourage private enterprise to do the job.  They have not in all cases spelled out exactly what they meant about doing the job, and we must read that to mean doing their own job to make money irrespective of the effects on the social fabric of the State.  In the few minutes that I have it is necessary to make a simple point: that until such time as the major conservative parties in this House, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, agree either to manage the economy together or to go into opposition to a socialist Government, we will have a continuing growth in cynicism and disillusionment among the electorate.  All they have seen for most of today at any rate is petty bickering, cat calling and name calling across the floor with no basic difference of political or economic opinion between the two sides.  It is galling that on the one hand we have the Labour Party in Coalition&mdash;<Col N="1207" /> that is bad enough &mdash; but on the other hand Fianna Fáil on this side are claiming to be at this time the voice of the working class and the unemployed.  At one stage they launched themselves into great support of the ICTU document and said that they supported it completely, that everything was in order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will say what I have to say in five minutes.  They supported all of these things in the ICTU document, but the working class people outside this House should recognise the record of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government, when they had the opportunity to be friends of the working class and unemployed and when they put ESB workers into prison, had the postal workers on the streets for months in 1979 coming up to the local elections and refused to pay the second phase of the public service pay award in 1982.  It was they who went on a binge of borrowing in 1977 for day to day expenditure in order to pay for their election promises, and that to a large extent has us in the present crisis of foreign debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People listening to the Fianna Fáil spokesman speaking on this document <i>Building on Reality</i> should compare it with <i>The Way Forward</i> which was issued in 1982.  To my knowledge Fianna Fáil have not abandoned that document, publicly at any rate.  From reading sections of it it is clear that it bears a very close relationship to <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The charade that we go through every now and again in the House of the Coalition and Fianna Fáil berating each other for not doing this and not doing that could give way to real political debate about the nature of the society we have on this island, the nature of the economy and what is required to eliminate unemployment. It is obvious to anyone who has watched what has been going on since 1973 that cutting budget deficits and cutting foreign borrowing in themselves will not solve the unemployment problem any <Col N="1208" /> more than increasing the deficit and borrowing for day to day expenditure will solve it.  A very basic debate needs to be carried on which I have not time in the five minutes available to me to pursue; but until we settle down to debate the real economic issues we will increase cynicism and disillusionment in the people outside this House.</P>
    <P>I will make one or two points about Fianna Fáil and the ICTU document. The Fianna Fáil document says that the growth in the size of the public service and its cost must be reversed.  The ICTU document says that not enough resources are devoted to the public service.  Fianna Fáil say that it is intended that the annual allocation to education in 1984-87 would be £94 million as in 1983.  The ICTU say that there can be no cutback whatever in overall expenditure measures in real terms in education.  Fianna Fáil say that the emphasis will be on reducing State support for public housing.  The ICTU say that there is an urgent need for an increase in the proportion of houses provided by local authorities and they call for a State construction company.  Fianna Fáil say that they support the ICTU document, they are the voice of the working class and at the same time their document <i>The Way Forward</i> is completely and totally contradictory of everything the ICTU stand for.</P>

      <P>In the short time available I would like to go through a number of points.  If I were not here talking about <i>Building on Reality</i> I would not believe the reality of the speech made by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare. We are not just now saying that this plan should be withdrawn.  From the day it was issued we said that this plan was not real, it was based on unreality and it was not practicable.  The arguments put forward by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare as to why we should follow this plan and why people should work to it are unbelievable.  The objective of <i>Building on Reality</i> was set out.  The plan sets out to halt and reverse the continuing upward spiral of unemployment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be shared between me and my colleague.  The plan sets out to halt and reverse the continued upward spiral of unemployment, to create the conditions in which, after the sharp decline of the past four years, employment will be more readily created and sustained.  Then the Minister for Health and Social Welfare comes in and sets out all the reasons why we have to cut down, to control our debts and halt this huge deficit we have, to stop foreign borrowing, and justifies almost everything that must be against Labour Party policy.</P>
      <P>I can understand why Deputy De Rossa is slightly annoyed, but it is amazing that tonight, when we are talking about the economic policies of the Government, he stands up for ten minutes and spends nine and a half minutes talking about Fianna Fáil policy and 30 seconds talking about Government policies. That is unlike him.  Obviously, he is concerned about Fianna Fáil having an impact on the working class.  He knows that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has no support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister has left because I gather he was a strong supporter of the ICTU and today's paper reports a motion from the ITGWU National Executive Council calling on the Government to declare the unemployment crisis a national emergency, to table the emergency on the agendas of the European Commission and the Council of the European Communities and to be discussed at the uniion's conference in his home city of Cork next week.  He is the Minister who has decimated the health service, who tonight put forward all the reasons why he could do nothing, why there is no money for education or to help youth unemployment.  I will tell him one thing that he could do.  This year £500 million is to be spent by his Department paying people on unemployment benefit and assistance.  Half of the people on the live register have been on it for over 12 months.  Does he not care about them? <Col N="1210" /> Is it a simple question of putting forward his monetarist policies?  Does he ignore the executive of the ICTU who supported him for years?  Does he ignore his own conference, his parliamentary party, the Labour Party?  I know that a person such as the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, who is chairman of that party, must feel sick when a Minister of his Government comes in and speaks against his party, his parliamentary party, his national executive and his trade union movement and says that the policies of the Labour Party are now the same as those put forward by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, here last night. He quoted the great success in the building industry, but he quoted selectively from the Central Bank report.  He did not finish the paragraph, which read:</P>
    <P>The volume of private housing output is estimated to have fallen by about 8 per cent, with larger falls occurring in industrial and commercial building.  Public Capital Programme (PCP) expenditure affecting the building industry fell by about 2½ per cent in volume in 1984....</P>
    <P>The outlook for building and construction continues to be unfavourable in 1985.  A volume reduction in the building content of PCP expenditure of about 4 per cent and a continued decline in the private housing sector suggests a further 4 per cent volume fall in building output in 1985.  Employment in the sector is projected to fall by 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted just one line.  Every report whether by the NESC, ESRI, Central Bank, AIB or any other organsiation, sets out clearly that this Government are simply increasing the numbers of unemployed.  Almost 20 per cent of the people are unemployed, over 225,000, and if we include the youth who are unregistered, there are another 16,000.  We see brochures from Britain daily about the thousands of people going to London looking for work.  Organisations which closed down in the fifties in London &mdash; the Irish Welfare Bureau, the <Col N="1211" /> Brent Irish Advisory Service, the Harringay Irish Community Service and Irish welfare centres all over London &mdash; have reopened and are trying to advise people not to go to London because the jobs are not there.  Yet people are going to London irrespective of this advice and working for £10 when the union rate is £30 and the Minister for Health is happy. This is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Finance coolly and calmly read out the same speech he has been making for the last two and a half years.  He told us there were no real problems.  I know he has been busy for the last three weeks, that he does not have to worry about local elections and that he is given briefs by his officials, but he should go out with his colleague, Deputy Keating, to Sheriff Street where there is 40 per cent unemployment, or any other part of the city, and hear the views of the people on Deputy Dukes and his Government or about Deputy Barry Desmond.  He should listen to what the people have to say about hospital wards being closed and about the queues at the outpatient clinics being longer than they have been since the foundation of the State.  There is no point saying you will provide services if you close the units which should provide those services, because that is what is happening.  The Minister for Labour was credited with a social employment scheme which I supported but there is no point having such a scheme to help 10,000 people when only six people are availing of it because the trade unions will not cooperate with this Government.  Deputy De Rossa should mention a few of these points when he is talking about the trade unions.  We never said we supported every line of the documents and the trade unions know that because we met them several times, but neither did we say we supported a 14 per cent increase for the public service.  Whoever advised the Minister for Health on economic and financial matters obviously gives him the same advise as he does on health matters because most of the points he put forward as Fianna Fáil policy are not true.  The <Col N="1212" /> facts are on the record.  The Minister, Deputy Desmond, was not here last night when the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke, so it was easy for him to misquote this evening.</P>
    <P>The people know the facts.  Almost 20 per cent of the working population are unemployed.  This Government have taken money out of the education system, they closed Irish Shipping, they privatised the B &amp; I, they have almost closed the Port and Docks, and factories &mdash; Fords, Dunlops, Verolme and so on &mdash; have closed down.  The people who lost their jobs in those industries do not have a hope in hell of getting another job.  I spoke today to some people from Irish Shipping where 240 people lost their jobs; 21 have since got employment, 17 outside the country and the four who got jobs in Ireland were typists.  That is the reality. What did the Government do for them?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask Deputy De Rossa if Fianna Fáil would have closed Irish Shipping.  Did we cut the pensions of people who were 15 or 20 years out of Irish Shipping from, say, £15 to £10 a week?  Did we refuse to give them redundancy payments above the statutory limit?  I met a man tonight who had worked for 27 years in Irish Shipping but what did he get?  He got £4,000 and he cannot get back his pension contributions. These are the policies being followed by this Government.</P>
    <P>Last week we spoke about the myths and inadequacies of the training schemes; we spoke about the unfairness of the social welfare system and how difficult it was to get a medical card but tonight the Minister said how he had developed this service and the community welfare scheme.  He has cut back on the health boards, local authorities are starved of funds, and there has not been a new education service in two and a half years. Nothing has been done by this Government. They continue to stab the workers and the unemployed in every way possible. Last summer when everyone was on holiday they introduced the food subsidies. People will not forget these facts. The Minister for the Environment has called off the harassment of people who <Col N="1213" /> do not pay their local service charges because the local elections will be held next month.</P>
    <P>Last October we said the policies in <i>Building on Reality</i> were not real.  We have asked this Government on a number of occasions to bring in realistic policies, to bring investment back into the country to the level it was at in 1977 to 1982, but what did they do?  They produced the document <i>Building on Reality</i> which does not have a section on investment and there is nothing for the construction industry.  The Minister said we promised £100 million for the construction industry, but is it not better to put that amount into this industry than to provide £500 million for people on unemployment assistance?  There are thousands of people living on the breadline who have medical cards but who are being chased to pay water rates and other charges. This Minister neglects his parliamentary party, the trade union movement and the working class and then says Fianna Fáil will do no better.  We have always done better.</P>
    <P>It is easy for minority parties, who will probably never be in the position to do anything, to knock everybody else.  It is unusual for Deputy De Rossa to do that, but there is no point in saying we did not do this, that or the other.  We built industries; we set up semi-State companies; we built an excellent construction industry; we saved Dublin port and made it viable; we built housing estates and education complexes in difficult times. But what has happened in recent years? Nothing.  In the last two and a half years the working class people have been turned on by this Government.  I would expect Deputy De Rossa to support the Opposition and not spend his time trying to give credibility to unrealistic policies.</P>
    <P>This Government took the wrong road a long time ago.  We have repeatedly said that.  There are 250,000 people unemployed, three times the number needed to fill Croke Park with thousands still outside.  We cannot continue to put people on welfare benefits, take away their health services and disrupt their way of life and still expect their support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Perhaps the businessmen thought for a while that this Government were going to control public expenditure, but I am sure Deputy Coveney will explain in five minutes that they did not even do that. <i>Building on Reality</i> has done nothing for the business people.  It has done nothing to control the finances of the State.  We are not saying, as the Minister for Health said, that the deficit was too big; we said that the money provided had been spent in the first three months of the year and we asked if there would be a budget two days after the local elections.  This Government have done nothing for jobs, employment or people on welfare or assistance.  It was amazing to hear the Tánaiste make a 50 minute speech, as dead a speech as one will ever hear, last Saturday week.  His only boast, as far as I can remember, and the Minister for Health repeated it tonight, was that the Labour Party in Government had succeeded in ensuring that the money paid to the 250,000 people unemployed kept pace with inflation.  That is some boast. He could not say they had done anything for employment, good bad or indifferent. He did nothing for people who wanted to get off the live register.  He did not do anything either for education or health, and his boast is that he kept unemployment index-linked to inflation.  The sooner people get a chance to vote in a general election the better.  At least they will get a chance to show their disapproval in the forthcoming local elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion put down by Fianna Fáil.  Before tonight, I thought we had only to convince two people &mdash; the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance &mdash; that we really have serious problems.  Unfortunately, we now have a third recruit, the Minister for Health, who is far removed from the reality of ordinary, everyday life.  I could not believe my ears when I listened to the hypocrisy he expounded, especially as I remember him from 1977 to 1981 and thereafter talking about the social conscience of the Labour Party and what should be done for ordinary people.  He now joins the most right wing Minister <Col N="1215" /> for Finance which this country has ever had.  He is so removed from the reality of the Labour Party Conference in Cork that he did not get their message either.</P>
      <P>We have no hang-ups about <i>Building On Reality</i>.  As I said on the day it was introduced, it was badly named; it should have been called &ldquo;Building on Unreality.&rdquo; It was built on quicksand.  Any small builder &mdash; although there are not too many working today &mdash; knows that a house built on quicksand will not last. It was also built on heroic assumptions. What were they?  A priority for the success of the plan was to be a freeze on public sector pay.  Did we get that?  We did not, because at 11.42 p.m. on the night before the budget Fine Gael had to cave in to the Labour Party who would not accept a freeze on public service pay and they put £108 million into the budget to provide for it.</P>
      <P>So much for the honesty and credibility which the Government espouse night after night.  They use every possible tool available to convince the people that all is well at home.  Last Sunday the Taoiseach was asked if he would not come home from Canada to deal with the problems here.  He replied that there were no problems at home.  I listened to the Minister for Finance last night, a man who consistently talks about honesty and credibility but who distorts facts and figures to convey the message that all is well.  Let us look at the facts and stop trying to cod the people.  You can fool some of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all the people all of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a discredited Taoiseach and a discredited plan.  There was supposed to be a public sector pay freeze but that has gone out the window.  Interest rates were to come come down but they are now higher than when the plan was introduced. The dollar is not losing its value. Have international markets continued to expand and will they so so for the next three years?  The best information is that they will not and that the American economy is entering another recession.  We know that when America sneezes we all catch a cold.  Even Government Ministers <Col N="1216" /> do not believe that the plan will work. When Deputy Quinn was asked about reducing the current budget deficit to 5 per cent in 1987, he replied that he intended to forget about that target because he did not agree with it.  If you want to reduce the current budget deficit to 5 per cent for 1987, then next year you will take off £340 million in cuts and more the following year.  The Government are not prepared to do this.</P>
    <P>Minister Desmond has the gall to say that Fianna Fáil make contradictory statements.  If he looks at our record for 1982 he will see that we kept on target. Every time the people called on Fianna Fáil to lead and develop the country we were always able to do so.  We did not get into office under false pretences as is the case with the Government.  Their plan was out of date within a month of being published and it is now discredited and disgraced.  Indeed, the Central Bank said that all the factors combined in the plan give an impression of hasty compilation and half baked stances.  Every chapter is a failure.  There is total dishonesty and misrepresentation of labour force figures. The Government said that in April 1984 there were 214,000 people employed in manufacturing industry and quoted a labour survey as the source of these figures.  There was no labour force survey in March or April 1984 and the only statistics available at that time were those from the Central Statistics Office on employment figures which mentioned 197,000.  How can the people believe the Government's figures?  They will give their answer on 20 June, and in a general election they will give the same answer.</P>
    <P>The Government said that unemployment would level off at 220,000.  At the end of 1984 it stood at 234,000.  Do I have to go any further?  The Government should come clean and tell the people that there are big problems.  When we look at the current budget deficit we see that two-thirds of it is eaten up already and they expect us to believe they will be on target.  They will be on target for the highest budget deficit in the history of the State.  I heard Minister Desmond talking about 1981 but the current budget deficit <Col N="1217" /> then was 7.9 per cent.  That is the time when the so-called economic commentators were trying to put the fear of God into everyone by saying that if our finances were not put in order international bankers would be knocking at our door to tell us how to run our business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were going to ask them a few years ago there is an even better excuse for asking them in today. Deputy Coveney is in business and if he can tell me that the environment for growth and the climate for investment is such that an enterprise can flourish I will bow my head to him.  I know he would not say that.  I also know that he did not say at a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure that the Youth Employment Agency was a farce, that we did not need it and that it was just another layer of bureaucracy.  He should also stand up and say that the NDC is another layer of bureaucracy which will not do anything to alleviate unemployment. He is not allowed to say those things, but I know he believes them.  He and I know that the climate is wrong and that there is no incentive to work.</P>
      <P>Another chapter mentions a new approach to public enterprise.  The only approach I see by the Government in that regard is one liquidation after another and sending for what used to be called a receiver.  Now we have to send for the national undertakers because that is about all that is left.  The National Development Corporation is a stillborn baby of the Labour Party.  If Minister Bruton has his way it will never see the light of day, and more luck to him.  There are supposed to be two parties in the Government. We wonder how long more the Labour Party will hang in there since they are not getting their part of the deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next chapter deals with helping the long term unemployed.  We dealt with that last week.  We put down a motion which the Government accepted by having no vote on it.  They have not got a manpower policy.  The whole plethora <Col N="1218" /> of schemes they have is not working.  The social employment scheme the Minister for Health talks about has not got off the ground because of trade union pressures. The Government's social policy is in tatters. Everybody on the streets of Ireland knows that the Government's social policy is represented by massive cuts in education, the dismantling of the health services and everything that goes with them.  The Government tried to convince us that the family income supplement would look after 30,000 families.  Only 1,800 families have got it.  This has been talked about for 18 months, another fraudulent presentation to the Irish people who are only waiting to get their hands on the Government.</P>

      <P>The postal service was so bad that the post never arrived.  Do I have to dwell on Government expenditure? I can only describe the Minister for Finance as the new Paul Daniels of Irish politics.  He tried to tell the taxpayers they would not have to pay more tax.  Everybody who got a pay cheque last week knows the reality.  Who is the Minister codding?  He is the Paul Daniels of Irish politics &mdash; now you see it; now you do not.  He is trying to fiddle around with figures and con the people into believing that the Government are not borrowing as much money as they were. When they took office the national debt was £12.7 billion.  At the end of this year it will be £20 billion.  Foreign borowing which they were to wipe out has gone from just over 3 billion to £8.5 billion.  I described the current budget deficit.  Do I have to say more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time the Government came clean with the people and told them they will take more tax from them and borrow more money and use it to pay an ever increasing number of unemployed people.  How can the Government convince me or any man with common sense that it is good business to borrow money to pay people to do nothing, while there are roads to be built and natural resources to be developed?  This document is an <Col N="1219" /> insult to our natural resources.  One-third of a page is devoted to fisheries, one page to forestry and half a page to tourism &mdash; all the areas where the jobs could be got if the Government had the political will and the business acumen to do the job. They should not try to cod the people any more with this document.  There is nothing in it.</P>
    <P>The Government's answer to everything is tax, tax and more tax.  The Fianna Fáil attitude is work, work and more work.  The Government will not reduce the taxation burden on the PAYE sector until they get more people back to work. The more people we have working, the bigger the contribution to the Exchequer and the quicker taxation will come down. It does not need any fancy plan bound up and sold like a packet of Persil which washes whiter than white to show what the country needs.  The ordinary people know that.  I cannot believe the Government do not know it.  If they want to keep their heads buried in the sand, that is their business.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the people and young people in particular, the Government should stop demolishing everything that was built up over the years by hard work by Irish men and women.  The best of our people whom we will need in the future to build up the country are going abroad. The Government should take down the signs of demolition, disillusion and despair and put up the signs of reconstruction and rebuilding.  Let us get down to doing the job we were elected to do. There is a job to be done.  Let us do it. The Government should take away this document as an admission that they understand the realities in Ireland today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am out of breath after listening to that.  This plan or any plan is constrained by three factors: the question of borrowing, the question of taxation and the question of public expenditure. We would all like to be able to invest in a high growth economy.  We would all like to put £200 million or £300 million into the building industry and a whole series of other projects.  The reality is that <Col N="1220" /> the country is crucified with taxation and foreign borrowing.  We must do something about public expenditure.  Fianna Fáil know that.  It is written all over their own document.  It is dishonest for them to continue to say we should have a high growth policy for employment.  We would love to do that, but we inherited a financial problem of enormous magnitude which prevents us from doing so and which constrains the development of the economy.</P>
      <P>Comments were made about the attitude of the Government to semi-State bodies.  We are determined to encourage efficiency in semi-State bodies.  The people want and expect that of us.  In a short period of time there are some signs that that policy is working.  NET are beginning to come out of their dire financial problems of a few years ago.  There are other signs of semi-State bodies being revived and encouraged by the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to say something about charges for local services.  I do not understand the attitude on the other side of the House on this subject.  The only Fianna Fáil Party policy document in existence that I know of is <i>The Way Forward 1983-1987</i>.  It states very clearly on page 96 that &ldquo;it will be necessary to consider imposing realistic charges both on individual users of sanitary services and developers so as to recoup part of the cost.  This matter will be examined in the context of legislation to empower local authorities to charge for services generally.&rdquo; That is identical to the policy of this Government. I do not understand why Fianna Fáil are running away from it.  They should not run away from it now that local elections are in the air.</P>
      <P>There would be a difference of opinion between Deputy Reynolds and myself, although we share backgrounds in business which might not be dissimilar.  I do not expect him to take my word for it that <i>Building on Reality</i> is beginning to work.  I have here the April edition of the Report of the Confederation of Irish Industry entitled <i>Economic Trends</i>.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> Ireland's inflation rate is continuing to come down.  Having fallen to an annual rate of 6.2 per cent in February, current predictions are that it will fall further to as low as 5 per cent by mid-May. This will put Ireland below the EEC average for the first time in many years and lower than the UK, France, Italy and Belgium.  A stable currency backed up by a low inflation and high productivity should enable Ireland to share many of the characteristics of the more disciplined communities such as Germany and the Netherlands and will lead to a more conducive climate for investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>If that does not mean <i>Building on Reality</i> is beginning to work, I do not know what it means.  It is patently absurd that we should be expected to deliver on a plan for three years in six months, and that we should be expected, when it is beginning to work, to review it and abandon it.  That would be the height of irresponsibility. The community expect stability.  They expect some rational form of planning. This is not a perfect plan.  Any of us writing the plan could come up with a slightly different version.  This is a good plan and we should stick with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is in very specific terms based on the failure of this document &mdash; I will not use the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;&mdash; to produce any results over the seven months since it was introduced here in the House.  We are calling on the Government to withdraw it and asking sensible people in the Labour Party to support our motion as it was supported in a very substantial way at the recent Labour Party Conference in Cork.  The reasons are quite obvious.  This document, purporting to be a plan, has not succeeded and has shown no sign so far of working towards the sort of successful conclusion which Deputy Coveney just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credibility is the all-important factor in the production of any document of this kind.  The document in question was presented as a plan for the period up to 1987.  It was produced on the basis that <Col N="1222" /> with the finance legislation that was to follow it would form an overall approach to economic planning in terms of dealing with our unemployment and public finance problems.  That is the very tone that was put on the document by the Taoiseach but this is where the basic lack of credibility lies.  Speaking about the document on 16 October last the Taoiseach said that the rise in unemployment would be halted.  This was from the Taoiseach who has been in the US for the past couple of weeks seeking to establish credibility on another basis.  The basic weakness in the case of this entire Government stems from the Taoiseach himself and permeates the Government. That weakness is manifested in the lack of credibility.  Not content with what one might regard as that negative promise, the Taoiseach went on to say that there would be a rapid increase in jobs, the number of which had fallen in the previous four years.</P>
    <P>The latest figures we have in regard to the building and construction industry particularly, in housing input and output, show that for the first time since 1977 the figure fell below 25,000.  We read at page 21 of <i>Building on Reality</i> that overall growth should resume early in the period of the plan and there is the forecast that employment would rise slightly between 1984 and 1987.  However, since the publication of the document in October last there has been a decrease in volume of about 9 per cent in the building and construction industry alone.  That trend developed prior to the doubling of the VAT on new house purchases so that with the reduction of 9 per cent in respect of employment in the industry, there is now a change in the VAT that will further aggravate the situation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the general picture in terms of the national finances and here again we find a serious situation developing. In the first quarter of this year the current budget deficit is estimated at £800 million or almost two-thirds of the deficit budgeted for the whole year.  Therefore we are going into a very serious unemployment situation and a very serious budget deficit situation which can only <Col N="1223" /> have been brought about by the downward turn in the economy because there is no doubt but that there is a downward spiral, that there are fewer people at work with the consequent lesser yield in taxation and greater cost to the Exchequer in terms of social welfare payments. In addition, this leads to further borrowing to cater for the deficits.</P>
    <P>This whole downward spiral in economic activity and public finances has been caused by the presentation, for the first time in this cosmetic way, of economic planning.  The Government plan had no basis in reality.</P>
    <P>During the debate that followed the publication of the document, I said that the stated objective of the plan was to increase employment but that in subsequent pages of the plan there was the projection that the unemployment figure would increase during the three year period.  This lip service to the problem of unemployment is callous hypocrisy, as can be seen from the table on page 145 of the plan where we read that it is proposed to scale down the public capital programme so that by 1987 in real terms public capital investment would be 20 per cent less than the present level.  It is not possible to bring about a reduction in unemployment and, consequently, an increase in employment unless there is an increase in public and private capital investment.  That is a basic, simple and straightforward fact.  It is what economics and public finances are about.  If there is an increase in investment either on the public side or on the private side, there will be more jobs and this results in less strain on the public finances in terms of social welfare payments and of taxation because there will be a broader spread of the tax base from which taxation is gathered.</P>
    <P>That basic element of economics is ignored in the document but we are talking of a document that is fraudulent. However, this is typical of the Taoiseach and of the <i>modus operandi</i> right across the board in so far as the Government are concerned whether they are dealing with economics, public finances, Northern <Col N="1224" /> Ireland, crime and vandalism or any other aspect of public policy.  The main purpose of the Government in the past two and a half years has been not to govern but to appear to look good.  That is not good enough either so far as this Dáil or so far as the people generally are concerned.  The people are waiting anxiously for a restoration of basic confidence in their institutions, for confidence in the capacity of the Government and public agencies to make things work, confidence in a tax system that will provide an environment in which people can work and, above all, political leaders in Government who can give them the necessary inspiration to point the way ahead and indicate to the people that there is a way forward, as we indicated in our document, <i>The Way Forward,</i> before we left office two and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>As this Government practically complete their third year in office, we see how fruitless those three years have been in the way of real performance as opposed to cosmetic performance.  We have had plenty of the latter.  We have had apparent leadership, not real leadership. There has been the issuing of documents like <i>Building on Reality</i> in the economic area and exercises in the political, constitutional and national areas and all these exercises have been basically fraudulent. Fraud is one thing that the Irish people will not tolerate in matters of public affairs.  That is why they have already decided &mdash; I do not care when it happens &mdash; in their minds and in their hearts to reject this Government because it is a fraudulent one.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Government realise that this type of exercise is not good enough, the better, and that what is required above all else is a psychological spur which will revitalise the minds and the creative abilities of our people, to show entrepreneurs and investors from home and abroad that there is a future and scope here for investment.  They must be shown that that scope for investment and that future will not be dependent on the whims of people who want to destroy the system or who have reservations about the system but that plans <Col N="1225" /> and developments on which confidence can be based will provide the psychological spur based fundamentally on a Government that will stay in office for the full period of five years with a clear majority, sure of where they are going.</P>
    <P>What is required today, above all else, is a political solution to our problems. People tend today to denigrate political solutions and political aspirations.  These are fundamental to Ireland's present day problems.  We have had sufficient analyses. In fact, we have been paralysed by analyses.  We have sufficient handlers, cosmetic people, dressage people and people who have sought to present us in this, that, or the other light.  What we want are people who will govern this country in a secure way, knowing that they will be there for a full period of five years, people who are not interested in knocking the other Government or the other party or parties.  After the next election, when Fianna Fáil obtain a clear majority, I do not intend to refer any more to any member of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  I would regard that as utterly irrelevant in the on-going political process which will be concerned with positive and decisive Government.</P>

      <P>We are where we are today because in pharisaical pursuit of what they considered to be some form of invented moral virtue which bore no relation to reality, they proceeded to produce publications like <i>Building on Reality</i> which were not based on any semblance of reality.  That document was fraudulent from day one in seeking to establish in the Irish mind that something had arrived in 1984 which was going to produce, by 1987, economic development that would lead to the growth in the Irish economy required to sustain the necessary employment and to eliminate social deprivation. That whole aspect has turned out to be a very sick joke.</P>
      <P>I hope by moving this motion that we have sought to re-establish today a plan for such economic development.  Above all, we want to see the re-establishment of old fashioned things called honesty and integrity in the conduct of Irish public affairs which were present before certain people started to debase this Parliament in their time, by using and abusing it instead of regarding this Parliament as the place that elected an Irish Government to carry out the business of the nation in an honest manner, rather than carry out a public relations exercise.</P>
      <P>I am very proud to say that over many years as a Government Minister I have never had a public relations man in my office and never intend to have one.  I intend to continue in that way.  The only good industry in this Government has been the hiring of public relations men, of consultants and the ultimate hirelings of all, liquidators to deal with the situation caused by the hiring of those consultants and public relations people.</P>

      <P>The amendment is necessary because on the sale of an impounded animal whose owner is known, the net proceeds of the sale after deduction of pound fees and expenses are returned to the owners.  In any case where the owner is unknown or cannot be found the net proceeds of the sale of the impounded animal are retained by the local authority. Accordingly, in such cases the amount of the net proceeds may be deducted in arriving at the local authorities net expenditure in relation to the pound.  This is something that was brought to our notice in the course of the debate.  It is not a contentious amendment.  It improves the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 basically deals with impounding.  The purpose of amendment No. 10, which was discussed the last night, was to deal with a situation where animals &mdash; the most likely example would be horses &mdash; stray into a person's garden, particularly in an urban area.  The net effect of the other provisions in the Bill is that if a person turns those animals out onto the public highway and an accident occurs, the person can be sued for negligence and will more than likely be found liable.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 was to correct that situation.  The refusal of the Government to accept the amendment means that the situation is not corrected.  I note that in this section dealing with impounding there is not a provision to cover that situation.  If one is to contact a local authority or the Garda <Col N="1234" /> Síochána to impound an animal this can only be done when the animal is found in a public place or in a public park and so on, as listed in the Bill.  I would like the Minister to deal with the situation envisaged by Deputy Hyland in his amendment because this is directly relevant to the section, to the lack of impounding powers for various State and Garda authorities under this section.  If a horse wanders into a person's garden in a suburban estate must he leave it there? What remedy has this person if he is not to be found liable for negligence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Amendment No. 10. was discussed fully on the last night.  The amendment put down by Deputy Hyland suggested that:</P>
      <P>no liability shall attach to occupiers of property where animals already straying enter into and escape from property where the occupier of the property is not the owner of and has not custody of such animals.</P>
      <P>What was suggested in the amendment was that, if an animal strayed from a farm and went into an urban garden and strayed back out, there should be no liability on the suburban householder.  That is the existing law, so the amendment put down would not have changed it.  Deputy O'Dea has put a different case and his case would require a different type of amendment.  Deputy O'Dea talks about a situation where not only does the animal stray from the land into a garden but where the owner of the suburban garden drives the animal out.  The problem there is that we might give immunity to anybody to drive an animal out without any care on to a public road.  If we did that we would have a situation where a person could uncaringly drive a cow or a horse out in front of a bus causing a fatal accident and he would not carry any liability for the accident.  At the moment if somebody drives an animal out in those circumstances without taking due care, the matter is decided by the court.  If a person drives out animals with due care he would not be deemed to be negligent by the court.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> It is impossible to legislate to give the person total immunity.  It is better to leave it to the courts to decide on the degree of negligence involved in such a case.  The ensuing step in relation to impounding would be that the Garda, the members of the local authority, or the Commissioners of Public Works or their agents would be in a position to impound animals then.  I understand exactly what Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Hyland have in mind and it is something which has been thoroughly debated.  The Deputies will appreciate the impossibility of giving an immunity which would enable people to behave in any way they liked.  We are leaving this matter to the courts.  The original amendment put down was merely a statement of existing law and it would not have brought about the change now being suggested.</P>

      <P>This section has caused a lot of concern.  I had discussions with officials of the Department but we have since given a lot of consideration to it and we feel that this section unnecessarily exposes the private property owner.  I refer specifically to the urban scene.  I am thinking in terms of the small urban garden which is taken over by stampeding horses or donkeys which are, for instance, damaging the front lawn and where there are not immediate facilities available to the owner to comply with the law.  By complying with the law I mean having the animals legally impounded. That facility is available but it is not immediately available.  It is unfair to expose that private individual to the rigours of the law.  Although the courts will rule on it eventually, we should at least in this Bill endeavour to protect the interests of the property owner.  I have listened attentively to the Minister's logic and I can see some justification for the points made but on balance I still hold the view that it is unfair to expose the property owner to the extent that he is being exposed in this section.  I discussed this idea with Deputy O'Dea and other colleagues in the parliamentary party and we got some independent advice on it.  It <Col N="1236" /> is generally held that our amendment would provide the level of protection to which the property owner is entitled in the final draft of the Bill.  Some of the points which the Minister put forward are relevant, but in the final analysis the Minister's points would be adequately covered by the courts who would make a decision on any claim for damages that might arise.  On balance I feel that the property owner should be protected.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's point and I accept that it is impossible to find words to cover every possible situation in legislation and that sometimes it is better to leave the matter to the courts.  However, by leaving the matter of deciding negligence to the courts the Minister cannot come into the House and assure us categorically that in no circumstances whatsoever will a property owner who turns stray animals out on to the road not be liable for negligence.  Take, for example, the case of somebody living beside a main roadway who knows that the volume of traffic will be large.  He can turn the animals out on to the roadway and use all possible due care.  He can ensure that they are turned out with the maximum care, but he does so in the knowledge that they will be out on a main road, such as the road from Dublin to Limerick which is familiar to the Minister and me, and that it is very likely that an accident could occur due to the volume of traffic regardless of the care he has exercised in putting the animals out.  The concept of negligence is based on reasonable foresight, and nobody can tell me that somebody who puts out an animal, using all the care in the world, on to the main Dublin road out of Limerick could not foresee the possibility that that animal could cause an accident when it was out on the main road.  In those circumstances I argue strongly that the courts could find a person who put out the animals on to the road responsible for negligence or liable in negligence regardless of the care and attention he has used in what I describe as the putting out of the animal on to the roadway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding this section and the <Col N="1237" /> impounding powers, the Minister has admitted that somebody who puts an animal out on to the public roadway can then contact the local authority, the Garda or whatever who have power to impound animals found in public places, but why not extend this right or something approximating to it to where animals are trespassing on to private property?  Why not give the private property owner the right to contact some of those authorities with a view to impounding those animals when they are trespassing on his property due to the fact that he may be found liable in negligence if he puts them out on to the public road?</P>

      <P>If the suburban householder turns the animal out on to the road does it not revert to being a stray animal? This legislation is clearing up the anomaly which exists at present whereby the owner of a stray animal is not liable for any damage done by that stray animal in making the owner of that stray animal liable for whatever damage that animal may cause on the roadway or in a public place.  If the suburban householder turns that animal on to the roadway is that animal deemed to be a stray animal and does the liability revert to the owner of the animal?  Would the duty of care on the householder be minimised?  Can we get some legal assurance as to how it will work out practically if a case is brought if the suburban householder using due care puts that animal out onto the roadway? Would the courts take the view that that animal under this Bill is deemed a stray animal and that the liability reverts to the owner of the animal in the first instance?  When the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, was here in place of the Minister on the last day we debated this, this matter could not be cleared up.  It was said that the suburban householder would have to hold that animal on his property and call the Garda, the local authority or now the Commissioners of Public Works to come to impound that animal.  You could have the crazy situation of a householder holding on to a horse or a cow until the Garda come and presumably they or somebody must bring <Col N="1238" /> the animal away and you could have gardaí out with ropes bringing cattle down the road at about two miles an hour.  It does not seem practicable to expect a suburban householder to have the responsibility of waiting for people to come to impound the animal and bring it away.  Can we be assured tonight that if the property owner using due care puts the animal out of his property on to the roadway or whatever, the animal then would be deemed to be a stray animal and the liability would revert to the owner of the animal under section 2?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Hyland has put the case very well in his contribution.  As I told him, section 5 on the point we are debating now makes no change in the existing situation.  It is not intended to change that situation.  Therefore, section 5 is not putting any unnecessary expense or exposure on the private property owner.  It is simply leaving the existing law as it stands.  The Deputy's amendment which he moved and was debated the last time the debate took place here does not deal with the point now being debated and is merely a restatement of existing law.  If an animal wanders from private property on to other private property from which it wanders again subsequently on to the public roadway the onus of negligence lies on the original property owner, not on the property owner on to whose land it wandered before it went back on to the road, and all the Deputy's amendment does is restate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the situation to which Deputies are directing their attention, what do you do if a cow strays into a neighbouring farm and the neighbouring farmer drives it out on to the public road? He has two options, and in practice it would work differently in the country from the way it would in the city. Restraining a large animal such as that and calling on the Garda or the local authority to impound the animal is part of the impounding process, and that option would quite well be open to somebody who had enough room to restrain a large animal.  In suburban areas I can see the <Col N="1239" /> practical difficulty of retaining a horse on the front lawn if the whole site is one eighth of an acre.  Deputy Hyland has stated this matter very clearly.  In that situation if due care is exercised in putting the animal out on to the road, then the onus of responsibility reverts to the original owner of the land from whose property the animal strayed.</P>
    <P>In regard to legislation there are only three options here.  You can introduce strict liability for the action of the owner of the suburban household who drives a horse out on to the road.  That would be blatantly unfair when his property has been invaded in the first instance.  The next option is the other extreme.  You can give absolute immunity if that person is driving it out and you can say, &ldquo;OK, it strayed into your front garden and you have absolute immunity if you drive it back out&rdquo;.  The problem there is how to get over the situation if they get the dog and chase the horse out through the front gate and it knocks a kid off a bicycle.  It is obvious that no care whatsoever was taken and the action was most careless and negligent.  I do not think that as a legislature we can give that kind of immunity.</P>
    <P>The only other option is to leave the law as it stands and allow the courts to decide on it.  Deputy O'Dea asked whether the right of the Garda or the local authority should extend to coming on to private property.  My advice is that it would, because it would be taken as part of the impounding process that they could come on to the private property and put an animal into the pound.  I do not think we can move from that.  I am aware of the level of debate that has taken place about this point over a number of years.  Wandering animals in urban areas is one of the chestnuts which come up frequently, but I do not know of any case, and no case has been brought to my attention, of an owner of a suburban house who turned an animal out on to the road being sued for subsequent damage.  Therefore, this is a perceived difficulty rather than a real difficulty.  I would like to hear from Deputies opposite <Col N="1240" /> if there is such a case in existence and if there is any case even where the owner of a suburban property was brought to court for subsequent damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that, under existing law, if a suburban householder turns an animal out into the public roadway, then the situation of liability reverts to the original owner.  As I understand it, that is not the position in law. The fundamental question here is a question of foresight.  If somebody puts an animal on to the public roadway and they foresee an accident can occur, they can be held liable in negligence.  Did I understand the Minister to say that under existing law a private householder can contact the Garda with a view to impounding the animal if they can restrain it on their own property?  Is there authority for that?</P>

This could be regarded as part of the impounding process and my advice is that that would be all right.</P>

      <P>I am still not very happy with this section because the problem of stray animals is on the increase.  Five or six years ago the problem would not have been as serious in urban areas as it is today.  The immediate instinct of the property owner is to remove the animal <Col N="1241" /> from his plot or front garden.  To legislate to hold him responsible, as we are doing if we accept the Bill without amendment, is putting him in a very unfair position.  I do not want to be awkward about this because we want to be helpful.  We had a very lengthy and constructive discussion on the earlier Stages, but I hoped that this section, which is causing such annoyance, would have led the Minister to accept our amendment.  This amendment protects the property owner but it does not take from the eventual action taken by an injured party if such action is necessary, because the courts would have to adjudicate the action.</P>
      <P>In my view, the property owner should be protected, especially as this is a growing problem in urban and rural areas.  I accept that we cannot legislate for urban as distinct from rural areas.  Therefore, perhaps the word &ldquo;urban&rdquo; should be deleted from my amendment to make it more general.</P>

Where does the liability go?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In section 5 we are not changing existing law so far as this point is concerned.  If an animal wandering on the public roadway wanders into somebody's front garden, that wandering into the front garden does not carry with it any responsibility on the householder.  When he puts it back on the road with due care and attention, he is putting it back where it was, and the obligation is transferred to the original owner of the animal.  We can give an immunity to somebody driving animals out.  There is not another position.  It has to be left to the courts.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The situation as regards impounding is still unclear.  The Minister says it is on the record of the House that if the animal wanders on to somebody else's property the property owner has an implied right to restrain the animal until such time as the Garda or the local authority come to impound the animal.  Perhaps there is in general law some kind of authority, but I cannot find anything in this legislation to cover that situation.  This legislation refers to animals wandering on public roads or in public places and the only situation envisaged is where the local authority or the Garda would be contacted in the case of an animal wandering in a public park, public place or public road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell the House how the position could be improved if he does not accept this amendment.  The greatest menace in urban areas arises from the fact that animal owners, especially horseowners, are abusing the existing legislation.  These people have unashamedly and flagrantly put horses into the Phoenix Park knowing they are protected by the existing law.  If the authority put the animals on the road, there is some doubt about the legal position. Animals are moving into farm land and the landowners are prohibited from <Col N="1243" /> putting them out.  This is one of the most serious abuses of the law.  On the edge of Dublin city there are men who do not own an acre of land but who have 30 or 40 horses grazing anywhere they can get it.  If I or any other property owner attempt to put those horses off our property, there is a risk that I may be responsible for any accident that might happen. I do not believe there is any level-headed law-abiding citizen who sees a stray animal, and knowing it is a case of perfect stray, would be so foolish as to put that animal off his land without having due regard for the safety of other people. However, my concern is this.  If one visits the Phoenix Park, a park which belongs to the State, one will find at least 70 or 80 horses there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has advised me that he cannot do anything about this abuse.  We now have an opportunity of correcting it and bringing those horse tanglers or dealers to justice.  They have no respect for anybody's personal safety or property and yet we are reluctant to make provision for one mechanism through which we could get at them.  On the edge of Dublin, there are farmers who live in dread of getting up in the morning and finding ten or 12 horses on their land eating their crop of wheat or oats.  If you are a law-abiding citizen, you will not put the horses out on the road but the owners will come, perhaps a fortnight later, in the dead of night, break down the fences and take out the horses.  They will then run them along the road.  I said, when the Minister introduced this legislation that, as they say in the Gaeltacht, it was &ldquo;teacht an tseagail&rdquo;, it was a long time coming.  More power to the Minister for bringing it before the House.  However, this matter will not come before the House again in my lifetime and a mechanism should be inserted to correct this abuse.  Unless the inhibition on the person who is abused is provided for, the menace will continue.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on a problem, akin <Col N="1244" /> to that which Deputy Tunney outlined, which has arisen in St. Mary's Park, Limerick.  There are families living there who have kept horses for generations. Each one has a premises, like a yard, where they keep their horses but they have no pasture where the horses may graze.  There is a huge commonage, a swamp, adjoining St. Mary's Park and it is irrecoverable from the point of view of the local authorities.  These people have come to me, as mayor of the city, to say that each of them is prepared to put up £100 to fence off a section of the commanage if they are given permission by Limerick Corporation to do so.  They will ensure that the place is locked and that the horses will not do any damage to the public.  In other words, it is a kind of pound arrangement with the local authority, which is very commendable.  The corporation wonder if the Bill specifies that you must own property yourself to hold a horse in before you could do anything like that.  Would the Minister be good enough to clarify that position? These are a group of well disposed horse owners and they have constructively put forward this proposal to keep their horses fenced in.  If thought or provision has not been given to that concept, it should be considered by the Minister because it is a constructive approach by the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Prendergast's suggestion does not come within the ambit of the Bill and it would not prevent the corporation from making an arrangement with horse owners if they decided to give them part of a public open space which is not used for any other purpose.  Deputy Tunney raised two points.  The provisions in the Bill would enable the problem regarding the Phoenix Park to be dealt with because we are extending the impounding powers not only to local authorities and the Garda but also to the agents of the Office of Public Works.  As the Phoenix Park is owned by the OPW they would have the power to impound.  Obviously, there is a local authority implication in that they must provide adequate pounds and it is their function to do so.  However, the Bill enables them to provide temporary pounds and to make arrangements for private pounds and so on.</P>
      <P>With regard to farmers on the margins of the city, their situation is covered by existing law.  The right of private detention of animals existed in law a long time ago but it was removed because it gave rise to rows between neighbours.  When cattle wandered from one farm to another, the farmer on whose land they strayed decided he was going to hold on to them and it made life rather difficult in rural areas.  It was removed for public order reasons.  If an explicit provision for detention of animals was not granted we would resurrect all those problems, especially among adjoining landowners. If the occupier of a property does not known to whom the animals belong, he is entitled to hold on to them.  Of course, if you know who the owner is you do not have the right to hold on to them.  You are entitled to impound the animals and call on the Garda or the local authorities to help in that impounding.  The Bill will certainly help in that regard.  Both the problems which the Deputy raised are covered in the Bill provided that those who are now given the responsibility of enforcing do so and that the local authorities use the powers under this Bill and existing powers to provide pounds to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> We may not have such a full debate on subsequent sections but I should like to refer the Deputies to the benefits of section 7.  Before this a fine in the sum of 50p existed and that has now been raised to a sum of £150 and a second offence will mean a fine of £350.  It was an offence to allow animals to wander on the public roads but under the 1861 Act the maximum penalty was so low that it was not worth taking the case to court.  The Garda tried to deal with the problem of wandering horses by taking summons under the Road Traffic Act on the basis that they were obstructing the highway.  However, they were not charging them with the offence of allowing animals to wander on the public road.  The offence existed in law in the 1861 Act but the maximum fine of 50p was not a deterrent.  I also refer Deputies to the table at the end of section 6 which will be very effective if the Garda act quickly and if the courts use the new maximum fines.  If they hand down penal penalties for these offences, the wandering will stop very quickly.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister did not understand precisely the point I made or maybe he has chosen to sidestep it. With regard to the Phoenix Park the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, told me that the pound would be necessary. They already have the power to take these horses and get rid of them. The people who put those horses there do so in the full knowledge of the law. They drive the horses to the park and having got to the park they leave them there happy in the knowledge that the park authorities and other authorities will not put them out on the road.  They are abusing the law and will continue to do so because they know the horses will not be put out.</P>

      <P>The Minister is technically correct.  We would be in order in moving the amendment on Report Stage. I got an assurance on that from the Ceann Comhairle the last night because we were not satisfied with the explanations given on the section and a few other sections. The section is controversial and has important implications in relation to actions which might be taken against property owners.  It is not exactly correct to say my amendment is merely a restatement of the present position.  Deputy O'Dea teased that out and the Minister agreed with him.  Our amendment provides a level of protection for the property owner to which many speakers referred in the early stages of the debate. The amendment takes nothing from the Bill.  It contributes to it.  The courts can adjudicate on any claim for damages.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The amendment says one thing and the debate says a different thing.  The nub of the issue we are debating is how does the man stand who drives the horse back out on to the road.  The Deputy's amendment deals with the situation where the horse after eating the grass decides to wander back on to the road.  The Deputy does not attempt to deal with the driving out aspect.</P>

The amendment does not refer specifically to people involved physically in turning horses out on to the road.  I accept that the Minister's argument in that regard is valid and logical.  The Minister knows that the intention in the amendment is to protect the property owner who puts the livestock back out on to the road.  The Minister may be technically correct, but our case is still extremely valid.  The Bill will be all the poorer for the omission of the amendment.  I ask the Minister to be a little more realistic in his approach to the amendment and to accept the case being made in good faith.  I cannot see why the Minister wants to exclude from the Bill the area which we are trying to cover.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that there is not a sufficient level of protection for the property owner.  I am particularly concerned about the farming property owner in the rural areas.  I know there are problems in the urban areas but they are different to some extent.  Deputy Tunney referred to horses being driven into fields of grass or corn.  I have seen that happen.  I would not be prepared to say to a farmer who found his good field of grass half eaten by horses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that he should exercise due care in turning them out on to the public road.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister.  I know he is leaving it to the interpretation and the discretion of the courts.  Disputes can arise between neighbouring farmers over <Col N="1250" /> trespassing.  Something could happen which would leave a serious liability on an innocent party.  This section is somewhat difficult to accept for that reason.  Before the section is finally agreed, I should like the Minister to assure the House fully that, where reasonable care is exercised in putting these animals off property on which they have trespassed, no liability will apply to the landowner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is a farmer to do if horses belonging to itinerants stray from the road into a field of corn?  Can he be expected to leave the animals there and ruin the crop?  We all know that his only option would be to turn those horses out on the road.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Hyland is reasonable.  I do not consider that its acceptance would place liability on the person who removed the animals from his land.  However, that would be a matter for the courts to decide and we should leave it at that; but it would be unfair for any court to find against a farmer who, merely to save his field of corn or grass or whatever, removed from his land animals that had strayed on to it from perhaps the main road.  In most such cases the farmer would turn the animals out but would not consider himself responsible for any damage caused by these animals subsequently. After all he would be merely returning the animals to where they had come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>A problem I see in regard to animals wandering on to a farm or, as has been suggested, being driven on to a farm, is that an argument could be made to the effect that the fences on the farm were defective.  There is no protection in the Bill for the farmer in this respect.  It might be easy to claim that fences were not up to a certain standard, but even allowing for that it is not fair or just that the farmer concerned should be liable in respect of animals found on his land being put back on to the road.  The Minister should consider very carefully what we have been saying in this regard. Let us forget about the courts for a moment and consider what the ordinary <Col N="1251" /> citizen, using his common sense, would do in the circumstances.  I would have great difficulty in accepting a situation in which a person acting merely to protect his property should become liable to prosecution.</P>

      <P>Is a farmer to be held responsible in the event of his cattle straying on the road because of someone having left a gate open?  I am thinking particularly of cattle straying on the roads at night thereby causing a hazard for road users.  In the case of black or other dark coloured cattle or horses, it is almost impossible for the motorist to see them at night.  Therefore I trust that in such circumstances the farmer would not be considered responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Much of this ground has been covered before. Deputy Dowling made the point that the innocent should be protected, but frequently in the sort of situation we are talking of there is conflict between innocent parties.  If the field of one innocent party is ruined and another innocent party is killed in a car crash as a result of the animals responsible having been turned on to the road, both parties should be protected and the liability should rest with the owner of the animals.  This is not a simple and straightforward matter.  I discussed the whole Bill with the farming organisations and they agreed with the steps we are taking.  Presumably in those organisations there is good legal advice available.</P>
      <P>The question of cattle wandering at night would be no different from their wandering during the day.  Obviously if a gate has been left open thereby causing the animals to stray in the first place, the farmer would have a good defence.  We are not placing strict liability on the landowner. We are simply removing the anomaly that existed in the previous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters that we must leave to the courts, and this brings us back to the nub of this debate.  People are talking about the rights of landowners, <Col N="1252" /> but they are talking about the rights of two different landowners.  First, they are talking about the right of the owner of the land from which the animals strayed and then they are talking about the rights of the owner of the land on to which the animals strayed.  Obviously there is a conflict between the two.  If we must lean on one side of the argument and state categorically in the Bill where the strict liability or the strict immunity lies, we would not be acting correctly because only a court could interpret a case in which there was the sort of conflict of interest I have outlined.  We can only put forward the best law possible and then leave it to the courts to decide who is negligent.  The courts are dealing with such conflicts all the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly puts the matter very well when he asks what a man is to do if he finds horses trespassing in a field of corn.  There are two options in such circumstances. First, the farmer can drive the animals from the field of corn and into a field where they would not do as much damage or he may ring the Garda and ask them to impound the animals.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The legislation has been debated thoroughly. The debate has been brought to one point: what action a man is to take in the event of animals straying onto his property.  Is he entitled to put those animals back on the road and, if so, what is his position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the law in that case? As I have stated, there are only three positions that can be adopted in so far as the Bill is concerned.  We can impose strict liability on the injured party in the first instance in respect of driving the animals on to the road, but that would be blatantly unfair.  Or we can grant immunity to such person so that, regardless of what damage the animals caused <Col N="1254" /> after being returned to the road, he could not be sued.  Whether they crossed in front of a school bus or whether they caused a child to be knocked from his bicycle, the person concerned could not be sued and the onus reverts to the owner of the animals.  But I do not think we could take up that position.</P>
      <P>I am arguing that the only position we can adopt is to leave such matters to the courts to decide.  The element of risk is that there is no liability on the second land owner if the animals wander in and then wander out.  There might be a liability if he were careless in the act of driving the animals out on to the road from his land, but I have read it into the record that I do not think there is a subsequent liability.  There is an option other than driving the animals out.  He can contact the Garda and restrain the animals as part of the impounding process until the Garda come to impound the animals.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rail Transportation of Ammonia.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  In view of the recent tragic accident elsewhere involving the transportation of dangerous chemicals, constituents have expressed to me their anxiety regarding the transportation of ammonia from Cork to Arklow through Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my information that a special train <Col N="1257" /> carrying ammonia from Cork to Arklow passes through several towns, Mallow, Thurles, Portlaoise, Kildare and Newbridge before arriving at Liffey Junction. It then passes under the Phoenix Park, joins up with the Sligo line at Cabra and follows the line of the Royal Canal to Connolly Station at Amiens Street.  From there it proceeds through the south side of Dublin along the Dart railway line, three miles of which is in my constituency, through Sandymount, Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Greystones heading for its destination at Arklow.  In a more humorous vein it reminds me somewhat of the ritual that was followed in previous years at dockers' funerals in Dublin.  Then the cortege used to pass every public house where the deceased person had been a customer before bringing him to his final rest.</P>
    <P>I understand that three trains carrying ammonia make the same journey five times a week.  Each one carries what is potentially the most lethal cargo ever to be transported in this country, namely, 150 tonnes of liquid ammonia.  CIE maintain that when they first decided to carry ammonia in 1977 they were assured that the fire brigade, the Garda and the local authority personnel along the Cork-Arklow run would be trained and equipped to deal with ammonia spillage.</P>
    <P>My first question to the Minister is whether this training has taken place. Are members of the fire-fighting services equipped to deal with the problem?  It is my information that the IIRS were involved at the outset in a safety plan for the movement of ammonia and the drawing up of a contingency plan to deal with any emergency.  My second question is, are the IIRS involved on an ongoing basis with such emergency plans?  My third question to the Minister is, has an outside agency been asked to give its views on the transport of ammonia along the railway system I have outlined?  How often are the tanks used, examined and overhauled for any deficiencies that may occur in them?</P>
    <P>When this train transporting ammonia is passing through my own constituency it travels on the Dublin suburban railway <Col N="1258" /> which is equipped with one of the most modern signal systems in the world.  In a letter from Mr. Conlon of CIE to the Sandymount Residents' Association dated 5 March he stated:</P>
    <P>The possibility of accidents, i.e. collisions etc. involving this traffic is very remote because of the very stiff rules and regulations which apply.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of CIE may be surprised to know that in the last week in March a car was trapped at the railway crossing at Sydney Parade Avenue.  We had all been given to understand that these crossings were monitored from a centre in Amiens Street.  Therefore the person watching the monitor could completely release the gates to allow the car out.  However, in this instance that did not happen.  It was only when a gentleman who was in the queue waiting for the gates to open got out of his car and used the telephone at the gate that the car was released.  If the train was travelling along the line at that time, what would have been the consequences?</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the precautions that are being taken with the local authority, the Garda and the health boards and also the regular discussions that take place on safety matters and emergency procedures in the event of a disaster.  We all hope there will never be such a disaster, but no one is absolutely certain of the reaction of ammonia if it should hit the open air and even the best emergency services can only mitigate the effects of a major disaster.  I am saying that even if all the contingency plans were perfect, it would not make one bit of difference in the event of an accident if the Houston disaster of 1976 is anything to go by.</P>
    <P>This happened on the outskirts of Houston when a tanker penetrated a support column of a by-pass bridge, releasing more than 7,500 gallons of ammonia.  It spread within three minutes over a radius of 1,000 feet and after a mere five minutes all the liquid had boiled off into a vapour so that there was nothing left to spray down.  The fumes quickly penetrated buildings and cars in the form of a mist. People trying to escape from confined <Col N="1259" /> areas were exposed to even higher ammonia levels.  Within a 200 feet radius of the initial release six people died and 78 more were hospitalised, having inhaled ammonia.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that this would never happen here but, if it did, precautions such as water sprays, gas masks and so on would not be of much help.  One must always eliminate the slightest possibility of its happening.  For instance, who, sitting in the stand at Bradford Football grounds last Saturday, could have realised that within a matter of minutes the whole place would be a blazing inferno?</P>
    <P>I am raising this issue this evening in an endeavour to have the Minister reexamine the route this ammonia train takes.  It is ridiculous that this dangerous cargo is hawked around the network I outlined earlier through densely populated areas, Dublin in particular.  Surely there are simpler and safer ways of having it transported from Cork to Arklow?  For example, what are the possibilities of its being transported by sea or having an alternative rail route through less densely populated areas?  Such would be well worth considering, because it must be remembered that the consideration of alternatives after a tragic accident is useless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the safety arrangements involved in the carriage by CIE of ammonia by rail from Cork to Arklow via Dublin conform to the international arrangements for the carriage of dangerous goods by rail.  This position also obtains in the carriage of the only other dangerous chemicals transported by rail by CIE, namely, acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate from Dublin to Ballina.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chemicals are carried in train loads in tank wagons and tank containers.  The trains are operated to special operating instructions and all persons concerned in the operations are given special training. The tank wagons and tank containers are specially designed and constructed to stringent specifications to withstand very <Col N="1260" /> heavy impacts.  Before they are entered into service, they are required to be approved by a competent authority.  In most cases Lloyd's of London are the authority while in some instances Bureau Veritas of Paris fulfil that function.  The containers must be maintained and inspected to strict standards while in service and be periodically checked by the competent authority.  The IIRS have also recently been involved in tank inspections.</P>
    <P>Because of the stringent requirements it is considered that, in the event of an accident involving these trains, the odds are against these tank wagons or tank containers being damaged to the extent that a leak of the chemicals would occur. The rupture of a container is similarly considered to be unlikely.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the special nature of the equipment and arrangements used for transporting the chemicals, in view of the likely effects of a major accident, a scheme for co-ordination of emergency services was drawn up under the aegis of my Department to deal with accident situations.  The scheme covers CIE, the Garda Síochána, the services of the local authorities and the health boards, the helicopter squadron of the Army Air Corps, harbour authorities, the ESB and organisations forwarding, receiving or using dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The scheme outlines the procedure, duties and responsibilities for the various services and organisations for the duration of the emergency.  Each service would discharge its functions at an incident, subject to the provisions made in the scheme for overall control.  The local authority services, the health boards and ambulance services would take action within the scheme in accordance with their emergency plans.</P>
    <P>Alternative methods of transport of ammonia, including a rail route not passing through Dublin, between Cork and Arklow were considered at the time the scheme was being drawn up.  Taking all factors into account, including safety, the route through Dublin was considered best.</P>
    <P>CIE have recently submitted draft bylaws <Col N="1261" /> to the Department of Labour in relation to the conveying, loading and unloading of dangerous substances in accordance with the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  When the draft bylaws have been approved by the Department of Labour they will be submitted to my Department for confirmation, and in the meantime CIE are complying with them.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the concern of the Deputy and of people generally about the transport of chemicals by rail.  However, every conceivable step is taken to ensure the safe carriage of the chemicals by rail and to eliminate in so far as humanly possible all potential accident risks.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Deputy raised this question here this evening I will ask my rail inspector to look at this route again in order to ascertain if there is any better and safer route than the one at present used.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to an agreement for the adoption of common technical specification and certification procedures which was concluded between the IIRS and the United States' Department of Defense in 1983, and which is currently due for renewal.  There have been no consultations between my Department and the Department responsible for the IIRS regarding the implications of the agreement for Irish neutrality, because there are no such implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the agreement in question is to secure access for Irish manufacturers to United States markets where quality standards up to those of the US Department of Defense's &ldquo;Qualified Products Lists&rdquo; is essential.  The agreement is of an administrative and technical nature and does not involve any defence <Col N="1066" /> or military commitments.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established in 1978 for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area.  Although UNIFIL has never been allowed to implement fully its mandate, it did succeed in reducing the level of violence in its area of operation and, since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, it has provided protection and humanitarian assistance to the civilian population there.</P>
      <P>UNIFIL now finds itself operating in an area which is the focus of an intensifying guerrilla war between Shiite resistance groups on the one hand and the Israeli Army (IDF) and Israeli backed militia on the other.  Despite these difficult circumstances the United Nations Security Council decided in April to renew UNIFIL's mandate for a further six months. The Secretary General of the United Nations at that time described the role of UNIFIL as essential.</P>
      <P>In my view UNIFIL continues to play a vital role in Southern Lebanon and is an important and recognised factor for stability there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Israel is scheduled to complete its withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in early June.  It is important that Israel not only withdraws fully but that its withdrawal is <Col N="1067" /> orderly and co-ordinated with the Lebanese authorities.  It is my hope that, following Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, UNIFIL will be in a position to operate to its full level of effectiveness and to carry out all the tasks that have been assigned to it by the international community.</P>
    <P>In the meantime UNIFIL operates in difficult circumstances and, at times, UNIFIL personnel may not be free from the dangers inherent in any international peacekeeping operation.  The Government continues to monitor developments in Lebanon which could affect the safety of our troops serving there.  A number of incidents involving the Israeli Defence Force and Israeli-backed militias which have endangered or threatened the safety and wellbeing of Irish UNIFIL troops have been of particular concern.  All such incidents have been brought to the attention of the Israeli authorities.  Concern has been conveyed and protests have been made where necessary.  These representations have been made both by UNIFIL on the ground in southern Lebanon and at a diplomatic level with Israeli representatives in Dublin and London.  All such representations are made with the aim of securing the future safety of Irish UNIFIL personnel and to allowing the force to carry out the tasks assigned to it by the international community. The Government will continue to monitor the situation in southern Lebanon and will take whatever steps may be necessary to minimise the risks to Irish troops serving there.</P>

      <P>The <Col N="1068" /> agreement between the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the United States Department of Defence is a commercial agreement between the two parties under which each party is permitted to certify conformity to agreed product standard specifications. As such the agreement has no implications for Ireland's neutrality.  It is not normal business practice to publish commercial agreements of this nature.  A copy of the agreement is available for examination in the IIRS library at Ballymun.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in a reply to Deputy Gregory-Independent on this subject on 9 May 1985, this agreement was concluded to facilitate access to the US market for Irish manufactured products and thereby help to create and safeguard jobs in Irish industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new scheme capital subsidisable at a rate not exceeding 80 per cent will be made available from the allocation for local authority housing to enable housing authorities to carry out essential remedial works of a structural nature to certain of their dwellings which have been affected by serious deterioration. The new scheme will apply to housing estates where the structural deterioration is the result of design or construction faults or where the dwellings are more than 50 years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a basic condition of the scheme that the balance of economic advantage should be shown to lie with the restoration of the dwellings involved and that the proposed works will provide the most economic solution to the deterioration problem, while achieving acceptable design and construction standards.  The housing authority is also expected to provide, from its own resources and in co-operation with tenants' organisations, for <Col N="1080" /> the carrying out of any necessary environmental and improvement works in relation to the scheme as a whole.  If necessary, proposals for assistance under the scheme will be dealt with on a priority basis related to the need and urgency of the works required.</P>
    <P>In the case of older houses it is permissible to include in an application provision for essential works of improvement (such as the provision of a water supply, sewerage facilities or bathroom in a house without such facilities) provided that the other necessary works of reconstruction arising from structural deficiency are sufficient to bring the houses within the scope of the scheme.  The maximum subsidisable allocation for any house of this category is £12,000.  In the case of other houses the works admissible are confined to those which are essential to correct inherent defects or are ancillary to the correction of such defects.</P>
    <P>Tenant-purchase houses may be included in an application where it is necessary to do so for practical reasons. In such cases the prior written agreement of the tenant-purchasers must be obtained together with a commitment to meet at least one half of the cost of the subsidisable works.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer and her husband are assessable to income tax under the provision of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Accordingly, the taxpayer's husband is chargeable on the combined income of both spouses.</P>
      <P>The husband's liabilities for the years 1982-83 and 1983-84 were reviewed on 24 April 1985 and overpayments arose for both years.  A cheque in settlement was issued to him on 29 April 1985.  The inspector of taxes has been unable to trace receipt of a claim for repayment for 1984-85 from either the taxpayer or her husband.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a routine investigation of the old age pension entitlements of the person concerned it was discovered that his means had increased since the date of his last assessment.  Accordingly, it was decided that he is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £37.30 from 3 August 1984.  The assessment of his means consisting of the weekly value of a holding and capital entitle him to pension at this rate only.  The appropriate pension book payable from 3 August 1984 issued on 7 August 1984.</P>

In the circumstances, the widow's contributory pension of £44.30 a week to which she is entitled will continue to be paid to her. The person concerned is entitled to free travel and was issued with a pass for this purpose on 4 January 1985.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for a free electricity allowance she would need to be living alone or with certain categories of persons only.  Her application for the allowance was refused on 13 February 1985 as her son and daughter-in-law who reside with her are not persons who come within these categories for satisfying the living alone condition of the scheme.  She was notified of this decision and the reasons for it at that time.  A free telephone rental allowance or a free television licence could not be granted in her case for similar reasons.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1984, circulated on 13 December 1984, contains the necessary provisions for the implementation of equal treatment as between men and women in matters of social security in accordance with the terms of EC Directive 79/7/EEC.  So far as the retirement pensions scheme is concerned the Bill provides for a revision of the conditions under which increases of benefits are payable in respect of adult and child dependants.</P>
      <P>The person referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy is not in receipt of a retirement pension from my Department but an increase of retirement pension is being paid to her husband in respect of her.  Pending a full examination of the circumstances in the light of the legislative provisions as finally enacted it is not possible to say how entitlements would be affected.</P>

      <P>The deserted wife's allowance of the person concerned was terminated with effect from 29 September 1983 for the reason that her husband had returned to live with her from that date, following <Col N="1097" /> a reconciliation between them.  A reapplication was received from her on 1 February 1985 and she has been interviewed by a local officer of the Department.  Her husband apparently went back into hospital on 13 December 1983 and has been there since.  Her claim is under consideration by a deciding officer and it is expected that a decision will be given shortly in the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the increased number of persons applying for appeals under various social welfare services there is an inevitable lengthening of the time in determining cases.  The appeal of the person concerned against the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim on the grounds that his means, derived from self employment exceeded the statutory limit was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer has decided to hold an oral hearing of the case and arrangements are being made to have the case heard at the earliest opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the amount of means assessed against him by the appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned <Col N="1098" /> claimed disability benefit from 12 January 1985 to 2 February 1985, after which date he was certified as fit to resume work.  There was a delay in authorising payment of benefit as inquiries were necessary to establish his correct RSI number.  A cheque paying benefit for the period 16 January 1985, fourth day of incapacity, to 2 February 1985 was, however, issued on 13 May 1985.</P>

He did not appeal against the amount of means assessed against him and the time allowed for appeal has expired. However, if he feels that his circumstances have changed it is open to him to request a review of his means.  An application form for this purpose can be obtained at his local office.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 29 January 1985, following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and he was examined on 30 April 1985 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.  He was advised of this decision and <Col N="1099" /> issued with an appeal form on 3 May 1985.  On receipt of the completed form, his case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>
