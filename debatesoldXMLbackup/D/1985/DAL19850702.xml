      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if the Government have considered the suggestion made in the report of the Dublin Docks Review Group that Dublin Port and Docks Board should be abolished and replaced by a restructured Dublin port authority operating as a commercial semi-State body; if the Government accept this proposal; if so, when it will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he accepts the <Col N="2" /> recommendation of the Horgan Report on the Dublin Port and Docks Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The recommendations in the report of the Dublin Docks Review Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan, fall into three broad categories:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Labour requirements and industrial relations: As indicated by the Minister for Labour in a statement when the report was published, these recommendations are primarily for consideration by the parties themselves, that is, Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the unions.  Negotiations have unfortunately broken down and <Col N="3" /> the deep-sea section of the port has been closed since Friday evening last, 28 June.  This issue was the subject of a private notice question on 27 June.</P>
    <P>(b)  Future organisation of the port of Dublin: The Government, having considered the structure of the Dublin Port and Docks Board in the light of a number of factors including the report of the Dublin Docks Review Group, have decided in principle that legislation should be prepared for the reconstitution of the Dublin Port and Docks Board to provide for a more efficient management structure and I hope to announce details of the proposed changes at an early date.</P>
    <P>(c)  The financial position of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the Dublin Port and Docks Board: The Government have recently decided on a financial package for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The package is comprised of grant assistance, including £3 million in 1985, a State guarantee for borrowings, a requirement for the board to take cost cutting and revenue increasing measures and to dispose of assets.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the financial assistance is contingent on measures to ensure industrial peace in the deep-sea section through agreement on flexible working arrangements and rationalisation of the dock labour force.  These measures must be based on the industrial relations recommendations contained in the Horgan Report, including the reduction of manning levels and the removal of restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise again that the Government have indicated their willingness to provide financial help, but the Government cannot of themselves solve the problems of the port.  As I have stated on a few occasions already, the problems can be resolved only by the parties themselves.  I trust that early solutions can be found within the framework of the Dublin Docks Review Group report and the recent <Col N="4" /> Labour Court recommendations.  It is essential, in the interests of all concerned, that agreement should be reached quickly and I appeal to all concerned to address themselves to that, continuously and urgently.  Time is running out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to my question and the Minister's statement that legislation is in the process of being prepared, could the Minister indicate in what direction this legislation is moving? Is it to establish a semi-State company or a company on the style of the semi-State company proposed in the Horgan Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to speculate on the final format of the new port board.  I should point out to the Deputy that we have been reviewing the entire question of ports policy for the past number of months, not just in relation to Dublin port but to ports in general.  I have for some time felt that the large boards which run harbour authorities may not be any longer appropriate to this operation.  This matter is under review and it is hoped that I shall be in a position to announce not legislation but proposals contained in legislation before too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it from the Minister's reply that the Dublin port problem is being studied only with a view to legislation in the context of the overall review of the ports, are is there a special study being made of the Dublin port situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been considering the running of ports in general and we have been looking specifically at the problems of Dublin port for quite a long time.  The Government have come up with a package of financial proposals to help the port and this is unprecedented. Never before has Dublin port got financial assistance from the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin port never needed it before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Horgan Review Group were set up under the aegis of Mr. Horgan of the Labour Court.  The parties to that group were the port and docks board on the one hand and the dockers on the other hand.  They signed the report unanimously.  It is vital that agreement be reached on implementation of the agreed report as quickly as possible.  As I said in the concluding part of my original answer, time is running out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the statement in the Horgan report which indicated that restructuring of the board was an urgent matter given the state of the port, does the Minister propose to take any interim measures to restructure the board pending whatever legislation he will bring forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Without legislation my power to restructure the board is very limited.  I wish to point out that the Horgan report simply dealt with one section of Dublin port.  Not only has it wider implications for the rest of the port but it also has implications for other ports throughout the country.  They were not taken into account, nor could they have been, by the Horgan Review Group.  We are considering the implications for other ports and, as I said earlier, I expect to come to conclusions about this before too long.  Then I hope I will be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation when the Dáil resumes after the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that no Government made moneys available to the Dublin Port and Docks Board up to now.  Is it not true that up to comparatively recently they were paying their own way?  Will the Minister state if this £3 million and the guarantee for borrowing relates only to the operations of Dublin Cargo Handling or whether it is an across-the-board application of a Government grant and a guarantee for borrowings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to confirm that what the Deputy said in the first part of <Col N="6" /> his question is correct.  Until comparatively recently Dublin Port and Docks Board were paying their way but that is not the case now because of the loss of traffic to the port.  This is principally caused by the industrial relations problems and the uncertainty of service.  That is not the only cause.  Obviously the recession has played some part but a cause, and something that is within the influence of those who work in the port, relates to industrial relations.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the grant which is committed by the Exchequer, and which is contingent on this agreement being reached and applied, is to the Dublin Port and Docks Board, not to Dublin Cargo Handling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be advisable to introduce a Bill in this House &mdash; we would facilitate the Minister &mdash; if he thought new legislation would resolve this problem?  The premier port in Ireland is now closed and the longer it remains closed the more damage will be done to its reputation and to the commercial life of the port and the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought legislation would solve the problem I would bring it before this House very speedily.  Unfortunately, I do not think that arises.  Here we are dealing with a human problem, one of industrial relations, and I think the House will accept that problems like this are not normally soluble by legislation. In fact, legislation might impede a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that nothing is happening at the moment.  The port is closed.  I wonder if we could get some initiative going?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisley what we have been seeking to achieve.  As I have said repeatedly, and I am sure Deputy Wilson agrees with me, the next push must come from the parties to the dispute in the deep sea section of the port.  The Horgan report was signed unanimously by both sides.  They committed themselves to the numbers in that <Col N="7" /> report.  Since then, because of failure to implement the report, it has gone back to the Labour Court and they have come up with a compromise solution that favours the dockers.  The dockers failed to put this to a ballot.  They are out since yesterday because they have been let go by the Dublin Port and Docks Board who have no money to pay them as the Exchequer's assistance which we have offered is not, and cannot, be made available until agreement is reached.  Not only do they require Exchequer money but they also require further borrowings from the banks.  They will not lend money until they are sure of the viability of the port and that can only be assured by agreement between the parties involved. We cannot force that agreement but we can, and do again, plead for that agreement as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with the Minister on that.  The dockers discuss the matter over their pints and the management at their desks.  The two sides are there but there is no movement.  Could we not send a skilled intermediary to help in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, we have done so.  The Labour Court intervened for a second time and the parties agreed to go to the court a second time.  They are very skilled intermediaries.  A compromise proposal has been put forward but so far it has not worked.  The union involved, the Marine Port and General Workers' Union, have failed to put the matter to a ballot of the members concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The deep sea section is closed.  The dock workforce have disregarded totally the most recent recommendations of the Labour Court. It is not true that the management are on one side and the workforce on the other side.  That is not what is happening.  The management have done everything possible.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy please put a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now losing more business in the deep sea area and it is questionable whether we will ever regain it.  Perhaps the Minister for Labour could intervene because these men will put another 300 out of work.  These people are also employed in the port, not with the dock labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything possible that can be done is and will be done.  The Minister for Labour has been most active in relation to this ongoing dispute.  He got the Horgan Review Group set up and he was instrumental in having the Labour Court intervene again in the past two weeks.  The present position is that the Labour Court made recommendations but this was not put to the members.  That is the problem.  Unfortunately, it appears that the members concerned are cutting their own throats.  They will not resolve this issue one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all happy with what has been said.  It appears here that the blame for the condition of the port is being put on the workforce but it is clear from what the Minister said earlier that it is a matter also for management.  Can no urgent steps be taken to help in the matter, for instance, as suggested in the Horgan report, that the Dublin Port and Docks board resign and the Minister appoint commissioners? This would seek to get the port back on its feet immediately and not wait until October which is the earliest date that new legislation could be introduced here. That is too long to wait to organise the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa has said that the workers in the port have been blamed solely for the present impasse.  If that impression has got out, it is a wrong impression.  I do not think there is any sense in recrimination or laying blame at this point.  Suffice to say that the parties involved need to get their <Col N="9" /> act together and get agreement.  Strenuous efforts have been made to achieve this and so far, despite the Labour Court's intervention twice, the matter has not been put to the members in recent times.  In relation to the question of the structures, the unfortunate part of the Horgan report was that it did not address itself to nor did it involve the rest of the workforce in Dublin docks let alone the workforce and management of other ports for whom it has a great many implications. We are urgently working out these implications so that when we do introduce legislation we will have dealt with the situation around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>The Free Ports Bill published on 18 June 1985 will enable me to establish a free port at Ringaskiddy.  I will be announcing details about the area to be designated as the free port, arrangements for management and control, etc., at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Minister give details of the area that is to be declared a free port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Later in the year.  The legislation unfortunately will not now be enacted before the summer recess, but I hope it will be enacted very soon after we resume after the summer recess and at that time I think it would be appropriate to announce the organisational arrangements for the new free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the declaration of the area as a free port would be of tremendous <Col N="10" /> benefit in the development of Cork harbour and that it is essential that this information be made available at the earliest possible date and not have it strung out as we have had it strung out over the past two years or so.  The Minister should be able to give us a more definite answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject the latter part of what Deputy Ahern has said, that this has been strung out over the past two years.  The decision to create a free port at Ringaskiddy was announced in the national plan last October.  We now have legislation before us.  As Deputy Ahern will be aware, the preparation of legislation is a complex matter and in this case involves several Departments and the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation is now ready.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to announce the management structure and organisation of the port as soon as possible and we will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to state how the area to be declared a free port area will relate to the large industrial site which is beside it and which is crying out for development?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>As I recently announced in this House, I have decided, as part of a general review of shipping policy which I am carrying out, to establish a Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements representative of the Government Departments and other <Col N="11" /> agencies concerned.  The task of the committee will be to investigate and report on our current and future strategic needs and how these should be secured.  I will be announcing the composition of the committee very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that the committee could report to me within three months.  That would be my hope. Obviously I cannot anticipate the report. I am sure if the committee reported that there is no need for a strategic shipping fleet Deputy De Rossa would not want me to implement the report.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state specifically if it is his intention to acquire the <i>Irish Spruce</i> as a base unit for a new deep sea shipping fleet?

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the decision to set up a committee of people expert in this area is in order to help us to make the right decision.  I understand very well the great pressure there is to commit ourselves to setting up a new shipping fleet, but Deputies will be aware of the grave crisis in shipping throughout the world where shipping company after shipping company is going into liquidation, where national fleets are being reduced all over the world and indeed in places very close to home, apart from Ireland, and it would be unwise of me to make any commitment until the committee report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that I gave to the House in a speech on his Estimate statistics on deep sea fleets of small countries?  I know there is a depression, I know business is going down, but does he not think that if Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland and so on find it profitable to have a limited deep sea shipping fleet this country also should have the same thing, roughly of the same tonnage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans for such legislation.  There are major practical and policy issues involved in rebroadcasting systems.</P>
      <P>First, the rebroadcasting of television signals would require under copyright law the agreement of the broadcasting authorities whose programmes are being rebroadcast.  Secondly, the broadcasting frequencies available to this country under international agreements are not sufficient to allow the widespread rebroadcasting of television signals.  Any such systems serving extensive areas would lead to unacceptable interference with other services and would inhibit the improvement of reception of existing RTE services and the development of new services.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the incompatibility of rebroadcasting systems with cable television systems and the fact that already the viability of a number of licensed cable systems is being threatened by illegal rebroadcasters.</P>
      <P>The question of how less sparsely populated areas might be served by cable systems was raised in the report of the Cable Systems Committee published earlier this year and a recommendation made in the report that a plan to facilitate this, based on the principle of commercial viability, should be developed for the establishment and operation of a national distribution network is being studied.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread use of deflectors at the moment and the fact that in rural areas the need for multi-viewing is so widespread? In view of the situation would he at this stage set up a group to study the possibilities of a deflection system?  We intend to bring in legislation on our return to office and I would like to have the report there when I come back.  Would the Minister facilitate us by setting up a <Col N="14" /> committee now to examine the possibilities of bringing in legislation for deflection systems?</P>

      <P>That is another promise chalked up on the big board Fianna Fáil have.  The Deputy was a Minister of State at my Department for some years and did absolutely nothing about rebroadcasting.  This is a very difficult problem, as he well knows.  There are international implications on two fronts, one under copyright law and the other under broadcasting channels allocated to this country.  We should not ignore the effects deflectors are having on licensed cable franchise holders.</P>

The Minister is ignoring the issue and should review the position.  This matter can be legislated for, but I know that there is a bias against this in the Department.  The Minister should indicate his policy in this matter.</P>

At present the vast majority of people who receive British services get them for nothing. I do not think they would welcome having to pay for them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no application at present before my Department for the provision of grant aid for port development at Greenore.  The limited funds at my disposal for harbour development are, as a matter of policy, made available to publicly controlled harbours, mainly those governed by the Harbours Act, 1946.  It would be inconsistent with this policy to provide State grant assistance to a privately owned port such as Greenore.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is no <Col N="20" /> application in the Department but numerous inquiries have been made to the Department over a period of years about the availability of grant aid for the development of Greenore Port.  Having regard to the serious economic situation that exists in the north-east, which is mainly concentrated in County Louth, would the Minister not think it appropriate to look at the question of the restriction of grant aid for the development of privately owned ports such as Greenore? It would help the overall economic development of the area if such aid was made available for the port.</P>

The point made by the Deputy will be one that will be considered in the context of that review.  The situation in County Louth highlights one of the problems in regard to ports in general because in respect of the three ports there, Greenore, Drogheda and Dundalk, grant assistance is being sought, in some cases to provide parallel facilities. I am not sure that such replication of facilities is a wise use of scarce resources. It involves enormous expense to the Exchequer and encourages competition between ports that are near each other when the resources could be put to better use perhaps elsewhere.</P>

I have already indicated to the House my view that the long-term solution to the problem of coastal erosion at Rosslare lies in a scheme of coastal protection.  In this regard, I have been informed that the Commissioners of Public Works recently made a positive determination under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, in relation to an application by Wexford County Council for a scheme of coastal protection for Rosslare strand.

Already he has given us some general lines on development and in this context he mentioned a provision of £500,000. Perhaps he would tell us what his plans are for the harbour authority and the powers they will have for the development of the harbour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is ongoing investment in the harbour with, as the Deputy says, provision of £500,000 this year.  I was at Rosslare harbour in the past week and I was glad to notice some of the improvements that have been effected there, for instance, the provision of a passenger gangway which was badly needed.  In the national plan the Government outlined their proposal for the setting up of a harbour authority who would run Rosslare harbour.  As I said then, this change would require both Irish and British legislation because of Rosslare harbour having been set up in conjunction with Fishguard.  There is no problem about preparing the relevant legislation here and having it passed but the difficulty is in persuading the British authorities to act with similar expedition and that is a matter over which we have no control, though we have been in contact with them several times on this subject. In the meantime I have discussed with <Col N="24" /> CIE ways and means of bringing about local involvement in the running of the port.  I expect a report from the chairman of CIE in that regard in the near future. I am very keen that some local people would be involved in the running of the port.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify what the British attitude is, whether they have indicated they are in favour generally of the proposal or that while they agree with the change they cannot give the necessary legislation priority at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The general impression is that there is no difficulty with the British apart from the problem of their finding time to draft the legislation and then parliamentary time for its enactment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the reasons a Royal Air Force helicopter had to be used in the rescue of Spanish sailors off the coast of Galway on 18 February 1985; and if he will make a statement on this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A distress call was received from the Spanish fishing vessel <i>Lembranza</i> by Valentia coast radio station in the morning of 18 February last. An accident on board the vessel, involving a cable snapping, had left one crew member dead and another seriously injured and in need of medical assistance.  A helicopter lift-off was required so that the injured man could be brought to hospital for treatment of extensive injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsequent medical evacuation procedure was co-ordinated by the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon Airport which is part of my Department.  The <i>Lembranza</i> was in position approximately 83 nautical miles off the coast of Galway.  As this was beyond the range of the Air Corps' Alouette helicopters, MRCC Shannon requested the assistance of an RAF Sea <Col N="25" /> King helicopter through MRCC Swansea. A helicopter was duly dispatched from the RAF base at Brawdy in South Wales and was accompanied by an Air Corps fixed-wing aircraft from Casement Aerodrome to assist in the search for the casualty and safety reasons.</P>
    <P>On reaching the <i>Lembranza</i> the helicopter lowered a doctor and winchman prior to lifting off the injured crewman, who was then brought directly to Limerick Regional Hospital for treatment.  The body of the deceased crew member was brought back to Spain by the fishing boat.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice, in accordance with the international co-operation which exists in marine search and rescue, to obtain assistance from the RAF in this way in cases where a casualty is beyond the range of the Air Corps helicopters.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to put on record my deep appreciation of the prompt assistance which we receive from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force during the incidents off our coasts which require their search and rescue capability.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps will start to take delivery of five Dauphin helicopter later this year.  When these helicopters are fully operational for search and rescue, they will be able to carry out rescues at distances up to 110 miles from base thus giving much more extensive coverage than is the case at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was out of range for the existing Irish helicopters and that the new helicopters which will be delivered later this year will have a wider range.  In relation to the first part <Col N="26" /> of the Deputy's supplementary question, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre was alerted at 11.20 a.m. and the helicopter reached the <i>Lembranza</i> at 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister that we will be receiving delivery of five Dauphin helicopters later this year.  But would he not agree that even these Dauphins, or the Alouettes we have at present do not have the necessary capabilities or capacity to operate in the event of very serious disasters or distress calls, such as the distress call which was received off the Galway coast on 18 February last?  Would the Minister confirm that a similar situation occurred recently in the case of the Air India disaster off the south west coast, that we had not got the necessary resources to implement a successful rescue mission, when again, we had to depend on the RAF for assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that RAF and Royal Navy assistance was so readily available.  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them, to the Irish Naval Service, the Irish Army, the Irish Air Corps, the Garda, all the emergency services, the people of Cork, every State agency involved who behaved superbly.  They deserve our great thanks. Indeed the Indian Government have been profuse in their thanks on their performance. Therefore, I do not think we should have an inferiority complex about having to enlist the help of other countries. We also received help from the US Air Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked two specific questions and I have not received answers.  I should like to be associated with the Minister's remarks about the RAF and their co-operation.  But would the Minister not agree that as an island nation, we have not got even one single helicopter with the engine capacity or navigational strength for an ongoing rescue mission?  Would he agree that the ones we have are of short strength only; they must go and come back; they cannot remain out there?  Could he give us the <Col N="27" /> reasons why the Puma helicopter which was leased from France when we were in Government is no longer leased?  Would he not agree that it is vital that we have at least one Puma available to us, an island nation, in order to ensure that we have adequate resources available to us for rescue missions off our coasts?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that television reception in the area has been totally unsatisfactory over a long number of years?  Furthermore, is he aware that, in a recent communication I had from RTE, while they said they wished to provide service at the earliest opportunity, it would appear they had no channel available but that they had requested the Minister's Department to reach appropriate international agreements so that RTE could use Channel F as the RTE channel in Monaghan?  Would the Minister agree that if his Department were to give interim permission we would have that service by next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, the necessary channel must be agreed under the Stockholm Agreement of 1961.  Several discussions have taken place with the UK authorities.  So far agreement on a co-ordinated channel has not been possible.  This is being pursued with the UK authorities and, hopefully, agreement will be reached and the question of reception in Monaghan will be put right before too long.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The Government invited proposals in November 1983 for the provision on a concessionary basis of an Irish satellite network and an Irish direct satellite broadcasting service, preferably with some telecommunications capacity.</P>
      <P>The closing date for receipt of proposals was 31 July 1984.  That date was not extended but clarification of the proposals and attitudes of those involved had, as would be normal in such instances, to be sought subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of proposals were received by the closing date but, as the tendering process is a confidential one, it would be inappropriate to divulge who are the <Col N="30" /> tenderers or to give any details such as the cost of the systems proposed by them.</P>
    <P>Evaluation of the applications which, given the size and complexity of the project necessarily took some time, was completed recently at departmental level.  I would expect that the Government will be making a decision in principle regarding the award of the franchise shortly.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give the estimated commencement date of the project at this time but it is likely to be at least two to three years.  The cost of the project will be borne totally by the successful applicant and there will be no State costs involved.  Consequently the question of including any cost provisions in my Department's Estimates does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate the actual cost or the lowest tender submitted by an applicant at this stage and the reason it will take two or three years for a final decision to be reached in regard to a commencement date for this project?  Would he agree that if we do not move in this area very quickly we will have no opportunity to get into this very exciting and worthwhile area of broadcasting? The Minister should take an early decision and proceed with the project or otherwise inform the House on what is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, this matter will be before the Government for decision very shortly.  I cannot say what was the lowest tender; it would not be practicable to do that.  In regard to the Deputy's question as to why it will take two to three years to commence the project, that is the time scale involved in ordering a satellite, having the configuration agreed, first of all, and then made, then having the satellite launched.  In addition, all sorts of programme considerations have to be taken into account. Moreover, an analysis of how to penetrate the market and be received by viewers has to be considered.  Therefore, it is a very complex question.  In other countries in Europe there has been a great slowing down of developments in this connection because of the highly <Col N="31" /> speculative nature of the proposals and because of the rapid change in technology.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he is satisfied that air traffic control equipment at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports is of the necessary standard; and if he will make a statement on the constant reports of inadequacy and potential danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the air traffic control equipment at the three State airports is adequate for the safety of air operations.  The Deputy will appreciate that the replacement of equipment and the provision of improved facilities is an on-going activity.  In excess of £7 million was spent on replacement equipment and improved facilities over the past four years.  While there was a <Col N="34" /> failure in the main air/ground communications equipment at Dublin Airport recently, at no stage was there a complete failure of communications as a reserve system remained available.  The transmitters and receivers which failed on that occasion have since been replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House how much of the £3,050,000 that is listed in the 1985 Estimate for electronic equipment for air navigation services has been spent already this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information here but I will let the Deputy have it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the footnote in the Book of Estimates which says &ldquo;included, capital services 1984, £429,000, 1985, £2,500,000&rdquo;?  Why is the £429,000 from 1984 included in the overall figure for the Estimate for 1985? Was it that there was money available for expenditure in 1984 which was not spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will send a detailed reply to the Deputy.  Over the past few years there have been substantial allocations in the Estimates for expenditure but very often because of the delay in getting tenders the money is not spent in a particular year and sometimes money is paid after the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would this have given rise to complaints which were being made by people involved in the service at Dublin Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been complaints but some of the delays have been caused by failure to get agreement with some staffs on the use of new equipment. Delays have not been caused by my Department and there is not a lack of provision for the development of technical facilities at our airports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communications the circumstances of <Col N="35" /> the death of a man on the Limerick-Dublin train; if he is satisfied that there are adequate means of communication on CIE trains to cope with such emergencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's functions regarding rail safety are mainly related to the investigation of rail accidents and to the inspection of new or reconstructed railway installations.</P>
      <P>The incident to which the question relates was not required to be reported as a railway accident to my Department under the legislation dealing with rail safety and is a matter for the board of CIE.</P>
      <P>CIE have informed me that the deceased passenger joined the 15.30 hours Cork/Dublin train at Limerick Junction on Sunday, 16 June, and that he became ill and died suddenly when the train was in the Newbridge area.  It is understood that he was being accompanied to hospital in Dublin to undergo heart surgery.</P>
      <P>CIE consider that the means of communication available are adequate to deal with emergencies of the type involved as the train can be brought to a stop by the guard to enable appropriate action to be taken.  The board recently accepted the need for a guard to driver voice communication system to be provided on all trains as recommended by the formal investigation into the Cherryville rail accident.  The board intend to give effect to that recommendation as soon as they have worked out detailed rules regarding the use of the communication system to be adopted.  In every carriage there is an emergency lever which can be pulled to halt a train.  That was not used.  I sympathise with the family who are bereaved in this sad incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite clear from the Minister's reply that a recommendation was made at the time of the Cherryville disaster and that that recommendation was not carried out and that there was serious neglect involved in what happened on this train?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was serious neglect I would be the first to say so and the first to take action.  There was not serious neglect.  The recommendation of the Cherryville report was accepted by CIE and they are in the process of installing the equipment.  That takes time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that an experienced reporter happened to be in that carriage and reported that the temperature was at 80 degrees plus, that there was no way of controlling it and that when the man collapsed there was no way anyone could communicate with anybody outside of that carriage and that we had the ridiculous situation of a bit of paper being thrown out of the train at Sallins in the hope that some carrier pigeon would take it to some responsible person employed by CIE at that station? That did not happen and there was not even a place to lay down the corpse when the man died on the train.  Is that not a disgraceful situation which should be dealt with as a matter of urgency and that the words &ldquo;in the process of installation&rdquo; are not good enough in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a situation which requires more sensitive handling than that indicated by Deputy Wilson's words.  There are levers in each carriage of the trains and they were not used. When the guard of the train was contacted and came on the scene he found that the person was dead.  He decided to let the train continue to its destination in Dublin as the most expeditious thing to do in the circumstances.  Obviously, this is a very sad event for the family concerned and we ought to be sensitive to their position and to console them in their bereavement.</P>

Consideration of the various aspects of the project is at an advanced stage and I hope to secure formal Government approval for the necessary level of investment in the near future. Further consultation with Dublin County Council under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, will then be required so I am not in a position to indicate when construction work on the project will commence.</P>

      <P>The cost of local radio will be determined by the number of stations established which will be a matter for the Local Radio Commission.

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Not pre-empting the debate on the Local Radio Bill, will the proposed section 28 not mention the sum of £1 million as a possible allocation for the new radio commission?  Surely if the Minister is serious about the Local Radio Bill and the development of local radio then he would have included some funds in the Estimates.  Surely this is not going to exist without any funding whatsoever. That is what the Minister is really saying here today, that he is not providing funds for this local radio.</P>

      <P>The Minister is talking about financial rectitude but he is setting up a local radio commission without any funding whatsoever, without any assistance from the Department of Communications, and he expects them to borrow from some institution to set about establishing local radio.

If Deputy Leyden wants the tax burden to be increased on the PAYE sector or on taxpayers in general, that is his business. This Government are determined to avoid imposing unnecessary liabilities on taxpayers.  It is intended that those people who are lucky enough to get contracts from the Local Radio Commission will by their fees remunerate the commission for any start off costs.</P>

It is the first time in the history of the State that proposed legislation is before the House and the Minister has provided no funding to establish a commission or to commence their operations. It is an outrageous proposal that he is not providing funding at the initial stages.

    <Title>Milan European Council: Statements.</Title>
    <Col N="119" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the European Council held in Milan, which I attended with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, on 28 and 29 June.  The Council, which for the first time was attended by the Governments of Spain and Portugal, was concerned to a considerable extent with the proposals made in the report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee for Institutional Affairs, consisting of personal representatives of Heads of State or Government and chaired by Senator Dooge.  I, therefore, invited the Senator and he was good enough to accompany me, in a consultative capacity, to Milan.  I have arranged for the conclusions of the Council to be laid before the House in the usual way.</P>
      <P>We spent some time in the House last Wednesday discussing European Union and other aspects of the Community.  I do not propose, therefore, to go in detail into the background to the recent Council.</P>
      <P>The Milan Council was the first for a long time to have had before it the opportunity of an indepth discussion on the way the Community is working and of its prospects, unencumbered by immediate and controversial topics like budget limits and contributions, enlargement, the super-levy etc., which have virtually monopolised earlier Councils.  This provided the opportunity which the Italian Presidency took for setting two days aside for Heads of State or of Government to discuss the Dooge Report, the question of a new Treaty on European Union, the report of the Committee on a Peoples' Europe, the internal market and technology, including the French EUREKA proposal, as well as the current economic and social situation, trade relations with Japan and famine in Africa.</P>
      <P>The meeting continued from approximately 11 a.m. until late on Friday night and again from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Saturday.  The Council was, in my experience, unique in the range and complexity of the subjects dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> The major problem facing Europe today is unemployment.  The European Community, with a budget equivalent to approximately 1 per cent of gross national product of the Community, is in no position at present to tackle this problem through solutions involving expenditure. It can, however, act in other ways that will help to sustain and create employment. First &mdash; and above all &mdash; it can improve the way in which it makes decisions. Even if the Community were endowed with unlimited resources, it could not act effectively if its decision-making processes were deficient.  This, therefore, is one reason why I have been so concerned to ensure that the Community can improve its capacity for making decisions. The relationships between its different institutions &mdash; primarily, the Parliament, the Council of Ministers, and the Commission &mdash; are extremely relevant to the efficient working of the European economy.</P>
    <P>Next, if the market, which the Community was established to encourage, is not free and unified so that it is a single market like the United States or Japan, then it will defeat the very purposes for which it was established.  Enterprises must be able to develop their full potential in a market of 260 million, soon to be of 320 million, people.  If this is not done, we shall all be the poorer; and Europe could well become, as Signor Spinelli has suggested, a border region between two great empires.  This was a second major concern in Milan &mdash; how to set about unravelling effectively the tangle of conflicting industrial norms, product standards, border controls, fiscal and other practices which continue to fragment the market and entangle the Community in an irrational and frustrating web of restrictions and rigidities.</P>
    <P>The third of our major concerns &mdash; which, as I have suggested, centre around the problem of economic growth in Europe and our ability to tackle unemployment &mdash; was the way in which Europe is falling behind technologically.  This can and has been exaggerated but there is need for action to ensure that industry located in Europe can take part in the <Col N="121" /> market of the future.  One estimate of the extent of what could be involved is that markets based on space products alone &mdash; including new alloys, new medicines, new exploration mapping and forecasting techniques &mdash; will by the end of this century be worth about $200 billion approximately, twice the entire market for services and products for the entire airline industry at the present time.  Europe, and we in Ireland, just cannot afford to be left out or to fall behind in this race.</P>
    <P>These then, were the three major concerns lying behind our deliberations in Milan: how to improve the institutional arrangements of the Community &mdash; which are difficult and complicated enough with ten members but will become even more so with enlargement to 12 &mdash; so as to enable it to work efficiently and democratically; how to complete the internal market so that the people of Europe can benefit from the full potential of what is now the single largest trading bloc in the world; and how to ensure the Europe, which has led the world for so long in so many areas of science and technology, does not fall behind now in the development of the products and services of the future.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I feel a certain sense of disappointment that proposals before the Council for improvements in the decision-making process that could be undertaken now &mdash; that is, reinforcing the practice of majority voting and strengthening the executive powers of the Commission &mdash; did not secure support from every member state.  However, with the support of seven member states, the Presidency is to take the steps necessary to convene an Inter-Governmental Conference with a view to submitting the results for decision to the next European Council to be held later this year in Luxembourg. The governments in favour of the convening of this conference were the six original members of the Community and Ireland.  Spain and Portugal will be invited to participate.  Major themes of the conference will be the question of amending the EC Treaty, in accordance <Col N="122" /> with Article 236, as regards the decision-making process of the Council; the Commission's executive power; the powers of the European Parliament; and the extension to new fields of activity in line with the proposals made by the Dooge and the Adonnino committees.</P>
    <P>The conference will also look at the question of a treaty or agreement on a common foreign and security policy on the basis of France-German and United Kingdom texts.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the French and German Governments, conscious of our special position of neutrality, worded Articles 8.1 and 8.2 of their draft treaty so as to place security matters other than political and economic aspects &mdash; viz. matters with possible defence implications &mdash; firmly outside the framework of the proposed political co-operation arrangements, as they are at present, and within the Western European Union framework, and of the manner in which the British Prime Minister accepted this significant change by reference to the equivalent paragraph 8 of the British draft treaty, on the basis that the Franco-German version met the needs of the Irish situation more effectively and clearly.</P>
    <P>These passages of the Franco-German draft treaty are:</P>
    <P>Article 8.1: The signatory States... reaffirm their readiness increasingly to coordinate their positions on the political and economic aspects of security.</P>
    <P>Article 8.2: Those among the signatory States who wish to co-operate more closely in the field of security will do so within the framework of the Western European Union while respecting the role which falls to the Alliance, and their specific situation and strategy within the latter.</P>
    <P>On this point at the conclusion of the discussions, I entered on the records a <Col N="123" /> formal declaration, referring to the Conclusion on Institutional Affairs to the effect that:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to its position on other points, Ireland accepts the wording of the first indent of the fourth paragraph viz. that dealing with Political Co-operation on the basis of paragraph 8.1 second sentence, and paragraph 8.2, of the Draft Franco-German Treaty.</P>
    <P>On the next major theme &mdash; that of the internal market &mdash; the European Council asked the Council of Ministers to initiate a precise programme of action with a view to achieving completely and effectively the conditions for a single market in the Community by 1992 at the latest. This means:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the removal of physical and technical barriers to the free movement of goods within the Community, in particular the adoption of common or compatible standards for major new technologies in order to open up public purchasing and satisfy the requirements of business;</P>
    <P>(2) the creation of a free market in the financial services and transport sections;</P>
    <P>(3) the creation of full freedom of establishment for the professions; and</P>
    <P>(4) the liberalisation of capital movements.</P>
    <P>I stressed here that the advantages which a single market could bring to the Community as a whole would not be evenly distributed unless specific measures were taken to counterbalance the centripetal effects.  The Council accordingly agreed that the creation of a single market should contribute to furthering the more general objectives of the Treaty, including those of harmonious development and economic convergence.</P>
    <P>I should also add on this point that some of the proposals in the Commission White Paper deal with fiscal harmonisation. I said that, in so far as Ireland was concerned, the concept of harmonising <Col N="124" /> excise duties and VAT could have unacceptable consequences and that, in particular, if taxes were to be harmonised then we should also think in terms of harmonising welfare provisions within the Community.  In other words, if the Community wishes to harmonise the revenue raising powers of Governments &mdash; and there are many arguments for this &mdash; then it must also look, as an absolute precondition, to the consequences and to the programmes which those revenues are used to finance.  The conclusions record, in paragraph 3 of this section, the need for a special examination of this subject.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to speak of improving the way in which the Community works and of achieving a unified market by the year 1992, but this does not meet the case of the man or woman now who has no job.  Unemployment, which, as I have said, is the most serious problem facing Europe today, must be addressed by the Community as well as by member states. I commended to the European Council in some detail the excellent report submitted by the Italian Minister, Mr. Goria, in his capacity as Chairman of the ECO/FIN Council, of which I am placing a copy in the Library together with a similar document on the EMS.  In this report, which follows directly from a statement I made in the Dublin European Council last December as to the need for consideration of stimulatory measures, attention is drawn to the need to give priority in all member states to combating unemployment.  The report follows the case I made then as to the need to ensure an appropriate level of demand in Europe so as to take over from the US economy if present trends towards slacker activity in the United States are reinforced.</P>
    <P>My intervention is closely reflected in the Presidency Conclusions which invites the ECO/FIN Council to consider the extent to which the convergence already achieved in inflation levels and imbalances &mdash; viz. in regard to external payments and Government budgets &mdash; would enable the Community to intensify the battle against unemployment.  The <Col N="125" /> Commission is also to report to the European Council in December on the present inadequacies as regards economic growth and employment in the European economy, in comparison with its major competitors among the industrialised countries and on the new strategies that could be implemented to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The support for a co-ordinated European approach in advanced technological research for civilian purposes, involving both the French EUREKA project and the Commission's constructive proposals along the same lines, was unanimous and remarkably enthusiastic.  The Council expressed the wish that the EUREKA project sponsored by President Mitterrand for France should be open to those non-Community countries which had already shown interest in taking part in it.  These include Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria.</P>
    <P>As regards follow-up, France would continue the steps it was taking, by convening before 14 July, in collaboration with the Council Presidency and the Commission, an <i>ad hoc</i> committee of Ministers for Research or other qualified representatives of the Governments of countries which had responded positively, and representatives of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Council considered that the follow-up should ensure exploitation of the potential benefits of the Community dimension by establishing a close link between technological development and the effort to break down the barriers to a full internal market; by tying it in with other common policies, in particular trade policy towards the Community's main partners; by reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication of national efforts and assembling a &ldquo;critical mass&rdquo;&mdash; or minimum necessary scale &mdash; of financial and human resources; and, finally, by obtaining the maximum benefit from the technical and financial instruments immediately available to the Community, including those of the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>In recent days agreements to co-operate in a number of the most advanced <Col N="126" /> fields have been concluded by European companies from a number of countries inside and outside the Community.  This development was noted with interest by the Council.  I should also mention that on the eve of the Milan meeting we received a further letter on EUREKA from the French Foreign Minister which made if fully clear that his Government had taken on board the concerns we had conveyed to them and had accepted that small and medium sized firms and research centres should be enabled to participate effectively in programmes under EUREKA and to benefit fully from the results of the research.</P>
    <P>A major issue which came up at Milan related to how this new initiative should be organised, with particular reference to the role of the Community, as such, and of the Commission.  This will no doubt be teased out further before and at the meeting of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee decided on by the Council.  The Government will be giving careful consideration to how best to advance Community and Irish interests.</P>
    <P>Against the background of increasing dangers to the world's multilateral trading system, the Council also discussed the Community's trade relations with Japan. It fully shared the serious concern of the recent Foreign Affairs Council at the very limited progress made by the Japanese authorities in opening up the Japanese market.  We, therefore, endorsed the request made by our Foreign Ministers to Japan to increase its imports of manufactured goods and processed agricultural products, and to liberalise Japanese financial markets and internationalise the Yen, and asked the Commission to press for progress in these areas during the visit this month to Europe of Prime Minister Nakasone.</P>
    <P>A Community which has perfected its decision-making processes and its internal market arrangements and is in total accord with its trading partners throughout the world &mdash; if one can imagine such a harmonious condition &mdash; would still be incomplete if it were to be seen by its citizens as remote, inaccessible and incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> This is the essence of the problem addressed by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on a People's Europe.  The report of the committee contains concrete recommendations on the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament, on strengthening the right of petition to the European Parliament and on a possible role for a European ombudsman; on co-operation in television production; on setting up a European Academy of Science, Technology and Art and on the feasibility of a Euro-lottery to finance cultural projects; on voluntary work camps, exchanges between schools and universities and the organisation of Community sporting events, Community teams and combating violence at sporting events; on the organisation of volunteers for development work in the Third World; on provision of a Community emergency health card, easier access to medical treatment when travelling in the Community, greater Community co-operation in combating drug abuse; on twinning of towns and cities; and on the adoption of a Community flag and anthem.</P>
    <P>The Council approved the recommendations on these questions and requested the Commission and the member states to implement those recommendations which are within their respective competences. The Foreign Ministers have been asked to report to us at our next meeting in December on progress.  We also emphasised the especial value of a French proposal to launch a programme of action at European level against cancer.</P>
    <P>The Council noted that two-thirds of the 1.2 million tonnes of cereals or their equivalent, committed at our meeting here in Dublin in December last, has already reached the recipients or was en route to Africa.  We agreed that new food aid requirements could arise, particularly if rain during the rainy season which had just started in Africa, was to be insufficient. We welcomed the Commission's proposal to mobilise 500,000 tonnes of cereals equivalent, additional to the normal aid programme, and asked the Council of Development Aid Ministers <Col N="128" /> to examine this urgently.  As regards the long term, we agreed to support the food strategies and efforts of African countries to achieve food self-sufficiency as well as to give priority to the battle against desertification.</P>
    <P>As the principal focus of the Council was on economic and institutional affairs, we had little time to discuss major political issues of international importance.  In this regard, the Council adopted conclusions only on the question of relations between the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, better known as COMECON.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State or Government also had an exchange of views and information on the Middle East situation and on terrorism in the world today.</P>
    <P>In the margin of the Council, I had a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, to review progress in the discussions on the situation in Northern Ireland.  As is customary, no substantive communique or other statement is issued on the content of these brief meetings.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Council was, as Deputies will gather, concerned with a wide range of problems confronting Europe and the world.  I can touch here only in outline on the discussions which, as I have said, extended over two long days.  I think that a significant step forward has been taken in the decision to hold an intergovernmental conference, with a view to deciding on necessary improvements in the working of the Community's institutions and in its decision-making process.</P>
    <P>On the matters of contention, the majority of countries found it possible &mdash; indeed went out of their way &mdash; to accommodate Irish interests.  Our concerns on neutrality were met.  The conclusions explicitly respond to the concerns I expressed in regard to unemployment and economic convergence.  Particular Irish concerns in regard to the advanced technology proposals have been accepted; and our reservations in relation to vital national interests in the decision-making process are coming increasingly to be recognised as valid and indeed acceptable by many other member states, <Col N="129" /> some of whom originally proposed measures in this area ostensibly in advance of the Irish position.</P>
    <P>While I regret the inability of the Council in Milan to give firm and agreed guidelines there and then on the decision-making proposals before it there, I am satisfied that the Community has at least the possibility of making the changes necessary to improve its efficiency and confer on its 320 million citizens, equitably, the benefit of a sophisticated and unified market with industries at the frontiers of technology and an agriculture which is among the best in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>By all accounts the European Council meeting in Milan appears to have been a confused affair. Yet another Council has come and gone without any action to deal with unemployment. Bad workmen blame their tools.  The institutions of the Community are being blamed, when it is in fact the political leaders of Europe who are to blame for a total lack of commitment or political will to tackle unemployment.</P>
      <P>The political issue for us, the touchstone of the effectiveness and relevance of the Community to our situation, is the level of unemployment.  As I stated last week, our unemployment rate in 1973 was 65,000, while today it is around 225,000.  In the Community as a whole it has jumped from 2,500,000 people to 14 million people.  The scale of unemployment in Ireland and in the Community is not paralleled elsewhere.  European leaders would do us all a service by concentrating on this scandal.  By comparison, schemes for European Union are simply a form of political escapism, castles in the air designed to distract the attention of impatient electorates from the inadequate economic performance of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious disunity over the proposal to call a conference on European unity hardly inspires great confidence about its success.  Britain on the one hand and France and Germany on the other seem to have spent their time trying to upstage each other.  The Milan European Council has left the Community in a shambles, <Col N="130" /> and anyone who concludes that a new era of progress is dawning in the Community is obviously an eternal optimist.</P>
    <P>It is becoming increasingly clear the Taoiseach is not a very reliable rapporteur. What people in this country want to know, what they are interested in, is whether the major European economies are going to reflate in a co-ordinated manner.  Is there any prospect of more resources for the Regional Fund to remedy the serious imbalances that exist and that are widening?  Other than the decision to call an intergovernmental conference, whose mandate must await the Council of Foreign Ministers, nothing else was decided.  So it is difficult to see that there is anything for even the most devoted leader writer to get enthusiastic about.  Is it not the case that nothing has yet been settled, that everything is for negotiation, and that there could be some unpleasant surprises for us at the end of the day?</P>
    <P>An intergovernmental conference has been convened to work out, firstly, &ldquo;a treaty on a common foreign and security policy on the basis of the Franco-German and United Kingdom drafts&rdquo; and, secondly, amendments to the Treaty. The whole notion of an intergovernmental conference to draft a new European Union Treaty, contained in the Dooge and Spinelli reports, has been diluted. The new Treaty is to be confined to political co-operation, while the Rome Treaty is to be retained and amended.  A number of member states have already forecast that the Conference, at least as far as amendment of the Treaty is concerned, is an impossible proposition as some Parliaments will never ratify sweeping changes in majority voting.</P>
    <P>Ireland voted with the Six for the conference and there can be no doubt that Ireland must attend such a conference, if it is called.  At the same time I do not think we can have any great enthusiasm for it.  I think we must be honest and see our role as part of the general posturing that was going on.  There is no basis for the Taoiseach's claim on RTE on Sunday that this brings major practical benefits to Ireland.  He referred to concessions <Col N="131" /> won by Ireland on the milk super-levy and the common fisheries policy.  The fact is these concessions, unsatisfactory though they were, were bitterly opposed by countries supposed to be full of goodwill towards us.  Even though our case was a strong one, the concessions were only made because our agreement was necessary to allow the new policies to go ahead.</P>
    <P>It is legitimate to ask how we would have fared if there had been no veto in existence.  That is the reality.  Let us stop creating illusions about how the Community really works.  Britain and Greece have won really major concessions from Community in the last couple of years, and they did not win them on the basis of the personal reputations or European attitudes of the people involved.  Sentiment really counts for very little unfortunately, in the hard bargaining that goes on in the Community.  Our vital interests will not receive any protection at the intergovernmental conference merely because we supported the holding of it. In fact, the reverse is the more likely outcome.</P>
    <P>The language of the conclusions, which refers to, &ldquo;a treaty on a common foreign and security policy on the basis of the Franco-German and United Kingdom drafts&rdquo;, gives a somewhat unfortunate impression that we favour both a common foreign policy and a common security policy, when the fact is that no Treaty Ireland will be able to sign can bind us to a common foreign and security policy, which would be incompatible with our neutrality.</P>
    <P>I understand and accept that the Franco-German draft treaty involves more intensive co-operation on political and economic aspects of security only, and that those member states who want to go beyond that in relation to security will do so in the framework of the Western European union.  But it is not by any means clear what more intensive co-operation on the political and economic aspects of security is likely to involve. Will it mean agreement to use economic <Col N="132" /> sanctions for instance or will it limit our freedom of action at the UN?</P>
    <P>After the last discussion we had here there were suggestions that I was imagining things when I talked about pressure on Irish neutrality.  But it is the people who say and write this kind of thing who are either fooling themselves or trying to hide the reality.  This is what the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;It should be made clear that no other Government has put any pressure at any time on us on this issue of neutrality.  Persistent reports to the contrary are quite simply inventions.  No one should allow themselves to be fooled by this propaganda.&rdquo;  That is in my view a dangerous piece of selectivity.  In fact, it is a half truth.  The recognition of that comes from the Taoiseach's statement today.  In one place he stated:</P>
    <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which the French and German Governments, conscious of our special position of neutrality, worded Articles 8.1 and 8.2 of their draft Treaty so as to place security matters other than political and economic aspects &mdash;</P>
    <P>If there was no problem for us why then is the Taoiseach grateful to the French and German Governments for this concession. Later in his statement the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>Our concerns on neutrality were met...</P>
    <P>The whole impression conveyed by the Taoiseach when he last spoke here and, indeed, by his leader writers, was that we need not have any concern but now, on his own admission, there was, even by himself, some grounds for concern.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that there is a widespread movement in the Community to bring about a new form of a Community in which it would be impossible for us to retain a policy of neutrality.  Two years ago the British Defence Secretary, Mr. Heseltine, said that in the event of any real threat there was no way Ireland could opt out.  A former German Chancellor, <Col N="133" /> Willi Brandt, still a major figure of influence in Europe, said, as reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 19 May 1985, that he would like to see Ireland making a full defence and military commitment to the EEC, and that this was the view of the German Government as well as the Opposition.  The German Ambassador here a month earlier stated that every effort should be taken to facilitate countries to participate in a common security policy, and suggested those countries prepared for stronger intergration should go ahead without waiting for the others, thus raising the spectre of the two tier Community.</P>
    <P>Did that not constitute pressure? When other countries put forward texts or proposals which ignore the existence of Irish neutrality and assume it out of existence, does that constitute at least some sort of pressure?  When the personal representatives of the other nine heads of Government in the Dooge interim report defined the aim of European Union as, &ldquo;the cohesiveness and solidarity of the countries of Europe within the larger framework of the Alantic Alliance&rdquo;, was that not pressure on us?  More recently Article 8 of British Foreign Minister Howe's draft agreement on political co-operation on security stated that it was an essential element of Europe's external political identity, and that the aim should be to maximise the contribution of member states to NATO.</P>
    <P>Not all the pressure on Irish neutrality is coming from foreign Governments.  A fair amount of it emanates from the right wing of the Fine Gael Party and their media friends.  The Minister for Defence has at least the virtue of straight talking when he speaks of neutrality as, &ldquo;a policy option&rdquo;, and states that the policy on neutrality is only valid till 1987, a point also made by the Taoiseach in a recent interview.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for reiterating that the Irish public feel deeply about this issue and I believe we must not here at home or in Europe create a false impression, be half-hearted or embarrassed about it.  The draft Treaty on political <Col N="134" /> co-operation if it happens must meet the wishes of the Irish people on this crucial issue.</P>
    <P>What is involved in completion of the internal market is spelt out in some detail in the communique.  The first item is the removal of physical barriers to the free movement of goods within the Community. During the recent discussion here in this House I spelt out what this can mean for us if there is no adequate regional policy or action.  It also involves the liberalisation of capital movements.  Since we joined the EMS we have very tight exchange controls.  Are we prepared to relax these, and what would the implications be of such a course of action?</P>
    <P>The chapter concludes with the following statement: &ldquo;In deciding on the above measures the Community will make every effort to ensure that the creation of a single free market contributes to furthering the more general objectives of the Treaty including those of harmonious development and economic convergence&rdquo;. To me that is a weak and perfunctory statement, which does nothing to meet the point which I argued forcibly in the Dáil last week in the debate on the Dooge report, that economic intergration has costs as well as benefits that must be countered by an effective regional policy.</P>
    <P>I am quite disturbed by the very simplistic statement by the Taoiseach in the course of his contribution today when he said:</P>
    <P>Next, if the market which the Community was established to encourage, is not free and unified so that it is a single market like the United States or Japan, then it will defeat the very purposes for which it was established. Enterprises must be able to develop their full potential in a market of 260 million, soon to be of 320 million, people.</P>
    <P>That is all very well.  It is an ideal but if we are going to have this totally free universal market throughout the Community without any protection for the <Col N="135" /> peripheral regional disadvantaged areas I would genuinely be worried about the outcome of that development.  How, for instance, is a small firm in Westport, County Mayo, or somewhere else in the west of Ireland expected to compete against the geographical and scale disadvantages it would have with some similar firm in the Ruhr?  That is a dangerous, simplistic type of approach and I hope the idea of a totally free common market without any protection for the disadvantaged peripheral areas will not be followed through, as the present Government seem to be quite content to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does. He is very specific there and says that if we do not have this wholly free unified market we shall all be the poorer.  That is something we can return to another day because we do not have time to debate it fully today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention something which appeared in <i>The Sunday Observer</i> about what is happening in Britain.  That article was called &ldquo;The Ruined House of Regional Aid&rdquo;.  It points out that from the thirties there has been a steady effort to transfer prosperity from the better off regions of Britain in the south-east to the poorer regions in the north and west.  The present British Government have, it was stated, killed that off with regional development grants cut from £650 million in 1982-83 to £177 million this year, leading to a widening gap between the north and south of Britain.  Regional policy is now regarded by the British Government as merely supporting lame ducks and the costly pursuing of &ldquo;structural rigidities&rdquo;. The danger is that this monetarist approach is about to be adopted totally in the European Community as a whole &mdash; and that is my worry &mdash; with the same inevitable consequences of widening the divide between the richer and poorer sections of the Community.  This is serious <Col N="136" /> and potentially disastrous from our point of view, and we must seek remedial action which will ensure a greater commitment of resources to an enlarged regional policy and fund.  We must be anxiously alert to our having to pay the price for increased European integration, and we should decline to ratify any agreement which does not contain the necessary safeguards and compensatory measures as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a naive reference in the conclusions to the possibility of further action or unemployment when the Council of Economic Ministers were invited to consider the extent to which the convergence which had already been achieved between the member states in the field of inflation and imbalances made it possible to intensify the battle against unemployment. I note in passing that the Irish Government have made no progress in correcting their own financial imbalances which behind all the fog carefully disseminated by the national handlers this Government head for the greatest current budget in the history of the State.  Of course Community-wide reflation would make the biggest contribution of all to reducing unemployment, and we have constantly urged this.  The proposed study on why the other major industrialised competitors are doing better should also have included a study of why most of the other smaller and medium-sized OECD countries are faring better than the Community.</P>
    <P>Proposals to enlarge the Commission's administrative powers sound fairly hollow, when at the same time there was, we heard, the insistence of the French Presidency that the European Commission be denied competence over the EUREKA proposals to strengthen European science and technology.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the Community, I must draw the House's attention to a little publicised statement made by the Taoiseach on 20 June in Rome with other Christian Democratic leaders from Germany, Benelux and Italy, calling on the European Council to take irreversible decisions leading to European <Col N="137" /> Union, calling for the European Parliament to be given power of co-decision in legislative matters, making majority voting the rule within the Council of Ministers with a few exceptions, and that the Commission should be nominated by the European Parliament instead of member governments.  The Taoiseach had no mandate from this House, or from anyone else to make such far-reaching commitments.  They certainly do not represent the position of the Irish people.  I am afraid the Taoiseach in matters European has a habit of losing all critical judgment and rushing headlong into commitments of that kind which he has no mandate to give before they have been examined or debated in any way in this country.</P>
    <P>During the Council a meeting took place between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher.  While the handlers line duly reported in the Irish press is that a summit is likely in the early autumn, the English papers, on the other hand, point out that they failed to set a date for a meeting. Does nobody recall that this meeting was originally promised for early this year? The Taoiseach cannot maintain credibility for these talks much longer.  We should be told one way or the other, what if anything, is going on.  It is, after all, our country they are talking about.  The Taoiseach used to lecture this House three or four years ago about the dangers of secret Anglo-Irish talks.</P>
    <P>Enough however is known about the talks to suggest that they cannot be reconciled with the spirit of the Forum Report, and the principle enshrined in it that any agreement without the narrow parameters permitted by the British Government will do nothing to establish lasting peace or stability in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The language of the communiqué, which &ldquo;reaffirmed their commitment to make progress in relation to the Northern Ireland situation through their continuing contact, their condemnation of all forms of terrorism and their determination to do everything possible to defeat it&rdquo;, suggests that the whole context and thrust of what is going on is wrong.  No internal Northern arrangements as the Forum <Col N="138" /> Report points out can succeed or bring peace.</P>
    <P>I feel I should comment on one proposal which keeps surfacing in our media. I refer to the suggestion that judges from this State might sit in the Northern courts on terrorist cases, and <i>vice versa.</i>  I hope that no such ludicrous proposal is even being considered.  One of the major achievements of this State has been the independence of the Judiciary and respect for our courts.  There must be no attempt to play around with the constitutional position of the Judiciary in this State or to undermine the integrity of their position.</P>
    <P>If these talks are not going anywhere, as would seem to be the case, let the Taoiseach end the charade now.  We could then advocate to the world a realistic policy based on the truth that the Northern Ireland political expedient of 60 years ago has totally failed and no attempt to prop it up by half-baked measures at this stage will change that basic position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be a strange priority, and I am sure this will seem so to many citizens of Europe, that at a time when unemployment is so high in the EC, when millions are out of work who want to work and who if given the chance would work, the Heads of Government of the EC should have spent the time of the Summit discussing vague possibilities of closer moves towards European unity, once again totally ignoring the greatest single social problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody introduced one shred of evidence that there is any substantial body of opinion in Ireland, or even in other EC countries, who are demanding moves towards closer integration, but there is a demand that something be done about unemployment and there would be widespread support for the Heads of Government if they knuckled down to and decided to tackle this problem of the jobless.  Unfortunately most EC leaders, including our Taoiseach, seem quite prepared to tolerate existing levels of unemployment while indulging in their own <Col N="139" /> idealistic pie in the sky fantasies about European unity.  Perhaps if people in the various EC countries saw some real effort being made to solve their day-to-day problems there might be more enthusiasm for political unity.</P>
    <P>In the discussion in the Dáil last Wednesday I warned the Taoiseach about the dangers of agreeing to participate in any conference of EC Governments which was going to use the Dooge report as an agenda for European unity, but this is precisely what has happened. The Taoiseach has totally capitulated and, more regrettably, we have isolated ourselves from those who should be our natural allies in the EC and who were on the other side in the vote on this occasion, Greece and Denmark.  I find quite unconvincing the assurances given by the Taoiseach and by Senator Dooge in today's <i>Irish Times</i> that Irish neutrality is not threatened by these developments.</P>
    <P>The Franco-German proposal indicated what is concerned in a treaty on European political co-operation and foreign policy co-ordination is the political and economic aspects of security.  We have always believed that genuine neutrality involves far more than simply staying out of military alliances.  Genuine neutrality means the development, protection and promotion of an independent foreign policy which takes a line which is totally independent of military blocs. Nobody is going to take our neutrality very seriously if we say we are not going to join NATO but we will support and promote the political line of our EC partners, all of whom happen to be members of NATO.  That sort of neutrality is of least possible value.  It offers us least protection in time of war and greatly reduces whatever international standing and respect we have enjoyed up to this among other neutral and non-aligned nations.</P>
    <P>This is already happening.  Our independent foreign policy is now succumbing to EC foreign policy.  On repeated occasions here in the past few years, we have addressed questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs asking what Ireland's position is on Central America, South <Col N="140" /> Africa, or the Middle East or what the Government had done on any of these international problems.  We have been told in reply what the EC position is and what the Ten have agreed.  Incidentally, this has been the position under both Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments. Soon we shall have no independent foreign policy.  This process is likely to be accelerated if the Community proceeds with the establishment of a full time political secretariat, to co-ordinate foreign policy between EC members.  Are we soon, then, going to have EC ambassadors representing us in parts of the world where we have no embassies at present?</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last week, the Dooge report has implications in many other areas, apart from our neutrality.  As the Taoiseach has now accepted the principle of a Conference of Governments, with the Dooge report as the agenda, can he now inform the House whether the Government accept the section of the Dooge report which says that a majority of the committee favours the adoption of the new general principle that decisions must be taken by qualified or simple majority?  I take it the majority of the committee is the same majority as in Milan &mdash; seven to three &mdash; and that we were one of the seven.  Does that mean that we have accepted, the adoption of the new general principle that decisions must be taken by qualified or simple majority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, if the Conference of Governments accept the Dooge report and set about its implementation, and if he has examined any possible areas of conflict with our Constitution. Will he submit the new proposals &mdash; to amend the Treaty of Rome, basically &mdash; to a referendum of the Irish people <Col N="141" /> before he agrees to them on our behalf? Since the Treaty of Rome was put to the people in a referendum and was incorporated in our Constitution, an amendment of it should surely be put to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must repeat that the Ten nations of the EC do not constitute Europe, no matter how many times the semantics in &ldquo;Community speak&rdquo; may try to persuade us that they do.  The Workers' Party welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC, but remember also the nations which have chosen to remain outside the Community &mdash; neutral nations, the northern nations and the socialist states whose social system excludes them from membership. A united Europe of the future will have to include all these countries on the basis of peace, democracy and mutual respect. There is a dangerous tendency within the EC to think in terms of the Community as the second capitalist superpower and economic and military bloc in confrontation with the East.  This type of thinking can only increase tensions and the dangers of war.  Surely our job should be to maintain close contact with the other neutral nations and through them to work for peace and co-operation between all European states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one wonders if the farmers ever paid tax.  I speak here for the small, rural farmers in the West of Ireland and, in particular, for the hill farmers who have many thousands of acres of mountain farms.  I wonder how many acres of mountain land will be needed to represent an adjusted acre? When one is talking about the mountains in Counties Sligo and Leitrim, it would take many such acres to compare with one prime acre of Irish land.  I represent the hill farmers and it is they about whom I am really concerned.  I would like to tell their critics how many hours a week such farmers work.  Farming is a family job and these farmers work between 90 and 100 hours a week.  Anybody working that kind of hours is making a good job of it.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about those who have reclaimed land.  How will their acreage be adjusted?  Many reclaimed land which ten years ago was of poor quality but today those farmers, who got grants under the farm modernisation scheme, have land which might look good but certainly will need to be maintained periodically.  That is why I am speaking on this debate.</P>
      <P>How long will it take the Commissioner and his staff to classify the land of Ireland?  It will take at least ten years before this farm tax can be implemented. As some speaker said, if we are to take roads and boreens, ditches and laneways into account, it will take a very long time, indeed, before the adjusted acres are classified.  I can see no farmer paying tax on that basis for at least ten years.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that this Bill is before the House, because the best way for farmers to pay tax is as they have done in previous years, and that is what should be done.  Farmers with over 80 acres will have to pay two taxes, on an account system and an adjusted acre system.  Why single them out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Bill.  There is absolutely no doubt in the <Col N="143" /> minds of any persons outside the agricultural or farming sector that there is greater need for tax equity to ensure that the agricultural sector make a reasonable and equitable contribution towards meeting the national expenditure and adding their fair share to the tax collected.  We have heard much in recent years about the need for tax equity.  Everyone, including the farming community apparently, believes in that provided it does not mean they should have to contribute additional money in taxation.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency in which the majority of the people are PAYE workers. They regard themselves as overtaxed and, rightly or wrongly, they hold the view that the farming community are not making a reasonable contribution towards the expenditure of the State and are certainly not making a reasonable tax contribution.  That is a feeling held not only by PAYE workers but by many self-employed people who run small businesses. In the throes of what is a deep economic recession they find themselves faced with tax obligations which many of them have to struggle to meet.  They met those obligations but they see the farming community cocking a snook at people in other sections of the community and apparently adopting the attitude that they should not make any reasonable contribution towards the tax take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on all sides of this House would like to see a reduction in the levels of taxation.  All of us hold that aspiration. The difficulty that exists is in meeting the daily expenditure of running a country, a country that is spending a great deal more <i>per capita</i> than it takes by way of taxation on all fronts, not only by way of income tax but also VAT and other taxes.  Taxation is a necessary, if unpopular, means of running a country and every section has a moral obligation to make a contribution. No group should abdicate that obligation on the one hand while, on the other hand, holding its hand out, roaring whenever a grant is abolished or changed. It should not hold out the begging bowl to Brussels while being unwilling to make <Col N="144" /> a realistic financial contribution towards the running of the State.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the money collected by way of taxation and there are many myths about the amounts. Interesting figures are available which illustrate clearly that not merely have the farming community not made an equitable proportionate contribution towards the financial running of the State but that the tax paid by that sector has reduced at a dramatic rate and this at a time when all other sections have had increased income tax bills.  I will give some figures relating to the PAYE sector in respect of their contribution by way of income tax.  These tell their own story.  In 1978 the PAYE sector paid by way of income tax the sum of £524 million; in 1979 the figure was £648 million; in 1980 it was £878 million; in 1981 it was £1,093 million; in 1982 it was £1,269 million; in 1983 it was £1,423 million and in 1984 the figure was £1,682 million.  That figure needs repeating.</P>
    <P>During that period self-employed people, excluding farmers, found that their contributions by way of income tax had increased proportionately due to the financial circumstances of the nation.  As a sector in its entirety, the self-employed group is maligned.  It is popular on the political hustings to condemn totally everyone in self-employment and presume that they are not making a reasonable contribution towards the tax take. Often we forget the many people employed in this sector and the fact that we rely on them to create new jobs.  The figures in respect of self-employed persons, excluding farmers, were as follows: in 1978 income tax receipts were £50 million; in 1979 the figure was £42 million &mdash; there was a decrease here I do not understand; in 1980 the figure was £72 million; in 1981 it was £86 million; in 1982 it was £106 million; in 1983 it was £133 million and in 1984 it was £152 million. These figures show there was a clear increase in tax from PAYE workers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>What about the farming community? At a time when this State is deeply in debt, when each of us is faced with paying increased income tax necessitated by the <Col N="145" /> level of indebtedness, what have the farming community done towards easing the burden on the State?  What has the tax system done towards giving some degree of equity in the tax contributions from farmers and those received from the rest of the community?  Again, the figures tell their own story.  In 1978 the farming community contributed £36 million by way of total tax receipts; in 1979 the figure was £49 million; in 1980 it was £60.4 million.  What did they contribute in 1984?.  A sum of £35 million, £25 million less than was contributed in 1980. There has been an absolute reduction to the tune of £25 million at a time when every other sector of the community has had to make a higher contribution than they made in preceding years.  I do not think anyone can suggest that that is indicative of an attitude or approach on the part of the farming community that they are willing to participate in this State to the extent of recognising the obligations of participation as well as the benefits of participation.</P>
    <P>The farming community cannot simply regard the taxpayers of Ireland as always being there to assist in the provision of grants and services and to keep the State running while their major function within this country is to receive grants from Brussels and grants domestically through whatever Government are in power. There must be both the rights of being a party to this State and the obligations attached to it, and I do not believe that any person who finds himself within the PAYE net at present would regard as acceptable the current level of taxation contributed by the farming community.</P>
    <P>I find extraordinary the comments of the Leader of the Opposition before the election.  He is against tax of all descriptions. He is going to ease income tax, repeal farm tax, presumably change capital gains tax and relieve all of us of a massive tax burden while spending something in the region of £500 million on State services.  This is a magical conjuring trick.  He may have convinced himself he can perform this trick but I have grave doubts as to whether ultimately, when the financial implications of some of the <Col N="146" /> things said by the Leader of the Opposition are examined seriously away from the brouhaha of the election atmosphere, any of what he said can be treated as a serious financial policy for this State.  In ten days prior to the local elections he said, effectively, that, as far as he is concerned, the farming community was paying sufficient, and probably paying too much tax.  We had the ultimate electoral charade being acted out in the days preceding 20 June with the urban members of the Opposition party knocking on doors and telling people, &ldquo;If you elect us we will reduce the PAYE burden&rdquo; and we had all the rural Deputies running around like hares on a spit telling the farming community, &ldquo;In no circumstances will we permit a farm tax and if this Government introduce the legislation we will repeal it&rdquo;.  That was the ultimate form of political cynicism and political dishonesty that I have seen in any election campaign.  It would be a tragedy if the people of this country in the context of a general election fell for that sort of nonsense.  The figures clearly give the lie to that sort of approach &mdash; £35 million contributed in total tax receipts by the farming community in 1984 when, in 1980, £60 million was contributed and when the self-employed in all other sectors and the PAYE sector were paying a greatly increased sum by way of tax.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt there is a need for a form of taxation to ensure that the farming community makes an adequate and equitable contribution to the Exchequer.  The need for tax reform in the area of farmer taxation is something that has been debated over the years. There has been a variety of different comments about the need to ensure that the farming community makes a reasonable contribution towards the tax take.  There have been for many years complaints from the farming community about the type of tax system to which they found themselves subjected.  We all know what the objections were to the system based on rateable valuation, which was found to be unconstitutional in our courts.  That system operated in tandem with the <Col N="147" /> accounts system which we have at present.  Since the rateable valuation system has gone we have in this House received many representations from the farming community to the effect that the accounts system should be changed.  We have heard a great deal about the need to provide an alternative type of system.</P>
    <P>Joe Rea, the President of the IFA, made an interesting contribution to the debate as far back as 12 May 1979, when he was interviewed by <i>The Irish Farmers Journal.</i>  It seems to be an interview that Mr. Rea has forgotten about in the heat of the public debate that has been taking place in recent weeks.  He has been suffering from a form of political amnesia that does not do him credit and indeed, I would suggest, casts great doubts on the credibility of much of what he has been saying.  We all recognise that Mr. Rea has to fight his corner as representing a sectional interest, but it is a curious corner he is fighting and it is a curious way he is fighting it when one looks at some of the comments that were made by him in that article.  He was asked.</P>
    <P>How can you ensure that a tax code will give the Government the yield they are looking for, while at the same time providing an incentive to farmers to develop their enterprises?</P>
    <P>The yield, of course, being the yield of taxation which Mr. Rea at that time considered the Government would regard as equitable to be contributed by farmers. Incidentally, the yield he talked about in this article and seemed to accept was a sum of £100 million.  In reply to that he said:</P>
    <P>I consider that the system of a flat rate tax which I am proposing is an ideal form of taxation because it rewards the farmer who works.  Agriculture is the oil of this country and it is in everybody's interest to have a prosperous agriculture.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to talk about the simple flat rate formula he was proposing and says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> All I am saying is let us have tax &mdash; a flat rate of tax on an adjusted acreage basis.  From the point of view of equity we do not want to bring people who obviously do not have a taxable income into the tax net.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that effectively a flat rate tax based on a concept of adjusted acres was the type of tax that he regarded as equitable, the type of tax that he thought should be supported, the type of tax that in 1979 Mr. Rea was proposing. Further on in the article he is asked whether he sees this tax as an interim solution leading to discussions on more comprehensive tax measures and Mr. Rea gives the historical comment that he did not see it as an interim solution at all, that he would see this as the final solution to the problem.  He said:</P>
    <P>I would see this as the final solution for the problem.  I think it would give Irish farmers a unique opportunity in the whole European context in that they would have a better taxation base to enable them to compete on EEC markets with their competitors.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>We would all love to have a taxation system under which none of us had to pay anything but it is quite obvious that this is not acceptable.  So either we devise a system that gives the Government a sum which they consider to be a &ldquo;yield in line&rdquo; or what will happen &mdash; as it has already happened &mdash; is that they will devise a system which will hammer the industry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rea in 1979 acknowledged that it was not acceptable for the farming community to pay no tax or little or no tax.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that his system would give a farmer security in the sense that he would know what his tax bill would be and that it would &ldquo;take the whole antagonism out of the tax debate as farmers would be seen to be contributing their fair share of tax&rdquo;.  He goes on in the same article to say that we are an interdependent community and:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> We want to remove the divisive force of tax from the area of national debate on development.  I think that the majority of farmers will support my proposals when they are fully explained to them.  Most farmers simply want to farm, not to be messing with accounts.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rea was advocating a flat rate tax system based on the adjusted acre and explained all the reasons why the farming community did not want a system based on accounts.  This measure will provide a flat rate system of the kind Mr. Rea specifically proposed for farmers with between 20 and 80 adjusted acres.  Farmers with over 80 adjusted acres will be entitled to deduct the amount of money they would pay under this tax from any income tax liability over and above that.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from a point of view which has no sympathy with farmers who have to do accounts and pay for the expense of so doing.  Mr. Rea regards the type of system provided here as superior. This provision for farmers with between 20 and 80 adjusted acres will obviate the necessity to do accounts and to incur expenditure to pay accountants to certify accounts.  Will the farming community not &ldquo;cop on&rdquo; to itself and realise that it is the only community that does not have to prepare accounts?  A small businessman running a sweet shop on his own in a poor section of Dublin must keep accounts and pay an accountant to certify them.  This is a normal business expense no matter whether one is a small shopkeeper or a multinational company.  Keeping accounts is a means of ascertaining what expenses and income one has and what proportion of one's income is liable to tax.</P>
    <P>This legislation extends a privilege to farmers with between 20 and 80 adjusted acres which many a small businessman would be delighted to have.  I do not understand it.  The brouhaha is not about the type of system but, to take Mr. Rea's words, many people &mdash; farmers in the context of this debate &mdash; would much prefer not to pay tax at all.  We would all prefer not to pay tax but the problem is <Col N="150" /> the State would cease to function.  The Members of the Opposition are as aware of that as I am, though they would pretend this is not the case.  Much of the hysteria surrounding the publication of this legislation is from the farming community whose contribution to Exchequer returns fell dramatically between 1980 and 1984.  This is due to the fact that they would prefer not to have to make an equitable contribution towards the Exchequer.  That is something which the House cannot support.</P>
    <P>It is curious that the Opposition would oppose this Bill knowing that it would result in some degree of equity in the taxation system and would take a small portion of the burden imposed by tax on the PAYE sector off their backs.  Apparently Fianna Fáil want to ensure that the PAYE worker is required to continue to pay tax at the current rate and want to increase the level of taxation they must pay in the future while providing the farming community with a protective mechanism and statutory exemption from making a contribution to the Exchequer on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will result in a greater degree of equity in the tax system.  Like everyone else, I recognise the importance of the agricultural sector to the community. I recognise that a prosperous agricultural sector is essential for our prosperity and that farming efficiency is essential for the prosperity of agriculture.  To that extent this Bill provides incentives to farmers who do not properly utilise their land to do so.  I bear no ill-will towards farmers.  I would not like my remarks today to be misread as suggesting any inbuilt antagonism.  I am making the point that every other sector is making a contribution to the tax net of a nature distinctly different to the farming community.  At a time of economic difficulty the farmers' contribution has dropped to a degree which is not acceptable to other workers.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that the debate on this Bill has developed the tone that it has as a result of Mr. Rea's contribution as opposed to the more responsible approach taken by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and their <Col N="151" /> involvement in constructive debate and discussion as opposed to hysterical public comment.  I hope the Bill works and will not be perceived by any farmer as a form of threat.  I deeply regret that, before the measure was debated and before we had scrutinised its contents, the Leader of the Opposition saw fit to announce that he would repeal it if enacted.  That is creating an environment which suggests that, if people do not pay on foot of the Bill when it is enacted, on their return to office Fianna Fáil will have some form of amnesty in relation to any payments which may have been due from the time of the passage of the Bill until their return.  When the majority of the electorate clue in to what Fianna Fáil are at, their return to office will be less likely than some Members opposite may think at present.</P>

      <P>I hope we will have a responsible Committee Stage and that when enacted the Bill will achieve the result outlined by the Minister and will be seen by all sections in the community, including the farming community, as an equitable measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point with which I could express any level of agreement in any of the public comment which has been made is that I am somewhat concerned with the definition of an adjusted acre and how that is determined.  I am looking at this as a lawyer and see great difficulties.  It is a complex concept, as defined in section 2 of the Bill.  I have no doubt it will be teased out on Committee Stage.  For this legislation to work that is a concept which must be understandable and about which there must be no ambiguity.  It is well explained in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, but when one gets down to the nitty gritty of the concept one wonders what some of it means.  On Committee Stage we may have to tease out that section to some extent in order to ensure that, on the enactment of this legislation, it does not <Col N="152" /> provide a definition that is so amorphous as to render it impossible to make any sense of it or to apply it in practice.  That is an area we must consider carefully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle and I trust the Opposition will adopt a more responsible approach to it.  If they are to continue on the line of simply pretending that the farming community are currently making an equitable contribution to the tax net, they should come clean on two matters during this debate.  They should tell the farmers whether, Fianna Fáil in the event of their being returned to office and repealing the legislation, would envisage the income tax position remaining exactly as it is, or whether they would produce an alternative type of tax that would apply to the agricultural sector, a similar system but described differently. If, say, Fianna Fáil are returned to office within three to six years, will they enforce the provisions of the legislation or, if not, what line will be taken in regard to arrears that will have accrued?</P>

People in the PAYE category are very interested in hearing Fianna Fáil's replies to these questions.

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) In the light of the waffle we have had from Deputy Shatter in the past half hour, I could not find someone better than he should I seek someone to assist me in opposing this Bill.  The Bill offers no assistance to those people about whom Deputy Shatter is so concerned &mdash; the PAYE sector.  Indeed, the purpose of this Bill is the reverse, as I will illustrate during my contribution.  The Deputy must have a very short memory because only two weeks ago his party, not only in rural Ireland but in Dublin city, were shattered at the local elections.  Urban and rural people have abandoned both Labour and Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have spoken fairly and positively on their approach to this type of legislation.  I agree with Deputy Shatter on the question of what is an adjusted acre and I shall refer to that later.  When the Bill was published on June 7, I refused to comment publicly on it.  The attitude of my party was already well known.  It was stated publicly on many occasions since the Bill was first mentioned in <i>Building on Reality.</i>  Building on unreality would be a more appropriate title.  I found no reason to add to the statements made by us at that time, particularly in view of the proximity of the local authority elections because we did not wish the legislation to be debated in a city versus country context, the very approach that Deputy Shatter has adopted this evening.  That approach will only create a further rift between city and rural people.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) I did not interrupt the Deputy so perhaps he will extend me the courtesy of listening to what I have to say.  Apparently the Government had none of the kinds of reservations outlined by Deputy Shatter <Col N="155" /> though, judging from the contributions of Government members so far, they encourage that approach.  The timing of the Government's announcement seems to be a callous and cynical effort to create an impression among urban people that the Government are doing something about taxing the farmers.  That ploy has backfired on them.  Candidates representing both Government parties, but particularly Labour, were widely defeated not only in rural areas but in the cities.  The question of the taxation of farmers is an emotive one especially in urban areas where the bulk of the country's PRSI taxpayers live.  It suits some elements in society to fan these emotions from time to time.  Among these I would include The Workers' Party, Labour Party Ministers, the trade unions and not least the Dublin dominated Labour-Fine Gael Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) Time and again we hear calls for farmers to pay their fair share of tax, as if the farming community were engaged in a conspiracy to avoid their income tax liabilities.  Of course, such calls are understandable in view of the huge tax burden borne by PAYE workers but do not take into account the real situation in farming today.  The fact of the matter is that most Irish farmers earn far less than those on wages or in salaried employment and those who do pay their taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year, since the taxation of farmers on the basis of annual accounts became law, the yield from the farming sector has increased.  This year and next year, as more and more farmers are brought into the tax net, the yield will increase even further.  Most experts agree with Professor Brendan Walsh in his assessment that the present income tax system, if still in force in 1986, will yield approximately £60 million.  Why then do this Government insist on replacing that system with a land tax that is patently inequitable and is expected to yield no <Col N="156" /> more than the figure I have just mentioned? Why introduce a retrograde tax, one that has no regard for enterprise, quotas, personal circumstances, ability to pay, for young farmers and for the state of development of our farms nationwide? If a similar system were applied to the urban population there would be a revolution. It is no surprise that farmers are up in arms about this land tax.  I repeat, it is not their fear of being taxed.  Their resentment is because this tax is not operable, is inequitable and unjust.  That is why our farmers and the farming organisations are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House some figures which will display the inequity of the proposed tax.  For instance, a farmer in dairying on 70 adjusted acres, let us say, earning £185 per adjusted acre will be in receipt of a total income of £13,000.  Let us suppose this farmer is married with three children and has no borrowings. Under the proposed land tax his liability would be £700.  Yet, under the present income tax code, he would be liable to pay £3,115.  To put that into perpective, the tax liability of a PAYE taxpayer earning £13,000, also married with three children, would be £2,805.  Where is the tax equity in that about which Deputy Shatter speaks?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) The complaint is that it is an unjust tax, it is unworkable, that farmers are not afraid of being taxed but rather want to be taxed on their incomes.  If some farmers are evading tax that is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) I might give another example: a farmer with 70 adjusted acres, with an income of <Col N="157" /> £13,000, married with five children and with borrowings of upwards of £50,000, will be liable to land tax at a figure of £700 whereas his liability under the existing income tax code would be £420.  Where is the equity in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is many a person in the PAYE sector who would love to have borrowings of £50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) A single farmer, without borrowing, earning £13,000, like his married conterpart, would be liable to £700 land tax but under the existing income tax code, he would be liable to £4,667.  Where is the equity in that?  I am talking about equity as between one farmer and another, whereas previously I spoke about equity as between farmers and other sections of the community.  I could continue to list obvious examples that would demonstrate the inequity of the land tax but my point has been proven.</P>
      <P>Anyway I doubt that equity was the aim of the Government in drafting this Bill.  It is obvious that the land tax is an exercise in yield-targeting in preference to any attempt at achieving tax equity and yield-targetting is a dangerous and undesirable precedent to create.  The ability to pay principle plays second fiddle to the objective of securing an overall revenue target.</P>
      <P>The Government's economic advisers, the National Economic and Social Council in their report entitled &ldquo;Economic and Social Policy Assessment&rdquo; of January 1985 had this to say at paragraph 3.44 under the heading of Farm Taxation:</P>
      <P>It is the Council's view that the adaption of yield targetting would be a unsatisfactory basis for designing tax arrangements and could set an undesirable precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same report the NESC says that the existing system gives rise to practical problems in terms of administration, collection and of compliance by taxpayers, but argues that the Government should have sought to resolve these problems by identifying farmers' incomes within the <Col N="158" /> income tax code.  We and our party leader have said time and again: let us put resources into the deployment of the existing Revenue Commissioners and if there are farmers who are dodging income tax, let the Revenue Commissioners get after them.  We advocated that a tax system such as is now proposed should not be implemented.</P>
    <P>While criticising the Government for failing to make comparisons between the yield from the new land tax and the amount the present taxation system would yield in 1986 the NESC, in that same report, confirm their previously stated view that farming profits should be taxed on the basis of actual accounts based on the ability to pay principle.  The NESC see the new tax as a hiccup in the system at a time when arrangements governing the taxation of farming profits have been moving toward a situation of greater equity within farming and the community as a whole.  There is no need for me to add anything to that NESC Report.  Their comments speak for themselves. Instead let me turn to the concept of an adjusted acre and to the question of the assessment of farms.  I am sorry that Deputy Shatter has left the House because I could have given him a few lessons on adjusted acreage.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation believe that it would take up to 15 years to complete a proper soil survey on which to base valuations.  The Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 June 1968 had the following to say:</P>
    <P>This study of a microcosm of Irish agricultural land makes it quite clear that this 155-year old valuation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;referring to the Griffith PLV &mdash;</P>
    <P>...is completely unsuitable as a basis for taxation today, and that if rates on agricultural land are to be maintained, it would be necessary to organise a review of valuations around the country, based on a programme of preparation of soil maps and crop productivity, which is not in fact being undertaken at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) As no doubt the Taoiseach is aware, rates on agricultural land were found to be unconstitutional by Mr. Justice Donal Barrington. Yet the Taoiseach now persists in bringing forward a land tax Bill, which he refers to as a Farm Tax Bill, but which to all intents and purposes is merely the imposition of agricultural rates under a new guise.  Will this tax not be found to be unconstitutional also?  There is simply no way that the 100 redeployed Land Commission staff and, indeed, the other 100 land tax adjustors recruited for the purpose, could adequately survey every farm of 20 acres or more.  On my calculations &mdash; by reference to the agricultural statistics compiled by An Foras Talúntais &mdash; approximately 154,000 farms will have to be visited, surveyed and assessed.  That works out at 770 farms for each one of those unfortunate adjustors.  Even if they were to work night an day for the next two years, they would not manage to fulfil that task.  In the meantime, if this Government have their way, the Farm Tax Bill will be in operation by 1986.</P>
      <P>As Des Maguire pointed out in his &ldquo;Farm Talk&rdquo; column in the <i>Sunday World</i> of 16 June 1985:</P>
      <P>It will be perfectly in order, if this Bill goes through in its present form, for some faceless civil servant in Dublin to classify and levy tax on a farm in Belmullet or Limerick without ever walking the lands in question and assessing their productive capacity.  So much for equity, fairness and balance &mdash; This is tax by remote control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine the outcry there would be if Government decreed that every employee in a manufacturing industry from the managing director down to the humble yard sweeper should pay a single level of tax on the basis of hours worked, irrespective of their earnings.  That is why the farming community is up in arms about the land tax.  It is a blunt instrument that hits everyone with equal ferocity, without regard to their ability to protect <Col N="160" /> themselves.</P>
    <P>Getting back to adjusted acreage, there is no scientific basis for deciding what constitutes the value or production capacity of land.  The Minister did not outline this in his opening address and I doubt if he would be able to outline it in his closing address.  Yet the Government are sending 200 unfortunate adjustors literally into the field to make such a decision.  It will be purely their personal opinion that will decide the level of adjustments.  The appeals system will undoubtedly be snowed under with cases. The courts are also likely to be busy with this incredible legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the history of this Bill and some of the fallacies upon which it is founded.  The Land Tax Bill was formally announced by this Government in a book entitled <i>Building on Reality</i> at the end of 1984.  That book might have been more aptly titled &ldquo;The Pipe Dreamers HandBook&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2 of <i>Building on Reality,</i> page 31 tells us that</P>
    <P>The central economic and social priority in the period of the plan is to tackle the unemployment crisis.  Economic policies have been framed with the objective of securing the maximum growth in employment during the period to 1987...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Looking at page 26 of the same book, one sees that in 1984 the number employed in agriculture is given as 186,000.  At the end of the period of the plan, 1987 one will note that &ldquo;employment growth&rdquo; in agriculture will leave 177,000 employed in agriculture.  This means a cut in employment of 9,000 persons.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that in 1971, the year prior to our EC entry, there were 273,000 persons employed in the agricultural sector.  The source of that statistic is the AFT Dairy Herd Management, 1978, page 5.  There were only 65,000 persons unemployed in 1971.  In the first ten years of EC membership 71,000 full time farmers have abandoned agriculture.  They did not do this because <Col N="161" /> agriculture was profitable, but on the contrary. They were economically forced out.  This process is still continuing, and will continue, as is acknowledged in the plan.</P>
    <P>Do this Government expect the ordinary man in the street to believe that 9,000 full time farmers will stop farming over the next three years because farming is profitable?  The stark truth is that relatively few farming enterprises are profitable and the Government's own statisticians, so beloved and oft quoted by the Taoiseach, continually endorse this fact.  It is high time that the facts about agricultural incomes were given to the citizens of this State.  It is also high time that the primary sources of misleading statistics regarding farming incomes were identified.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office publish annually a figure which represents &ldquo;Income from Self Employment and Other Trading Incomes&rdquo; in agriculture. In 1983 the CSO say that this amounted to £1,079 million.  From this total national agricultural income, deductions for building depreciation and interest payments must be made.  This would then leave something in the region of £700 million to £750 million for distribution between about 190,000 full time farmers and in the region of 50,000 part time farmers. Remember, part time farmers are being taxed via PAYE in their principal employment with their farming profits included.  It can be safely assumed that at least ten per cent and maybe as much as fifteen per cent of the total agricultural income goes to the part-time farmers.</P>
    <P>This would indicate that the average full time farmer in 1983 had an income of less than £3,500.  In the same year, the average industrial wage was approximately £7,100, while the average public servant earned £10,600.</P>
    <P>Even though our CSO compiled income data for all sectors of the economy, they never published an average full time farmer income value (in figures). They did not however restrict themselves from reporting in 1983 that farmers income rose by 14 per cent.  Similarly in 1982 they reported a rise of 22.8 per cent <Col N="162" /> and in 1981 a rise of 14.4 per cent.  It is little wonder the ordinary citizen felt that farmers were doing just fine.</P>
    <P>The other primary source of agricultural statistics is An Foras Talúntais but for some reason the CSO and AFT statistics for the same subjects show up glaring differences.  In some cases this can be put down to selective use of certain data relating to basic farming input costs.  For example, on Table 65 of the Farm Management Survey, AFT shows that the average full time only dairying farmer, farming 73.4 acres or 65.4 acres adjusted, would only require £1,097 to cover the farm portion of the cost of his car plus electricity and telephone.  The Minister for Agriculture however, in answer to my Dáil question on 11 June last said that in 1983 members of his Departmental staff using their own motor on State business for say 4,000 miles received £1,972.  One or other figure must be wrong.</P>
    <P>A further example of questionable statistical accounting arises if one examines the depreciation charges given by the institute.  On Table 63 of the AFT survey, the average machinery depreciation charge to the average 53.3 acre farm is £434.  This works out at £8.14 per acre. However, the CSO data estimates the average depreciation charge to lie in the region of £20 per acre.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, on the question of interest charges on farmers the banks say the average charge is £20 per acre whereas the institute say it is £9.40 per acre.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the institute state that a female can aspire to being only two-thirds of a labour unit at maturity.  This obviously exaggerates the income per labour unit on farms.  I tell the Minister that that is true.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): AFT. The institute's average full time farmer income would, as a consequence of the above, lie in the region of £5,770 or £6,490, more than the CSO derived value of £3,500.</P>
      <P>The anomalies in farm income values published by the AFT and the CSO have been the main cause of urban (PAYE) dissatisfaction with the income tax take from farmers over the last ten years.  The lack of credibility in the official statistics could not have been ignored by the Department of Finance, when they found out in 1982, 1983 and 1984 that the tax yield expected did not materialise.</P>
      <P>By mid-1984 it was abundantly clear that farm incomes had been seriously overestimated.  By 1984 over 44,000 farms were on the Revenue Commissioners' files.  These larger farms represented approximately half the farmed area in the State or 5.5 million acres based on the 1975 CSO census.  It would also have been clear to the Revenue Commissioners that the tax yield per acre for 1983-84 would lie in the region of under £6.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance obviously decided that it would be futile to proceed with the accounts system for the remaining smaller 90,000 farms.  The stage of diminishing returns had been reached.  A new approach was needed, and so we have the new Farm Tax Bill.  Farmers' incomes were irrelevant; the Exchequer's tax appetite was all-important.</P>
      <P>It is pertinent to remind the House of replies given by the Minister for Finance to several questions put to him by me on 11 June last as in the Official Report Volume 359.</P>
      <P>Question No. 73 was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance the estimated average income of the full time farmers among the 44,194 in the income tax net on accounts in 1983-84.</P>
      <P>and No. 74 was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Finance the actual average income found on accounts for the full time farmers <Col N="164" /> among the 44,194 in the income tax net on accounts in 1983-84.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied, taking both questions together, as follows at column 1004:</P>
    <P>Mr. Dukes: Statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given...</P>
    <P>In reply to Question No. 77 on the same date, 11 June, when asked to compare AFT and CSO data with that of the Department of Finance, the Minister stated at column 1006:</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not compile data on actual farm incomes. It is not possible, therefore, to draw meaningful comparisons between income assessed by the Revenue Commissioners in the course of tax collection and income data compiled by An Foras Talúntais and the CSO for other purposes.</P>
    <P>On the same day Deputy Dukes in reply to Question No. 80 asking the number of full time farmers on accounts who had no taxable income for 1983-84 stated at column 1006:</P>
    <P>The information requested is not available.  As revenue records do not distinguish between liable and nonliable cases it is not possible to indicate how many full time farmers had no taxable incomes without examining each individual case assessed.  Such an examination, which would involve more than 36,000 cases, could not be carried out without the expenditure of undue time and resources.</P>
    <P>That was the official answer, yet the same Minister on 16 May last told a large group of farmers at the Red House in County Kildare that 12,000 of those same 36,000 farmers had no taxable income.  When I asked him for the information in the Dáil he said the figures were not available. Where is he going?</P>
    <P>Two other questions, Nos. 78 and 79, were answered by the Minister for Finance on 11 June.  Question No. 78 asked for the &ldquo;total acreage farmed by full time <Col N="165" /> farmers on accounts in 1983-84&rdquo; and Question No. 79 asked &ldquo;the income per acre and the income tax yield per acre in 1983-84 of those full time farmers on accounts&rdquo;.  Taking questions Nos. 78 and 79 together, the Minister replied at column 1006:</P>
    <P>Income tax on farming profits has never been assessed by reference to the acreage of the land farmed. Accordingly it is not possible to provide the information sought.</P>
    <P>If we summarise the answers given by the Minister, Deputy Dukes, on 11 June last, we have the following information: (a) the Department of Finance have no idea of the income per acre on Irish farms; (b) the Revenue Commissioners have not compiled data on farm incomes; and (c) the CSO and AFT do collect farmer income data, but this data is collected for purposes other than ascertaining actual farm incomes.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the admitted incompleteness of their knowledge, this Government on page 123, Section 6.16 of <i>Building on Reality</i> propose a new method of taxing farm incomes based on a new concept &mdash; the adjusted acre.  This the Government state will take equity into account.  Equity will be achieved according to the plan at £10 per adjusted acre in 1986.  Is it really necessary to point out the absolute stupidity of this proposal as a move towards tax equity?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, indicated some days after the plan was published that the land tax proposed would free farmers from the trouble and expense of keeping accounts and paying accountants.  He advised that they, the farmers, should accept the proposals.  He was saying to farmers, &ldquo;You pay this £10 per acre and you will be left alone to get on with your business&rdquo;.  In the US an organisation called the Mafia have another name for this kind of payment; it is called protection money.</P>
    <P>There is a written Constitution in this State, which prohibits such bizarre concepts as are outlined in this Bill.  The proposed land tax is alleged to be an income tax but income tax is a tax on <Col N="166" /> income.  Farm income can only be calculated mathematically using accounts for past events.  This Bill is proposing that income can be prophesised in an equitable manner for 180,000 people and their families.  It is an insult to the intelligence of fair-minded people.  The Government seem intent to engage in a bout of asset stripping of farmers for short term political gain, even at the risk of jeopardising the nation's best prospects of working its way out of the recession.  This is not good government but a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>Paul Tansey, the economic correspondent of <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> in his &ldquo;Money Matters&rdquo; column on 7 April last said the land tax proposal was nothing more than a Coalition solution to a Coalition problem.  It was not so much a tax, he said, it was more a way of cementing the two Government parties together for a further three years.  That is what it is. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>the Labour Party, who like to tax farmers and the wealthy in principle, were satisfied that a farm tax &mdash; any farm tax &mdash; had been included in the national plan.</P>
    <P>So this Bill is another sop to Labour to prop up this unpopular Government.  The irony is that what is proposed is not a farm tax but a land tax, a revival of agricultural rates.  It is not an income tax but a resource tax.  No self-respecting Labour socialist could justify such a tax without hiding behind the monetarist cloak of Fine Gael.  As the local elections showed, that is a very transparent cloak.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) I said earlier that this was not a farm tax but a land tax.  I am glad to note that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, shares my view on this.  He made clear his objections to the proposed tax by refusing to allow his Department or his officials to be involved in the preparation or implementation of the tax.  The Minister sees how it would inhibit him.  He will also have seen how impractical the land tax is and how dangerous it is for Irish agriculture.  He knows that the notion of capacity to earn varies, not according to the land in question but according to the enterprise engaged in by the farmer in question.  He knows too that capacity to earn is now governed by production quotas on milk and cereals and is likely soon to be governed by a quota on beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) Let us examine how capacity to earn is governed by the enterprise involved.  An adjusted acre of land for dairying is capable of providing an income of £161, on which the tax liability under the proposed land tax would be £10.  The same adjusted acre of land, used for dry stock farming, will return only £64, of which £10 will also be charged for land tax, or perhaps the figure will be £25 next year.  A hill sheep and cattle farmer can expect to receive a return of £41 per adjusted acre, of which he will be liable for £10 in land tax.</P>
      <P>Taken as a percentage of gross income without any personal allowances, the dairy farmer will pay 6.2 per cent, a dry stock farmer 15.6 per cent and a hill farmer 24.4 per cent.  In urban terms, that is like fixing an hourly rate of tax at the same level for an executive earning £25,000 per annum and a manual worker earning £7,000 per annum, on the basis that each worked 40 hours per week.  Is that equity?</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) Is Deputy McLoughlin in favour of this measure?  A sad fact of this proposed tax is that it discriminates against the poor farmer and actually helps the rancher type.  Those are the people they want to tax.  The poor small farmer is being hindered and the bigger farmer is being let off the hook.  A typical farmer would farm, say, 48 adjusted acres in dairying or dry stock.  Under the existing income tax code, he rightly has no liability for taxation at present income levels, yet he will pay £480 a year land tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of 82 adjusted acres mainly devoted to dry stock.  The income return is below the exempted income tax threshold and there is no tax <Col N="169" /> liability, but those 82 acres will carry an £820 land tax penalty.  The hill sheep and cattle farmer will be hardest hit of all since his income, even from 125 adjusted acres, would not put him in the income tax bracket.  He simply would not and could not earn enough from that tough and demanding way of life, yet he will face a land tax bill of £1,250.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a full-time farmer on 70 acres of good land with earnings over £11,000 per annum and currently liable for income tax will now be liable only at the same level of land tax as the farmer with a gross income of £2,800.  Is that tax equity as between one farmer and another?</P>

      <P>Martin Ryan, a reputable agriculture correspondent of the <i>Limerick Leader,</i> recently pointed out that all calculations on land tax liability have been done on the basis of the tax being applied at £10 per adjusted acre and the acreage adjustment being applied on similar criteria to those used by the Agricultural Institute. He states:</P>
      <P>There is no assurance that the rate of tax will be retained at £10 per adjusted acre.  There is a concealed expression in the Government plan that the amount to be collected from the system will be dictated by `Government needs'.  Knowing that Governments never have a surplus of cash and the current serious shortfall is not likely to change in the foreseeable future, such a statement must be viewed with extreme caution.</P>

Administrative delays and difficulties which are preventing amounts of tax from not being collected from a small section of farmers should be rectified and the Government should see that this is done.  Unpaid tax by some farmers is not the fault of the general body of farmers and should not be used as an excuse for the imposition of a new inequitable tax. A land tax was not implied or even mentioned in the Fine Gael or Labour manifestos in November 1982 and they have no mandate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) In November 1982, when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Agriculture, he declared Fine Gael opposition to any new form of capital taxation on farmers to replace agricultural rates when they were finally phased out.  He also rejected the notion of a property tax on a productive asset and said that farmers should be taxed on the income they receive from their farms and that any subsequent profits should be taxed on the same basis as manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>In the chapter on taxation in the joint Programme for Government it is stated that in drawing up new tax proposals account will be taken of the cost of the care of dependent children.  Does this land tax take care of expenses in connection with dependent children?  In the 1983 budget debate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, said that public perception of tax equity demands that all income earners should be liable for tax on an equal footing.  Deputy Dukes also said, on 17 May 1983, that if farmers were allowed the option of a system under which taxable income would be based on standard results, the more profitable farmers would be systematically undertaxed while the less profitable would have to keep accounts to avoid excessive income tax charges.  He went on to say that a notional system of taxation for farmers would be inconsistent with the objective of treating all taxpayers on an equal basis.</P>

    <P>During the mid-seventies Deputy Garret FitzGerald proposed a 12 per cent levy on farm sales.  He said it was merely an option and the idea was that if we could raise about £120 million by these means we would be able to revalue the IR£ upwards against sterling by 5 per cent.  He said it would also mean that income tax could be reduced, an increase in food subsidies and an elimination of rates on private homes and agricultural holdings.  He also said in <i>Magill</i> in July 1979, that he was convinced that the inequities to which such a levy would give rise would offset the benefits that would accrue and, therefore, the proposal was rejected in favour of a straightforward <Col N="173" /> tax on farmers.

      <P>(<i>Limerick West:</i>) There is no guarantee either that the threshold of 80 adjusted acres will remain beyond year one of the land tax.  Minister Kavanagh did not give us any such guarantee.  As the IFA pointed out, the threshold for full income tax on accounts fell from £100 PLV to £40 PLV between 1974 and 1980 and was abolished completely in 1983. Nobody will give odds on the threshold remaining at 80 adjusted acres beyond 1987.  I doubt if Minister Kavanagh can give us such a guarantee.  The £10 and the 80 adjusted acre threshold is just the thin edge of the wedge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been informed by the Government's advertisements, paid for dearly by the taxpayers, that the land tax will relieve farmers with less than 80 adjusted acres from keeping accounts.  Is this something a responsible Government should promote?  Is it true that the Government require the keeping of <Col N="174" /> accounts anyway for the calculation of such things as health contributions &mdash; we did not hear anything from the Minister about that &mdash; and for income and youth employment levies?  If accounts are now not to be kept, how will these levies be calculated?  Will they be calculated on the basis of the adjusted acreage of the farm?</P>
    <P>It is sad to reflect that it took a decade or so to encourage farmers to prepare proper accounts in the interest of tax calculation and other purposes.  Farming, like any business, needs accounts kept properly to show where the enterprise is going.  This drive had the added bonus of providing farmers with some basic knowledge of how their business was performing. Now, with a wave of their land tax wand, the Government will consign most of the ledgers to the dust pile while at the same time removing many income tax payers from paying their fair share of tax on their income.</P>
    <P>The preparation of accounts, while difficult and possibly expensive, established good business practice among farmers and proved a useful management tool. How many farmers will now lapse into old ways and forget about their accounts? Another sad result of this short-sighted Bill is that the scope for development in the cattle sector, the only sector capable of increasing output in the quota-ridden agriculture industry today, is being inhibited from growth.  With a land tax bill to be paid from capital, the small and medium sized farmer simply will not have the capacity to invest in extra cattle.  I have called many times for the Government, as a matter of urgency and in the national interest, to do everything possible to restore our beef cow herd to its former level of 700,000; but instead, they have laid before us this Land Tax Bill which will effectively ensure that the beef cow population remains at its all-time low figure of 400,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the technical aspects of the Bill.  With regard to the provision that the owner of land let on conacre will be liable for tax, I should like the Minister to confirm if the tax payment will be allowed as a credit against rental income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> Concerning the publication of classification lists in public places, and in particular in Garda stations, I must protest strongly at this unwarranted invasion of privacy and urge the Minister to think again.  Posting such information publicly in rural Ireland is akin to having one's sins published on the church gate on a Sunday.  Shame on the Minister and the Government for bringing in this type of legislation in rural Ireland in 1985.  They are a disgrace.  The move is shortsighted.</P>
    <P>I note that there can be no appeal against tax demands, merely against the assessment of the acreage adjustment.  I note too that, while interest is payable on delayed payment of tax, no interest is payable by a local authority on tax found on appeal to have been wrongly assessed and paid.  This should be amended in the interests of fair play.  Will the Minister respond to that?</P>
    <P>Where there is a hardship case a suspension of the tax due is allowed, but it causes me worry to note that the tax will only be suspended and not waived. When we had rates on agricultural land rates could be waived.  I can envisage cases where a farmer through a long period of ill-health or otherwise, and without someone to replace him, could reach retirement with a millstone of land tax around his neck.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, confirmed on RTE radio on 12 June that the tax will represent a charge on the land and that if the land is sold the amount due would have to be paid.  In some instances that could amount to a sizeable figure which would prove a disincentive to the sale of the land.  I note too a most petty charge, typical of the attitude of the Government, that will be levied for certificates proving that the land tax has been paid &mdash; another obnoxious section of the Bill.  Could the Government not devise a form of receipt that would serve adequately for the purpose of land transfer without farmers having to go to the added expense of a certificate of proof of payment?</P>
    <P>It is sad to have to make these comments in the House.  The Government <Col N="176" /> did not get a mandate to introduce this legislation.  Labour and Fine Gael when they faced the electorate did not put such a proposal before the people.  In November 1982 they conned the farming community in this regard.  Fianna Fáil have repeatedly pointed out that instead of recruiting 100 people to operate this legislation they should increase the number of officials in the Revenue Commissioners to pursue those who are not paying their fair share of tax.  If the Government feel that some farmers are not paying an adequate share of tax they should go after them, but the legislation before us is not the answer.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that, at a time when the Government should be encouraging farm development, they introduce this Bill which will have the inevitable result of farm splitting between members of families.  Another sad consequence of the Bill is that young farmers, immediately they come into possession of their own land, will be liable for an annual capital expense of land tax, making it more difficult than ever for them to make their business pay its way.  Where will they find the money over and above the tax to stock their farm with cattle?  If they borrow to do so, they will not get relief from land tax on it.  No wonder <i>Building on Reality</i> predicts another 7,700 farmers leaving the land before 1987.</P>

      <P>All reasoned opinion is against the land tax.  The chairperson of the Commission on Taxation has come out against it; the Government's own economic advisers, the National, Economic and Social Council (NESC), are against it, and need I remind you, we in Fianna Fáil are against it.</P>
      <P>The land tax is inequitable, both among farmers and between farmers and others.  It will bring widespread acrimony.  It will tax the farming community without regard to the ability to pay.

      <P>Nothing has changed since 30 March.  The reasons we opposed it then are the same reasons why we oppose it now.  I hope I have outlined our position to this Government who are obstinate and blind in bringing in this legislation.  I also hope that some Government backbenchers, such as Deputy Farrelly and Deputy Dowling, will see the light and walk up those steps with Fianna Fáil to reject this legislation which is obnoxious and which, in the words of their own leader, is the wrong way to tax farmers.

      <P>This is typical of the Opposition. Even the one minute left is to be denied to me.  One can oppose this Bill on the basis that it taxes the farmers too much and that they are being overtaxed, or on the basis that they are not being taxed sufficiently.  Which is he saying?  Is he saying farmers are not paying enough, and that Fianna Fáil would bring in proper, sensible, substantial taxation on the farmers?  But he does not say that. This is the kind of waffle we had before. Fianna Fáil were in power for decades. They never taxed the farmers and they never will.</P>

      <P>I will attempt to respond to the points made in relation to those matters which arise directly from the proposals in this Bill.  Before I do so however, having listened to the various contributions.  I think it is necessary to remind Deputies of some of my opening remarks.  One of the achievements of this measure will be, in some degree, to equalise the contribution of the farming sector to national taxation.  Land constitutes the major part of the natural resources of the State and its importance as taxable property was recognised in the system of rates on land which the farm tax will replace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely recognised that since rates on land are no longer applicable, the tax contribution from the farming sector has been reduced substantially. The provisions of the Bill represent a simple but effective mechanism for correcting that situation.  The Bill also represents the first attempt in over a century to put an up to date realistic value on land for tax purposes.  The concept of an adjusted acre will stand for the future as an equitable, definitive assessment of the productive capabilities of land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy attempted to attack the provisions of the Bill on the grounds that the farm tax, first, was not equitable and, second, will be unfair between sectors.  Deputy Calleary followed him very closely in this. First, the proposals for the farm tax are equitable.  It is not an income tax but a tax on adjusted land acreage with, first, exemption for those under 20 adjusted acres &mdash; this removes any danger of hardship on smaller farmers &mdash; secondly, a sliding scale of liability for those with between 20 and 25 adjusted acres, thirdly, liability which is clear and definite for those with between 25 and 80 adjusted acres and fourthly, an interaction with income tax for those over 80 adjusted acres.  The amount payable will also be related to the ability of persons to pay, as measured by the size of their resource &mdash; the land itself &mdash; in terms of an up to date classification, by expert professional officers, of the value of the resource.</P>

He seemed to base his assertion on the impression that tax inspectors may not enter on property for assessing liability to other kinds of tax.  I am rather surprised that Deputy O'Kennedy appears to have overlooked section 34 of the 1976 Finance Act, as amended by section 60 of the 1980 Finance Act which he himself introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He refers to the adjustment of acres having to take place again and again and that is not the case.  The initial classification will stand once the appeals process has been completed and the Bill is very definite that revision of the initial classification will take place only if there is a material change of circumstances &mdash; not where a farmer goes ahead with some development plan or other.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy O'Kennedy seems to think that the provision that local authorities will issue certificates indicates that they will have to set up a register of land sales, with all its attendant bureaucracy. This, of course, is wrong.  The issuing of certificates and receipts on application is to facilitate the sale of land by showing that the farm tax is paid.  This is no more complicated than the inquiries a prudent solicitor makes in any property transaction about charges on the property being sold or bought and inquiries about rates due on land where a standard practice in all land transactions, when there were rates on land.  On a more general argument about adjusted acreage made by Deputy O'Kennedy, the fact is that the concept of adjusted acreage has been used for many years by the Land Commission in the distribution of land, in order to determine the amount of land required for a viable holding.  Deputy Noonan mentioned adjusted acreage in some of the figures he gave, but yet would not say how these adjusted acreages were determined.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates, in his very sound contribution, was quite right in this respect.  There was no statutory backing for the concept and, although farms were adjusted to the equivalent of prime agricultural land, the adjustment to be made in each case was left to the land inspector.  I think the Deputy knows that very well.</P>

      <P>The definition of an adjusted acre in the Bill, section 2 (1), is aimed at providing an objective basis for classifications, appeals and revisions. This will enable us to avoid the problem of the arbitrary and inequitable nature of the valuation base which led ultimately to the termination of rates on land, as the House is well aware.  Some anomalies may, of course, arise but the farm tax commissioners, by instituting appropriate control arrangements, should be able to deal with these and there will be, of course, right of appeal.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is now advocating strongly, so it seems, that income tax is what will bring about equity between farmers and the PAYE sector. We have to face the facts and they are simply as follows.  We can look on this tax as a replacement for rates on agricultural land and as a contribution towards the cost of providing local authority services. Rates were a property tax unrelated to income.  The farming community are now paying about £35 million in income tax. In 1980 they paid £64 million between rates and income tax.  If you adjust that up to the present, that would be £108 million in 1985 as between rates and income tax.  There has been a reduction in the tax take from farmers, not as a result of action by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Several Deputies asked how long it will take to bring the tax into operation.  This depends on when we can get started.  The Bill gives power to enter on land and, incidentally, provides for penalties for failure to co-operate. The full classification of land into adjusted acres is likely to take several years.  The aim will be to start in each county with the bigger farms and to introduce tax on those farms in 1986.  All counties will be treated equally.  To those Deputies who have expressed doubts about the time and scale I wish to point out that the basic records in respect of land holdings, occupiers and so on are already available and, as a result of the Bill, they will be available as a right to persons doing the classification.  The tax will start in 1986 on the basis of the stage reached in the classification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The classification of land will be done by experts &mdash; obviously it will require expertise.  In the final analysis the appeals process will provide a safeguard against any unfairness or any significant lack of consistency in individual cases.  I do not think there is any real need to worry about the points raised by Deputy Calleary and Deputy Brennan regarding variation in the quality of land and the effects of reclamation.  The expert staff should not find it beyond their competence to deal with that matter.  The staff already available are well used to the basic concept of adjusted acreage but we will deal with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the rate and yield of the tax.  Section 9 provides that the rate of tax will be determined by the Minister having regard to the estimated change in the level of family farm incomes and the yield to the Exchequer from other taxes.  The rate will be £10 per adjusted acre.  I propose on Committee Stage to bring in amendments that will provide that in the Bill the rate of farm tax in 1986 will be £10 per adjusted acre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>By moving this motion we will be debating one of the most important matters to come before the House during Private Members' Business.  We are talking about the last large remaining industry within the Cork area.  It is unacceptable that we should be contemplating redundancies in this firm, much less closure of the firm.</P>
      <P>On 28 June 1984 a supplementary estimate was introduced to give effect to the £89 million being given in equity to Irish Steel.  I should like to refer to some of the items which arose during that debate. The figures for 1983-1984 we were told showed a loss of £21 million made up as follows: depreciation £4.5 million, operating loss £4.9 million and the remaining £12 million for interest on borrowings.  A year later we were told that the firm recorded a loss of £17 million. That involved £5 million in operating losses, £4 million depreciation, £6 million financial charges and £2 million for foreign currency transaction loss.  Some improvement was shown there in 12 months and that improvement in the operation was indicated by consultants who submitted various reports in the past few years.  They indicated that the firm could be made viable.  The uncertainty being created for Irish Steel is totally unacceptable.  The thought of redundancy and closure has the obvious effect of undermining the workforce.  This should not have been allowed to develop. The Minister must take full responsibility for the frame of mind of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A year ago it was indicated that energy costs were having a tremendous effect on the viability of the company.  It was stated that a warning was issued about the adverse effects these costs would have. A year later we are told that energy costs are exceptionally high.  Why did we have to wait until now when the warning sounds were issued in June 1984?  At that time the Minister was asked to discuss this matter with the Minister for Energy. We have no evidence of whether that meeting took place but one thing is sure: the firm tell us energy costs are still exceptionally high.  The adaptable structure of the operation of Irish Steel is a good enough reason to ensure its continuance. The consultants employed to inquire into <Col N="195" /> the viability of this firm have indicated clearly that it can be made viable.  Market prices have refused to rise and the firm have to bear a massive increase of 50 per cent on the price of their raw material which, for the most part, is scrap.</P>
    <P>Although immediate targets have been achieved, the firm are seriously disadvantaged by the unacceptable level of their cost structure.  Six months ago the chairman advised the board and the Minister that, if there were no improvements in these factors, the company would face financial problems during the second half of 1985.  The employees' representatives were apprised of that last February.  It is the board's conviction that the company must do what is necessary to bring about a significant improvement in their affairs.</P>
    <P>If the outflow of cash is not staunched at once, the board say they will be left with no alternative but to recommend to the Minister that the plant cease to trade and close down.  For this side of the House and the people we represent that is totally unacceptable: It is unacceptable that it should even be considered in the light of all the circumstances.  The Government have agreed in company with other EC members to apply for further funding for the steel industry.  We have been left in no doubt that this application is nothing more than a formality. I hope the Minister will tell us otherwise.  Surely he and the Government are aware of the contribution Irish Steel make to the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record some elements of that contribution.  The salaries and wages bill of the company amounts to £10 million while the PAYE and PRSI payments to the Government amount to £4 million.  In addition there are payments to the ESB of £10 million, to Bord Gáis of £1.5 million, to Hammond Lane, £6 million while £1 million goes on freight.  Side contracts amount to £750,000.  Ferry and bus services amount to £300,000 while in respect of general stores and engineering the amount is £1.5 million.  A sum of £750,000 is spent on lime supplies.  There is a sum of £750,000, too, in respect of oxygen, while insurances <Col N="196" /> amount to £600,000 and pension premiums to £700,000.  The payments in respect of other services such as rates and harbour dues, rents and so on account for another £1 million making a total of £24.85 million.</P>
    <P>The company indicate that their contribution to the balance of payments is £45 million.  The number of people employed directly in Irish Steel is 650.  In addition, a further 400 persons are employed in the many firms concerned.  All these jobs are in serious doubt because of the uncertainty and the lack of commitment on the part of the Government in regard to Irish Steel.  It is hardly necessary for me to name the various firms, but it is necessary to emphasise that 40 per cent of the employees of Irish Steel are from the town of Cobh and that town has already suffered the closure of Marathon and of Verolme Cork Dockyard in addition to the redundancies at NET where further redundancies are proposed and also the loss of jobs in the supporting industries. What is of great concern to many of us is that the trade unions involved in Irish Steel were not invited to discussions prior to the recent announcements by management.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the situation in Irish Steel should be as it is. I note from information supplied to me that overtime at the company costs £2 million per year.  I do not wish to use the word &ldquo;closure&rdquo; too often because we on this side of the House, and many others too I am sure, will not accept the closure of Irish Steel even for the shortest possible time.  However, the estimated cost of the closure of Irish Steel is £7.3 million.</P>
    <P>I understand the chairman of the company has told the workers that when making the investment last year, the Government made it clear that there would be no more money for Irish Steel. If that is the case, why the approach to the Community?  But if after saying that there is to be no more money for the company there is to be money forthcoming, who will believe such threats from the Government in the future?  It is the specific responsibility of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism <Col N="197" /> to resolve this mess.  One could use much stronger words to describe the situation. The workers have made their contribution towards the attainment of all production and sales targets since the commencement of the developed industry. We are all very conscious of the huge investments that had to be made in Irish Steel.  We realise fully that any proposal for further investment in the company must be given full and deep consideration.</P>
    <P>There is a massive financial argument in favour of keeping the company in operation.  I have outlined the numbers of jobs that would be lost and the various implications of closure in terms of returns to the Exchequer and a further drain on the social welfare system, not to mention the shattering effect a closure of this magnitude would have on the people of Cork city and county who are reeling from so many closures and redundancies.</P>
    <P>The reason for the shameful manner in which the Minister is using the workers of Irish Steel can be known only to him. One wonders what he is playing at.  The board have taken a decision that there will be no pay increase before the end of 1986 at the earliest and that the workforce must be reduced by 100 with redundancy paid at statutory terms plus one week's pay.  That is a very bitter pill for anyone to swallow, but the workers at Irish Steel have demonstrated their restraint when restraint was required. They have not had a wage increase for about 18 months.  What is cynical about the Minister's package is that he has not said that even if it is accepted he will support the company financially.  We must therefore reach the inescapable conclusion that the Minister has decided to confront the workers with measures so unpalatable, especially in relation to redundancy, that he will bring about a confrontation between workers and management at the plant and then close it with the least damage possible politically to the Government.</P>
    <P>What we are asking for is nothing more nor less than honesty.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that they are prepared to deal so callously with men, many <Col N="198" /> of whom have risked their health in such a demanding industry, and to add them as another statistic to the already massive dole queue.  Where is the social conscience that we heard so much about in regard to this Government?  In September 1983 the Government engaged consultants to assess Irish Steel Holdings' viability, prospects and so on.  Having already received a report in 1982, the December 1983 report was favourable on the results achieved, also expressing the belief that, from a marketing point of view, Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. had overcome the worst and most difficult hurdle, that is a significant breakthrough into the European market.  Our contention now is that we do not wish to hear talk of redundancies never mind closures. Redundancies and redundancy payments have become inescapable traps for workers. A recent description fits the bill when they were termed as fools gold.</P>
    <P>As the nation is well aware, we have had sufficient redundancies in the Cork area.  Under the terms of this motion we want this Government to ensure, by their action, the continuance of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd.  Does it not make more economic sense to provide the necessary finance to tide this company over their little shortfall for the second half of this year, thereby safeguarding the vast amount of money put into the company over the years?  Surely it is not the Minister's intention to allow the situation to deteriorate to the extent that the firm would be placed in jeopardy through uncertain action on the part of the Minister, with doubt being created and the morale of the workers being undermined?</P>
    <P>Is it not time that the Minister and the Government took a decision on Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. and stopped toying with the company?  There were soundings before the local elections when we were hopeful of a positive response on the part of the Government.  Time has drifted on and because of the atmosphere created, because of the uncertainty for the company's employees and those employed in supporting industries, we have tabled this motion.  Bearing in mind the prospects of <Col N="199" /> the industry, the workers and the entire economic life of the Cork region we are hopeful that the Government &mdash; who have a large part to play in this instance &mdash; will quietly ensure the continuance of this company, restoring the morale and confidence of its workers.  We are pleading with the Government that this uncertainty should no longer prevail.  It is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago, on a motion dealing with employment in this area, the Minister used words to the effect that they knew there had been many job losses in the Cork area but they could do nothing about them.  This is one instance in which they can do something because the ball is firmly in their court.  There were other firms in relation to which perhaps the Government could have contended with some justification that they had no role to play, when perhaps that interpretation was correct.  Bearing in mind Government equity in this company, they are in a position to act and ensure its continuance which I might stress again is the function of the Minister and of this Government.</P>

      <P>As we have done on numerous occasions in the three years I have been a Member of this House it is sad that we are discussing this evening the future of another industry in the Cork region.  We have seen the closure of Fords, Dunlops, Verolme (Cork) Dockyard, Maritime Industries and others. Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. face an uncertain future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 June 1984 the Irish Steel (Amendment) Bill, 1984, was introduced in this House by the Minister now present.  In the course of his Second Stage remarks the Minister was explicit that henceforth Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. would have to live or die alone, they would have to stand on their own two feet.  Under the provisions of that Bill £89 million was allocated towards the equity of that company.  To the best of my knowledge, that investment by the Government was not made for a considerable time thereafter.  I should be glad if the <Col N="200" /> Minister would inform us as to what occasioned that delay.  We note from a statement by the chairman of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. that the estimated financial charges for the coming year are £6 million. It would be interesting to know by how much that estimated £6 million would have been reduced and what would have been the financial charge had the equity been paid by the Government soon after the passage of that Bill.</P>
    <P>The future of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. must be viewed in the context of the Cork region as a whole and not in isolation.  At present there are 650 persons directly employed by the company, 40 per cent of whom are from the town of Cobh and an additional 400 persons employed by a number of other firms who would be in grave danger of losing their jobs were Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. to close.  Not only are there 400 other jobs indirectly dependent on Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. but there are also many other small firms supplying goods and trading with them, such as the ESB, Marine Transport, John A. Wood, Irish Industrial Gases, who would also be in imminent danger if the Irish Steel were to close.  Therefore the roll-on effect of the closure of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. would be catastrophic for the region.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in Cobh alone over the past two years we have already seen the closure of Maritime Industries, Verolme Dockyard, redundacies in NET and in recent weeks there have been rumours of further redundancies afoot in NET.  In a statement by the chairman of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd, on 13 June he referred to that he called a number of disabilities.  They were as follows: average costs were exceptionally high, market prices had stubbornly refused to rise, they had had to bear a massive increase up to 50 per cent in the price of scrap and in addition, although their immediate sale targets had been achieved they were seriously disadvantaged by the unacceptable level of their own cost structure.  He also said that the only one of those of which the company was in control was the cost of labour and on those grounds the board decided to <Col N="201" /> implement the following: there was to be an instant pay freeze at all levels until the end of 1986, the numbers employed by the company would be reduced by approximately 100 persons, redundancy payments were to be restricted to statutory requirements plus one week's pay for every year of service, and a 1.7 per cent increase by way of analogue review for 1984 which was recommended by the Labour Court would be paid.  According to the chairman these decisions are the only way to resolve the crisis in the industry and extend the life of the company and that in consequence they are not negotiable.  That statement was made to bring peace in the area.  By reducing the workforce by approximately 100 workers £2 million will be saved.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how this will help significantly in saving Irish Steel.  Furthermore the wage freeze until the end of 1986 is not easily acceptable as the workers have not had an increase for approximately 18 months.  The big question is, do these decisions regarding redundancies and a wage freeze mean anything to the Minister who has not said that even if the board's decisions are accepted by the workforce, he will financially support the company?  Regarding the other disabilities the Minister and the Government have control over, one of the main cost factors affecting Irish steel is the cost of electricity and gas.  To date the Minister has not made known whether any moves have been made to offer assistance in these fields.  The price of scrap which went up by 50 per cent has thrown the whole budget position of Irish Steel Limited out of line.  In conjunction with the refusal of the market prices to rise, it has resulted in the company not improving their trading position.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly neither the Minister nor Irish Steel have control of open market forces so we cannot blame them for that. But the blame for the poor results cannot be placed on the shoulders of the workers as the production targets set by the company were achieved and surpassed over the past three years.  The targets for the years 1982-83 to 1984-85 were 390,000 tonnes and the achieved output was <Col N="202" /> 395,000 tonnes.  From these results it can be seen that the workforce were performing as required, in some cases beyond requirement.  The salary and wage bill of the company is £10 million and in addition £4 million is paid to the Government for PAYE and PRSI contributions. Should Irish Steel close it would mean the loss of that amount of money to the Exchequer from a going concern and the Government would have to pay out social welfare instead.  In the event of the worst coming to the worst, that is, 1,000 people at least being made unemployed, approximately £7 million, not taking into account agreed redundancies above the statutory level, would have to be paid out in the first year, not to speak of the amount of social welfare that would have to be paid in subsequent years because the likelihood of a large number of jobs coming into the Cork region in the near future is extremely dim.</P>
    <P>Another factor that must be taken into account is the contribution to the balance of payments being made by Irish Steel. This amounts to £45 million.  Should Irish steel close £45 million will be lost to the Exchequer and the Department of Social Welfare will be paying out anything from £7 million upwards.  I cannot see who that would benefit the economy.  The position of Irish Steel is uncertain and the workers are in a similar state of mind to the 1,100 workers who over a year ago were made redundant in Verolme dockyard.  The workers do not know whether they are coming or going and they are under tremendous psychological pressure.  Under these circumstances they cannot function at their optimum.  This uncertainty is doing no good for Irish Steel, for Cobh, for Cork or for other areas where the workers live.  It is up to the Minister to say what he intends doing.  It is quite clear that the benefits to the State outweigh the losses that would ensure if the plant closed, so the plant should be kept open. We in Fianna Fáil call on the Government to take all the necessary action to ensure the continuance of Irish Steel Holdings Limited.</P>
    <P>We note that the Minister's amendment &ldquo;expresses its confidence that the <Col N="203" /> Government...&rdquo; We do not have confidence in the Government.  Any confidence has been eroded over the past three years.  In the Cobh area we saw the closure of the two ship building berths, Verolme dockyard and Marathon.  After that the Government decided to sink the Irish ships.  Irish Shipping went into liquidation. That coupled with many other decisions made by the Government is why we do not have confidence in anything that the Government say they will do.  In this case the Government are not saying whether or not they will do anything. It seems that the Minister has manoeuvred the board of Irish Steel Limited into a confrontation course with the unions, thus giving himself an excuse to scuttle Irish Steel.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  The Minister must come clean and not hide behind the board of Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;expresses its confidence that the Government in taking a decision on the request from Irish Steel Ltd. for additional support in the light of its financial results in 1984/85 will consider all the relevant facts including the potential commercial viability of the Haulbowline plant; the impact which closure would have on the Cork area; the effectiveness of cost cutting measures recently announced by the Company, and, the competing demands for scarce Exchequer resources.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Around this time last year the Oireachtas passed legislation, the Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Act, 1984, the purpose of which was to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited thereby enabling the company to repay some of the £106 million which they owed by means of an equity injection.  I explained in clear terms at the time that <Col N="204" /> the option facing the Oireachtas was the closure of Irish Steel or committing £89 million of taxpayers' money to enable the company to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel were to be given a final opportunity to prove themselves as a commercial enterprise.  I stated quite clearly that, having regard to EC policy in this area, from the end of 1984 the company would have to finance their operations in a normal commercial manner without any further recourse to the State.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged by the response from the Opposition when I moved Second Stage of the enabling legislation in the House last year.  For instance, Deputy Reynolds stated that the criterion in regard to Irish Steel and all other semi-State bodies when Fianna Fáil were in Government was viability.  This was evidenced, he claimed, by the closure of the National Film Studios of Ireland and Min Fhéir Teoranta by the then Government. Deputy Reynolds also expressed serious concern about investing even that £89 million of taxpayers' money in Irish Steel. Thus I am sure that all Members of this House and the taxpayers will now be as concerned as I am that the £89 million aid package has failed to achieve its objective and will want to know why Irish Steel are now requesting further financial support.</P>
    <P>Without going into too much detail I would like to recall the background which led the Government into recommending that Irish Steel should receive £89 million in equity last year.  Three consultancy reports were prepared by the French firm SOFRESID in the period September 1982 to January 1984.  On the basis of the last report the EC Commission and the Government accepted that Irish Steel could meet the EC Commission's requirements for financial viability in 1986 based on certain assumptions made regarding prices and sales volumes and on condition that the Council of Ministers approved a proposal from the Commission to give Irish Steel additional production and sales quotas to enable them to sell their products into European and other markets.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to invest £89 <Col N="205" /> million in equity in Irish Steel on the basis that the company had a reasonable chance of achieving the SOFRESID projections. Irish Steel received the £89 million in five tranches on the following dates in 1984: £20 million on 29 June, £16 million on 17 July, £14 million on 17 September, £10 million on 9 November, £29 million on 21 December.</P>
    <P>Some £68 million of this, was used to repay all of the company's domestic bank borrowings which were covered by ministerial guarantees.  As the borrowing was guaranteed by the taxpayer anyway, the repayment reduced by £68 million the exposure of the taxpayer.  In this sense the injection of £68 million of the £89 million represented no more than a bookkeeping transaction from the point of view of the taxpayer.  The balance of the sum was used for working capital purposes and to finance the company's losses.</P>
    <P>At present some £39 million in outstanding guaranteed borrowings are owed by Irish Steel in respect of the following: ECSC loan (20 million US dollars) &mdash; £19.3 million; ECSC loan (68 million French francs) &mdash; £7.1 million; leasing agreements &mdash; £12.6 million.  I should add that if the company were closed the Government would be called on to honour the guarantees given.</P>
    <P>In the final months of 1984 my Department became aware of the fact that Irish Steel's financial position and their prospects of future viability were deteriorating.  I instructed that a report on the company should be prepared and this was completed in early December. The indications then were that the SOFRESID forecasts on price and other key variables would not be achieved primarily because the company were unable to pass on by way of increased selling prices the huge increase in the cost of scrap, their basic raw material.  This report also indicated that there was a possibility that the £89 million investment package might not prove sufficient to enable the company to continue in operation without further assistance.</P>
    <P>I did not consider that matters were so serious that a decision to close the <Col N="206" /> company should be considered by the Government at that time as the Irish Steel Board, in my view, were best equipped to judge the magnitude of the company's financial problems and the implications of the deterioration in the company's performance. I informed the chairman of Irish Steel in the New Year of my concerns about the gravity of the company's projected financial results.  He was told that a decision on Irish Steel's future would be taken when the Government had an opportunity to consider my Department's report on the company's rolled-over five year corporate plan.</P>
    <P>When the corporate plan was received in late January, officials of my Department and the Department of Finance examined it thoroughly in consultation with the company's senior management.  A detailed report was completed and this is now under consideration by the Government together with certain recommendations regarding the future of the company.</P>
    <P>Before going into the reasons for Irish Steel's present difficulties, I should make it clear that my Department have been monitoring the affairs of the company very closely for quite some time on the basis, <i>inter alia</i>, of a detailed monthly return of key indices.  In addition two civil servants, one each from my Department and the Department of Finance, were appointed to the board of Irish Steel last March.  Because of the insight and knowledge available to my officials I am confident that the analysis presented to the Government about Irish Steel's position is as accurate as such a report can be.</P>
    <P>The main negative factors facing Irish Steel at present are as follows: (1) the sharp rise in ferrous scrap prices; (ii) the continued depression in steel selling prices; (iii) the high electricity costs relative to their competitors; (iv) high labour costs; and (v) the strength of the US dollar which has increased the burden of financial charges as well as giving rise to as yet unrealised exchange losses.</P>
    <P>The main deviation, however, amongst these five, from forecasted costs which Irish Steel faced for nearly 18 months was the high price of scrap relative to the <Col N="207" /> sales price of steel.  It is important that Deputies opposite recognise that as scrap represents around 40 per cent of the cost per tonne of finished steel, any significant price development affecting this essential raw material impacts quite significantly on the financial position of the company. Scrap prices in the Community rose sharply in 1984 and in early 1985.  Such was the extent of this price rise that Irish Steel estimate that, compared with the SOFRESID assumption, they had to pay over £4 million extra for scrap in their financial year which ended on 30 June 1985.  Irish Steel endeavour to utilise all available domestic scrap, but their needs are such that they must import about 70 per cent of their total scrap requirements. The increase in scrap prices was caused by the strength of the dollar and by the increasing demand by third countries for Community scrap as opposed to US scrap.  I tried on a number of occasions at meetings of the Council of Ministers to get support for a proposal to introduce restrictions on the export of scrap to countries outside the Community.  The Commission did not respond positively to my request as the larger member states &mdash; France, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands &mdash; favour the existing policy of free trade.</P>
    <P>In recent months the price of scrap has fallen.  The US composite price for scrap fell from about US $87 per tonne in March 1985 to about US $66 per tonne in June 1985.  This drop in price may be just a seasonal or temporary variation.  It is difficult to predict how scrap prices will develop in the long term.  The EC Commission in its recent report <i>General Objectives for Steel 1990</i> states that the price of scrap will not drop back to the level that made the electric are process so attractive to steelmakers.  The Commission does not offer any encouragement to the effect that, apart from seasonal trends, the price of scrap will rise again.</P>
    <P>I might digress for a moment to explain that in addition to the factors arising from the dollar, which it might be argued are temporary factors since the dollar may <Col N="208" /> revert to a more normal relationship to other currencies, there is the underlying structural problem that over the last few years large numbers of steelmakers have invested in electric are furnaces of the type we have in Haulbowline.  That is because this was the most profitable, efficient and flexible means of producing steel at the time.  That type of steel mill relies on and can use only scrap.  It cannot use raw iron as the integrated mills, which were less profitable at the time, could do. The consequence of the type of mill we have being profitable was that more people got into it, but there was a finite supply of scrap in the world.  Therefore there were more people competing for the same amount of scrap.  That remains the case.  Previously we had a market for scrap in Europe which was virtually self-contained &mdash; in other words, we produced enough scrap to supply our own mills. As a result of increased investment in electric are furnaces outside the Community more and more steel manufacturers are coming into Europe and looking for scrap here, thereby pushing up the price of scrap in Europe.  That is unlikely to change and it creates a continuing structural difficulty for steel production based on the type of process in Irish Steel which was so profitable in the past.  We cannot ignore those factors in our assessment of the position.</P>
    <P>The price that Irish Steel must pay for scrap is outside their control.  So too is the price they receive for their products on the European marketplace.  It is now clear that Irish Steel will not achieve the sales price assumptions projected by SOFRESID.  Current market prices are considerably below the consultants' expectation.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to forecast with certainty the future development of steel prices, yet the forecasting of sales prices is a crucial determinant in any calculation of Irish Steel's future viability.  If sales prices are off target by £1 per tonne this could result in a reduction in operating profit of up to £250,000.</P>
    <P>My Department have examined, as far as they can, the likely market trends for steel in the ECSC and in other markets. <Col N="209" /> Particular attention has been paid to the demand for steel in the engineering-construction industry because it is in that sector that the products produced by Irish Steel are mainly used.  The market in 1984 in the Community in this sector was highly unprofitable due to the substantial drop in demand for new buildings and new civil engineering projects, because of the decline in the volume of public capital expenditure in practically all European countries.  The prospects for a substantial recovery in the engineering-construction sector in the Community are not great.</P>
    <P>Turning to the medium term demand for steel, this is covered in the EC Commission's Report <i>General Objectives for Steel 1990.</i>  It makes depressing reading. The Commission considers that overall demand in 1990 may not be any greater than it was last year.  Over-capacity still exists in the Community steel industry. This is in spite of a considerable reduction in capacity of some 30 million tonnes achieved over the past five years.  As a consequence of over-capacity and slack demand, price increases are expected to be very modest and may only cover increases in raw material costs.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that Irish Steel have to operate in a market environment that is fairly rigidly controlled by ECSC rules.  The Council of Ministers meeting at Elsinore in 1982 decided on a series of &ldquo;anti-crisis&rdquo; measures to restructure the steel industry in Europe in an attempt to prevent the demise of the industry.  These &ldquo;anti-crisis&rdquo; rules are due to expire at the end of this year.  The most important rules provide that</P>
    <P>(a)  all aids to the industry must be notified to the Commission and approved by it and no aid may be paid after 1985;</P>
    <P>(b)  steel undertakings cannot produce or deliver more than what is allocated to them by means of the quota system;</P>
    <P>(c)  the minimum price rules for certain steel products must be observed; and</P>
    <P>(d)  imports from the Community's <Col N="210" /> main trading partners are restricted by way of voluntary arrangements.</P>
    <P>There has been a high cost in terms of jobs lost.  It is estimated that between 1974 and 1984 some 350,000 jobs were lost in the steel industry, or 44 per cent of persons employed in December 1974. Irish Steel, it should not be forgotten, reduced their workforce from 1,100 to 650 within this period.</P>
    <P>What of the future?  In the report already referred to the European Commission cautions that forecasting employment in the iron and steel industry in 1990 is hazardous owing to the many factors to be taken into consideration. It nevertheless considers that &ldquo;it is an inescapable fact that employment in steel will in the next six years be subjected to very severe cutbacks&rdquo;.  This is on top of the reductions experienced already.  The picture thus is bleak not only in Ireland but in all of Europe.</P>
    <P>In the next five years the Commission reckons that there will continue to be significant surplus capacity and, as I have already mentioned, this structural problem will result in there being pressure on prices and on the efforts of steel undertakings to improve their level of competitiveness.  There are a few bright spots on the horizon but unfortunately in products not at this time manufactured by Irish Steel.  For example, demand is moving increasingly towards quality steel products, so-called speciality steels, with a higher value added.  As against this there appears to be a continuing change in the pattern of consumption as non-steel based products are substituted for steel products in uses that were previously the preserve of steelmakers.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of a serious threat from exports from non-EC countries where steel production capacity has rapidly increased in recent years.  The European market is threatened by the emerging steel industries of several developing countries whose modern mills can produce steel at very competitive prices.  As it is forecast that there will be a stagnation in world consumption between 1985 and 1990, these countries <Col N="211" /> will focus their attention on the Community and on market such as the US, where the Community industry is trying to sell.  Another problem is that world capacity could increase by some 100 million tonnes which would almost certainly lead to a further imbalance between supply and demand, adding to the imbalance which already exists.  This means that the Community steel industry is going to face extremely intensive pressure in the next five years and further capacity cuts are, therefore, inevitable.</P>
    <P>To date within the ECSC special account has been taken of Irish Steel. The Commission has not insisted on the cuts in production capacity which were applied in other member states but has allowed the company sufficient flexibility through the production quota system to increase their production levels so as to achieve certain economies of scale thereby enabling Irish Steel to endeavour to attain the viability targets indicated by the consultants SOFRESID.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel have increased their production more or less in line with forecasts. However, that positive development is but one part of the equation.  Extra production does not make commercial sense if the company continue to lose money on each tonne of steel they produce.  Not wishing to sound too pessimistic, I would like to say that it is a credit to the company and their workforce that they were able to produce and sell so much product in the last 12 months in the face of extreme competition.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel's financial charges have also risen in their current financial year as compared to forecast.  For instance, their operating loss was greater than expected. There was some delay in the timing of the equity injections as compared to forecast. But, in addition, the company incurred foreign exchange translation losses which were mainly due to the strength of the US dollar.  For instance, their US $20 million loan, which is now valued at over £19 million at current rates of exchange, was valued at £9.5 million when the loan was taken out in 1979.</P>
    <P>The chairman of Irish Steel has already <Col N="212" /> stated that the company will have a net loss of around £17 million in their current financial year.  That figure includes £5 million in operating losses; £4 million in depreciation charges; £6 million in financial charges and a £2 million foreign currency translation loss.  This result is very disappointing when compared to what had been projected.  The losses this year will be nearly doubled those expected when the House approved the £89 million aid package last year.</P>
    <P>In April 1985 Irish Steel requested additional State equity of £25 million. This additional equity was sought because the company considered that the £89 million investment would prove inadequate.  The fact that Irish Steel are running out of cash so soon after a massive investment is a clear indication of the magnitude of the task facing the company.</P>
    <P>When the board of Irish Steel announced their redundancy and pay proposals in June 1985 I was not surprised to hear about these measures.  My own view is that these measures could profitably have been embarked upon sooner, as the company had indications as early as last September that they would likely be facing serious financial constraints.  Let me make it clear to Deputy Lyons that these are the proposals of the board of the company and that it is the function of that board to deal with matters of that kind.  While I support the board's efforts to reduce costs, and I commend them for such achievement as they have had in the past in this regard, I do not wish to intervene in the negotiations between the board, management and unions.</P>
    <P>I explained my views to a delegation of Irish Steel workers lead by the vice-president of the ITGWU at a meeting on 24 June last.  I impressed upon the delegation the very serious financial position of Irish Steel.  The company simply do not have the money to pay redundancy terms similar to those which were negotiated in respect of other firms which closed or rationalised their operations in the Cork region.  I also emphasised that the board's offer to pay one week's pay over and above statutory entitlement had <Col N="213" /> not been approved by the Government; nor indeed had the proposed payment of the 1.7 per cent under the Analogue agreement.  As funding is available from the ECSC to assist redundant steel workers, I have, however, instructed my Department to approach the Commission with the object of finding out whether it would be prepared to provide financial aid towards redundancies. Preliminary contact has been made with the Commission.</P>
    <P>Provided certain strict criteria and some conditions are fulfilled, it may be possible to obtain financial assistance from the Commission towards redundancy costs.  I must emphasise that it is by no means certain that an application from the Government would be approved. However, I have instructed my officials to pursue this matter urgently. Hopefully, by the end of the year some financial assistance might be available from the Commission.</P>
    <P>My Department have also reminded the IDA that firms re-employing redundant steelworkers may be entitled to avail of loans at reduced interest rates from the Commission.  Thus there would be a real incentive for firms to employ redundant steelworkers either in existing or new projects.  I should add that projects in non-industrial sectors such as tourism are also eligible to benefit from these loans.</P>
    <P>What then is the future of Irish Steel? The Government will, I hope, make a decision in the coming weeks in response to the company's request for additional equity.  I think the House should know, at least in general terms, the main factors which have to be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>First, there is the question of financial viability.  I have examined a number of scenarios which make various assumptions about sales prices, output and input costs.  Currently Irish Steel could not now be considered strictly viable in the commercial sense of the word.  The House is aware that the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> makes it clear that the affairs of commercial <Col N="214" /> semi-State bodies must be examined from a commercial point of view.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I think it timely to recall the State has, up to the present, committed nearly £190 million to Irish Steel by way of equity financing, grants and bank guarantees, approximately £130,000 per worker.</P>
    <P>In return for all this money, the company's accumulated net losses to date are approximately £115 million.  One must ask if the company will be able to reverse their fortunes in an extremely hostile market-place where factors beyond their control will continue to militate against every effort to improve profitability.</P>
    <P>If Irish Steel received additional equity, that investment in itself would not be sufficient to keep the company in operation.  Where possible, the company must reduce costs where they have control over them.  Thus the reaction of the unions to the cost-cutting measures announced recently by the ISL board is of crucial importance to the future of Irish Steel.  It is a factor in any decision.</P>
    <P>I reckon that Irish Steel must demonstrate that they can reduce their labour costs by at least 10 per cent and thereby contribute to whatever package deal which can be constructed for consideration. I am confident that Members on all sides of the House will see this as a necessary part of any proposals which might be put before them for approval.</P>
    <P>Another crucial factor under examination at present is the price of electricity paid by Irish Steel.  After scrap and labour costs, this vital but expensive energy source is the next most important element of production costs.  In the context of this year's budget the Government announced measures to reduce the cost of electricity to all industrial users.  For Irish Steel this reduction came to around 7.5 per cent.  Taking this reduction into account Irish Steel paid in the region of £7.3 million to the ESB in the year 1984-85. It is widely recognised that Irish Steel and indeed heavy industrial users generally are paying significantly more for their electricity than their European competitors. If the company's electricity costs <Col N="215" /> were to be reduced further this year it would be necessary, in order to comply with EC competition policy, to extend a concession to some other industrial users. The cost of this concession might well have to be passed on to other consumers. Deputy Lyons did not advert to this point.</P>

      <P>Another element to be considered is the fact that the EC Commission has to approve the payment of whatever moneys which might be advanced to Irish Steel.  On 26 April last the Council of Ministers gave its assent to a Commission proposal to permit the payment of additional aid to steel undertakings in 1985.  Member states had until 31 May to notify the Commission of their aid proposals.</P>
      <P>The Government submitted an aid application to the Commission on 30 May 1985 for approval to invest up to a maximum of £24 million in Irish Steel.  It was made clear to the Commission and to Irish Steel that this application was without prejudice to the Government's decision about the future of the company. It was noncommittal and should be seen solely as a piece of contingency planning. The amount sought is the absolute maximum which would be consistent with the EC Commission's current formula for the payment of additional aid to steel undertakings. This formula says that financial charges of undertakings should, by the provision of aid, not be brought below 4 per cent of turnover.  This application was presented by my Department to the EC Commission and experts from other Member States at a meeting in Brussels last week.  The Commission is required to give its decisions on all aid applications by the end of this month.  Additional moneys cannot be paid to Irish Steel in the absence of a positive decision from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recall that on 26 April the Council also decided that no operating or investment aid could be paid to steel <Col N="216" /> industries after 1985.  Consequently, if the Government were to decide to advance moneys to Irish Steel all these funds would have to be paid over before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It would be unthinkable for any Government not to take into account social as well as commercial factors before taking a decision about Irish Steel's future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that offer by Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>My Department have, therefore, examined in detail the direct and indirect costs that would arise if ISL were unable to continue.  There is no dispute that this would have an adverse impact on industries and services which do business with the company.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate with any degree of accuracy the extent of additional job losses outside the company which would result from the closure of Irish Steel.  It is not clear, for example, whether suppliers and service companies would be forced to lay off employees or whether they might be deployed elsewhere. All that can be said is that some 200 to 300 jobs would be put at risk, but not necessarily lost.  Recent assertions and reports which quoted a figure of up to 400 job losses in other industries are an exaggeration.  One must also consider the benefit to the economy of tax paid and consumer spending by Irish Steel workers.  This does not feature in a commercial balance sheet but is a significant factor.  It must be admitted, however, that it is on the commercial balance sheet that other companies, both public and private, are judged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact that the closure of Irish Steel would have on the Cork region which has been affected by the closure of Fords, Dunlops, Verolme Cork Dockyard and other industries will be taken <Col N="217" /> fully into account when the Government take their decision about the future of the company.</P>
    <P>Another vital ingredient in this complex series of problems is whether the Exchequer can actually afford to borrow and service another £24 million which is 1.5 per cent of PAYE revenue and £44,000 per worker in ISL on top of the £130,000 per worker already invested.  In addition the Government have to consider many other demands for scarce Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>I hope my statement tonight convinced the Irish Steel workforce that their company is at a crossroads and that the reaction to recent proposals put to them by management is an important ingredient in any decision.  I trust the House is convinced that we are examining every possible aspect of the case.  The Government will be apprised of all the relevant facts including the contributions made in this debate.  I hope that Deputies will address themselves to the real choices that are to be faced, rather than select only the evidence that favours one course or another.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in my statement that would justify the suggestion by Deputy Ahern that in some sense blame is being put on the workers in this case.  I have no doubt that the workers have made efforts in the past to contribute to the success of the company.  Unfortunately, there are factors outside everybody's control which sometimes cause damage to a company and they are beyond the control of both workers and management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago a former Coalition Minister described the Cork harbour industry as trivial and in the seclusion of his own constituency at election time criticised a Fianna Fáil Government for spending money foolishly on industries he described as trivial. He was sniffed out by a former war horse of the House, former Deputy Martin Corry, who flushed out the information. Strangely, that thinking of about 20 years ago seems to be prevalent among the Coalition Government.  Tonight's debate on Irish Steel follows a number of other <Col N="218" /> tough debates on the Cork scene in the past two years but one thing we do not want in Cork any more is a decision to make more workers redundant, particularly those employed in State industries.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's final comment that he is not putting blame on the workers although he did refer to high labour costs &mdash; I will refer to that later &mdash; the message he seemed to convey was that, unless the workers accept the terms of the redundancy offer made to them, there is no chance whatever for the future of Irish Steel.  The Minister did not say, and this is very important, that if those redundancies are accepted with some revised terms, he will give a guarantee about the future of that industry.  One thing we cannot afford in Cork is the loss of 650 jobs.  I considered the debate important enough to be present in the House because for the last two years we have been concerned about the increase in unemployment in that city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be naive enough to blame the Government for the job losses that have occurred.  I have already said that some of those losses were beyond the control of the Government.  Those losses have had a very serious impact on the economic and social life of the harbour area, the city and county.  Poverty is at a level not experienced since the fifties. Redundancy lump sums have long since run out and social welfare is now basic. However, the Government must accept some blame for the position in Cork.  I cannot identify one job that was created by the Government task force set up last year.  The contents of the report of the task force were never made known to the House.  Did they make any reference to the future of Irish Steel or the prospects for the workers?  The Minister responsible for the launching of that task force should be honest with the House and the people of Cork and tell us what was in the report.  He should tell us why the report was concealed and locked in some backroom in the Department.  Why was it locked away?  What is in the report that he does not want us to know?  What is in it that the people of Cork should not know?  Was there a reference to the <Col N="219" /> future of Irish Steel?  Was there a forecast of what might happen to Irish Steel?  Is there some more ominous news for Cork?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not part of the report at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May we have a copy of the report?  I will only believe what is in the report when I see a copy of it.  When the task force was launched I participated on a television programme with the Minister.  Reference was made to the Ford closure and the Minister said that the Government would see to it that Fords would not walk away from Cork. That commitment was not honoured and replacement jobs were not provided.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a leading article in the magazine, <i>Business and Finance,</i> published on 20 June 1985 in Volume 21 under the heading, &ldquo;Steel Yourself Minister&rdquo;.  The article commenced by saying it was time to put Irish Steel out of their misery.  It was very easy for a well-heeled safe journalist to write those words and advise the Minister to steel himself.  I hope Deputy O'Sullivan read the article and brought it to the attention of his Labour colleagues in Government. I understand that all Labour Members received a copy of that article.  If that is the type of advice the Government are taking on board we have a strong obligation to point to the other side of the coin.</P>
      <P>It is easy to say it is time to put Irish Steel out of their misery but at what expense?  Does the journalist who wrote the article have any concern for the 650 workers involved and the families depending on them?  Does the journalist have any concern for the fact that those workers may have to meet big mortgage repayments and may have children at various stages of education?  Those considerations were far removed from the cold hand of that person who was writing what the readers wanted to read in that magazine.  That person is in the business of keeping the magazine afloat. A lot of misery will be created if that happens.  I hope other considerations will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> When will the Government reach a decision on this matter?  Deputy Ahern asked the Minister about the delay in the payment of equity.  In the course of his speech the Minister admitted that there was some delay.  He said there was some delay in the timing of the equity injections as compared to forecast, but he did not say why.  In my opinion this is criminal. This industry has been having many problems and legislation was passed in this House, with the support of both sides, but red tape prevented that agreement from coming into force in time.  That is disgraceful.  If that has contributed to the costs of this company, then the Minister and the Government are responsible. The employment position in Cork is deteriorating.  The Minister said the argument that 400 extra jobs could be lost if Irish Steel were to close is an exaggeration but I do not agree.  I appeal to him to ensure that the Government decision is a positive one.</P>
    <P>Redundancy has been used unfairly by some.  It has been used as a carrot to get people to concede jobs, a concession they make but regret two or three years later, especially at a time like this when alternative jobs are so difficult to find.  That redundancy money disappears very fast but there is another aspect which must be considered.  Redundancy payments can cause additional problems because when social welfare benefits expire and people apply for assistance, the redundancy payments are taken into consideration.  If a man is a spendthrift and spends his redundancy money that is fine, but if he is thrifty and saves, he will suffer.  The Minister's colleague is aware of this, but I ask that something be done urgently about this problem.</P>
    <P>I remember a night in this House a few short years ago when Deputy FitzGerald, the present Taoiseach, with a full gallery &mdash; a brilliant lobbying effort by his Kilkenny Deputies &mdash; discussed the Fieldcrest problem.  We had a readymade solution to that problem but the then Opposition led by Deputy FitzGerald suggested we nationalise Fieldcrest. Fieldcrest were a private company but Irish Steel are a State company.  Let this <Col N="221" /> Taoiseach and his Ministers reflect on the stand they took then.  If it was right to nationalise a private company then, let them do something for Irish Steel, a State owned company.  Let the Labour Ministers remind them of that night when, to the cheers of a packed Fine Gael gallery, they rallied to the cause of the Fieldcrest workers.  If there is any honesty left in the Taoiseach, let him remember that night when he made that move for narrow political gain.</P>
    <P>I deliberately allowed the Minister to conclude his statement and was glad to hear him say he was prepared to consider the situation in Cork.  This is very important because the social and economic considerations are great.  Morale is low and cannot take another blow of this nature. The Minister referred to the problems affecting Irish Steel since the package last year.  Let me go through them.  He mentioned the sharp rise in ferrous scrap prices &mdash; they are completely outside the control of the company as he admitted &mdash; the continued depression in steel selling prices &mdash; also outside the control of the company &mdash; the high electricity costs relative to their competitors &mdash; again outside the control of the company, but not, I suggest, outside the control of the Government.  Desperate situations require desperate remedies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the natural resource, the gas find which we in Cork have had since the seventies.  I understand there is a second find, and I welcome it too.  I hope there will be more gas as well as oil finds.  This generation has an obligation to use that resource to the benefit of the unemployed who are suffering.  An Bord Gáis are making a profit, but I am not really concerned about profits which make this company appear to be amazingly viable. That resource must be used to provide Irish Steel with cheap fuel because the high costs are crippling the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned high labour costs.  I would like comparisons between labour costs in the European steelyards and the Cork steelyard.  If there is a discrepancy, I do not believe it is because of lack of effort on the part of the Cork workers.  I am sure it is because <Col N="222" /> of more modernised and mechanised operations in the European mills.  In my opinion the investment in Irish Steel by successive Governments has been money well spent.  If my memory serves me right, these workers have not had a pay increase for the past 18 months.  That reflects a very responsible attitude.  These workers are very concerned about the future and their approach is reasonable and rational.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the chairman of the company who has made a wonderful contribution to the industrial life of this country.  He has tackled a very difficult problem here.  Of course he is having difficulties but for the Minister to tell the unions that this is a matter for the board of Irish Steel was wrong because he knows he is the person with the clout.  He is the person who can intervene because, as he said in his speech, there are other considerations, the social considerations and the special needs of the Cork area. In other words, this cannot be confined to the cold, calculated decisions boards make with certain statistical information before them.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read that the absenteeism rate was as low as 8 per cent.  I wish it were zero per cent or even 1 per cent, but compared with the absentee rate in other industries 8 per cent is quite low.  Many of these workers come from the Cobh region and have to come to work by boat.  I was not in political life 20 years ago when the bridge was being built, but many of these workers come from Cobh, Cork city, Passage West, Monkstown, Carrigaline, Ringaskiddy and the adjoining areas.  Cork Deputies know many of the people working there and their first commitment is, and will continue to be, to Irish Steel.  That means we all have an obligation to fight for the future of that company.  But the Minister has to come clean and tell us if there is a future for this company.  Are the Government prepared to make such a commitment? The Minister's statement was too vague and left too many questions unanswered.</P>
    <P>The Minister says about redundancy that &ldquo;provided certain strict criteria and some conditions are fulfilled it may be <Col N="223" /> possible to obtain financial assistance from the Commission towards redundancy costs&rdquo;.  He does not say what those-criteria and conditions are likely to be. He says he must emphasise that it is by no means certain that an application to the Government would be approved.</P>

      <P>My other observation deals with the raising of £25,000 to £40,000.  I understand both of these points can be dealt with only under a Finance Bill.  I am restating the point here, so that it would not go unnoticed and that the Minister, in the best interests of this designated fund, would give it all the help it needs.  It has been hidebound up to now, but the door has been opened a little.  We expect that the Minister will encourage his colleague in Government to give the fund every chance it needs to be a success.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I have sympathy with the Deputy on this.  I said that we should get in touch with the Minister for Finance about it, but on reflection I am not so sure that it would be a good idea to reduce the period from five to three years.  As the Deputy will appreciate &mdash; and I thank him for his support &mdash; what we are trying to do is to get equity into companies on a reasonably solid basis so that people running those companies will know that they have a certain financial backing based on this tax concession.  If you were to say that once one has got into one of the companies one would qualify for the tax relief as quickly as three years there would be many &ldquo;quick buck&rdquo; merchants getting in for three years and getting out again.  The company would not be able to pursue any rational development plan on the basis of such support.  With all due respect to the Deputy, he might reconsider his attitude on this.  It is better to leave it at five years. However, this is a matter primarily for another debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 would seem to be the only section on which there is room to talk.  I am not too happy, as I have said, about tax relief not being given from the time one invests money in the funds. One must wait until the money is invested in a venture.  That would be a disincentive to the small investor who might not be able to finance the waiting period, which could be months.  It could well mean that the small investor would be unable to make the investment.  This may be part of a Finance Act rather than the present Bill, but I still make the point that the possibility will have to be considered that investors in unquoted securities would be eligible for tax relief immediately on investment in the designated fund recognised under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  As the Deputy is aware, this is also a Finance Bill matter.  The problem is that there would be a great incentive to people running the funds to hold the cash, because those who put the money in would get their tax relief straight away.  You could have people sitting on the money for quite a while, waiting for an ideal investment to come up, rather than turning the money over and recycling it in the productive sector.  The investor would not be particularly worried once he knew that his money was safe.  He would have got his tax relief from the moment the money went into the fund, even though nothing productive would have been invested in and might not be invested in for some time.  I do not think that would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with the Deputy that it is desirable to get the tax relief to people as soon as possible &mdash; and some may have liquidity problems and feel that they are not able to wait &mdash; on the other hand this money will be put in only by people with money to spare.  If they have money to spare to put into these tax relief funds, then they have sufficient money to wait the relatively short time which should apply between the time the money goes in and the investment in productive activity takes place.  I fear that the Deputy's approach &mdash; and this may be going a little <Col N="226" /> far &mdash; could facilitate, at least in the short term, the scheme being used for a species of tax evasion rather than for the purpose for which we both wish it to be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that there is some reason why an individual investor should not be given an amended certificate of tax-free allowance as soon as possible after he furnishes evidence of investment in a designated fund?  I am talking particularly of people in the PAYE sector, not the large investor.  The small investor is treated a little unfairly here.  Could the Minister talk to his colleague?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the reasons I have already given, it is desirable that the investor should be getting after the funds manager to get him put the money into something productive fairly soon.  If an investor can get tax relief from the moment he puts his money forward and if the manager has not invested it in anything productive there will not be pressure from the investor, if we accept the proposal of the Deputy.  I am sure Deputy Lyons would be the first to point out to me that there is need for urgency with regard to dealing with the unemployment problem.  It is our intention to get any money that avails of this generous tax relief recycled quickly into productive activity rather than to have it lying around in a quasi-bank account.  That is why I do not think that much can be said for the Deputy's proposal, although I acknowledge it has been put forward with the intention of trying to improve the scheme.  As I have said already, I thank the Deputy for his approach in the matter but I do not think this suggestion is good.</P>

      <P>As I indicated on Second Stage and again tonight, we have agreed to this Bill because of our concern regarding this matter.  Some two years ago we said that because of the limitations of the scheme it would not be a success and we are pleased that the Minister has adopted the stance we indicated some time ago. All of us hope that this Bill will have the desired effect, namely, that it will encourage the investment of funds which we know are available.  We hope that this easing of restrictions will encourage that investment and that more than two funds will be set up in the coming year.  We welcome the liberalisation measures now proposed and we regret that the Minister has not gone further in this regard.</P>
      <P>If the scheme is to be successful it must be good for investors and for business.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Finance has arrived in the House.  I contend that his approach is too restrictive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may escape the censure of the Chair by making a passing reference to the Department of Finance. I had intended to say that the Minister <Col N="229" /> for Finance is too restrictive with regard to the terms of the scheme.  I urge him to broaden his horizons so that the scheme will be availed of more widely.  I have heard of mental telepathy: it is quite extraordinary that as I was coming to that sentence the Minister for Finance came into the House.  I am glad he is in the House to hear me say this.</P>

      <P>The key to all of this is section 2, which takes the scheme out of the unit trust restrictions.  Designated funds for investment purposes were subject to the Unit Trust Act, 1972, and the restrictions under that Act and so long as that continued no progress was made in the past 18 months.  Now that there is a new category of designated funds, I hope it will set the ball rolling. It is vital that the political will and the administrative arrangements that may be made as a result of that political will exist to ensure that this development is facilitated.  It is a logical, sensible development and one that can lead to the translation of funds into venture investment areas.  That is what is required. We hope that the political will and the resultant administrative capacity will be such as to utilise this new mechanism. Obviously what was in the Finance Bill was failing by reason of the restrictions under the unit trust legislation.  I hope the new mechanism will ensure that the matter will work properly.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has shown himself to be very ready, as have all of my other colleagues in Government, to make amendments to this tax relief scheme in the Finance Bill this year in the light of experience in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to allow a situation where people could advertise for investment in specific funds which are to be used for tax relief.  Without this Bill one would have had to invest either directly as an individual in an individual company or in a fund which you heard about but which could not advertise for your investment.  Obviously there was no limit on the amount of availability of <Col N="230" /> individual investment in individual companies but the absence of the availability of funds to advertise did mean that the fund aspect of the scheme, as distinct from the individual aspect of the scheme, could not really work.  I am very glad we have been able to get this Bill through the House before the Summer Recess so that it can get to work right through the summer.  The implied criticisms by the Deputies opposite of what may have gone before are not really relevant.  The fact is that this is a new scheme introduced by this Government.  It will work well and it will work well partly because it is a good scheme and partly also because of the support it has received from the party opposite for which I express my appreciation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise time is short and I will not make a lengthy intervention.  My sole purpose in intervening is to seek clarification.  As the House will be aware, there were reports in yesterday's paper that there may be 16,000 jobs lost over this measure.  I am sure this is not correct but I would like clarification of a few issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only sector paying rates at the moment is the commercial community. They do so regardless of the service they get from the local authority and regardless of their profit and loss account.  That is an accepted situation.  The reason for this, I understand, is due to a court decision whereby the rateable valuation of certain property came into question.  I thought at first that this was simply a technical change to allow for that but there seems to be a misunderstanding about certain items of industrial plant that may or may not be affected.  The current yield of rates from manufacturing <Col N="231" /> industry is somewhere in the region of £80 million to £100 million annually.  It has been suggested, if a certain interpretation of this Bill is correct, that this could be doubled or trebled in terms of the rates bill for certain forms of manufacturing industry.  This is by virtue of the fact that certain equipment such as furnaces, boilers and ovens will now be rateable. Some people in the pharmaceutical industry and the buildings and materials industry have approached me in my role as chairman of the Small Businesses Committee about this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if this is correct because this would cause acute cash flow difficulties for small firms.  There are current difficulties with AIB financing and so on as of July of this year but it must be said that a lot of small companies are operating on a hand to mouth basis.  They are getting longer periods in terms of the credit restrictions that are being asked for by their customers in the trade and this all leads to a very difficult problem as well as high interest rates.  I know of one firm in my own constituency.  He has three garages and his PLV increased threefold.  The difficulty is that there may be almost arbitrary increases of the PLV at the behest of the local authority and it is quite a technical matter for the entrepreneur then to go to an auctioneer to take up a detailed appeal.  Obviously the smaller the business the less resources they have to deploy such personnel.  This is being perceived as discrimination against manufacturing industry, if the interpretation is as they say it is.  We must be mindful of the competitive position of manufacturing industry.  The State recognises its role through IDA aid, CTT aid and many other forms of ancilliary aid. Perhaps some of the good work could be undone if these fears are realised.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to clarify exactly what the material financial effect of this Bill would be, whether it is a full retention of the <i>status quo</i> prior to the High Court decision or whether it will amount to a doubling or trebling of the rates bill.  It is in the Minister's own interest to clarify the allegation that 16,000 <Col N="232" /> jobs would be lost, which I am sure is incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of serious concern, as Deputy Yates has said.  It is of concern to CII, who are the spokesmen for Irish industry and, apart from their concern, we have had enough examples this year of ill-considered Government action through the Minister for Finance in regard to bringing in disincentive measures that have impeded growth of employment in industry.  We had it in the doubling of the VAT rate on the construction industry.  I see here a similar type attitude in these proposals in the Valuation Bill.  When you examine them they are concerned with movable plant. Traditionally the whole valuation and rating system was related to fixed assets, to buildings and affixations to buildings, plant directly involved in a building or attached in a permanent way to the building. That is how the system operated over the years.  The concern here is precisely as Deputy Yates said: that a whole area of movable plant will be incorporated by legislation into the rateable assessment for valuation purposes.  It is of particular concern to the chemical area and to the processing area, particularly the food processing area, where there is a high storage element, where there is a high element of movable machinery.  All these industries that are subjected to changes in terms of improvement of productivity are now going to be in a situation where even run-down plant they may wish to change would be subjected to valuation and to rates arising out of that valuation. The danger is that it will act as a penal clause for taxation purposes and a disincentive to industries which require to change their production processes.  This is a very serious matter.  If, in order to increase productivity industries acquire improved machinery at a higher cost they will be subject to a higher valuation and a penal collection of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had too many examples in recent times of measures being brought in here that at first glance may seem to have some justification.  However an indepth examination of such legislation <Col N="233" /> reveals the extent of the disincentives.  Is any tax measure which will operate as a direct disincentive and a bar to investment worth it in relation to the revenue raised?  Has a sufficient study been carried out by the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the balancing effect of the revenue raised from a valuation tax on moveable plant as against the disincentive to improve plant?  Moveable plant has always been regarded as a flexible asset.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister may say that in practice such plant has been taxed to some degree over the years. If a firm has such plant the overall context is taken into account and the valuation is fixed on the overall value of the premises and the production unit as a whole.  That has been the pragmatic approach of the valuation commissioners over the years.  That is very different from writing a clause into law stating that from now on such plant is subject to valuation and, by reason of that, subject to commercial rates.  That represents a precedent which will act as a disincentive to industry and employment. I should like to hear the Minister's view on that.  I hope he will allay our fears because they are genuinely expressed.</P>
    <P>Over the years if the Valuation Office in assessing the valuation of a premises see such plant in a firm they have taken the overall context into account and made a valuation accordingly.  Now, however, moveable plant will be liable to valuation and to rates.  I wonder if the Valuation Office, the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister have taken into account the disincentive involved in introducing a measure of this kind into law for the first time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in expressing concern at the possible effects of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to clarify a number of issues which have arisen and which, in essence, must give the House cause for concern about the possible repressive effects on manufacturing industry of a measure which, if interpreted in its widest form, could leave the manufacturing <Col N="234" /> sector open to a substantial increase in taxation.</P>
      <P>When introducing the measure the Minister referred to the Bill as being a technical measure to rectify difficulties which arose in the interpretation of the existing legislation.  That would tend to allay fears and anxieties, but a closer reading of the explanatory memorandum shows that the Bill has two objectives. One is to bring within the ambit of rating industrial plant deemed rateable prior to a recent court decision and secondly to provide for rating of other property not specifically referred to in existing legislation. I am not quite sure how the description of the Bill as being a technical one rectifying some difficulties which arose in the interpretation of existing legislation squares with the second provision.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on that.  Both objectives can be said to seek to extend the base of the valuation system to the detriment or relative impoverishment of the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The sooner we have a major review of the taxation system rather than piecemeal reforms the better.  It is somewhat incongruous that plant which may now be deemed to be rateable legally may be plant which was grant-aided by the IDA some years ago.  I am not sure how that squares with the general thrust of Government policy which is to try to stimulate manufacturing industry and encourage enterprise and entrepreneurial skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a variety of assessments of the net effect of this measure on the manufacturing sector but some estimates, admittedly from representatives of business organisations who have proven in the past that their assessments are as accurate as anyone else's, show that in some cases the tax levy is likely to be increased by 100 per cent or 200 per cent. If, for example, the amount of money which might now be additionally expected from the sector could be said to be of the order of £100 million, obviously the deficit in the working capital of businesses would be substantial.  I am sure the Minister has given that some consideration. I accept that it is difficult to <Col N="235" /> try to square the circle, but we must be extremely reluctant to place any disincentive on any employment sustaining sector which already feels that there is a little light at the end of the tunnel.  Anything that puts greater difficulty in their way must be carefully thought through.</P>
    <P>The effects of the Bill clearly discriminate against one segment of the economic infrastructure and there might be grounds for challenging this on constitutional grounds.  I wonder if the Minister and his advisers have borne this in mind.  I do not know if it is a valid fear, but it would not be the first time that such an approach was deemed to be appropriate.  Is the Bill essential?  If it is, what safeguards does the Minister suggest would be reasonable to ensure there will not be very substantial taxation above and beyond what he and the House might regard as reasonable and appropriate which would place a heavy burden on people who are already heavily burdened by taxation and who are manfully trying to sustain employment in these difficult times?  The manufacturing base is restricted enough already and I hope this Bill will not place a further constriction on it.</P>
    <P>However, the sounds emanating from the business community are untypically shrill and strident and in some cases alarmist.  Knowing some of the people involved I am aware that they are not usually given to such reaction.  I urge that we proceed cautiously in this area and that the fears and anxieties that have been expressed by representatives of the business interests involved and which have been expressed in this House also will be given careful and respectable scrutiny by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would comment as far as is possible on the points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Those Deputies who have contributed to the debate have drawn attention to a number of aspects of the Bill in respect of which, reasonably I think, they would like some further examination.  Attention has been drawn also to a number of points <Col N="236" /> made about the Bill by people outside the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal first with some of the other comments made by the Deputies and which have not been echoed outside the House.  Though it may have been a slip of the tongue, Deputy Keating used a very good word to describe some of those comments when he referred to then as alarmist.  My definition of an alarmist is someone who provokes alarm when there is no need for it.</P>
      <P>As I said when introducing the Bill, its purpose is not to extend the list of Noonan (Limerick West)"properties to be valued and rated but to preserve the traditional valuation base. Members of the House who are also members of local authorities should bear in mind the very real difficulties of local authorities in ensuring an adequate flow of revenue from their own resources and from resources available to them.</P>
      <P>The reason for the Bill in the first place is to ensure that the rateable base for local authorities remains as it has up to now always been intended to be and that we recover some of the ground lost to local authorities in terms of their revenue base following a number of court decisions. It is not for me to criticise the courts but the local authorities have lost ground as a result of a number of court decisions which did not fit in with the intentions of the legislators.  I realise I am on dangerous ground in referring to the courts in this way but I make the remark in all deference to them.  We are here this evening to adjust the legislation so that it becomes clear to the courts and so that the kind of difficulty I have referred to can be avoided in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the point that our purpose in this Bill is not to extend the valuation base but to put beyond a number of matters that have become the subject of challenge in the courts and to restore the valuation base to the level that was intended in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies said that in their view valuation law in general is outdated and outmoded and they reminded the House that this law dates from the middle of the 19th century.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with that view.  Our <Col N="237" /> valuation law is not perfect.  Much has changed since the basic principles of valuation law were enacted and that is one of the reasons for this Bill.  The Bill clarifies the meanings of plant and machinery as those terms are understood in the 20th century and puts on a firm legal basis the traditional practice of setting new valuations by reference to the valuation of comparable properties already valued. I am in accord with the views expressed by a number of Deputies who contributed to the debate in their regarding this Bill as a first step in a more general review of valuation law, a matter that is being examined in my Department in consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation. Deputies continued from there to ask why we should have this Bill when what is needed is a more fundamental review of valuation law.  That is a fair question and the fairest answer I can give to it is that we should see the Bill for what it is, one that remedies and preserves the present valuation base so that we may at least undertake our review of valuation law in the knowledge that our local authorities basically have at their disposal the kind of revenue base the legislators designed for them.  This does not in any way tie our hands or remove any options in terms of a more fundamental review of valuation law.  It stabilises the law as it was intended to be without expanding the base and it gives more certainty to the law.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies commented that a revaluation of all the property in the State is needed and various suggestions were offered as to how we might go about that task.  I would not disagree. The present valuation law is more than 130 years old but I must make the point that there are more than one million rateable hereditaments in the country and the process of revaluing them would involve considerable time even if we were to effect a significant increase in the staff of the Valuation Office.</P>
    <P>We can only make a guesstimate of the cost of a complete revaluation but it would be in the region of £10 million to £15 million.  Having regard to the length of time this would require and to the total <Col N="238" /> cost involved, it is not something we would embark on lightly.  One can think of a couple of committees of the House who might have the odd remark to make about that kind of money being expended over such a period of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not mind if it was done efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise fully Deputy Keating's concern with efficiency.  I think he appreciates that he has no more ardent supporter than myself in his concern in that regard but the gentlemen on the opposite side of the House do not seem to be too keen on efficiency in public expenditure.  However, that may be a matter for another evening's debate.</P>
      <P>Deputies Wilson and Skelly welcomed the news that we are proceeding to provide specifically for the valuation of car parks.  Though that kind of property is not mentioned specifically it is covered within the terms of item 2 in the Schedule to section 3.  Deputy Wilson asked for clarification as to how the tone of the valuation list operates.  He was speaking of Dublin and Dublin was revalued early in this century.</P>
      <P>The primary valuation Act, that is the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1952, prescribed that the valuation of buildings be based on an estimate of the net annual letting value and that formed the basis for the valuations fixed originally.  With the passing of time letting values increased sharply and it was apparent within 40 years of the primary valuation that valuations could not be determined strictly by reference to annual letting values.  Therefore, a process began of setting valuations at a level lower than the letting values but doing so in a consistent manner so that the valuation of one building compared with that of another would bear a relationship similar to that between their respective letting values. That process is what we call maintaining the tone of the valuation list and helps to maintain a uniform valuation throughout the country as required by the 1852 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this point Deputy Taylor compared the way in which the <Col N="239" /> valuation system operates here and in the United Kingdom.  As he pointed out, there are regular revaluations in the United Kingdom with the result that, in many cases, valuations correspond to letting values.  On the other hand, I would have to make the point that, as a result of regular revaluations, valuations in the United Kingdom are generally much higher than they are here while on the other hand their rate poundages are much lower.  Of course, in a general sense one balances out the other.  If one increases the valuation the poundages will go down and the net result is the same.  In general the true factors will tend to balance one another out although it is difficult to predict what, if any, would be the net revenue change resulting from an overall revaluation here.  In principle it should give the same result.  It might give a slightly different distribution but, in principle, the result should be broadly the same even for a given category of buildings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also mentioned in passing some feelings he had about the system of raising local revenues.  I intend to mention this briefly only because I do not think it is germane to the thrust of this Bill.  He seemed to ask why &mdash; since there are local income taxes and local sales taxes in the United States and, he thought, in other countries in Europe &mdash; we could not have them here since they seem to operate reasonably well particularly in parts of the United States.  I would remind Deputy Taylor simply that in many of the states of which he speaks in the United States, and indeed in a number of cities where there are local sales taxes and income taxes, one is talking about a total taxpaying population that is, in some cases, several times greater than the total population of this country.  Therefore, in terms of taxation policy, it is not relevant to draw a direct comparision between what may be our situation here and what happens in the United States.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly raised the question of the valuation of ponds and reservoirs listed in the Schedule to section 8 of the <Col N="240" /> Bill.  The ponds and reservoirs he mentioned are of an industrial nature.  They had always been valued and rated until their valuations were called into question by some recent court decisions.  This Bill will give explicit power to value and rate them.  It will put beyond doubt the situation that obtained previously in which they were valued and rated and which was set aside by some court decisions. The clear intention of the legislator in framing the legislation was that they should be so valued and rated.  I intend to put that beyond doubt in this Bill, not to expand the definition but simply to ensure that what was intended actually comes about.  Of course we are not speaking here of ornamental or amenity ponds; they are never valued or rated unless they significantly enhance the value of a property and, even then, their valuations would be extremely small.  I mention that only because Deputy Skelly spoke of his recollections of fishing and swimming in the ponds associated with the Killeen Paper Mill.  Indeed I remember myself engaging in some similar activities and hopping across stepping stones in the ponds of another defunct paper mill in Drimnagh which Deputy Keating will remember also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly also adverted to the fact that the Bill makes no mention of an appeal mechanism.  It is true, it does not. There is no need to provide specifically for appeals as the properties covered by this Bill, in common with all other property liable to valuation, are subject to the appeals procedure laid down in the Valuation (Ireland) Act of 1852.  Therefore, there is no need in this Bill to provide for an appeals procedure.  The appeals procedure already exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly also sought information on the rate revenue from commercial property and the benefits that accrue from commercial enterprises in return for that contribution.  Rates revenue in the aggregate from such property in 1984 was £121.5 million, in 1983 it was £104.1 million. It would require a great deal of investigation to estimate what return those ratepayers get for the contribution <Col N="241" /> they make.  It is clear that all such commercial and industrial enterprises benefit, along with the rest of the community, from the entire range of services made available by local authorities to the community at large.  To break that down into individual enterprises would be a very difficult job indeed.  It is a part of the base from which the expenditures of local authorities, on the services they provide, is financed.  I do not think it could be claimed that the value of the benefits received was not in proportion to the level of the rates paid.  Deputy Skelly went on to seek confirmation of the percentage of local authority revenue derived from rates.  Specifically he asked if it was true that that percentage had fallen from 34 per cent in 1965 to 16 per cent in 1981.  Those figures are correct.  The basic reason for the fall in percentage was the decision to transfer liability for rates on domestic property to the Exchequer, a move which was undertaken, as we all remember, in 1978.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly mentioned also &mdash; and it has been taken up by other Deputies &mdash; provisions in the Bill for the Minister carrying out certain things by way of making orders.  In this respect I might quote from the Official Report of 21 May last, at column 1650 when Deputy Skelly had this to say:</P>
    <P>Nothing happens, of course, if the Minister makes an order.  While it is often necessary for the Minister to be able to make orders, sometimes he can be given a power of which we will not know the effect until later on.</P>
    <P>I must say I can understand Deputy Skelly's hesitation and that of others were they to read the provisions of the Bill in that way.  I might draw the attention of the House to section 3 (4) which sets out the procedure we have in mind and which reads:</P>
    <P>Whenever an order is proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution <Col N="242" /> approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>What we have done there is to provide for the making of and affirmative confirmation of orders.  Of course, there is another procedure which we could have used, that is the procedure under which an order is laid before the House and becomes valid if not opposed within 21 days.  But we deliberately chose the affirmative order because that requires an active decision of the House, an active examination of the text of the order and a debate in the House before it can be passed.  In that way Deputies and the House in general can be assured that nothing will be slipped through on them. Indeed Deputy Skelly took me to task somewhat for, as he seemed to think, trying to slip the Bill through on the nod in the House.  I pointed out to him &mdash; and I noticed that my <i>sotto voce</i> was picked up in the report &mdash; that the Bill had been circulated since the middle of March. Whatever else I might be accused of in bringing this Bill before the House, certainly I cannot be accused of rushing it through.  These has been plenty of time for consideration and examination of it. The essential point I want to make is that any orders that will be made under the provisions of this Bill have to be positively affirmed by the House and, therefore, will receive full and proper examination.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that the annual revision of domestic property, which is a statutory function of the Commissioner of Valuation, should cease since such property is no longer rated.  I am afraid I cannot agree with that.  The process of revising the valuations of domestic property, when material changes are effected to their structures, is a very important function notwithstanding the fact that rates are no longer levied on the occupiers.  These valuations have been established over a long number of years and form an important source of basic information on property for commercial and official purposes.  They would quickly get out of date if they were not revised and that would set at nought the entire <Col N="243" /> work of the valuations in this area.  It would be rather foolhardy to destroy such an extensive data base.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy then suggested that industrial plant and machinery are for the first time to be rateable under this Bill.  Industrial plant has always been valued and rated in accordance with the Valuation Acts.  Machinery has always been excluded by those same Acts from valuation and rating.  That will continue to be the case under the provisions of this Bill.  That is clear both from the Bill and the explanatory memorandum.  Movable machinery is not covered, it is not rateable and will not be valued under this Bill.  Nothing in this Bill brings in a new category of valuation base that would affect industry in the way in which Deputy Lenihan was afraid it might.</P>
    <P>The problem this Bill seeks to rectify has been caused by certain court decisions taken within the framework of the Valuation Acts as they have been up to now.  The courts have ruled in some instances that when a mechanical element is associated with a piece of plant the whole element becomes a machine and is therefore exempt from valuing and rating.  This Bill provides that only the plant element will be valued and, far from extending the valuation base or bringing new elements in, this Bill merely restores the <i>status quo</i> prior to those court decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was concerned also at how what we call the tone of the list operates.  I will correct a misapprehension on his part.  We are taking advantage of this Bill to put on a legal base a long-standing traditional practice. Deputy O'Kennedy was correct in that new valuations are made by reference to the valuation of properties already valued, but with the important qualification that such properties are comparable. The tone of the list takes account not only of the rental value but of the condition of the property and the purpose for which it is used.  It is therefore incorrect of Deputy O'Kennedy to infer that, if two properties had rental valuations of £20,000 and £10,000 respectively, their <Col N="244" /> valuations must be set in a ratio of two to one.  There are other factors that have to be taken into account in fixing the valuation and one could not draw that conclusion automatically from that kind of comparision.  The valuation which would be set would reflect the respective uses of the buildings, the condition of the buildings and the location.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to have some hesitation about giving statutory effect to this long-standing practice.  I do not understand his fears.  Short of a complete revision of valuation law, valuation must be set by reference to rental values and taking account of inflation. The only equitable way of setting valuations is by the adoption of the tone of the list system which allows us to take account of the various factors that enter into our consideration of the valuation. Putting the system on a statutory basis does not fundamentally change anything in the way that the valuations are carried out.</P>
    <P>I will come to a number of points made by Deputy Yates and repeated to some extent by Deputy Keating.  I wish to deal more comprehensively with some of the remarks lately made by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  Deputy Yates raised the question of some misunderstandings about items of industrial plant which I hope I have cleared up.  It is clear from what I said that there is no question of this Bill doubling or trebling the rates bill.  Both Deputy Keating and Deputy Yates spoke of discrimination against manufacturing industry.  That is not really an appropriate term in the context of the discussion we are having.  If there is any discrimination it is in favour of domestic property by taking out of the base on which local authorities can get their revenue. In the charging of rates there is no specific and no unconstitutional discrimination against manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan asked if movable plant is now being excluded.  It is not. The Bill does not apply to movable plant. It refers to fixtures which have always been a category liable to valuation for rates.  It is very clear in the Bill.  Deputy Keating suggested that it is anomalous to <Col N="245" /> put rates on plant which might a very short time previously have been grant-aided by the IDA.  It is not.  As Deputy Keating would remember, in many cases where the IDA assist in an industrial enterprise there is a remission of rates for a period.  It is not at all anomalous, once assistance has been given to set up an enterprise, that after a period it begins to make its own contribution towards the funding of the services provided for the local community and by industry in the area.  One might just as well argue that it is anomalous to tax anybody getting any kind of benefit from the State.  There is not an anomaly in having a taxation system that requires contributions from people without necessarily taking account of the various ways in which the State or the community helps those individuals or firms with a certain purpose in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating asked, if the Bill is really necessary, what safeguards can we have against the possibility of an unreasonable burden of taxation.  The best safeguard is a responsible and measured approach by local authorities towards raising local revenue.  Deputy Keating knows perfectly well that it is not within my compass, although I wish sometimes it were, to give him that kind of guarantee.  What we are providing for in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a function of this Bill to restrict either the requirement of local authorities for revenue or their exercise of the powers given them to raise revenue.  The function of this Bill is to ensure that the base on which they raise local revenue is what the legislator <Col N="246" /> intended it to be and to take out the difficulties that have been created as a result of a number of court cases which have effectively set aside some of the provisions that have been in the legislation up to now.</P>
      <P>Finally, I come to some of the points raised by a number of people outside the House which have been raised legitimately by Deputies in here this evening. It has been contended that the Bill could result in a substantial extension of rating with extra costs for manufacturing industry.  It has been claimed, for example, that one of the results of the Bill could be a doubling of existing rates charges of £80 million a year.  That is not the case.  As I said, we are restoring the <i>status quo</i> to where it was before a number of court decisions were taken.  We are clarifying the valuation base, not extending it, not providing for any new categories of rateable hereditament to be brought in.</P>

      <P>I did not hear them worrying too much about whether the valuation base as it applies to commercial and industrial property was excessively restrictive or the contrary, whichever way Deputy Lenihan wishes to express it.  I have here a number of letters which I had the honour of receiving from the CII dealing with certain aspects of the fears <Col N="247" /> of the CII about this.  In relation to some of the comments made, I have to make the following points.  First, the valuation placed on plant such as provided for in this Bill does not necessarily reflect the cost of that plant in relation to total invesment in the enterprise as a whole, so that exercises that have been done identifying the proportion of investment cost made up of plant and buildings and other assets which go into it have no bearing whatever on the valuation of buildings or on the relative valuation of different kinds of buildings or of different plants owned by different firms in the same business. Therefore, I am afraid a number of gentlemen have given themselves a great deal of work for no good reason because to make that comparison is not relevant. Secondly, plant is already valued and rated in the majority of cases.  The ones which escape at the moment are those in respect of which court actions have been taken on the interpretation of section 7 of the 1860 Act.  Therefore, there is no question here of a vast array of a huge amount of plant waiting to be pounced on once the Bill is passed.  There are cases where plant which was previously rated has had its valuation reduced or eliminated because of these court decisions and the effect of this Bill will be to restore the valuation, of course taking account of the process of appeal that is already in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To speak of doubling or trebling the bill is absolutely out of the question.  We are certainly not going to do anything of that kind, and to speak of there being any great danger to small, large or medium sized industries is totally outside the scope of this Bill.  It does not arise.  The cases in which an increase will arise are those where plant has been reduced in valuation or devalued &mdash; if I may coin a phrase &mdash; as a result of a specific very small number of court cases.</P>

I repeat &mdash; because there is none so blind as he who will not see and probably none so deaf as he who will not hear &mdash; that the function of this Bill is to regularise the position, to restore the <i>status quo</i> to what it was before those court decisions were made.  It is not a Bill which goes out to extend substantially the valuation base, and Deputy Lenihan would do better to read the text of the Bill with some attention before he starts bandying around big words like &ldquo;bureaucratic&rdquo;. He would also do well to bear in mind the state of a number of local authorities who have been left short&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of an amount of revenue as a result of these court decisions. Bravo, and I congratulate the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The court decisions to which I have referred have given a very broad interpretation to the word &ldquo;machinery&rdquo;, the developing trend there being to regard any structures and other installations associated with the manufacturing process as machinery and hence not rateable. I am not trying to extend the valuation base but I am providing a measure that will prevent an extension of the meaning of &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; leading to a gradual erosion of a substantial part of the valuation base, so that the only industries or firms which will face extra costs in the future are those which succeeded in having their valuations reduced as a result of court decisions to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> It has got to the point where it is alleged, for example, that section 8 of the Bill could be deemed to include not only ovens and boilers but also silos, storage tanks and most of the equipment used in processing industries such as the chemical industry or the dairy industry.  It is also alleged that the section could be deemed to cover all conveyor belts or transfer lines which take a product from one machine to another within a factory. Even a brief reading of section 8 and of the Bill will show that that is not the case and a brief reference to the Schedules of the Bill will show again that that is not the case.  I refer those who have written this not just to section 8 but to section 7 (3) of the Bill also.  Also it is asked if an electric motor is attached to a piece of plant such as a silo or grain dryer in order to drive a fan or a pump, whether the entire piece of plant would be exempted because a motor is attached.  It would not.  The motor would not be rated; the plant would be rated.  That is the clear intent of the legislation as it is up to now.</P>
    <P>Finally, the interests outside the House down in Kildare Street are concerned that sections 3 (2) and 8 (2) give the Minister authority to introduce additional Schedules by order and it is suggested that, in view of the potentially very wide-ranging implications of the extension of such powers, certain persons would wish to have any extension of powers made by means of a Bill presented for formal discussion by the Oireachtas. I must say that it is not for us in this House to be told how to conduct our business by people outside the House, particularly since the provision in the Bill for the use of orders requires affirmative confirmation of those orders by the House.  They are orders which have to be brought into the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1985</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 12th February, 1985.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief purpose of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, is to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of trusts by providing trustees with a range of suitable investment outlets.  The Act lists the investments in which trustees may place trust funds unless the instrument; if any, setting up the trust expressly forbids them to do so.  The trust deed may, of course, provide wider powers of <Col N="251" /> investment but many trusts and analogous funds are restricted to the investments authorised under the Act. The list of authorised trustee investments is kept under active review and changes are proposed as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is empowered under section 2 of the Act to amend the list of authorised investments by order.  A draft of the Order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a motion of approval of the draft must be passed by each House.  This is a working example of the kind of order to which we referred on the previous item of business.</P>
    <P>As part of this process I am now asking the House to approve a draft order authorising trustees to invest trust funds in interest-bearing deposit accounts with Barclays Bank (Ireland) Limited.  This will bring to 35 the number of licensed banks in which trust funds may be deposited.  The Central Bank, the banking supervisory authority, have recommended that this bank should be named as an authorised trustee investment.  Such recommendations by the Central Bank are based on strict criteria covering the standing of the bank, its capital level and its record of compliance with Central Bank licensing and supervisory standards. In addition the institution must have gross assets and gross domestic assets in excess of the minimum qualification of £25 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is obliged to consult with the following persons in regard to the terms of any order he proposes to make under the Act: a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice; the Governor of the Central Bank; the public trustee; the chairman of the Irish Bank's Standing Committee; the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland; and the President of the Stock Exchange, Irish.  These statutory reference have all been consulted and no objections have been raised to the proposed addition.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the bank named in <Col N="252" /> the draft order is suitable for the investment of trust funds and I therefore commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We approve of this order and would like to say that Barclays Bank (Ireland) Limited are a very welcome addition to the number of financial outlets that now exist in respect of trustee investments.  This represents an excellent development in the whole area of investment banking in Ireland.  The Minister has stated that there are now 35 such outlets and this is an addition to the substantial range of outlets for such investments.  Even if we do not have a healthy investment climate, at least we have a certain degree of health in the institutional aspect of the investment scene.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. II) Regulations 1985, and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporters Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1985,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Dáil on the 27th day of June, 1985.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations would be to reduce from £1.10 to 75p the fees payable in respect of pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  I would hope, with the approval of the House, to have the remission of these fees made effective from 1 April 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present veterinary inspection fee of £1.10 per pig was introduced on 1 January 1984.  The bacon curers have, however, since May 1982 been refusing <Col N="253" /> to pay veterinary inspection fees on pigs. One of the main reasons for their refusal to pay was that they held that it was inequitable that they should have to observe a certain level of hygiene standards and costs in relation to their premises and products which did not apply to local pork slaughterers.</P>
    <P>In December last the Government, therefore, authorised the drafting of a Bill providing that standards of veterinary control and hygiene at slaughtering premises catering solely for the home market should be brought into line with those applying at export factories, and that the fees for veterinary inspection be correspondingly in line.  The preparation of this legislation is well advanced and I would hope to bring it before the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In addition to their complaints about inequities <i>vis-à-vis</i> local pork slaughterers, the bacon curers also maintained that the level of the veterinary fee itself was too high, particularly in relation to the fees being charged by our main competitors on export markets.  There was therefore a case for reducing the level of fee to improve the industry's export competitiveness, particularly in view of the difficulties which the industry has been experiencing in recent times.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, the Government decided to reduce the present level of inspection fee and to come to an arrangement in relation to arrears of fees due.</P>
    <P>After protracted negotiations we have recently come to an agreement with the industry that payment of veterinary inspection fees for pigs would be resumed at the reduced rate of 75p from 1 April 1985.  In addition, a sum of 15p per pig towards arrears will be payable once the legislation harmonising inspection standards and costs between bacon curers and local pork slaughterers is enacted and implemented.  These financial arrangements will, of course, be reviewed on an ongoing basis &mdash; and have been agreed with the industry.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the revenue from these arrangements will be short of what we estimated would be received if current <Col N="254" /> fees had been paid.  The plain fact of the matter is, however, that if we had to go along the road of full recovery of fees this could give rise to serious difficulties in the industry.  Many factories could have been faced with intolerable bills which, along with the other difficulties now faced by the industry, might have been too much and may have resulted in closures.</P>
    <P>The important thing now is that the industry must set about the task of organising itself to meet the challenges that lie ahead on both the export and home markets.</P>
    <P>Improved efficiency in marketing and processing is essential if we are to have an export industry.  On the domestic market we will soon be faced with the challenge presented by the removal of our import derogations under EC law.  It is vital that the industry be in a position to compete with possible imports.  To do this effectively it will need to place a far greater emphasis on product quality and product diversification.  Plant modernisation will be an integral part of this.  Significant amounts of both EC and national aid have been made available for this purpose and are available to suitable applicants.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies on all sides of the House will lend their support to the proposed regulations which are now before the House in draft form and will join with me in urging the pigmeat industry to set about the task of overcoming the challenges now facing it.  We have shown a readiness to respond to their difficulties and we will be anxious to continue to help whenever we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome any measures which will put an end to the conflict regarding arrears of veterinary fees.  Since 1982 the bacon curers have been refusing on several grounds to pay. One of them was that their competitors were not faced with this type of charge and secondly the pork slaughters had no fee.  We have discussed over the past few months the question of hygiene standards and the fact that many slaughtering houses do not have to comply with factory <Col N="255" /> regulations.  It is regrettable that factories have not catered for this market.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that in December 1984 the Minister for Agriculture sought and received the approval of the Government to introduce legislation which would provide for harmonisation of charges and standards in both kinds of slaughtering houses and the temporary introduction of a reduced inspection fee.</P>
      <P>It is also very satisfying that the IBSC have agreed to the resumption of the payment of the proposed new fee of £75 per pig retrospective to 1 April.  There will also be an addition of 15p per pig in respect of arrears.  These measures will bring a semblance of regularity into the pig industry than many Members because we have one of the best factories in the country in County Monaghan which has made great strides in the development of markets abroad.  It has given much needed employment and that must be continued.  We would welcome anything that can be done to improve the standard generally, to improve hygiene and our position in the market.  We had a great pork market for a couple of years but that is no longer the case and we will have to get into the American market if we want to develop the industry to its full potential.</P>

However, I wish to raise the subject again because, over the last 12 months, there has been a considerable delay in the inspection of new houses.  It is not uncommon for Deputies to contact the Department in writing or by telephone <Col N="256" /> requesting an inspection which would result in a grant payment for people badly in need of it.

      <P>In many cases, four or five months elapse and nothing further is done.  It is very hard to explain to constituents that you had been in touch with the Department who said that they were sending a reminder to the inspector and it is very annoying not to get any decision. It must also be very annoying for the staff in O'Connell Bridge House to have continual queries directed at them in relation to the same people.  The Minister said that there was a shortage of staff and that one of the housing inspectors was ill but the person building his or her own house does not understand these delays. Normally, those building their own houses are waiting for the grant to pay builders' providers or contractors but they are also waiting for that grant to qualify for a loan subsidy which would be a sum of £1,000 in the first year.</P>
      <P>I know that many people have problems in securing sites and finance to build new houses.  At local authority level, we often deal with requests to increase the loans substantially.  However, to take a realistic view, the loan is probably as much as the person building the house will be able to pay in the years ahead. When people ask for my advice in regard to loans I tell them that they should be very wary of over-extending themselves. Those who build houses are usually young married couples who have added expense in regard to children and in furnishing their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the people who have been building over the years lived in other accommodation and perhaps did not qualify for grants.  I have stated continuously that we should ease the burden in every way possible by providing serviced sites.  I have discovered from inquiries that many local authorities charge a high price for their serviced sites.  In fact, one could say that the figure is fixed with a view to making a profit.  The case made is that the local authority have to spend a lot of <Col N="257" /> money providing services such as water, sewerage and ESB.  It has always been my belief that more should be done in regard to the provision of serviced sites to make it easier for people to buy their own home.  I understand that the Exchequer pays in the region of £100 million in rent subsidies to local authorities.  Just 12 months ago local authorities would have had to obtain £20 per week in rent for the average council house but the average rent was £4 per week.  That is the reason for the massive subsidy.</P>
    <P>Huge sums of money have been spent on capital works in recent years such as the provision of schools, hospitals and so on but very little has been made available to ease the burden of the person anxious to buy his or her own house, the individual who would be seeking a loan to buy a house costing from £16,000 upwards.  I can recall that when I first became a Member the average price of a house was £4,000 but the assistance given then has not increased very much.  A lot of the employment in the construction industry is provided by builders erecting houses for people qualified to obtain the £1,000 grant.  In the case of those people every penny counts.</P>
    <P>I hear many complaints at local clinics about the delay in getting housing inspectors to call to view houses.  Up to a few years ago only six weeks elapsed between the time the file was sent to the housing inspector and its return to the applicant. However, in the last two years it has taken up to five months to deal with such applications.  In recent weeks a woman whose husband died since he applied for a grant told me that the file was sent to the housing inspector last March.  Due to the delay in dealing with applications staff should be moved around to areas where there is a big backlog.  Cavan and Monaghan have not received the same attention as other counties in regard to house inspections.  We should consider redeploying staff.  We can no longer afford to have officials placed in one area and not be in a position to cover other districts. As a result of the backlog in regard to house inspections technicians or other <Col N="258" /> qualified people should be brought in to help out.</P>
    <P>Some Department inspectors appear to have a bee in their bonnet in regard to applications to convert garages to living quarters.  I have heard of people being turned down because the inspector felt that such work would be in excess of the limits applicable to new house grants. The Minister should insist on his inspectors being lenient in this regard.  There should not be a rigid interpretation of the regulations.  In many cases the people building houses are not aware of the floor area because the plans are drawn up by architects.  It is wrong to deprive such people of house grants.  I am aware of two cases where people have had to revise a plan for their houses to ensure that there would not be access from the garage to the house in order to comply with the regulations.  Department officials should be lenient in such cases.  It should be within the competence of the Department to redeploy staff to prevent a hold-up in dealing with applications.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Chair that Deputy Wilson, who sought the question on the Adjournment, had intended to speak but understood that the matter would be dealt with at a later stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the position of Deputy Wilson.  I could have been caught in the same manner except that my secretary managed to locate me for the debate. We dealt with this matter last week and I had hoped that I made it clear what the problem was.  Generally, in so far as the administration of the grant schemes is concerned, the position at present is reasonably satisfactory and every effort is made to avoid undue delays.  The average <Col N="259" /> length of time for inspections throughout the country is about six weeks.  The period for inspections depends on a number of factors, the principal one being the inspector's workload at a time an inspection is requested.  For geographical reasons, and because of the need to arrange visits on an economic basis, it is possible that from time to time there may be longer delays than average in certain cases.</P>
      <P>I know from my own experience as a Deputy how anxious grant applicants are to have any necessary inspections carried out at short notice.  This is quite understandable, since many applicants will be waiting to get construction work under way or will be waiting for the grant payments so that they can meet any financial liabilities that they have incurred.  I would like to see a system under which we could have inspections virtually on demand but I have to face the reality that such a system would not be practicable either on grounds of cost or staff availability. The most we can do is to endeavour to keep the time required for inspections at a reasonable level.  I know that Deputies can, from time to time, cite cases in which there has been what may appear at first sight to have been unacceptable delays in carrying out inspections.  This is inevitable in a system in which we are processing such large numbers of grant applications and payments; and Deputies will appreciate that in a task of this size there must be cases that will require inspection periods above the norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cavan/Monaghan situation has been one area where particular problems have arisen.  As Deputies know, staffing difficulties in that area have given rise to longer delays than normal.  Following the retirement of a supervising inspector in Donegal last year a housing inspector from the Cavan/Monaghan area was appointed to fill this post in a temporary capacity.  A housing inspector from another area was subsequently sent to the Cavan/Monaghan area to help clear the backlog of cases which had accumulated. It is not possible to return the original inspector to the Cavan/Monaghan <Col N="260" /> area because he is seriously ill in hospital. His earlier replacement is now providing cover for another vacancy arising from a recent promotion.  I am conscious that there is still a particular problem in Cavan/Monaghan and I promised the Deputy last week that I intend to have a further look at the position in this area to see if anything can be done, with the resources we have available, to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Given the overall number of grant applications, which at present are of the order of 550 per week, it is inevitable, as I have said, that there will arise individual cases where longer delays than normal occur.  For instance in relation to new house grants Deputies will appreciate that it is a condition of payment that the house must be occupied as a normal place of residence.  It frequently arises in such cases that when an inspector calls he finds the house unoccupied and this requires him to carry out a further inspection.  It is, of course, fully appreciated by me and my Department that it may cause hardship in certain circumstances if an applicant has to wait unduly for an inspection. My Department are prepared to make every effort to facilitate an applicant in such circumstances, and in this connection I might mention the arrangements whereby inspections are arranged at short notice to cater for emergency cases on the house improvement side.  Deputies may be aware of particular cases where they feel that there have been undue delays.  I will arrange to have any such cases looked into if they are brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>Overall, I can assure the House that it is my aim at all times to ensure that a uniform and satisfactory service is provided to all grant applicants throughout the country.  There will be unforeseen circumstances which can produce an imbalance from time to time as has happened in Cavan/Monaghan but, despite this, I am satisfied that a reasonable service is being provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard mentioned that garages may be a cause for losing a grant if it is converted or considered to have been built for conversion.  Some time ago a <Col N="261" /> change was made to increase the measurements for grant sized houses.  Internal walls were not to be taken into the measurement; the external measurement was to be taken as the guide.  This meant we could increase the size of the house, and the floor area was measured from the outside walls.  A number of instances were brought to my notice where the garage was obviously intended for future conversion.  That may not have been so in other cases where the garage was built in accordance with specific plans, but in the cases brought to my notice it appeared that a car could not have been driven <Col N="262" /> through the space where the door would be and it was obvious that the arrangement was to convert this space after the inspection had been completed.  I have set down guidelines which will make it clear exactly what one can or cannot do as regards building a garage.  I hope this will be of benefit to Deputies when explaining this matter to their constituents.</P>

The incidence of overcrowding is rare and arises from unforeseen or unforeseeable events.

I should explain that the criteria used in assessing standards for safety in CIE trains are determined by <Col N="41" /> CIE.

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will provide details of the volume of imports of hides, leather and component parts, including plastic material, from all countries inside and outside the EC, especially Third World countries for each of the past 15 years; and the reason no effective action was taken to stem the inflow of foreign leather and plastic materials which have had such a ruinous effect on the Irish leather tanning and footwear industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy are published by the Central Statistics Office and are obtainable in the &ldquo;Trade Statistics of Ireland&rdquo; series.</P>
      <P>Ireland's industrial progress is heavily dependent on the degree of freedom of international trading and any measures to reduce that mutual freedom, between trading partners, would be seriously disadvantageous to Ireland.  Our trading obligations are of course defined within the context of our membership of the EC agreements with third countries arising from EC trade agreements.</P>
      <P>In practical terms, the market for cheap low-quality leathers is not an appropriate target market for the high-quality hides and leathers arising in Ireland. The best prospects of success for Irish hide processing lie in converting the high-quality raw material into the high priced quality and speciality leathers for which a significant market exists in Europe and the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leather is not a homogeneous product; <Col N="51" /> different types and qualities of hides are required to manufacture different leathers for different end uses.  One result of this is that the type of hide arising in Ireland is not suitable for many kinds of leather products and therefore the importation of leathers would be necessary however successful the Irish tanneries.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Irish market for the kinds of leathers produced here is far too small to support a viable leather industry. The main markets for Irish leather lie outside Ireland and the importation of leathers of various kinds into Ireland has, therefore, little effect on the tanneries.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of plastic materials substituting for leather in the footwear and other industries is also, in the first instance, similarly bound up with our international trading obligations.  The practical situation arising from the shift from leather to plastic materials in, e.g., the footwear industry, similarly has little relevance to the development of the Irish leather industry.  The dictates of the market ensure that there is little, if any, effective substitution between cheap plastic materials and high-quality leather. The effects of such imports on the Irish tanning industry would therefore be minimal.</P>

Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recoverd under PAYE from other pension by means of the restricted tax free allowances.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, for the current year, 1985-86, the taxpayer has been granted all the tax free allowances to which he proved title.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax free allowances are reduced to take account of his social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the retirement pension by means of the restricted tax free allowances.  The figure of £50.95 mentioned in the Question includes an amount of £46.35 in respect of income tax payable.  The balance of £4.60 represents the youth employment levy and health contribution.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension.  Both he and his wife are also recipients of social welfare pensions.  It is standard practice in such cases to collect the tax attributable to the social welfare pensions which are paid gross by restricting the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE which are set against the other pension.  As it is expected that the taxpayer's estimated total income for the current year, 1985-86, will not greatly exceed the appropriate exemption threshold of £6,000, he has been granted a measure of marginal relief.  An amended certificate of tax free allowances incorporating this relief and <Col N="63" /> granting allowances of £570 or £47.57 per month was issued to him on 20 May 1985. Any tax overdeducted from his retirement pension since 6 April last was refundable by the payer of that pension on operation of the amended certificate.</P>

      <P>The circular referred to was sent by the Eastern Health Board to most voluntary organisations funded by the Board.  It informs them of restrictions on the board's funds for the current year and advises them not to incur expenditure in anticipation of additional funding by the board.  The circular also advises the voluntary organisations to ensure that if at all possible a greater proportion of their expenditure is met by income from sources other than the board and mentions the importance of ensuring that realistic contributions are collected from those availing of their services who can afford to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board have assured me that no pressure has been brought to bear on any organisation with regard to the recommendations contained in the circular.

      <P>The action of the health board arises, of course, from current restrictions on public spending and is a necessary measure to ensure the continued maintenance of certain voluntary services for persons with needs in the health area.</P>

      <P>The current statutory minimum wage for farm labourers is £99.73 on average nationally, just half the average male adult wage in industry.  In the case of large families the additions to the personal rate in respect of adult and child dependants can sometimes result in weekly unemployment payments which are close to, if not higher than, earnings from very low paid work.  This happens in only a very small proportion of cases.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to maintain the incentive to work by topping up the wages of low paid workers with families.  For example, a farm labourer with seven children, who is on the average statutory minimum wage would be entitled to a weekly supplement of £18, bringing his gross income up to £117.73.</P>
      <P>In a further development of family support within the social welfare system, the Government are planning to introduce a child benefit scheme which will incorporate a partial reduction in the child dependant increases to various social welfare payments into a higher monthly benefit. This will be paid regardless of whether the family breadwinner is at work or not, and will help to maintain a reasonable balance between earnings and unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Acts provide that one of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of a contributory old age pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 qualifying contributions from 5 January 1953 or from his year of entry into insurance, <Col N="78" /> whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.  Therefore, pre-1953 contributions cannot be taken into account for the purpose of calculating a person's yearly average.</P>
      <P>The husband of the person concerned reached age 66 years on 17 March 1979. He claimed a contributory old age pension on 4 December 1980.  The Department's records show that he was insured at the modified rate payable in respect of permanent and pensionable public servants from 1950 to his retirement in 1978. This rate provides entitlement to a restricted range of benefits only.  It does not include cover for contributory old age pension or retirement pension and is not, therefore, a qualifying contribution for either pension.  In the circumstances he cannot be awarded a contributory old age pension or retirement pension.  The qualifying conditions for contributory old age pension and retirement pension are among the matters being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare in its general review of social welfare schemes.</P>

      <P>Employment is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts if it is under a contract of service.  Such a contract exists where there is a master-servant relationship between the employer and employee and where the employer has the right of control, direction and dismissal over the employee.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, who is employed by a limited company, has described himself as a self-employed heating and plumbing installer.  A survey carried out by an outdoor officer of the Department revealed that there are only two employees in the company, the person concerned and his wife who is a director of the company.  It was held by the deciding officer that the person concerned although operating through the formal structure of a limited company is in reality in control and is not therefore employed under a contract of service. He decided that his employment was not therefore insurable under the Social Welfare Acts during the period from April 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was notified of this decision and advised that if he was dissatisfied with it he could appeal against it by notifying the Department in writing.

He will be entitled to a refund of these contributions and this will be made to him shortly if he does not indicate that he wishes to have his case reviewed by an appeals officer.  If he appeals, the refund procedure will be delayed until the appeals officer has given his decision.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit in the years 1980, 1981 and 1982.

The person concerned has claimed unemployment benefit intermittently since 26 February 1984.

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires the person concerned to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from 5 January 1953 to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached age 65. The person concerned does not satisfy the condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of only 15 Irish contributions in the required period, which in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.  This is equal to a yearly average of less than one.

    <P>Under EC Regulations he qualifies for an Irish <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension on the basis of his combined British and Irish records from 1953.

This is a reduced rate of benefit based on a yearly average of 28 insurance contributions on her insurance record between her date of entry into insurance and the last complete contribution year prior to the date of desertion.  For benefit at the maximum rate (in her case £67.90) an average of at least 48 contributions would be required.

      <P>The free travel facility which is available in this country to persons aged 66 and over and to permanently incapacitated beneficiaries under that age is unique and no similar state-sponsored scheme operates in other member states of the EC.  An extension of this scheme to allow beneficiaries to travel free throughout the EC could, therefore, be expected to encounter significant difficulties of a practical nature and would have considerable financial implications. There are no proposals for such an extension in present circumstances.  Concessionary travel on certain European rail and shipping services is, however, provided by certain transport companies to elderly persons under the rail europe senior scheme.  This scheme is administered in Ireland by CIE.</P>

They say in fact that an initial effect of the introduction of a Neighbourhood Watch scheme can be to produce an increase in recorded crime because of an increased <Col N="108" /> public awareness and willingness to report crime.  Garda experience, however, of the limited number of schemes which have been in operation for some time is that they have had positive effects in terms of crime detection and prevention and have promoted better Garda &mdash; community co-operation.</P>

      <P>My Department have been encouraging schools to provide equality of educational opportunity to girls and boys.  Principals of co-educational schools are encouraged to operate them on a fully co-educational basis by offering subjects to pupils without categorisation and to foster actively non-traditional subject take-up by girls.  Indeed, it is a source of concern to me that where girls have opportunities to study subjects such as physics, higher level mathematics, engineering, construction studies and technical drawing, only a relatively small number do so, presumably due to factors such as societal attitudes, parental expectations and peer pressures.  Single sex girls' schools which lack physical facilities to offer instruction in non-traditional subjects such as woodwork, technical drawing, etc., are encouraged to co-operate with schools in their vicinity and to have shared use of specialised facilities.  The school inspectorate is available to offer advice to schools who wish to amend their subject options, to improve their curricular balance and to make optimum use of their existing resources.  Where resources are considered inadequate, sympathetic consideration will be given by my Department to any representations from school authorities.  It is open to the authorities of any school to put proposals to the Department for the provision of improved facilities and accommodation. All proposals will be considered on their merits.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a new and simplified scheme of grants for certain special subjects in secondary schools in 1985 and Árd Scoil Rís, Limerick, received a grant of £1,310.  The previous grants scheme, where grants were paid in arrears, proved to be very complex and difficult to operate and was the source of many complaints from both managers and schools.</P>
      <P>Before a new scheme could be introduced, it was first necessary to clear a backlog of claims where my Department had financial commitments to the schools concerned.  Under this arrangement Árd Scoil Rís received a payment of £9,369 in May 1985.  Because of the introduction of the new scheme, no claims submitted by schools in respect of school year 1984-85 were processed and therefore a commitment to payment was not made in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost in 1985 of clearing the backlog of claims absorbed a very substantial proportion of the total relevant Estimates provision.  However, with this backlog cleared, the financial position in 1986 will be much more favourable.  I am also satisfied that the new system of payment will make for earlier payment and a more equitable distribution of the moneys available.  I do not accept the suggestion that it will not be possible for the school to operate effectively within the existing grants scheme and I am satisfied that the amounts paid by my Department to the school authorities represent the amounts properly payable in accordance with the regulations.

The provision of two additional classrooms has been approved to cater for increased enrolments in the school year commencing September 1985.
