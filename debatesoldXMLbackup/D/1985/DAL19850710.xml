      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 12 and 13, to delete the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; and subsititute the folowing definition:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of 63 <Col N="1115" /> amendments which the Minister submitted in the last three days and some of them, notably those submitted yesterday, are amendments to amendments.  In the course of one day we are expected to give proper consideration to very important legislation in respect of which the Minister has submitted 50 other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy bear with the Chair for a moment?  This is a limited debate which must conclude at 7 p.m.  The Deputy is making a speech which would have been in order when I asked whether the arrangements for today's Order of Business were agreed.  The Chair was told they were agreed without debate and it is not reasonable now to start on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Chair's point and we are bound by that order, but we should not convey an impression to the public that we are going to give adequate consideration to this very important legislation today.  We would need at least three weeks to discuss all stages in a reasonable way.  In my view we will do no service to anyone by taking all the amendments and all stages of this very important Bill in one day.  If some people think that is the way we should do our business it it not our view.  We like to co-operate on matters of national interest but it will be impossible to co-operate in this case.  Even if we give only limited consideration to some matters which will come up for discussion, it is obvious that we will not even get as far as sections 5 or 6.  That is not the way to deal with legislation.  When we talk later about the intentions of the legislators, let us not try to fool ourselves that the legislators had any opportunity to consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not deny Deputy O'Kennedy the opportunity which presents itself to make that point, but the arrangement of business, not just for today or for this Bill but for this week have been agreed between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1116" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of order.  If the Minister wants to make a point in his contribution, I will allow him to make a passing reference to it, as Deputy O'Kennedy did.  I appeal to Members to make the best use of the time unanimously set aside by the House for the disposal of this item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's first amendment was circulated on 5 July.  In my view he should have given the reasons why this amendment has been introduced. It is not good enough for a Minister to come here and say &ldquo;I move&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are major issues involved in this amendment and I propose to deal with them but not at too great a length.  This amendment extends the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  Originally it said that &ldquo;husbandry and cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; but now it reads &ldquo;husbandry and includes horticulture, fruit growing, seed growing, dairy farming and livestock breeding and keeping and the use of land as grazing land, meadow land, osier land, market gardens and nursery grounds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is that any activities covered within that extended definition will not be liable to tax under section 3 provided they are under 20 adjusted acres.  That exposes one of the first anomalies in a Bill which is full of anomalies.  This legislation ensures that intensive activity, be it pig breeding, livestock breeding of one form or another or market gardening, nursery gardens and so on, is now an exempted farm unit because it is under 20 adjusted acres. The Minister may say that he will do something about this in the Finance Act of next year but from the beginning of the operation of this legislation all those units, provided that they are under 20 adjusted acres, are now exempted by virtue of this definition.  I cannot understand why this amendment has been introduced at the last moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not just about equity between farmers and the PAYE sector, <Col N="1117" /> but also within the farming community. This type of amendment is very unfair to the PAYE sector.  Significantly, the Minister now present is not the Minister who introduced this and the amendments are all in the name of the Minister for the Environment.  Why is that Minister not here today, when he was dealing with them earlier?  If certain activities which can produce very substantial, intense activity leading to a very considerable income are now being exempted, even from the farm tax, what justification can there be for that?  It points out the anomaly that exists in the legislation, that once you move into an area of making special rules for special categories, as distinct from applying the same regulations to all to ensure the same fair measure of tax, obviously you get anomalies of this kind which are not only unfair but obviously seriously so.  That is the only comment I would make in relation to this first of about 70 amendments introduced by the Minister into his own legislation.  If the rest follow the pattern of the first, I am afraid that it is four months that we would need for a debate on this matter, not the five or six hours available to us at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should like to support the case made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  It is wrong and unfair, even to the Minister but more particularly to us here on the Opposition benches, to expect us to do justice to this legislation within the time allocated.  I appeal to the Minister now to proceed with the completion of this legislation today, in order to give us an opportunity of looking into some aspects of it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that this legislation is complete nonsense.  I shall explain this as we proceed with the debate on the sections.  The legislation will not achieve what the Government intend it to achieve, as outlined in <i>Building on Reality:</i> to double the take of income tax from farmers &mdash; tax, not income tax, because this is not a tax on income, it is a tax on resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 1 and the amendment as introduced by the Minister, I would ask <Col N="1118" /> him to clarify a situation where a person takes land under the conacre system, that is 11 months letting of land.  It appears that the person who owns the land and not the person using it is liable for the land tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to interrupt, if I may, to direct the Deputy along the right lines.  The point he is making now would probably be quite in order on section 1, but we are dealing now with the definition of agricultural land and that is all that is before the House at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> But the definition of agriculture, a Cheann Comhairle, is what is concerned in the Minister's amendment.  I accept that my argument possibly would properly come under that section.  Briefly, a whole new meaning is being given to agriculture.  I ask the Minister, particularly at this point, to outline in detail the purpose of the amendment and why it was necessary to elaborate still further on the detailed definition of what agriculture really is and of what is involved.  Many of the areas outlined by the Minister would not necessarily come under the definition of agriculture at all.  Many of those would, to a certain extent, come under commercial enterprises.  They are, of course, allied to agriculture, but in so far as the farm tax aspect is concerned, I do not see where this will arise.  Many of the enterprises outlined do not necessarily need land at all.  Where is the aspect of tax and how will tax be collected from the people involved in those enterprises? Many are farmyard enterprises and do not need land for their development. Would the Minister outline in detail the thinking behind the introduction of this amendment and explain the changes subsequent on the introduction of the legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, on the same point as Deputy Noonan made at the end, it is very important that the Minister should explain precisely why this amendment is needed.  The original Bill <Col N="1119" /> sounds a little crazy &mdash;&ldquo;agriculture means husbandry&rdquo;.  If one had husbandry in the Bill, one would put down that definition as &ldquo;husbandry means agriculture&rdquo;. The whole business of definitions in this area is a little crazy.  Why does the Minister then have to expand on the theme?</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's point seems reasonable but nevertheless it is not, because these items were excluded even before this new definition.  Already, any holding under 20 adjusted acres &mdash; and that included market gardening or whatever &mdash; was excluded and is still excluded.</P>

      <P>Probably, it can still be caught.  Could the Minister also explain what horticulture means now?  It does not mean fruit growing, or market gardening, or nursery grounds, or seed growing.  They are all included separately. So what does horticulture mean? There is a new one on me &mdash; osier land. Perhaps the Minister would explain what this means?  It has been described to me, but I was amazed at that definition.  I would be afraid to mention what I was told it was.</P>
      <P>What is the need for, or purpose of this specific list of detailed farming enterprises? Why was it necessary to list them all under agriculture?  Possibly some are missing.  They just happened to catch osier land, but there may be something they missed and which is not in this definition. Why is it necessary to list these items?  Was there pressure to put them in?  What was the purpose of listing them?</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to elaborate further on the definition of agriculture as given in the Bill.  In <Col N="1120" /> the Bill as published it is stated that &ldquo;agriculture' means husbandry and cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  In this amendment we are giving more clarity to the phrase &ldquo;cognate words shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  I wish to point out that we followed the original definition, namely, that agriculture means husbandary and we have elaborated on it by saying it includes the series of items we have indicated.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to think this is unfair in that the effect of this definition &mdash; which clarifies the definition rather than extends it &mdash; means that somehow we have changed the thrust of the Bill and that we have taken a number of things out of the charge to farm tax.  Of course that is not the case.  These items would have been covered before but we have made it more clear in the Bill.  As the Deputy knows, I have a great passion for clarity in legislation.  We have made more clear what is to be covered under the definition of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what types of enterprise are involved is a little different. Deputy Noonan indicated that in his view some of the activities listed here are commercial activities.  To the extent that some of the activities here are currently treated in a different way from general husbandry for income tax purposes, that position remains unchanged because this Bill does not deal with income tax.  It deals only with the application of farm tax.  If Deputies feel there is a case for proposing a different kind of income tax treatment for any one of the activities listed here, or for any agricultural activity not specifically listed here, they are free to make the point. However, I suggest it should not be made in the context of this Bill because this deals only with farm tax and it is our intention that farm tax will not apply to holdings of less than 20 adjusted acres.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan thought that some of the activities listed here are commercial activities that do not need land.  I cannot find one activity listed that does not need land.  Horticulture needs land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Fruit growing and seed growing need land.  Dairy farming needs land.  In the most commonly accepted terms of the phrase, livestock breeding needs land.  Even intensive livestock breeding or activities such as those carried out in the bull performance testing station near my home need land. Obviously the keeping and use of land as grazing land needs land, as does the operation of meadow land.  Market gardens and nursery grounds obviously need land.  Osier land also requires land.  For the benefit of Deputy Mac Giolla, osier land is land on which are grown those species of willow that produce the cane used for basket work.  It is not a widely practised culture here but nevertheless we have provided for it because I am informed there is some activity under that heading.</P>
      <P>As far as intensive units are concerned, such as intensive pig production units that do not use considerable amounts of farmland, if they do not use 20 adjusted acres or more there is no farm tax but in itself that makes no difference to the way they are treated for income tax purposes.  As I pointed out before, this Bill does not make any provisions about income tax. This is to establish a farm tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked if I had missed anything in the definitions.  I do not think so.  While it is not an exhaustive list, it is as comprehensive as it can be at the moment.  Since it incorporates the word &ldquo;includes&rdquo;, clearly it is intended that the list is not an exhaustive one.</P>

      <P>What the Minister has said indicates that he does not understand the amendment, much less the legislation introduced by the Minister for the Environment.  I will put this bluntly and simply to him: this Bill exempts the activities in agriculture, and the others now included in the amendment, from taxation if they are under 20 adjusted acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only tax that can apply to them.  Is the Minister now suggesting that, in the case of a conventional agricultural holding under 20 adjusted acres which will be exempt from farm tax, he can catch it under some other heading?  Is that the Minister's suggestion? The farmers will be happy to know that apparently exemption does not mean exemption.  The Minister is on impossible ground here.  Whatever sense it made originally in terms of conventional farmers as far as the exemption for people with less than 20 adjusted acres is concerned, what the Minister is now proposing makes no sense.  It demonstrates that this Bill is a nonsense from start to finish.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense to extend the definitions to cover situations where there are intensive units of activity which, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, are more commercial than agriculture.  I do not say that is wrong; it should be encouraged.  We are talking about fair play.  Land is required for intensive pig breeding just as some land would be required for a shop.  We are talking about fair play.  One needs space for anything.  The Minister must recognise that the answer he has given is not in any way adequate or satisfactory. We are totally opposed to this controversial but very important legislation. It is legislation that is unfair to the farmers and to the PAYE sector.  It would be a monument to our ineffectiveness as legislators for us to put this Bill through today.  We could not even begin to discuss all the very important issues involved today and if any other answer from the Minister should be as inaccurate and as unsatisfactory as the last one, we will be making a show of ourselves as legislators.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister spoke strongly a few moments ago about the question of clarity but in a situation where there is a farmyard enterprise but where there is no land as such or where the amount of land is less than 20 adjusted acres, would the person operating the enterprise be subject to income tax in the normal way?  Also, in the case of there being a farmyard enterprise on a farm in respect of which the owner, because of the adjusted acreage, was liable to farm tax, would the enterprise be subject to income tax while the farm itself was subject to land tax?</P>

      <P>I wish to reinforce the points made by Deputies O'Kennedy and Noonan.  From my reading of the national plan and from what the Government <Col N="1125" /> have communicated to the farmers it seems to be the intention that farmers with holdings of agricultural land of between 20 and 80 adjusted acres will be liable for farm tax but not for income tax.

      <P>Assuming that is the intention, what is to be the position of a person engaged in one of these various activities referred to in the Minister's amendment if the enterprise is being conducted on a holding of, say, 21 adjusted acres?  Will that person not be liable for income tax on the profits of the enterprise and be liable only for one fifth of the farm tax if the marginal relief is applied?  That seems to be anomalous and can hardly be the Government's intention.</P>

      <P>Surely the definition of agricultural activities refers to those activities engaged in in the interest of profit.  Otherwise we could have the situation whereby commissioners of Public Works who might be using land in our national parks as grazing land for deer or for other purposes, not as a profit making exercise but for public amenity purposes, would be included in the definition that agriculture means husbandry and using land as grazing land, meadow land and so on.  Should we not make it clear that the activities being included are those that are profit making as distinct from activities that are for amenity reasons?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to another anomaly in this Bill, that is the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, the truth of the matter is that this Bill intends to tax the person who is entitled legally to ownership irrespective of whether that person is actually engaged in agricultural activity.  That is what this section says in effect.  I will not admit that the Minister is best qualified in this House in terms of interpreting legal effect.  I think I can say modestly I know an awful lot more and have had an awful lot more experience on it.  To put it in general terms, in effect, when one reads through section 1 (a), (b) and (c) of the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, one will <Col N="1129" /> find that the purpose in general terms, which the Minister likes to use, is to tax the person entitled to the use of the land even though he may have leased it, he may have an agent working it or have another person physically in possession.</P>
      <P>This exposes another anomaly in this Bill.  If we want to tax people on the basis of their income are we really going to introduce a nonsense whereby perhaps a disabled wife, or a widow whose husband had been farming fairly profitably, with a young family or whatever and who suddenly finds that she cannot adequately do so, will be treated the same as every other farmer if she leases the place, contracts it or whatever else?  That is demonstrably unfair.  Any of us who have had any experience of rural life &mdash; and the Minister should know a little about it &mdash; knows that.  We should be arguing that point alone for days.  That is what the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; in this section demonstrates. A situation may arise in which the person actually doing the farming would be liable to income tax and, because they have taken a contract or whatever else they are not covered under this provision and they are treated as the person liable to pay.  Presumably such a person will have to pay on income.  If I take a lease, a conacre letting or whatever from the person legally entitled, I am not liable under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; presumably I am but this Bill does not say so &mdash; to income tax.  Would the Minister please address himself to the point: why in hell's name should one distinguish between the person who is earning his income, having to pay conacre or whatever else from farming and the other person who is farming on the property of which he is the registered owner?  That is the distinction being drawn here.</P>
      <P>As we go through this all too short a day I will demonstrate to this Minister at every single opportunity all of the anomalies contained in this Bill and the fact that, when it comes to it, he will not get it under way anyway.  I repeat my plea: would he please allow us to discuss it properly and say &ldquo;We will go as far as we can today and we will continue next term.&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Let me pose a direct question to the Minister under this section.  I am referring now to section 1 (b) where a person takes land on the conacre system, that is the 11 months letting system.  The person who owns the land and not the person using it is liable to the land tax.  This means that the owner of the land could very well be doubly taxed as he will be liable to income tax on his rental income.  In a similar way the person letting the land and deriving income therefrom would appear to be completely exempt from tax.  The Minister might clarify those points.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are open to so many different interpretations it is important that as we progress, even within the limited time at our disposal, we get as many definitions and clarifications as we can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> Perhaps the Minister would explain when replying, the term &ldquo;temporary depasturage&rdquo; in subsection (c).  Will the Minister also outline the situation in relation to people who are not owners of the land but who are in temporary occupation and who would have more substantial rights in law than would those operating under the 11-month letting system?  In relation to paragraph (b) would the Minister clarify the situation in a case where the person is the occupier of an agricultural landholding and where he is a relative within the meaning of that term in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, and where the two holdings are not separately managed?  Is the effect of this subsection that where there is any connection at all between the relatives who own two separate holdings then each of those persons would be fully liable for farm tax on the combined holdings?  Is there any provision for dividing up the farm tax in that situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a holding of substantial size and where both a father and son are farming it and where some of the land is transferred, what is the case in relation to the occupier clause?  I noticed that some of the advertisements taken out used the words &ldquo;for genuine transfers of land&rdquo;.  Would a father who had given land to his son before the passing of this Act be accepted as genuine and would someone who decides at a later stage to transfer half of his holdings be considered not to be genuine?  This clause is to deal with the question of tax avoidance, but on the other hand successive Government policy was to get land to younger farmers and the stamp duty exemption was an incentive to this end.</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy wants to use up his time making smart remarks there is nothing I can do to stop him.  I will answer the questions raised on the definition section.  We have set out here the definition of &ldquo;occupiers&rdquo; and we make the point that it is the person who is entitled to the immediate use or enjoyment of the land who is liable for tax.  In the vast majority of cases, since Irish farms are occupied by the owners, that means that the situation is perfectly clear. Where the land is leased by the owner to another person other than under conacre it is the other person who is liable for the tax because he has the use and enjoyment of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under conacre or temporary depasturage or adjustment, which Deputy O'Dea mentioned, which is a term which appears in the Land Acts and which was put in here to make sure that the definition covered all cases, it is the owner of the land who is liable for the tax.  In the normal course of events the fact that there is a farm tax liability on the land would be reflected in the price paid for the conacre.  The market will sort that out, although there is nothing in the Bill that requires a solution to be adopted except that it makes the owner of the land liable for the farm tax.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in relation to land which is the subject of a discretionary trust under which no one in particular has the right of possession.  In this case it is the trustees who are liable for the tax.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of this section is the anti-avoidance provision and the one which is most interesting to Deputy Yates.  It is intended to prevent situations in which there would be transfers of land within families or between related companies or connected persons simply to avoid tax.  Subsection (2) (a) means that the persons involved, including companies, would be regarded as one person for the purpose of section 4 (3) of the Bill under which the adjusted acreage of the holdings is determined and also would be regarded as one person for the purposes of section 3 (1) under which holdings become taxable farms.  Subsection (2) (b) makes an exception in the case where relatives are separately farming a holding and subsection (2) (c) provides that the question as to whether persons are connected is to be decided in accordance with the income tax law, subject to one minor modification.  The test is whether the two persons are farming the two farms separately.  If they are not farming two farms separately they will be treated as one person and one taxable farm and the liability will be calculated on the basis that they are one person and one farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;let me explain why.  This Bill develops the concept of the adjusted acre.  I will try to summarise it.  The Bill provides that it is &ldquo;any area of agricultural land ... the estimated capacity of which for agricultural production is equivalent to the capacity for such production of one acre of land capable of <Col N="1139" /> the estimated highest such production in the State ...&rdquo;.  That is the first area of doubt in determining the adjusted acre. The explanatory memorandum does a better job even.  It says: &ldquo;provides that an adjusted acre is an area of land with the equivalent productive potential of one acre of the best land in the State ...&rdquo;. Will someone please define with total confidence what in hell's blazes that means?  What lawyer will not be able to point out that the one acre of land was adjusted not in relation to the best land in the State but in relation to anything but the best?  There will be a million ways of getting across that point.</P>
      <P>The second area of doubt arises in regard to the phrase &ldquo;capable of the estimated highest such production&rdquo;.  The land is deemed to be capable of the highest such production based on an estimate, not the realised highest production in this notional acre of Tír na nÓg, wherever it is.  Before the first-year barrister even considers the rest of it he is already into money, a lawyer's bonanza.  If there is money to be made out of farming, the place to go now is into the Law Library of the Incorporated Law Society.  Why is this so?  The reason is to be found in subsection (2) which states that in estimating the capacity for argicultural production of land in any place regard shall be had to a whole range of factors which must be considered in determining the adjusted acreage.  Under this notional nonsense every acre will have to be adjusted taking into account each of these factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these factors is the range of uses to which the land can be put for the purposes of agricultural production. There was a time when people might have thought that the Minister had some association with agriculture but obviously this provision is capable of a multiplicity of interpretations.  In a mixed farming area the land could be put ot dairying use or could be used for fattening stores. There could be intense tillage activity or it could be used for mixed farming or sheep farming.  Which of these uses will determine the adjusted acreage?  The <Col N="1140" /> second point relates to the adequacy of the means of access to the land.  I accept that this is a very important point and is a reasonable criterion in determining the value of any land.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) (iii) refers to a following list of factors and any other natural phenomena affecting the capacity of the land for agricultural production.  The first factor on the list is the nature and qualify of the soil.  This implies that the nature and quality are different, one from the other.  I presume that the adjuster &mdash; or &ldquo;the adjuster man&rdquo; as he will come to be known if this proposal is ever implemented &mdash; will have to give evidence as to the exact nature of the soil.  He will be asked to give detailed evidence as to the ingredients of the soil.  This will have to be done on every farm, according to this Bill.  The qualify must also be assessed.  I am not too divorced from farming but some of my colleagues here are engaged in it.  I am only related to those who are engaged in farming.  The provision in regard to the nature and qualify of the soil will make a nonsense of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The next factor to be considered is the location and climate of the place.  Is the Minister serious?  Who will give evidence on the climate and the difference between Donegal, Kerry and Armagh? For once the people in Armagh will be glad to be excluded.  The Six Counties will be very happy to be excluded from this kind of nonsense.  Some farmers will say the climate is bad in Donegal or good in Wexford but that is not evidence.</P>
    <P>The next factor is whether the land is flat or sloping and, if it is sloping, the adjuster will have to measure the direction and degree of the slope.  Does the Minister not recognise that this is getting into cloud cuckooland?</P>
    <P>The next condition that must be taken into account is whether the land is sheltered. Let us assume we all know what &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; means but the legal definition will give rise to delays and expense.  In our part of the country when a young man marries a fairly old woman it will be said that he only went in there for shelter. The adjuster must also consider whether <Col N="1141" /> the land is overlooked by hills or mountains. I do not know what is intended to be conveyed by this phrase.  Some of the best land in Tipperary, my home place, is overlooked by hills and mountains.  The lads around Clonoulty and Boherlahan will be making a strong case to the Minister that the Galtees are looking down on them and asking if that means they are to be adjusted at a lower level.</P>
    <P>The subsection goes on to deal with the structure of the agricultural land holding of which the land forms part and then the natural drainage of the land.  How qualified will these adjusters be to determine on a casual visit the exact extent of the natural drainage, most of which is underground?</P>
    <P>The adequacy of the water supply to the land must also be considered.  The Minister has decided to delete the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo;.  If a farmer is inventive and efficient enough to provide a better water supply to his farm holding he will be effectively penalised under this legislation. He is penalised anyway for any kind of productive activity.  It then goes on to talk about the accessibility of the land and justice is not being done to its importance.</P>
    <P>To get an accurate figure of the adjusted acre we must refer to subsection (2) (b) which says:</P>
    <P>It shall be assumed that the land has been, is being and will continue to be, farmed, and that the land and the business of farming the land, has been, is being, and will continue to be, managed reasonably and reasonably efficiently,...</P>
    <P>The section goes on to mention the nature and amount of investment in land and the kind of investment we are talking about to get the standard notional, dreamland adjusted acre.  The section guarantees that this Bill will never get off the ground until it is brought to every court in the land.  When introducing this legislation the Minister for the Environment said:</P>
    <P>The classification of land will take some years to complete and will, as I mentioned earlier, commence with the bigger farms and work downwards. <Col N="1142" /> The tax will commence in 1986 and will be levied on the larger farms initially. The Bill facilitates this.  The effect will be that if, for example, by 1987 the classification has progressed down to, say, 40 adjusted acres, the threshold for liability to the tax in that year will be prescribed by the Minister for Finance at 40 adjusted acres.</P>
    <P>It is time, therefore, that the Minister told the PAYE sector that the threshold for liability might not be 20 adjusted acres for the first, second or third year.  My guess is that if the Government get 60 adjusted acres in the first year, they will be doing exceptionally well because the farmers, as is their right and obligation, will test the adjusted acreage determination on the basis of the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us that we do not have to abide by the obligations in the Bill and that the valuation adjuster will merely have to drop out to Ballycahill, cast an eye over the ditch, ask about cattle and tillage and work out the acreage without delving too deeply into the farmer's affairs.  This tax is based on nonsense and they will be waving flags and banners in honour of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment down at the Four Courts if this Bill goes through.  However, the farmers will have a different opinion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Section 2 will probably be found to be unconstitutional. The Minister's definition of an adjusted acre is based on its estimated capacity.  As Deputy O'Kennedy correctly pointed out, many factors must be taken into consideration when arriving at an adjusted acre for each holding and it seems to be an impossible task to value all holdings to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.  Far from simplifying the farm taxation system, this will give rise to numerous appeals.  Subsection (2) (b) states:</P>
      <P>it shall be assumed that the land has been, is being and will continue to be, farmed ... managed reasonably and reasonably efficiently ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> These definitions will give rise to controversy. The Commission on Taxation said that it would take up to 15 years to complete a proper survey on which to base valuations.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 June 1968 the Taoiseach &mdash; Deputy FitzGerald, as he then was &mdash; said that the study of Irish agricultural land made it quite clear that the Griffith Poor Law Valuation was completely unsuitable as a basis for taxation today and that if rates on agricultural land were to be maintained, it would be necessary to organise a review of valuations based on a programme of preparation of soil maps and crop productivity which was not being undertaken at that time.</P>
    <P>Rates on agricultural land were found to be unconstitutional but the Government and the Minister now persist in bringing in a land tax Bill to which he refers as a farm tax Bill but which, to all intents and purposes, is merely agricultural rates under a new guise.  I have no doubt that this will also be found to be unconstitutional as a vehicle for collecting tax from farmers.  There is no simple way whereby the hundred or so people who are now redeployed from the Land Commission and the other hundred land tax adjusters who are being recruited by the Government can adequately survey every farm of 20 acres or more.  The Taòiseach said that in 1968 and the chairman of the Commission on Taxation made a similar statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> There is no simple way to do this.  According to statistics compiled by An Foras Talúntais approximately 154,000 farms will have to be visited, surveyed and assessed.  The Minister for the Environment gave a commitment that every farm would be visited and I hope that takes place.  I understand that the adjusters will be allotted 770 farms and even if they work without stop every day for a number of years they will not have completed their task.  The survey will not be properly <Col N="1144" /> done by the time the tax is due to be levied.  The new farm tax commissioner and the staff will, in my view be given the power to classify and list farms even if the staff have not examined and adjusted them.</P>
      <P>We must also realise that there is no scientific basis for deciding what constitutes the value or production capacity of land.  For that reason this section will fall down badly.  There is no way one can decide what constitutes an acre of land except by scientific means, the only method that will stand up in law.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Yet the Minister is sending adjusters into the field to make such a decision without a scientific base.  Their personal opinions will decide the level of adjustment.  The appeals system will, undoubtedly, be snowed under with cases.  Our courts are likely to be kept very busy arising out of this incredible legislation.</P>
      <P>It is worth repeating what the Minister for Finance said in the course of a statement on 17 May 1983:</P>
      <P>If farmers were allowed the option of a system under which taxable incomes would be based on standard results, the more profitable farmers would be systematically undertaxed while the less profitable would have to keep accounts to avoid excessive income tax charges.  In any event a notional system of taxation for farmers would be inconsistent with the objective of treating all taxpayers on an equal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that statement the Minister has put forward my argument.  In the 1983 budget the Minister said that the public perception of tax equity demands that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing.  However, the Minister is treating one section of the community differently from another.  He is proposing to tax farmers on an adjusted acre not taking into account their capacity to pay, their domestic problems, borrowings and <Col N="1145" /> other considerations.  It is hard to understand why he made a statement to the effect that the public perception of tax equity demanded that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>The new tax will not take into consideration the capacity of the land involved to produce.  The Minister may argue that the tax on adjusted acres will allow farmers increase production but we must realise that quotas exist in all areas of agriculture. Increased production, therefore, does not arise.  The term &ldquo;adjusted acre&rdquo; is wide open to many interpretations and I have no doubt lawyers will have a field day in the courts over this.  The PLV system was declared unconstitutional and I have no doubt that the new tax will be held to be unconstitutional as a vehicle for taxing farmers.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputies opposite are anxious to make a positive contribution to the debate.  Adjusted acreage is not a new concept in farming. It has been used successfully by the Land Commission over a period of time and there were few problems in relation to the consideration they put on adjusted acreage when disposing of allotments of land to farmers.  That is not to say that I am happy about what may arise in relation to the adjusting of acreage.  I do not like referring to this form of taxation as a resource tax, which I hope it is not, and I do not want any Member to think that it is anything other than a tax on the potential productivity of land.  I believe the figure of £10 per acre to be reasonable. If the adjustment is carried out fairly and well it will alleviate a lot of the concern of the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> It is natural that people will be concerned about paying tax but for the Opposition spokesman to suggest that the Taoiseach was opposed to the adjusted acreage concept is misleading and misrepresents what he said in 1968. He found fault with the Griffith Poor Law Valuation system.  If the concept of adjusted acreage had been moved forward prior to 1979 a case might never have been put through the courts by the IFA.  There was an inequitable valuation on land that dated from the last century. Some highly valued land was adjacent to river beds and so on while good quality land had a lower valuation.  Consequently a level of unfair taxation was levied.  In view of the Minister's assurances about the method by which the acreage will be adjusted, I hope it will not be an armchair adjusting of acreage, as has been suggested. I am confident that each farm will be visited not only by one or two members of the Land Commission or by members of the ACOT service, but by others who will go there if there is a dispute arising from the level of adjustment.</P>
    <P>In my view, the majority of farmers are fair minded people and will accept what is a fair adjusting of the acreage.  Of that I have no doubt from my discussions with them, but difficulties may arise if there is opposition to inspectors going on to farms.  The Opposition should realise that to support that type of move would be to their disadvantage.  It would be a good move to ensure that there is equity in the farming area <i>vis-a-vis</i> what land can produce.  Even after extensive scientific studies have been carried out, we still might not arrive at a fair system.  Account should be taken of land which has been well managed, improved from a drainage point of view and reclaimed because many farms have been greatly improved over the last ten, 15 or 20 more years.  It takes a great deal of good husbandry and a greater input of fertilisation to maintain the fertility of soil and that, too, must be taken into account when acreage is being adjusted.</P>
    <P>Many other points have been made in the Bill and I agree with all of them but hopefully at the end of the day there will <Col N="1147" /> be little room for disagreement, concern or disputes.  If disputes do arise, a farmer can have redress under this Bill to ensure that fair play is done, and is seen to be done.  This is the basis on which this type of taxation will be successful, but unless the acreage is adjusted fairly, and is seen to be adjusted fairly, I cannot say with confidence that it will work.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the adjusted acres.  The previous speaker said there had been adjustments by the Land Commission but I could not agree with him when he said there had been agreement between the inspectors and the farmers.  I know of many cases where the agricultural advisers took issue with the farm inspectors.  I was involved in a co-operative for many years and I was talking to a man a few weeks ago who told me how dissatisfied he was with the system of adjusted acres which was in operation at that time, when all that was involved was giving a man additional acres to bring his holding up to 45 acres and when land was not held as highly as it is today.</P>
      <P>If we do not have a soil survey, which will not be carried out in some counties for some years to come, we will be depending on a visual examination of the soil.  Much will depend on the time of year the inspectors visits the farm.  During the spring farms look very good and the land is in very good shape, but I am afraid there could be reclassification of land on a continuing basis depending on how the land was worked, fertilised, sprayed and so on.  For instance, an inspector could go on to a farm with very bad soil but if it was well sprayed with a good nitrogen dressing it could look good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Mention was made of the location and climate of the farm.  Let us take the example of a farm with a very bad lane leading to it.  If the local authority carry out a local improvement scheme on that lane-way, the farm will be easily accessible. Will it then be reclassified?  If a group water scheme provided drinking water for the animals, would the farm be reclassified? If the western drainage scheme was reintroduced and the land was drained, would there be a reclassification of the farm?  I can see real problems arising because many different aspects are not being taken into consideration which would need to be considered if an equitable survey is to be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Many respected agricultural commentators have made the point that even if we can arrive at this magical concept of an adjusted acre there is an inherent inequity built into this legislation in that the yield per adjusted acre will vary depending on the type of farming enterprise being carried on.  For instance, a person involved in dairying will have a different yield per adjusted acre from a person involved in dry stock who, in turn, will have a different yield than a person involved in sheep farming.  Even if this legislation worked &mdash; and I am convinced it will not &mdash; it is subject to this inherent inequity.  I have heard no explanation from the Government benches why they are so persistently trying to implement legislation which has built into it this inherent inequity.</P>
      <P>My experience of the law might not be as extensive as that of Deputy O'Kennedy, but I have some experience and I can say without exception that I have never read a more ridiculous piece of legal gobbledegook than section 2 which proposes to set out the definition of an adjusted acre.  Let me read it slowly for the benefit of the Minister.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the Minister I shall read slowly section 2 (1), paraphrasing it to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Act ... &ldquo;adjusted acre&rdquo; means any area of agricultural land (whether equal to or greater than one <Col N="1149" /> acre) the estimated capacity of which for agricultural production is equivalent to the capacity for such production of one acre of land capable of the estimated highest such production in the State....</P>
    <P>I have never read a greater piece of arrant nonsense than that definition and what follows it in section 2.</P>
    <P>We are going to send out, as mentioned by the Minister for the Environment on the last day, I think 200 adjusters into our highways and byways to adjust every acre in accordance with this definition. Looking at this legislation and without having any consultation with the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture, it appears that those adjusters will have to be men of very superior abilities in various fields of endeavour.  For example, they will have to make decisions on the nature and quality of the soil, so they will need some experience and expertise in that field.  They will have to determine the relevance of the local climate, so they will need expertise in the meteorological area.  They will have to determine, if the land is sloping, the degree of slope so they will need some engineering expertise, presumably.  They will have to determine the capacity or incapacity, as the case may be, of the land to support farm machinery.  I do not know exactly what that means.</P>

      <P>When I get some order from the Minister I shall continue. Another matter not immediately evident from the legislation is the degree to which each of those criteria is going to determine how many adjusted acreas an individual has.  For example, are we going to do as was done in the old essay competitions, mark them out of 20 or ten or five? Will we give 20 marks out of 100 for the nature and quality of the soil and judge each farm in accordance with that?  Will we give only five out of 100 for the degree of slope of the land?  How exactly will this be done and what degree of relevance <Col N="1151" /> will each of those criteria have?  The unreality of this is seen in that even in the definition of the term &ldquo;adjusted acre&rdquo; assumptions have to be imported into the legislation.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse many of the comments my colleagues have made in the course of this debate so far.  It is impossible to decipher from the proposed legislation exactly what is an adjusted acre.  This tax is totally unfair, discriminatory and inequitable.  It takes no account of farming patterns, of a farmer's financial situation, of his responsibility to his family and of his many commitments.  Above all, this legislation fails to recognise that farmers are the biggest indirect tax payers in the country. As high consumers, they pay a large amount of indirect taxation through VAT and other systems and this is not recognised at all in this Bill.  The contribution that farmers have made to the Exchequer through indirect taxation over the years has not been recognised, even by commentators.</P>

      <P>I happen to have qualifications, I modestly want to say, and am in a position to value land.  I understand the qualities and productivity capabilities of land.  The main bone of contention here is the adjusted acre.  Other speakers particularly Deputy Dowling, have spoken about this.  Over the years we have had two systems of adjusted acreage operating here, much to the dissatisfaction of farmers.  We have had the Land Commission adjusting the land downwards. We must say, in fairness to them, that they did their best for the small farmers. That opportunity will not be <Col N="1153" /> available to them any more because this Government have decided not to acquire any more land or to allow the Land Commission to function in the traditional way.  To make up for the shortfall in rate revenue, we now have this land to create jobs for Land Commission staff who would have had to be made redundant and for the rate collectors throughout the country.  There is no doubt about it, this land tax is rates by a back door method. The Government should admit that.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have always tried to bring the small farmers up to a minimum 45 acres.  They have taken account of fragmented holdings and location of land and have always been reasonably generous in their approach to farmers.  On the other side of the coin, we have ACOT and the advisory services adjusting land upwards in order to bring farmers into a certain category for grant purposes and if at all possible up to developmental level.  The advisory services operated basically on the stocking rates of the land and often they did not take into account the amount of rented land that a farmer was using.  They took the number of stock in his herd put that against the number of bona fide acres that he owned and adjusted the acreage based on the stocking rates and put the farmers into a separate category.</P>
      <P>Neither of those two systems has been satisfactory or conclusive.  Both are vague methods of adjusting land acreage.  Here we have something that is totally vague in deciding on a farmer's liability for land tax.  Section 2 (2) states that regard shall be had to the range of uses to which land can be put for the purposes of agricultural production.  That is totally unfair because no account is taken of the farming pattern, of the traditional farming system that operates on a farm.  That system may have been operating for generations.  A young farmer inheriting the farm may have no option other than to carry on the traditional farming system he inherited because he has not the financial capability or capacity to change to other farming patterns.  How can it be fair or equitable to decide on adjusted acreage under that system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> Section 2 (2) (a) (ii) refers to the adequacy of the means of access to the land.  I am very worried about this provision. There can be good land on the side of a main primary road.  Will that be adjusted on the basis that it could be for development purposes or that it might have development potential?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the farmer lives miles away from the land and it may cost him a considerable amount to farm that land.  I do not think the Minister can give a simple yes and no answer to these questions.  The people doing the adjustment will be guided by the criteria that will be laid down if this Bill is passed. They will have to assess the land on those criteria.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) (a) (iii) states:</P>
      <P>the following, and other natural phenomena affecting the capacity of the land for agricultural production:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very vague.  It gives very considerable latitude to a person examining land and deciding its potential.  The best land in the country will look fertile and green in June or July but when the soil is turned over it will be found to be totally different from land one mile down the road.  There are two types of land in farming terminology: there is cold land which is slow to grow and to produce and which may hold grass later into the winter; there is warm land and if the climate is right it can produce grass and other crops.  The fact is that rainfall levels and climate vary from area to area.  The western seaboard, from Donegal to Kerry, and into the midlands is affected by severe rainfall at various times throughout the year.  We must compare year by year because at the end of the day it is the amount of <Col N="1155" /> money in the farmer's pocket that determines whether he will survive, that determines his standard of living and the input he will be able to make in farm production in the following year.  We have had a bad summer this year and the growing season has been slow.  What account will be taken of that if a farmer suffers a loss at the end of the year, as will happen in many cases?  This tax is unfair and it falls down on several aspects.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers also to the nature and quality of the soil.  Will the Minister tell us if soil sampling will be carried out on every farm?  That work will have to be done.  If we are to take into account the nature and quality of the soil, the various soil types will have to be examined on each farm.  I am a farmer, I am the son of a farmer, and I have been involved in agriculture for most of my life.  I know that a distance of 20 yards can separate two different types of land structure.  The capacity of land can change enormously in a very short distance.  Therefore, it would be totally unfair to have a certain type of system operating for a townland, for a county or for an area without taking due account of the soil quality in each place.  The section also speaks about the location and climate of the place.  Will the rainfall levels be taken into account?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section also states that regard shall be had to whether the land is flat or sloping and, if it is sloping, the direction and the degree of the slope. It is obvious in that kind of land structure that tillage will be out.  If the topography of the area is such that it does not lend itself to tillage production, as is the case in most of the land in the west of Ireland, will that fact be taken into account?  What criteria will be used in assessing the capability of that kind of land to produce crops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also speaks about whether the land is sheltered and whether it is overlooked by hills or mountains.  Here we have to consider land that may be surrounded by State forests.  It is possible <Col N="1156" /> to get good patches of land surrounded on three sides by a State forest.  It may be possible to have meadow land there but it may not be possible to save that meadow; it may be possible to grow corn but it may not be possible to harvest it. Yet, on a certain day in the year that land may look perfect.  Where is the equity in assessing sucy land for farm tax?</P>
    <P>The section also refers to the natural drainage of the land and any arterial, local or other drainage affecting it.  In the Dunkellin river basin in County Galway there are 114,000 acres of land flooded for six months of the year.  Yet, on a July day along the river bank the land could look beautiful.  What account will be taken of that situation?  What criteria will be used to decide in that case?  As I have pointed out, it depends on the time of the year when the assessment is carried out.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned these proposals are totally inequitable, unfair and take no account of the ability of a farmer to meet his commitments, financial and otherwise, to his family.  They take no account of the capital investment needed for a farmer to make a viable living from farming.  They take no account of a farmer's indirect contribution to the Exchequer through the tax he pays indirectly on goods he purchases.  They take no account of the farm family situation and of the voluntary, selfless and dedicated efforts of a farmer and members of his family.  In the interests of the economy and of the country, I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill.  Otherwise agricultural development will be curtailed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that before any farm unit is adjusted a visit will be made, that there will be an inspection physically by the adjuster and that regard will be had to all the matters set out here?  Secondly, what seems to be regarded as an advantage in paragraph (ii) of subsection (2) (a), that is, the adequacy of the means of access to land, is now perceived in many areas to be a disadvantage.  Only this morning I heard a representative of the IFA say on radio, but not in relation to this Bill, <Col N="1157" /> that the dairy yield from stock is much less when the stock are near a busy main road than is the case when they are in pastures far removed from the road. Apparently the decreased yields result from various factors such as dumping and the interruption of the normal habits of the stock.  Sometimes this is reflected in a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in yields.  If it emerges that access is a disadvantage rather than an advantage, will that factor be taken into account in adjusting the acreage downwards?</P>

I know he is not in favour of it but he must go along with his party in regard to it.  However, lest the Deputy should have got the impression that I was misquoting his leader, I wish to quote from <i>Magill</i> magazine of July 1979.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The article refers to the Taoiseach having proposed a 12 per cent levy on farm sales in the mid-seventies.  In his interview with the magazine, the Taoiseach said in that regard:</P>
      <P>This was merely an option I proposed at the time.  The idea was that if we were able to raise about £120 million through this means we would be able to revalue the Irish pound upwards against sterling by about 5 per cent and greatly reduce the element of imported inflation in our general inflation rate.  We would have been able to lower income tax, increase food subsidies and eliminate rates on private homes and agricultural holdings.</P>
      <P>He continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I was convinced that the inequities to which such a levy would give rise would offset the benefits that <Col N="1158" /> would accrue and therefore the proposal was rejected in favour of a straightforward tax on farmers.</P>
    <P>The question was then put directly to the Taoiseach as to what form of farmer taxation he favoured at that stage.  His reply was:</P>
    <P>Farming should be taxed on the basis of accounts, on the same basis as any other business.</P>
    <P>While speaking to a motion in this House on 9 December 1980, the Taoiseach said, as reported at column 741 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The rates system takes no account of family circumstances, so a farmer with ten children pays as much as a single farmer.  It is not related to the capacity to pay and as a form of taxation in that respect is unjust.</P>
    <P>I have already quoted statements made by the Minister for Finance in this regard. Therefore, I am asking why there is this change of heart at this time.  Is it because the pressure is being applied by the Labour Party who are not present for this debate.</P>

      <P>There will be problems in regard to determination and assessment in some areas.  For instance, in parts of Laois and Offaly there are vast acreages of land which look very well, especially at this time of the year, but the problem is that they are flooded on a regular basis, especially those areas along the Shannon.  In west and south Offaly these lands are flooded regularly for five to eight months of the year.  There is also quite an amount of land adjacent to bogs, marginal land, about which there will also be a problem in arriving at an adjusted acreage.  The same will apply to land way down the country where one must travel down bad roads to gain access.</P>
      <P>According to one of the major farming organisations, they intend putting some of these points to the test in court at a later stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great reservoir of common sense among the farming community and the auctioneers who will value such land.  I would hope that such a reservoir of common sense would be found within the Department of Finance and officials of the farm tax office in arriving at agreement on adjusted acreage. Everybody has spoken about the necessity of having 160,000 farms visited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> In the case of a large number of such farms, over 20 adjusted acres, I would hope that an adjustor from the farm tax office will be able to visit a farm and reach agreement on an appropriate adjusted acreage.  I have discussed this issue continuously with members of different farming organisations since it was first mooted.  Quite a number of farmers with whom I discussed the matter are able to tell one what acreage they have.  Quite a number are in a position to give a rough estimate of their adjusted acreage. Granted there will be a margin involved and an assessor might adjust that upwards.</P>
    <P>Many people have drawn comparisons between this farm tax and the old rating system.  The old rating system has been proved to be unconstitutional.  At least on this occasion, when an adjusted acreage has been arrived at a farmer has a right of appeal, he can have it reassessed and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the ICMSA met the Government, when, I am sure, the question of adjusted acreage was discussed at considerable length.  As somebody who has at all times had excellent relations with the IFA, I am disappointed that there has not been a further meeting with the Government.  I think their last meeting with the Government in regard to this matter was on 7 January last.  The present Government have always maintained <Col N="1162" /> good, cordial relations and a good working relationship with the IFA.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the senior personnel of the IFA to discuss this legislation. After all legislation is all about discussion regardless of which Government may be in power.  The vast majority of the leadership of the IFA are reasonable people and there should be discussion about this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how many people are represented by each of the different farming organisations but they represent the vast majority of farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country.  With regard to the question of adjusted acreage, the IFA should have had a greater input than has been the case to date.  I have outlined my reservations about this publicly and privately on many occasions.  Everybody has a duty to ensure that the best possible legislation is passed by this House, goes to the Seanad and is eventually signed by the President.  Any organisation representing a group, such as the IFA, who do not closely involve themselves in the democratic process of advancing their viewpoints to the Government, ascertaining whether amendments can be effected suitable to all sides, are not fulfilling their democratic duty.  This is of importance and the Taoiseach has said that he would be willing to meet any organisation that came to him to discuss this issue, that the Government are happy and willing to meet the IFA.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy N. Treacy is an auctioneer by profession.  He mentioned points about accessibility to land and so on, as outlined in this section.  But two auctioneers will not agree about the adjusted acreage of any farm.  For example, there will be different prices advanced when such land is being valued, they may employ different methods of assessment and so on.</P>

      <P>They will be working within these guidelines.  I would hope that any farmer not satisfied with an assessment will enter into further discussions, lodge an appeal and so on.  Many difficulties will arise in the early stages of the administration of this tax.  Any farmer with land under 20 adjusted acres will be happy with the provisions of this Bill and quite a sizeable number will be involved. With regard to farmers under 80 adjusted acres there are safeguards in hardship cases which means that the imposition of this tax can be at least as economical for such a farmer as it is for them at present to pay accountants to prepare their accounts and so on.  This section will have to be looked at so that we take sufficient account of poor quality land, so that there are sufficient extensions given and sufficient allowances for land that floods and for hedges, ditches and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1850s the Griffith valuation system was probably the best that could be achieved at the time.  It was probably the fairest system at the time.  From what we have heard in this debate this will probably be called the Dukes valuation system.  We are setting down guidelines as to how adjusted acreages are to be arrived at.  Farmers will be very concerned to make sure that they are listed as having the lowest possible adjusted acreage, so I envisage the appeals system being inundated.  The poor law valuation system lasted for over 100 years and over the last 40 or 50 years people's entitlement to various benefits, grants, etc., as well as their entitlement to pay rates, has been based on that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could not blame any farmer trying to get the best out of the system because this system might last for another 100 <Col N="1164" /> years.  It will be a long time before a lot of the land is classified and agreed. Whether or not we like it, there is likely to be wholesale evasion in this area. Under the old rating system farmers devised ways of avoiding rates.  There might have been one farmer, but if one went looking for the rates one would find three or four different rateable holdings in the wife's name, the son's name, the mother's name and so on.  There was an advantage in doing things like that.  In relation to farmers who are not already in the income tax system it will be impossible to determine exactly what they own. People already in the tax system must put on the forms the number of acres they own.  That applies to a very small section of the farming community.  Through no fault of the farming community they have not been assessed for income tax even though since 1983-84 every farmer is supposed to be in the tax net.  The whole concept of an adjusted acre is daft.  The farm tax seems to be another one of these sacred cows of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>This farm tax principle seems to have assumed the status of a sacred cow for the Labour Party, just as is the Local Radio Bill which we had last week.  Due to the way in which farmer taxation has been politicised over the last 11 years it is almost impossible for any Minister to back down, having introduced the legislation.  Even if a bad Bill is introduced we cannot withdraw it.  The idea of an adjusted acre in section 2 is the most daft idea we have ever come up with in this House.  Subsection (1) says that we should find one acre of land capable of the highest production in the State. We will have to have a competition to find one acre of the best land.  Where is this famous acre to be?  Maybe we could <Col N="1165" /> incorporate it on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; and have a &ldquo;write-in&rdquo; for the best adjusted acre in the country or the land with the greatest potential.  I would need the eloquence of Deputy John Kelly to describe this, it is so ridiculous.  I cannot find words to describe it.  The Minister must know that this section is rubbish. We are making a laughing stock of ourselves. This Bill refers to the nature and quality of the soil.  I know the Minister was at a meeting with myself recently where a man was talking about how he would take account of the wind chill factor.  I have never heard of such a thing.</P>

      <P>The worrying thing about this section is that it is the kernel of the Bill.  The principle here is that we are going to tax farmers on their potential to earn.  If we are going to espouse this new principle why do we not extend it to solicitors, accountants, publicans and everyone else?  Why is it just for farmers? I would be prepared to argue the merits of this Bill with anyone on the grounds that there is economic merit in having a land tax, but it is not being put forward on that basis.  This could have been an idea put forward with a view to bringing more land into production.  This Bill has only been put forward as a way to collect more income tax.  Neither are we prepared to say that this is a wealth tax.  I would be prepared to argue as to whether we should have a wealth tax.  My views have changed over the last 11 years as to <Col N="1166" /> the advisability of a wealth tax.  The Bill is not being sold as a wealth tax because we cannot sell it like that and just pick out the farmer and tax him differently from everybody else.  If everybody was to pay a wealth tax that would be different.  This is a new principle altogether.  This is income tax.  This is another way to collect income tax from farmers, and we are taxing them on their potential to earn. Why not extend this principle to all sections as regard income tax?  Maybe we could tax solicitors &mdash; perhaps Deputy Shatter is one of them &mdash; on the number of square feet of floor space in their offices.  A thousand square feet at £10 per square foot would bring in £10,000 tax. It would suit some solicitors, and others it would not suit.  Maybe we should tax accountants in that way.  Maybe we should tax everyone on this new principle. What about writers?  Maybe we could have Hugh Leonard adjusted lines. Journalists could be taxed on Conor Cruise O'Brien adjusted one liners.  That is really what we are getting here.  This is being sold as income tax but it is on people's potential to earn.  Why not tax the carpenter on the number of tools he has in his box?</P>
      <P>All the things I have mentioned have only one thing in common, that is that one idea is more daft than the other. Nobody would advocate that we start to tax people in that way.  No one in this House would wish to tax people on that basis.  Should we tax doctors on the number of patients they have and multiply by 20 or 30 or 40?  Some people would like that principle but it would not suit others.  All those ideas are equally ridiculous. I believe in bringing things down to their basis, and this Bill is about the principle that we are going to income tax people on their potential to earn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have many other things to say regarding farmer taxation generally about which I know something.  We all in this House would say that we should declare our interest.  I am a practising chartered accountant and, therefore, I declare my interest in saying that it suits me to have farmers in the income tax net and doing accounts.  I state that at the outset so that <Col N="1167" /> nobody can accuse me of defending my own profession.  In the past ten years or so when the threshold continued to drop the farmers coming in feared the most.  I know that most of the farmers who have been in the income tax net for a number of years have learned to live with it.  It is no longer a big thing with them.  They are prepared to pay their tax and have their accounts done.</P>
    <P>I heard a great deal of rubbish here last week about the fees accountants charge and so on.  Why are we setting up the great myth about farmers &mdash; of course, they have encouraged it down the years &mdash; that they are different from everyone else, that they cannot pay tax the same as everyone else and so on?  Any businessman, be he a small shopkeeper or anything else, who wants to know how he is doing keeps records of some kind, and not a farmer in Kildare, big or small &mdash; who might give the impression of being an idiot and unable to keep records &mdash; when presented with an income tax bill is not able to bring his records up very quickly.</P>

I have felt for a long time that the present system of income tax deters farmers from developing their resources to the maximum extent.  I stand over that.  Perhaps the members of the farming organisations in the gallery may disagree with that.  I have seen farmers with initiative, ability and enterprise investing in their holdings and in their different patterns of farming, and the risk there is exceedingly high.  It is perhaps a higher risk investment than any industry or any other comparable area in any part of the world.  Unless there is seen to be a reasonable return from it, naturally the productivity levels will drop.  That is happening in a number of the bigger farming enterprises.  Unfortunately, this Bill does nothing to remedy that situation.</P>

      <P>In connection with adjusting acreage, if I were to go out to the country, who would be the most qualified person I could go to?  There are many qualified people.  There are people very qualified academically.  They can carry out soil surveys and solicit information in connection with soil potential, which I and most Members of this House would not be able to do, but the farmer has been working the soil all his life. Consider the man who can predict the weather from watching the vagaries of animals and so on because he is very observant.  Nobody is better equipped than the farmer even in the draining of land.  We have all as local authority representatives seen county engineers doing certain jobs, but people who have been living on the land know about the potential of the land.  I hope that is what will be done and I know that it will be.  The Minister has given his assurance as to what will be done not only once but twice and three times if necessary to ensure this form of land taxation in relation to potential income.  I tell Deputy McCreevy that it is not a question of saying that land has a certain potential. It will be an established fact that it will have that potential.</P>

I am not aware of any major exception to this.  I am not quite sure how best to help the Deputy.  Information as to what is made available is in the Order Paper each day the Dáil meets, but of course that does not apply when the Dáil is not in session.

The thrust of the Bill will be towards the farmer who has already shown that he is a good user of land.  A small farmer is not necessarily a very good one.  Land must be used to its maximum potential and it is against that background that a person's ability to farm well will be taken into account. Obviously, we must ensure, through constitutional methods, a certain bias towards farming families who will need extra land to make a living in the future.

      <P>The arrangement whereby the eligibility of applicants for this scheme is assessed by the lending institutions is expeditious <Col N="1177" /> and cost effective.  This assessment is carried out in accordance with detailed conditions and criteria drawn up in association with my Department.  The administration of the scheme by the lending institutions is subject to audit and no State contribution is payable in respect of cases improperly admitted to the scheme.  I am satisfied that these arrangements ensure that the benefits of the scheme are applied only to genuine cases of farmers in severe financial difficulty and that the cost to the Exchequer is kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>In view of the large amounts of capital tied up in individual farm units, the maximum net assets limitation of £200,000 is not excessive.  As I indicated in reply to a recent question by the Deputy, a sample survey carried out by my Department revealed that only 20 per cent of the participants sampled had net assets between £150,000 and £200,000.</P>

In effect, this means that there must be three to six months' notice of any transfer.</P>
      <P>My Department have recently discussed with farming and co-operative organisations the question of amending the rules so as to allow for transfers at less frequent intervals.  The initial reaction of the organisations was to favour such an amendment and I intend to take a final decision on the matter shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As late as last week it was pointed out to me that there may have been irregularity in that regard expecially in a certain co-op area.  I have asked officials of my Department to investigate the allegations.  I should like to tell the Deputy that up to recently a supplier of milk could transfer from one co-op to another without giving any notice to the co-op he had been supplying.  However, because of the payment system brought in with the milk super-levy we, in conjunction with it, brought in a system under which a supplier had to give at least three months notice, or maybe as much as six months notice, if he wished to transfer from one co-op to another. Recently the Commission agreed that payments due under the super-levy system should not be on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis.  Therefore, I am considering whether we should change the amount of notice necessary from a minimum of three months to a minimum of one yar.  I am favourably disposed towards doing that.  I have had discussions with the various organisations and I believe they are in favour of such a change.  If I feel that the attitude is pretty unanimous and, in my own wisdom, that it is the correct thing to do, I will do it.</P>

What further action will the Minister take in view of the fact that he has had discussions with farming organisations and others about the matter?  This critical problem is likely to lead to job losses and chaos in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is critical but <Col N="1181" /> I might add that there are mixed views among farming organisations as to what should be done and how we should go about it.  I am favourably disposed towards creating a climate where it will be more difficult for a supplier to change from one co-operative to another.  Of course that cuts two ways.  If a supplier changes and later discovers that it was not in his best interests to do so he will have to wait one year to change to his original supplier.  That is a minor point. If I think it is wise to lengthen the period from three months to one year I will do so, and I just may do that.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he is considering making it more difficult to transfer but I get the impression that he is interested in getting the views of the farmers as to what they will accept.  Has he taken into account the views of the workers in Golden Vale, Ballyclough and Kantoher where 2,000 people are involved?

I would not like to give the impression that I may do what I said I will do at the behest of any farming group or otherwise.  I will adopt the procedure I outlined if I think it is the right thing to do.  I will not be pressurised into doing anything.  I will decide if it is the right thing to do and act accordingly.  I should like to add that last week I had a meeting with representatives of the workers in the co-op referred to.

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the plans he has to help the plight of small farmers, particularly in mountain areas, who are now faced with a very serious situation with the prospect of getting low prices for their lambs and whose income will be further reduced by lack of demand for their breeding ewes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall market for Irish lamb recently has been affected by a falling off in effective demand for imported lamb on the French market, our main export outlet.  The best means of securing the highest prices on that market is to supply the type of lean, well-conformed lamb carcase for which the French consumer is willing to pay a premium.</P>
      <P>Ewe numbers are, of course, continuing to expand, especially in lowland areas, an increasing number of these ewes are drafted from mountain flocks.  A hill cross ewe project initiated by my Department in 1983 is now operating in most hill sheep areas.  This project will be expanded and should lead to a further increase in demand for good class mountain type ewes.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that the 1984-85 ewe premium under the sheepmeat regulation, which will be paid shortly, will be as much as £15.98 per ewe.  This increased rate will provide a valuable boost to the income of flockowners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the present uncertainty in this trade, as well as the other penalties which farmers have had to suffer by way of loss of the farmers' dole in the last few years, is another blow to the security of the small farmers in the west, particularly in the mountainous areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not.  There is always uncertainty in the lamb and beef trades and there are fluctuations over <Col N="1188" /> which we do not have any control.  The Paris market, the main export market for Irish lamb, is notoriously unpredictable. This year, when we might have expected greater consumer demand from the spring to the middle of the summer, that increase has not materialised and this has resulted in a weakening of our lamb market.  At present lamb averages 99p per lb., which is 3p less than for the same period last year.  This is due to a drop in consumer demand, but that is just a fact of life over which we have no control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the last few years there has been a steady drop, that farmers have a fair idea where they were getting to in relation to their production?  Would he accept that at present there is a terrible uncertainty in this trade, and what is he proposing to do to allay the fears of the small farmers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

As regards the other point made by the Deputy about the income of the small farmers, I should like to point out, as I did in my original reply, that the ewe premium is now £15.98p, which is an increase of £2.85p over last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that any sector of the <Col N="1191" /> cattle trade is in a depressed state.  Prices for all qualities of cattle at present compare favourably with recent years, except perhaps some periods in 1984 when certain exceptional factors were affecting the market.  It is not realistic to regard every peak in the market price as a new floor from which further advances are to be achieved.  What we need is a situation where everyone in the beef chain can get a reasonable return for efficient performance, and in view of our grass-based production system this implies some seasonal variation in prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there has been a great deal of publicity in regard to this matter and that it is a well known fact that the trade is in a bad state at the moment?  Would he not accept that it is reported, if he wants to listen each evening to the figures given from the various marts, that the present situation is serious?  Furthermore, would he accept that because of the milk levy situation farmers were advised to go into the beef trade, which again shows that there is no management in present agricultural structures and that farming is completely on the decline?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely predictable in that this time last year we still had the variable premium as operated by the UK in all its forms and all its severity.  That meant a very strong demand for cattle north of the Border.  I am sure that Deputies Leonard and Kirk could tell the Deputy about that.  Higher prices had to be paid because of the support from that system.  Farmers down here had to compete for very scarce cattle.  We got rid of that particularly inequitable part of the premium and there has been a resultant slight drop in price.  It has had more beneficial than adverse effects.  It has benefited meat plants in this part of the country tremendously and is giving huge additional employment in the meat processing industry.</P>

      <P>The western drainage scheme is one of the two elements in the overall measures for the development of agriculture in the West of Ireland, the second being the western package. Discussion will be opened shortly with the EC Commission on the review of the package which is due this year.  The intention is that the future provision for drainage operations in the west will be examined in the course of the review.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is very unwise to wind down that scheme?  I am surprised that he has not had discussions before now. This scheme is supposed to be fully implemented in January of 1986 and it is very hard to see how the Government will get it going fully when they have lost half a year in the discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is satisfied with the progress being made to import substitute the considerable amount of fruit and vegetables coming into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Home production of fruit and vegetables grown for the fresh market has been expanding and there was, in fact, a 6 per cent increase in acreage between 1981 and 1984.  Efforts are being continued by my Department, An Foras Taluntais and An Comhairle Oiliuna Talmhaiochta (ACOT), in conjunction with the growers' organisations, to seek ways of further reducing imports by the application of new production technology, the improvement of marketing arrangements and the provision of a new horticultural advisory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework for continuing progress is provided by the financial aid available <Col N="1196" /> from my Department for the conversion of glasshouses to solid fuel heating, for the employment of a market co-ordinator for the glasshouse industry and for setting up producer groups as well as the more general aid available under the farm modernisation scheme.  The scope for development and expansion exists and I am confident that with the full co-operation of the growers and the other interests in the industry real progress will continue to be made to reduce imports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in the areas where real progress can be made so far as import substitution is concerned the proper measures are not being taken to expedite that process?  In his reply he referred to the installation of solid fuel boilers.  Having regard to the capital investment necessary for such installation, will the Minister not agree that it will be beyond the capacity of many growers to make that investment because of their severe financial position and the glasshouse industry will continue to suffer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any capital investment is not easy nowadays in the light of current interest rates.  I hope they will come down and thus allow people to invest.  The whole thrust of what we are doing is designed to reduce the volume of imported fruit and vegetables that can be produced at home.  The vast bulk of our imports is incapable of being produced in a climate like ours.  We have made considerable progress towards attacking that import bill.  I do not know if the Deputy attended the recent launch by ACOT of their new advisory services geared towards the fruit and vegetable market which took place at Warrenstown. That event showed the earnestness of ACOT in tackling the problem.  An Foras Talúntais are making trojan efforts to develop new technology that will allow people to grow fruit and vegetables in better conditions.  The move has been reasonably successful.  We anticipate that the system that was unveiled at Warrenstown will reduce vegetable imports next year by approximately £10 million.  It may <Col N="1197" /> not be a great amount but it is a beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Having due regard for the trojan work of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, will the Minister not agree that the Government measures introduced, particularly in relation to the glasshouse industry, are unsatisfactory and will not produce results as quickly as they should because of the state of the industry for some time past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite happy to look at the point raised by the Deputy.  I can see there are problems with regard to capital investment and I hope I may be able to assist in the capital development to which he referred.  We have difficulty from the Dutch glasshouse industry, particularly concerning the production of tomatoes.  We believe the Dutch are using a subsidised gas system that is not in conformity with EC regulations and this country, together with other EC countries, have objected repeatedly to this.  The Dutch have been found to be in contravention of EC regulations in this connection but at present they are appealing their case to a higher court.</P>

We are trying to produce a range of products at an earlier date during the year and during the winter months, at which time of the year they are not available at present.

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the steps he intends to take, as a matter of urgency, to protect the price of beef to Irish producers following the unfavourable prices agreed for the Egyptian export trade which was signed recently by a major Irish meat packer on behalf of a consortium of Irish Meat Packers and in which he played a crucial personal role; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my recent visit to Egypt, and of the Protocol of Co-operation subsequently signed with the Egyptian Ministry of Supply and Home Trade, was to provide a framework within which Irish exporters, together with CBF, could make detailed commercial arrangements with the Egyptian purchasing authorities. The visit had to be arranged at extremely short notice in order to safeguard the overall position of Irish cattle and beef in Egypt, which was under serious and immediate threat from competing countries.</P>
      <P>I am not a party to the contracts which were negotiated by Irish exporters subsequent to my visit.  I can only assume that the exporters concerned entered into those contracts on the basis of their own commercial judgement of what the total market environment is likely to be at the time the cattle and beef have to be supplied to Egypt.  In this respect the contracts are no different from any others concluded by Irish beef exporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Why was it necessary to confine the deal to the group concerned, that is, the group who went to Egypt?  Is the Minister not aware that other groups or meat factories were involved in previous deals with the Egyptians and why were these not invited to participate on this occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not invite any individual or group to accompany me to Egypt. In the ten days or two weeks preceding my visit, it had been brought to my notice by a number of exporters who were heavily involved in the Egyptian market that there was a grave threat to our supplies to that market because of conditions being offered by at least one other country.  In the light of the information I received from the suppliers to that market, I decided to travel to Egypt to meet the relevant Ministers in an effort to ensure that our portion of that market was not lost.  I notified the people who had alerted me to the danger of losing the market that I was travelling to Egypt but I did not <Col N="1200" /> invite anyone to accompany me.  Anyone who travelled to Egypt did so of his own accord.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Did the Minister not consider it odd that the contract was not drawn up in the name of the State board, CBF, as opposed to being in the name of a private company?  Is the Minister not aware that in such circumstances those kinds of contracts are on a state to state basis which is the more acceptable practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the least surprised in regard to the contract because CBF do not enter into trade agreements. They do not have the finance that would enable them to do so.  They are merely a promotional body, so they do not sign contracts either for the buying or the selling of beef.  It is a matter for the individual traders to engage in that process and I played no part in that side of the negotiations.  My involvement was solely on grounds of protocol.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year the Commission decided to instigate a debate under the general heading of &ldquo;Perspectives for the Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo;, the aim being to define the future prospects for European agriculture.  The Commission's internal work on this is now well advanced and it is expected that a consultative document will be issued shortly for discussion with the various Community bodies and interested groups.  Following that the Commission will present its conclusions and proposals to the Council of Ministers towards the end of the year.  At this stage and in the absence of the Commission's consultative document it is not possible to make detailed comments.  Naturally, it will be my endeavour to ensure that the overall line of development to be followed will help to strengthen and consolidate the CAP and assist the progress and expansion of Irish agriculture in the years ahead.</P>

Has he read an article in <i>The <Col N="1203" /> Irish Times</i> in the past week to the effect that this document was discussed last week?  I am disgusted that the Minister, as a very interested party, has not acquainted himself to date with the contents of the document.  Is the Minister aware that the document contains the suggestion that market prices must be given a greater role where surpluses exist?  It acknowledges that this would mean lower incomes, more unemployment and taking land out of production. Has anybody in this country quantified the effects such policies would have here, to what degree national employment would be affected, and how many acres would be taken out of production?</P>

We have a permanent representative in Brussels to look out for such documentation and to keep an eye on matters for the Irish Government.  In the event of the document not being available, and we not having seen it, whatever may be reported in newspapers is most likely to be speculation and I am not in a position to comment.

      <P>I fully understand. I shall not detain the House very long.  I have been most anxious to say a word with specific reference to this section dealing with the adjusted acreage.  I want the Minister to accept what I have to say in the most cordial and friendly spirit.  I want to place on record what I think of the adjusted acreage having regard to my long connection with the farming community as a valuer and as somebody who has been closely involved in the letting of land and the drawing up of conacre contracts etc.  As a Fellow of the Institute of Valuers, I have often expressed an opinion on the quality of land, be that good land, medium type land, bogland, commonage, whether it be the subject of collop grazing or whatever.  I have given evidence in the Circuit Court on numerous occasions in relation to the quality of land.  The whole question of farm tax is pivotal on section 2 dealing with the adjusted acreage.  That is why I am extremely perturbed about this.  In relation to land acreage there is no such thing as a permanent acre of good land, a permanent acre of poor quality land, or of medium type land, because from year to year it is dependent, first, on locality and, second, on weather.  There may be a year in which there will be a very heavy rainfall from January right through to the middle of April resulting in land, which the year before, a dry year, was of reasonably good quality, being completely watelogged.  Will there be a further adjustment on land in every bad year, in every wet year?  If the Minister would recall the disastrous year we had in 1947&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the bad year of 1947 I raised matters in this House in relation to deplorable land conditions, acreage and so on.  My association with farmers, both big and small, has been close.  My knowledge of land is reasonable. Having read section 2, I am at a loss to know how the tax will be based on adjusted acreages.  Where will we find an acre of land with the highest productive capacity in the country on which to base all other acreages?  I have spent a great part of my life dealing with farmers, setting their land, surveying their land, valuing their land, making representations to the Valuation Office on their behalf and appearing for them in a variety of courts.  Nobody in the House has a closer connection with the farming community or a greater knowledge of the difficulties that will arise on this section. Yesterday, when we were dealing with the Valuation Bill, I referred to appeals being decided by the Circuit Court when relating to certain valuations.  I have always admired the knowledge of Circuit Court judges and the helpfulness of senior and junior counsel in relation to matters of this kind.  They sometimes astonish valuers with the extent of their knowledge.  Knowledge gained from theory is good, but knowledge gained from experience is better.  Is this Land Tax Bill the product of theory rather than of practice?  If it is the product of theory it will run into serious difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the position in relation to the adjustment of common grazing and the adjustment of other forms of land subject to conacre agreements?  What will <Col N="1252" /> be the adjustment in relation to certain meadowing and lands which are used for grazing and for hay?  Is the Minister serious in thinking that the vast majority of farmers will be satisfied with an adjustment other than an adjustment upon which they decide?  The best judge of the quality of land is the owner, the local valuer or the local estate agent.  There will be a great conflict of opinion between the owner of the land who knows its productive capacity and the commissioner in charge of appeals.  To base a tax on adjusted acreages is unrealistic. I am giving the House the benefit of my experience as a valuer who has served a great percentage of farmers in the midlands.  Every same person will agree that farmers must be taxed but that that tax should be based on their income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously worried because there is a close relationship between the adjusted acre and the property tax already in operation.  When the property tax was imposed it was supposed to yield £13 million, and £1 million was collected at a cost of £500,000.  How much will this tax cost in administration? Very little will be collected by the time all the concessions are granted and allowances are made.  Placing the yield based on adjusted acreages on one side and the cost of administration, appeals and dissatisfaction resulting from what the farmer will think is an unfavourable decision in relation to his appeal on the other, where are we going to go in relation to this whole problem?</P>
      <P>Is all this exercise worth what it is likely to yield when there is no goodwill from a large section of the farmers? When it comes to imposing tax on farmers I would prefer that everyone would sit around a table and agree on a form of taxation based on the income of the farmer rather than on his property that may be yielding a smaller financial return to him based on atmospheric conditions from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made prophesies which have <Col N="1253" /> come to pass although I do not style myself as a prophet of accuracy.  Nevertheless, I have not always been wrong.  I am convinced that some years from now the exercise we are going through here in relation to this farm tax will be forgotten. First and foremost, I cannot see the farmers paying.  Secondly, I cannot see the adjusted acreage working.  Thirdly, I cannot see the landowners being satisfied with any result from the appeals tribunal or the commissioner in charge of appeals. In the light of all this, when we are not taking the ability of the farmer to pay into consideration, we are on a very lame and limping exercise.  We must consider other aspects of the farmer's income apart entirely from the financial return and profit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will agree with me on this.  No farmer in Ireland ever aspired to being a millionaire.  He never had that ambition.  He could not have it because the ways and means were never in his way, but every farmer had one ambition which was to leave the land at the harvest better off than when he entered the land in the spring.  That is what I have been preaching in this House for the greater part of 40 years.  In relation to farm production, income and taxes unless a farmer can leave the land in the autumn a better off man and somehow richer than when he entered the land in the spring, his whole year's work is useless and wasteful.</P>
    <P>That is why I am sorry that there has not been a greater degree of co-operation between all farmer's organisations, all farmers big and small, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance in this matter.  No system of farm tax will work unless everybody is in step. You must have willing farmers, willing payers, particularly those who are going to pay based on the adjusted acreage because the adjusted acreage is the kernel of the matter.  Unless the willing farmer feels that by the adjusting of his acreage he will be able to contribute as generously as his financial means and income will permit, this is a useless exercise. These are important considerations. As well as the adjusted acreage you must <Col N="1254" /> take into consideration what profit the farmer has made.  There is no point in adjusting a man's acreage if he has lost money during that year.  Whether his acreage is adjusted or not, unless he can pay and has made some profit the whole exercise is useless.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the idea of this adjusted acreage came from.  I had farmers with me years ago, particularly when I was representing them in their business, and they would describe various parts of farms which looked well, which looked good and in the opinion of representatives of the Commissioner of Valuation was good land, but when a crop was planted on it even when it was manured and fertilised to the highest possible degree the farmer would not get a justifiable return from it.  Therefore, the best qualified officer of the Commissioners of Valuation or the Department of Finance may judge an acre of land and he can be as far out in his judgement as could be possible.  You will not judge the yield or return from an acre of land by looking at it in the spring or in the summer.  The way to judge an acre of land to see what profit that acre made is not by appearance but by pounds and pence.  Farmers are extremely commonsense people.  I have yet to meet a foolish farmer when it comes to the quality of his land.  He is walking it, he is manuring it, he is judging it, he is asking his neighbours about it.  He is having a second opinion, and after all this he has the opinion of his valuer.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about this section. The whole principle of this farm tax has been a cause of very great worry to me because I am afraid that there is what I can only describe even at the root of the adjusted acreage as a socialist element in which people who have no property, who own nothing and have never aspired to own anything, are anxious to put the political gun, so to speak, to the heads of those who have something, those who work hard and who own property or have property handed down from their fathers, grandfathers and greatgrandfathers. There is a certain degree of jealousy and that is rather grave when it comes to <Col N="1255" /> people who never had property or aspired to have property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is commonsense on this side of the House too.  The abundance of intelligence does not always rest with Fianna Fáil.  It rests with people who have been closely connected with the financial circumstances of those who will be asked to pay.  My worry is in relation to the adjustment of acreage, on which basis all payments will be made. There is much anxiety among my farming constituents with whom I have discussed this matter and whose opinion I value, particularly the younger farmers connected with Macra na Feirme, the IFA and the ICMSA.  My views are based on their opinions backed up by my long experience as a member of the Institute of Valuers.  I can see endless difficulties arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we get down to the whole question of the adjustment of acreages let us examine what the difficulties are likely to be before we cause serious problems for many farmers.  I wish the Minister for <Col N="1256" /> Finance well in his efforts to have a taxation system which will appear to be fair, in which those on the land, in the factory, on the shop floor or in business will all contribute to the provision of services. Any intelligent Minister for Finance &mdash; and our Minister certainly possesses an abundance of intelligence &mdash; has the support of all the people in his efforts to raise funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand by the Minister in any effort he makes to bring in the necessary funds to administer the affairs of the country but I would like to see commonsense and intelligent methods used in the raising of funds.  I am putting forward my views today as one who has devoted the greatest years of his life to working in a professional capacity with the farming community, advising them as a valuer.  I am sorry this whole question has arisen because I am of the opinion that when all is said and done and this Bill is passed, the yield will not be worth the amount of money spent on administering it.  I am judging that by the record of the property tax.  I spoke against that measure and was never in favour of it.  I am not in favour of taxing people for no other reason than that they own property.  I am not a socialist and have never subscribed to socialist ideologies. I am a believer in private enterprise and the right of ownership.  I believe in the right of the people of Ireland to hold the land of Ireland from God alone who gave it.</P>
      <P>For that reason I would urge the Minister to consider very carefully the question of adjusted acreage and to enter into close consultation with valuers and farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever system is adopted in relation to the adjustment of acreage, every aspect should be taken into consideration, including reports of agriculture advisers and valuers but above all the opinion of the farmer himself.  There is no better judge of land than the farmer. A farmer may complete a form and tell the Minister that the acreage must be <Col N="1257" /> adjusted in one way or another.  It must be remembered that no farmer wants to do the State out of any money.  My experience is that every farmer wants to keep his head above water and pay his way.  There is no better spender than the farmer if he has the money.  There is nobody quicker to pay.  The farmer loves to pay if he has the money to do so. The success of this tax depends on the satisfactory adjustment of acreage. Speaking not as a politician but as an experienced valuer, I believe this adjustment of acreage will not work.  I do not think it is feasible.  For the Minister's sake I hope it will work.  Every farmer is anxious to co-operate.  We would all like to see this measure working but it will be very difficult because of the vast difference in the quality of land.  There are mountainous areas and areas which have drainage problems, while gravel and sand form a substratum in other areas.  We are dependent on atmospheric conditions which affect the yield from the land and the return at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I offer those views to the Minister as one who has valued nearly every area of land in the midlands and dealt professionally with the majority of farmers there.  I wish the Minister well in this measure and hope that the machinery which will be set up to deal with the adjustment of acreage will be such as to leave no doubt in the minds of farmers that they are getting justice and fair play.  If this is not the case there will be a lack of co-operation by farmers.  The goodwill of the owner is necessary to adjust the acreage in a satisfactory manner, otherwise it is a wasteful exercise.  If he gets a square deal nobody will be quicker to pay than the farmer, bearing in mind that his land must be yielding him a profit.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that the task of the adjusters will be difficult.  I hope that the Government will not send out the same team which carried out the review for the new disadvantaged areas scheme as some of them got lost in the mountains and the scheme degenerated into a sorry mess.  I advise the Minister to leave those people <Col N="1258" /> at home or to send them to an eye specialist. In my constituency, the team were stuck in the mist on the top of the Galtee mountains on the Waterford and Cork sides.  They did not come to Tipperary which has similar type land.  I hope the Minister will not send these adjusters around rural areas with suede shoes to carry out this type of review.  This is a very serious matter, our land was fought for dearly and Irish people love their land.  The Minister should forget the Civil Service gobbledegook regarding adjusted acres.</P>
      <P>Over the next two years a lot of money will be spent on civil servants running around the country drawing fat salaries. There will probably also be millions spent in taking cases to the Supreme Court. After all that, we will probably have to debate the matter here again unless there is a change of Government.  The Government have availed of the grants available for farmers from the EC which would have helped to give them a decent living. Everybody knows that over the last two years the farming community have taken a steep reduction in their income&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a scheme to encourage farmers to transfer land.  If a farmer with 100 acres transfers 50 acres to his son will they be treated separately in regard to land tax?  Sometimes land is fragmented, there may be 30 acres at the farm holding and perhaps 60 acres down the road.  Will the adjusters value the 60 acres in the same way as the 30 acres? Although the land in both areas may be of the same quality, the same use cannot be made of both areas.  I hope commonsense will prevail and that the adjusters will realise that the land away from the farm holding cannot be utilised as well as that on the holding.  Land has been fragmented down through the years and it is not the fault of the farmer if it is spread around the parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> The section does not refer to the age of a farmer and whether he can afford to develop his farm.  Does the Minister realise that one-third of our farmers are over 55 years of age and that one-third of them are single?  The recession has prevented quite a large proportion of farmers from developing their holdings and they have also had to contend with the uncertainty regarding the super-levy. How could any farmer develop in these circumstances?  The Government should have helped farmers to develop their own industry.  They are now supposed to pay a flat tax, irrespective of whether they can afford it.  In the 1983 budget the Minister for Finance dropped the farm grants without warning and the type of carry on during the last two and a half years did not give farmers a chance to develop their holdings.  Regardless of their age or the quality of land, they had no hope.  The milk, beef, beet and grain businesses are all in trouble.  The Government are also in trouble because they do not know what they are doing from day-to-day on farm policy.</P>

      <P>I agree with the speakers who said that the nub of this issue is the adjustment of acres.  How many adjusters &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; will be employed?  I understand that 100 adjusters will be transferred from the Land Commission and, if a further 100 are to be taken on under what scheme will they be employed?  What are the necessary qualifications for adjusters? This is of particular importance and it should be spelt out clearly.  Will they have a degree in soil analysis or in engineering? What will be the nature of the training that will qualify them to carry out this massive undertaking?  How long is it envisaged that a national adjustment of <Col N="1261" /> acreage will take?  When will it commence and finish?  Is it the Minister's intention to carry out a partial adjustment and impose a tax on those people while those whose land has not been adjusted will escape for some period? Can that be regarded as equity?</P>
      <P>Will the national adjustment be carried out, as I believe it should, on an acre by acre basis?  Will the publication by An Foras Talúntais, Soil Associations of Ireland, 1980, be used as a guide?  Will the officials in An Foras Talúntais who carried out a square inch by square inch survey of the soils of Ireland be consulted and their results taken into account?  Is it intended, following a national adjustment, that a period be set aside after which a review will be carried out of the national adjustment?</P>

      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked if this concept of the adjustment of acres was not something like a spot the ball competition.  He wondered about the concept of the most productive acre and where this is to be found.  We have a fairly clear idea of the most productive acre, the standard against which other acres will be assessed. It is not just one specific acre, it is a judgment of the most productive acres in the country.  I intend to return to that matter in a few moments.

      <P>What points do the farming community take into consideration?  One of the things any sensible farmer would take into account in deciding whether to bid for a piece of land would be the range of uses to which it could be put for the purposes of agricultural production.  If he sees a piece of land which could be used for a variety of enterprises he will tend to be more favourably disposed towards it than he would towards a piece of land which had a very restricted range of uses, unless he has a very restricted interest. Deputy O'Kennedy knows that in his constituency of North Tipperary and in my constituency of Kildare, where we tend to have a mix of enterprises on farms, the wider the potential range of uses of that land the more it will be <Col N="1266" /> appreciated by the farmer.  Farmers are expert at taking into account or having regard to the range of uses to which the land can be put for the purposes of agricultural production.</P>

      <P>The next thing many farmers would look at is the adequacy of means of access.  Is there a road into it? Has it road frontage with access?  What is the road like?  Is it a boreen, a decent lane or a roadway?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter to which most farmers will pay a good deal of attention.  We often hear farmers talk about a bit of land which comes on the market but they say it is not very covenient because a person has to go across another farmer's land to get to it or maybe there is a problem about a right of way from the nearest road.  Means of access is something farmers would bear in mind when assessing the potential value to them of a specific piece of land. Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned a radio interview this morning with a spokeman from the IFA.  He was quite rightly complaining&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes it is relevant to section 2.

I am afraid I have not been able, offhand, to think of a way to take that factor into account in this Bill.</P>

      <P>To extend that there is a difficulty of that kind in relation to any piece of land, it seems that that would be a factor which would potentially affect the range of uses to which it could be put. I cannot think of too many places in the country where that kind of location would unduly restrict the range of uses to which land can be put.</P>
      <P>There are other matters which farmers will take into account.  One of the first things they would want to know in assessing the potential value of land would be the nature and quality of the soil.  Some Deputies opposite seem to have some difficulty in conceiving of a distinction between the nature and quality of soil.  I am no agronomist, although I spent many years working for farmers, but in my view it is not all that difficult to distinguish between the nature of soil and the quality of soil.</P>

I do not know why they should have a great deal of difficulty with that. Location is self-evident, as is climate.  We have an abundance of information from the meteorological service about the climate in different parts of the country. We have an abundance of information about levels of rainfall and about sunshine, and that is all climate.  Above all, we have an abundance of information about location.  They are two factors which any farmer will tell you can have a substantial effect on the potential value of land.  It ranges across a whole spectrum of considerations.  There are some pieces of land which are near the coast and are particularly good for, let us say, potato growing because they have sandy soil. They have a particular advantage there. If they are near the coast in the south west corner where on average &mdash; and this <Col N="1270" /> has been the case for many generations &mdash; there is more sunshine and rather less rainfall than we have in the rest of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You do not <Col N="1271" /> have to measure every inch of the land that is sloping.  What we must take account of is that the topography of the land is a factor that can have a fairly substantial bearing on the productive capacity of the land.  Nobody in this House or outside it could dispute the fact that for a given quality of land you will get a better crop on a south facing slope than on a north facing one.

      <P>I am not skipping at all.  I am pointing out, and I cannot be gainsaid on this, that all the factors mentioned here are ones that the ordinary, down to earth, commonsense farmer will take into account in assessing the value of land to him.</P>
      <P>As regards the structure of the agricultural holdings of which the land forms part, Deputies Treacy and Byrne raised the question of what happens if a farmer has very good land bordering on a main road and more of his land is down a boreen some distance away.  That is clearly a factor that affects the way in which he can use the land and the return that he will get from it.  That is why we make it a consideration in the adjustment to take account of the structure of the land holding of which the land forms part.  It is clear that if you have 60 acres in one block it is far more conveniently farmed than if you have 60 acres in two, or indeed, three blocks.  You do not have to go very far, even in this country, to find that kind of situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the natural drainage of the land and any arterial local or other drainage affecting the land and provided by a State authority or a local authority, again, natural drainage is a factor that is very much in the forefront of farmers' minds in many parts of the country in assessing the value of land.  We heard Deputy Enright speaking about the problems encountered in Laois-Offaly and Deputy Treacy mentioned the problems encountered along the banks of the Dunkellin river.  The same applies to the Owenmore river and the same in the Mulcaire catchment area. The same applies over wide areas of the country.  In my own constituency, the Barrow causes problems over some of its length.  The fact that land is subject to that kind of flooding from time to time during the year is obviously a factor that affects the assessment of the potential value of the land.  That is why it is included here as one of the criteria.  I was rather surprised that the Deputies who raised these points did not refer at all to the criteria mentioned here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the other side of the House have not got their heads together at all on this issue, nor have they even tried to look at these criteria.  It seems to me that the discussion that we should be having is this &mdash; are these criteria sufficient to take account of all the concerns that the Deputies on the other side of the House have raised in relation to assessing the potential capacity of land?  I believe that they are, but I am open to persuasion.  I notice that none of the Deputies on the far side has raised <Col N="1275" /> anything so far that is not covered in the criteria that we have set out here in section 2.</P>
      <P>The adequacy of water supply to the land is obviously a factor that will count and I do not think that needs any discussion whatever.  I have an amendment in to delete the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo;.  The accessibility of the land to, and its capacity to support, farm machinery and farm stock is a matter that is of considerable concern to a farmer who is assessing the potential of land.  We know of the difficulties of farmers in many parts of the country who cannot take their stock off the land during winter.  We have seen the damage that can be done to land by using machinery in excessively wet conditions and we have seen the damage that can be done by using machinery on it at the wrong time of the year.  The susceptibility of land to that kind of damage is something farmers take into account when looking at land and coming to a conclusion about its value to them.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by a number of Deputies to the question of variations in climatic conditions during the year and from year to year.  Of course one cannot forecast or take specific account for each acre of land of every drop of rain that will fall on it in any one year.  Where we can take account &mdash; and there is provision elsewhere in the Bill for doing this &mdash; of any differing effects from one year to another of climatic conditions is by allowing the differential effect of those changes from one year to another to be brought to bear on the rate at which the tax is charged.  In section 9 we have provided that changes in farm income will be the base on which we assess changes in the rate of farm tax.  That does not take away from the fact that once the adjustment is done on the basis of the criteria we have here we will have built up on the basis of commonsense a picture of the productive potential of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea seemed to take issue with the notion that we are bringing assumptions into the legislation.  I refer him to section 2 (2) (b) and (c).  Section 2(2) (b) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> It shall be assumed that the land has been, is being and will continue to be, farmed, and that the land and the business of farming the land has been, is being, and will continue to be, managed reasonably and reasonably efficiently.</P>
    <P>That means that in assessing land we are looking at an average level of management expertise in deciding what way to adjust the acres.  We are not going to each farm to look in detail at each farmer's personal capacity for managing the land in order to decide on the adjustment. Adopting that approach which takes some concept of the average as a base gives an advantage to those who are better than average and it will provide a spur to those who are less good than average in relation to the management of their land.  Section 2(2) (c) deals with the question of investment in the land. Deputy Dowling asked if the provision in relation to improvements was fair.  I suggest it is fair because we are working on the basis that the level of investment on the land will be reasonable for land generally.  In other words, if a high level of investment has been put into the land that will not in itself be a factor that will raise the assessment of the number of adjusted acres.  We set out in this section the factors taken into account under the heading of investment.</P>
    <P>Much play was made of the time of year at which the assessment would be done.  A number of colleagues said that in the springtime a piece of land might look very well but later in the year it could be subject to flooding.  One could have land that looked well when at the beginning of the growth season but that would look less well, comparatively speaking, as the year went on.  Of course that is a consideration that would have to be taken into account and it is one that would be picked up by the application of all of the criteria set out here.</P>
    <P>I have to insist that in any case we are not doing a visual assessment of land. The people doing the assessment will be trained people.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be acre by acre.  That is the thrust of my response. There are areas where it will not be necessary to do every acre and there are other areas where it will be no necessary to do the work on a more concentrated basis. Given the criteria we have here, I expect that virtually every acre &mdash; I am not saying all of them &mdash; will come out at less than one adjusted acre.  Obviously it will depend on the circumstances just how far one goes down the scale.  However, it is almost a matter of definition that the vast majority of acres assessed will come out at less than one acre.  It would be agreed generally that the best land in the country is in the south, in the Golden Vale and the Midleton area, and, for example, around Fota.  It is not only a matter of the basic productive quality of the land.  There is good land, too, in County Kildare but we are only trotting after some of the people in the south in that regard.  There is the question also of climate in the south.  It is a matter of observation that there is much less frost in that area than is the case elsewhere.  Generally there is a longer growing season in the south than is the case in most of the rest of the country.  Where there is that combination <Col N="1279" /> of climatic conditions and soil type one can extract the maximum from the land in terms of production.  It is against that kind of criteria that we will be judging other land.</P>
      <P>There will be cases in which the land will look extremely good in June or July but will not look so good at other times of the year.  That factor, too, will be taken into account by the operation of the various factors enumerated in section 2.</P>
      <P>So far as the question of subjectivity or objectivity is concerned in relation to these assessments, in what I admit was a somewhat disorderly interjection before lunch I asked Deputy Byrne if he had ever seen a subjective drain.  Any drain I have ever seen has been very objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's problem is that he has not seen any drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The factors we are taking account of are very objective but inevitably an element of judgment must enter into this just as there is an element of judgment in many areas of our taxation system.  That is the case, too, in assessing the value of assets for different purposes. It does not seem to me that there is anything especially wrong with applying an element of judgment so long as the judgments arrived at are informed judgments and so long as they take proper account of the criteria that this Parliament decides to set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What has changed the Minister's mind?  Two years ago he rejected the judgment factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be deflected by these kinds of interruptions.  I am not contradicting what I said at any other stage.  These are all matters that are capable of objective determination.  Deputy O'Dea asked what weight would be given to each of these elements of judgment. That question is somewhat beside the point.  Even from his experience of farmland in the East Limerick constituency, Deputy O'Dea will find that some of the <Col N="1280" /> factors listed would be of very little relevance to some pieces of land while there are others that would be of very considerable importance.  Therefore, any judgment made would be on the basis of a combination of those of the criteria set out that are relevant in the case of any piece of land.  It is not possible, then, to provide that in the event of slope, for instance, one allocates a minimum of five marks or ten marks or whatever the Deputy had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking whether that was what the Minister had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not what I had in mind because some of these factors would not be relevant.  It is not a question of scoring a piece of land against a board of ten drawn on the basis of these criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Minister's opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of making a judgment against these criteria of the whole complex of factors that make up the productive capacity of land.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan reminded us that there is no such thing as a permanent acre of good land or of bad land or of indifferent land and that the condition of land can change from time to time depending on climatic conditions and on management.  We are assuming an average level of management, so that factor need not concern us unduly, and we are taking account of climatic conditions in making the first assessment to the extent that variations from one year to another in climatic conditions affect farm incomes, so under section 9, the rate of farm tax will change also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there would not be a reevaluation or a re-assessment of land after a wet year, for instance.  I should hope that in the vast majority of cases, once the first assessment on the basis of this section had been completed, it would not be necessary to return to it except in cases where the farmer in question either acquired more land or disposed of some of his land and consequently there was a <Col N="1281" /> change in the number of adjusted acres and in which case he would be liable for farm tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan claimed also that the adjusted acre notion is similar to the residential property tax.  That is not the case. The residential property tax is based on a combination of both a value criterion and an income criterion.  It has no relevance to the kinds of factors to be taken into account in adjusting acres.  A number of factors which Deputy Flanagan perceives as difficulties in the process of adjusting acres are the very factors we have set out in section 2 as being the ones to be taken into account.  In the context of this Bill, therefore, they are not difficulties but are part of the base on which we would assess the number of adjusted acres in any case.</P>
    <P>Regarding the number of adjustors, Deputy Byrne seems to be very well informed because he pointed out that we will be using about 100 Land Commission inspectors and taking on about 100 other people to carry out the job.  These people will be employed on a five year contract basis.</P>

The Deputy was nodding very much in agreement earlier when a colleague of his was talking about jealousy.  It will behoves Deputy Byrne to make the kind of remark he has just made about a group of people who will be young graduates in agriculture seeking jobs for the first time.  That kind of remark does not do much either for the Deputy's standing in the House or in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might as well make the same kind of comment about those people who work for ACOT and who assist farmers fairly substantially or indeed about people who are employed by co-operatives and I am glad that a number of the co-ops employ agricultural graduates in order to assist their members in improving their farming operations.  I do not hear Deputies making snide remarks about the incomes paid to such people.  Such remarks have no relevance to this debate.</P>
      <P>I come now to the last matter raised by Deputy H. Byrne.  He wanted to know if the work carried out by An Foras Talúntais in soil mapping will be used as a basis for the work of these people.  It will not be used as a basis but certainly it will constitute a body of information which they will use in defining their approach to their work.  It will certainly be used in the training these people will receive. Obviously, it will be very valuable information for them to have if it is available, when they go out on the ground to carry out the assessments and the adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>So it will not be used as a basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be used as a basis but it will form part of the information they will use to guide them in the work they will be carrying out.  The point is fairly obvious.  The more information they have before they begin the job of assessing, the better they will be able to do the job.  I am quite sure that, in both their training and in laying out the programme of work to be carried out, the maximum use will be made of such information as is available &mdash; and there is quite a lot of soil types and conditions around the country.  I now come to the conclusion of all of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The 100 people who are being taken on in addition to the Land Commission inspectors &mdash; and I think <Col N="1283" /> Deputy O'Dea was listening &mdash; will be required to be graduates in agricultural science, B.Ags.  That is the first qualification they must have.  In addition to that we are providing specific training, once they are taken on, before they go out to do the job.  I cannot give the House the detailed content of the training programme.  They will be on the job during the course of this summer.  They will be given a number of weeks training. I cannot say exactly how many weeks or what will be the content of that training, but they will be trained by the Land Commission inspectorate staff.  As the House well knows, those inspectors have been at the business of adjusting acres one way or another for a great many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not provided for that in the Bill.  In the vast majority of cases I would hope the only reason there would be to re-examine a determination of the number of adjusted acres would be in the case where a farm is either being enlarged or where a piece of it is being disposed of or apportioned to some other person.  I would hope that that would be the case in the vast majority of farms.  If I may be permitted to make a passing reference, as Deputies know, we have provided for an appeals procedure in the event of a farmer feeling that the number of adjusted acres as assessed do not accurately reflect his view &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If he improves his land I <Col N="1284" /> do not expect that he will be rushing forward to ask that it be reassessed, nor indeed would the local authority necesarily be in a position, first, to know that he had improved his land or, second, to believe that that would be a basis for re-assessment. Even if there appeared to be a basis for reassessment, the provisions of section 2 already operate on the assumption that the level of investment in the land is reasonable.  Unless somebody is going mad altogether with a huge programme of very intensive investment, in most cases I would expect that that would not make any difference to the number of adjusted acres on which he would be assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>First, that is not a matter for this Bill.  This Bill does not deal with income tax.  Second, we already had a discussion on that point on section 1 when we dealt with the definitions and in particular the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  If the two units created by the kind of division about which the Deputy talks are separately managed, then they would be separately assessed.  If they are not being separately managed, then they would be treated as one unit for the purpose of farm tax.  I come to my conclusion on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the debate and the concerns Deputies have expressed about different ways of assessing the productive potential of land, I have come to the conclusion &mdash; and I have paid a lot of attention to what Deputies have been saying &mdash; that the factors we have set out here are indeed factors that are properly taken into account in assessing the productive value of land.  I believe these are the kinds of factors that the average, sensible, down to earth farmer will take into account himself when he is approaching the matter.  They are ones that are <Col N="1286" /> capable of assessment, of being put together in order to form a clear picture of the productive capacity of land.  Therefore, they are entirely suitable as a basis for this tax, as a basis for a tax which, as I have said on many occasions, is simple, easy to administer both by the taxpayer and the tax gatherer, predictable as to the revenue it will produce and, all other things being equal, one which will provide an incentive to people subject to this farm tax to expand their production and make better use of their land.</P>

      <P>A Minister who can say in the House now that this basis of taxation is simple, easy to administer and fair is capable of saying anything, when what he said two years ago was exactly the opposite.  He said then that farmers should be taxed on the income they get from their farms and any subsequent profit should be taxed on the same basis as manufacturing industry.  I could quote the Minister at great length when he pointed out that capital taxation on farmers to replace agricultural rates is unsuitable and unfair.  Two years later he can come into this House, flatly contradict himself and give us a long drawn out explanation of how reasonable and fair it is.</P>

Therefore, these adjusters and the decisions at which they will arrive with regard to adjusted acres will all be very different from the sensible farmers to whom the Minister has been appealing all day and the kind of things they would take into account.  Certainly farmers would take some of these matters into account but the Minister is providing that every one should be taken into account.  I will give some examples.</P>

      <P>The Minister has acknowledged that it has to be a visible inspection of each farm and that it has to be judged according to each of these criteria, whether it is sheltered, overlooked by mountains and all the rest.  If these criteria are adhered to as this law says they must, the bulk of it will not be done after ten years.  The Minister in a reasonably optimistic assessment said that the bulk of it might be done in five years.  Now we come to the point whether this is a sensible way of approaching taxation. The Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment who introduced this acknowledged that it would take a very considerable time to get it under way and that what would probably happen is that we might get it down to as far as 40 adjusted acres being the norm after a few years.  The Minister had better tell the trade unions that what is being considered here is an adjustment above 40 acres or 50 acres after a number of years.</P>

    <P>It is not surprising that the Congress of Trade Unions said that the proposal of the Government to exclude all farmers with less than 80 adjusted acres, a substantial farm, from income tax is indefensible and an insult to the PAYE workers <Col N="1291" /> who have lobbied and campaigned through the trade union movement for a tax system which would ensure that all sections of the community would be taxed on the basis of their incomes.  That is also what the farmers want.

      <P>This is an attack against fair play in taxation.  The farmers recognise that.  They have asked to be treated the same.  We have now reached the very happy day when we have the unions and the farmers agreeing.  The only ones ignoring them are the members of this Government.  Within both Government parties it is clear from today's contribution that many backbenchers know that we are being put through a lot of nonsense today and that <Col N="1292" /> this will not even yield tax and that the only growth we will see here is a growth in administration and bureaucracy.  There will be 100 jobs for young graduates but when the Government tell us that this is what sensible farmers would or might do, they are ignoring the reality of the obligation they have put in here that they must go through all of these and any question by way of legal appeal will insist that each and every one of these will have been accounted for by every visiting adjuster to every farm.  For all of this, perhaps in 1987, 1988 or 1989 we will get some element of contribution.  If the Government had developed the system already there and given the 200 people to strengthen the system, probably with the agreement of all, the Government would have about four times the level of contribution they will get from this nonsense tax in three years time.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately we are running out of time.  The people of Cork will perhaps be flattered or perhaps discouraged that at least we have located the mythical area with the best land in Ireland by which all else will be judged, down around Fota in County Cork.  There will be many visitations to Fota to assess the quality of this land.  That is the Minister's opinion and the Minister's opinion is worth about as much as every other opinion expressed by the Minister in this House today &mdash; not a hat of crabs.  A Minister's opinion as to how these things might be done, should be done, could be done and as to what sensible farmers would or should do is of no consequence when it comes to determining the meaning of the law as passed.  The judges who decide this will not consult the Official Report to see what the Minister of short duration in Finance, one Deputy Alan Dukes, thought it should mean.</P>

At the end of the day we will have another nonsense tax which is going to cost more in administration and litigation and will drive tensions and jealousies between farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about what on average might and should happen and what reasonable people would do.  Those words &ldquo;on average&rdquo; are very comfortable and reassuring, but in order to sum up the nonsense that we have been forced to put through today I quote from my colleague behind me who is a man of some sense, Deputy Byrne.  When I asked what in Heaven's name is meant by &ldquo;on average&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;If your head is in the fire and your feet are in the fridge, on average you are sitting comfortably.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very fair in section 2 of the Bill.  In section 2(1), (2), (3) and (4) he has given a fair chance to the adjusters and fair guidelines on how to decide an adjusted acre.  The Opposition spokesman on finance said that he had listened to a great deal of codology here today from the Government side of the House, but I have heard people on the far side encourage tax evasion.  For instance, somebody asked if a person who had 100 adjusted acres could divide it up into two 50s and give 50 to his son and 50 to himself so that he would pay land tax only.  Let me ask the same people if a person on PAYE who has a son unemployed can get half his salary paid to his unemployed son. That is what they are encouraging.</P>

In my county, Meath County Council lost an income of £1.4 million, and it is only at this stage that the land tax is being brought in.  The land tax should have been brought in to replace rates, and all farmers should have had to pay income tax also.  Had I been Minister for Finance in a Labour Government that is exactly what would have happened. We are coming to the day when there will be radical changes because people outside are looking to see what parties are prepared to provide an equitable tax system.  Looking at the Opposition I cannot say that, but let me tell what happened during the elections.  I am a good man for a story.  I was driving along a narrow road one fine day and I met an old, disabled man sitting in a wheelchair and he really relieved my mind.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me respond to Deputy Leyden's question.  It does not arise under the section because those areas are classified as most severely handicapped on the basis of physical criteria.

      <P>No, I am not suggesting or even giving the slightest hint of a suggestion that there will be an amendment in the Bill.  The factors that lead to those areas being classified as more severely handicapped are physical factors which are taken into account under the provisions of section 2 of this Bill.  Using those criteria to assess acres in all of those areas will give on the whole a very small number of adjusted acres per map acre. Therefore, the Bill already caters for that.</P>

      <P>We have heard at five or six different times from Deputy Noonan about no mandate from the people for this legislation.  I want to remind him that while his party were in Government they got no mandate for a 2 per cent levy or a resource tax.  The Deputy was the second person to propose a flat rate of tax.  Joe Rea was the first; Deputy Noonan was the second, and he made four different speeches about it until the boss told him to stop talking about such proposals.  Let him be honest with himself.  There are surely as many people in his constituency who are in favour of this proposal as there are everywhere else.  He should not waste the time of the House talking a lot of rubbish.  Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Noonan are smiling.  They spent three and a half hours speaking on Second <Col N="1297" /> Stage and did not allow any of the other Members to make a contribution.</P>

      <P>I was waiting to move on for hours.  Deputy O'Kennedy made the point that he wanted income tax to be paid by farmers in accordance with the policy of congress.  I merely wished to make the point that if farmers were paying the same taxes as in 1978 and if those taxes had risen simply in accordance with farm income without any increase in the number of people in the tax net &mdash; at that time there were only 22,000 in the tax net &mdash; farmers would today be paying £55.5 million in rates and £85.8 million in income tax, a total of £141 million.  Under this Bill it is hoped by 1987 to bring in £65 million.  I agree with Deputy McLoughlin that this land tax should be replacing rates and that income tax should be paid as well because we should be getting at least £141 million from farmers based on the 1978 figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now dealing with what is called a taxable farm.  It should be noted that as a consequence of the Minister's amendment this morning &mdash; I am glad there are two Labour Deputies present to hear this &mdash; all intensive farm activity whether it is pig breeding, the intensive husbandry in certain parts of the north of this county or poultry activity, a farm of under 20 adjusted acres will now be totally exempt from any tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>For farm tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>But income tax cannot apply to a farm under 20 adjusted acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality. <Col N="1303" /> The section states that a taxable farm means an agricultural land holding listed in the classification list and the adjusted acreage of which is not less than 20 adjusted acres.  That clearly means that the activities I have mentioned under 20 adjusted acres are not taxable farms.  It appears that the Labour Party were not consulted about that amendment.</P>
      <P>I should like to make another point in terms of the inequity of this taxable farm notion.  We are dealing with adjusted acreage and that is the only criterion.  I should like to make a point that demonstrates the nonsense of this tax.  Certain dairy farms which over the years have been used for dairying activity were not engaged in that activity for various reasons in the last two years, but whoever purchases that land will not and cannot get a dairy quota to engage in diarying activity.  Does the Minister not recognise the total inequity of considering such land in the same way as land with a dairying quota.  Will the Minister now acknowledge that that is an example of the arrant nonsense and injustice that will arise as a consequence of this piece of total nonsense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the section adjusted acreage of less than 20 adjusted acres will be excluded but surely that will result in some terrible anomalies.  There could be a very successful bloodstock farmer with less than 20 adjusted acres in County Kildare making, as some of them are, in the region of £100,000 per year. Under this section such a person will not be paying land tax or income tax although a farmer down the road with 50 adjusted acres who may be up to his hocks in debt and so on will be liable for land tax.  He would not be paying income tax if this legislation had not been brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers may have been fooled by this. A number of farmers will be pleased with this legislation because they will be paying less under farm tax than they are paying under income tax.  Those with under 20 adjusted acres will not have to pay land tax or income tax and those with more than 80 adjusted acres will not have <Col N="1304" /> to pay any more tax because their land tax will be a credit against their income tax.  Therefore, in order to get from the £32 million now being collected from farmers to the £70 million farmers in the 20 to 80 adjusted acre group will have to pay the extra money.  Some will pay less while others will pay more.  Those liable may not be paying tax at present and that is what is wrong about the principle.</P>
    <P>How is it intended to collect levies from farmers from now on?  There has been a lot of confusion about those levies in recent years and it is only in the tax year 1984-85 that the the levies are being collected by the Collector General.  Up to now the health boards were liable for the collection.  Now that we are doing away with accounts for a big number of farmers we will not know their income. Will the levies be based on the adjusted acres?  The Minister should clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a question in regard to those with other incomes such as outside employment or a case 3 source, investment income.  Before the local elections I read in an advertisement in a Sunday newspaper a reply to the point raised by the IFA about what would happen to people with other income.  The Government's statement was that people with other income would have to pay farm tax, they would not get out.  It will be difficult to devise a provision to put that into effect.  Will a farmer who has £100 on deposit or who at the end of his harvest puts money on deposit be liable for income tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the figure of 20 adjusted acres is very low.  I understand that marginal relief will be extended to 24 acres.  However, the Minister should consider raising the figure of 20 adjusted acres.  I cannot see anybody surviving on 20 adjusted acres or less.  I am sorry the minimum figure is not 35 or 40 adjusted acres.  Many people in my constituency, hard working farmers, are having great difficulty surviving on 35 to 45 acre farms.  Even at this stage I appeal to the Minister to increase the figure to a minimum of 30 adjusted acres, <Col N="1305" /> or even 35 to 40 adjusted acres.  In my view, the marginal relief should be extended beyond 24 acres to encompass additional allowances to many small farmers who are trying to raise families. The money we are speaking of can be of immense importance to small farmers. Again I ask the Minister to extend the acreage or if not at least to consider extending the marginal relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Rarely do I disagree with Deputy McCreevy but I want to contradict the notion that as a result of this land tax the farmers with farms between 20 and 80 adjusted acres will pay more.  This is where the IFA and the Opposition propaganda succeeded in damaging this farm tax.  Most of the small farmers to whom I have spoken with up to 80 acres are delighted with the land tax because they will know at the beginning of the year that they will have to pay £800 tax.  They will not have to go to accountants and there will be no hassle. But a farmer with 500 acres who up to now could prove he was not liable for income tax, will have to pay £5,000 land tax, and rightly so.  That is where most of the money will come from.  There are mostly wealthy farmers in the Gallery this evening; there are very few small farmers there.  They are the people who are calling meetings and saying no to the land tax.  As yet no small farmer has come to me opposing it.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask a few questions. The area where I was born is polluted with small farmers each with 14 Irish acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I live beside the Gaeltacht &mdash; and to their credit, many of these people are making a good livelihood from the land.  I am glad to see that people in my area would not be liable for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have my own opinion, as a Labour Deputy, about exempting 20 adjusted acres, and let me spell it out.  Anybody who is farming full time should not be liable for income tax or land tax on the <Col N="1306" /> first 20 adjusted acres.  But the person who has 18 or 19 acres set is not liable for land tax and he is not being pressed to utilise his land properly.  A man in my constituency with 19 acres is not liable for land tax and can leave it idle if he wishes.  He will pay neither income tax nor land tax on it.  That is something the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>Second, if a person with 19 adjusted acres working in a Government job, which most of them seem to be, sets his land, say 20 acres at £100 an acre, getting £2,000 of an income, how will that be taxed?  My third question is one about which I think Deputy O'Kennedy is wrong from the way the Minister is nodding his head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down to delete section 3 but it was ruled out of order and I do not know why. The Bill specifies 20 adjusted acres as the threshold where the farm tax will begin.  Section 3 destroys that base because it allows the Minister to change that at any time and to raise the threshold to 25, 30, 35 or even 80 adjusted acres.  I asked the Minister to delete that section or at least amend it in such a way that if the Minister were to prescribe a larger threshold than 20 adjusted acres he would have to come back to this House to do so.  This Bill gives <i>carte blanche</i> to any Minister for Finance to practically eliminate the land tax within the law simply by raising the threshold of land tax to whatever figure he likes.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister responsible for the Bill may feel this legislation gives him power to raise the threshold in exceptional cases while another Minister who is against the land tax could, without any change in legislation, destroy the effectiveness of <Col N="1307" /> the land tax by raising the threshold.  If I am wrong I hope the Minister will explain the purpose of this section because if this Bill is to have any effect this section should be deleted.</P>
    <P>I am against the tax exemption but that is not in this Bill.  The Minister says the Government estimate that only 10 per cent of farmers, 15,000, will be liable to income tax when this Bill is passed.  That would be an outrageous idea but the intention is that that would be covered in the budget.  If that is true we will be back to the position which existed in 1977-78. At that time under the rates system only farmers with over £75 rateable valuation were assessable for income tax and rates on agricultural land.  If the Minister goes ahead with this section, we will have an even worse situation because in 1977-78, 22,000 farmers were liable to income tax but next January only 15,000 farmers will be liable for income tax.  I am totally against this exemption from income tax. I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy will agree, and when this matter is raised in January I hope he will oppose it.</P>
    <P>As regards the land tax and the leasing of land, this is a new factor which it is hoped will lead to greater land mobility, and I am sure great efforts will be made to encourage farmers to lease land.  I do not know what the current leasing rate is, but I was told the average price in 1983 or 1984 was in the region of £45 to £100 an acre.</P>

      <P>The figure of £45 was the lowest figure, and the Land Commission were getting that price.  For some reason they always seem to get the lowest price.  Farmers are prepared to lease land at £100 an acre and still make money on it.  If they were not making money they would not lease it.  It is now being said in this House that farmers would not be able to pay the Government £10 an acre while other farmers can lease land at £100 an acre and still make a good profit and living out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the land tax has not <Col N="1308" /> been brought out by the Government.  It was an attempt to replace the rates which were abolished because they were found to be unconstitutional, and this legislation is to ensure that this will not be unconstitutional.  I do not know if it will be found so, but it was to replace rates. Basically, when it was being spoken about some years ago it was part of the land structure and land mobility effort that was coming through land leasing and greater incentives to people who were not working the land properly to get off it or lease it to people who would work it.  The land tax was to be seen in that light, as an incentive to farmers to use their land.  That has not been brought out at all in the Bill and is not being seen in the debate as a factor in needing a land tax.  I see it as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition's Whip is as anxious to complete it in a hurry, too. There are three brief points I should like to make.  First, there is no reference to the 80 adjusted acres.  I have a very genuine fear that if Fianna Fáil ever get into office this will be reduced to 60 acres. The benefits and incentives effects that Deputy Mac Giolla outlined for small farmers who are trying to move from a subsistence to a developmental level should be cemented into this Bill by this Minister, whom I can trust not to tamper <Col N="1309" /> with the threshold of 80 acres.  I would ask him to review that aspect.</P>
      <P>Secondly, as regards getting this system off the ground, it strikes me that one of the best ways one could do that would be through self-assessment.  I do not know if this point was made earlier. There are many farmers who know their statute map acres and their adjusted acreage. They are reasonable farmers who want to operate this system.  It would free much of the manpower and resources involved if people were in the first year allowed to operate self-assessment.  The margin of error as opposed to the cash flow benefits would point to the fact that self-assessment would be beneficial.  I ask the Minister to let us know his views on that.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, as time is short perhaps the Minister would deal with the points which I made in detail on Second Stage relating to the hardship clauses.  Different points have been made in different guises about numbers of dependants, different stages of development and so on.  It looks as if we are not going to reach the hardship section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify exactly how this will operate.  In Wexford there has been friction over the fact that the PLV case was taken in that county involving the Wexford farmers.  If the discretion is left to local authorities, it may cause difficulties.  Perhaps the Minister could expand on that in his reply?</P>

Looking again at the concept of a flat tax which is relevant to this section, to the previous section and a number of others that we will not be able to deal with at this stage, I would draw attention to the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of May 12, 1979 in which is reported an exclusive interview by Des Maguire with Joe Rea, now president of the Irish Farmers' Association.  I have great regard for Joe Rea and would in no way attempt to denigrate the man in this House, even though it would now appear that he is on a U-turn from what he was proposing then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please permit me to continue?  Time is running short and I shall try to be as brief as possible.  On the question of the objective which Mr. Rea had in mind, he says in that article:</P>
      <P>It must be the objective of IFA to ensure that the money is taken through a system that does least damage to the industry and especially the least damage to the farmer interested in intensification and increasing output.</P>
      <P>In reply to a further question he said that the flat rate of tax he was proposing &ldquo;is an ideal form of taxation because it rewards the farmer who works.  Agriculture is the oil of this country and it is in everybody's interest to have a prosperous agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The concept of a flat rate of tax was clearly acceptable to him and was clearly being put.  Obviously, a number of other people had agreed with him before he came into print on that very important issue.  Section 2, which the House has passed, deals with a flat rate of tax on an adjusted acreage basis.  I hope it will work to the advantage of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy said that in 1983 a sum of £32 million was taken from farmers. In 1979 it was projected that £100 million would be obtained by way of rates and farm taxation but in 1983 we got only £32 million from that sector.  That is a very small level of taxation when one considers the high level of taxation the PAYE sector has to bear.</P>
      <P>Mr. Rea stated:</P>
      <P>One of the main attractions of the system which I am proposing is that it is very simple.  When you find out what amount of tax is due, you divide that by the number of taxable acres in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> On that point I ask the Minister the projected number of taxable acres.  How was the figure of £10 arrived at?  I realise that the Minister cannot consider it in the context of this Bill but perhaps he could do so in a future Finance Bill.  Mr. Rea said that the system would not be equitable if the personal position of farmers was not taken into consideration and that allowances must be made for married people and the number of children in family.  I should like to think that could be accommodated.  Mr. Rea suggested that could be done by exempting a certain number of adjusted acres.  In this case it is 20 acres but perhaps the figure could be 30 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If that could be done it would alleviate many of the difficulties that have been in the minds of farmers in their opposition to this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows it is not in the Bill and he also knows that the Minister is not going to change his mind in the last 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be in the Bill.  The Deputy is a former Minister for Finance and I am sure he is aware it could be accommodated in a Finance Bill.  If that is not correct let him tell me so.</P>
      <P>This response from Mr. Rea arose from a paper on farming taxation published by Fianna Fáil in 1979.  I am sure the Deputy had something worthwhile and interesting to say on it at the time but I was not a Member of the House then and I did not go to the trouble of checking what the Deputy said on that occasion.  The late Mr. Colley was the then Minister for Finance and he took a lot of stick from the farming community. Perhaps we were not totally innocent in our opposition to what was then clearly seen as a resource tax that did not take account of the potential income of a farm of land.  On that occasion Mr. Rea said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My system must not be confused <Col N="1313" /> with the resource tax because one of the very fundamental elements in it is that the formula will be indexed at all times to farm income in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>There is an amendment to that effect and consequently, it cannot be labelled a resource tax or a farm tax.  I think it is linked to income and, consequently, it cannot be labelled other than an income tax.  If there is any attempt to label it other than income tax we are not being honest with the PAYE sector and the ICTU&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience in the past number of years has been that there is very little tax to be derived from farmers who have between 30 and 80 acres.  The level of take under the accounting system is exceedingly low.  This system simplifies the matter.  It eliminates the use of accountants and many farmers will appreciate that fact.  I am sure they will accept it wholeheartedly.  If I were proposing a system of taxation I would not have an upper threshold.  I would develop a system along the lines discussed and proposed by Mr. Rea.  He was confident then he could get his organisation to accept it.  For the information of the House, the publication is the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> dated 12 May 1979.</P>
      <P>The point has been raised that what is proposed here does not take account of certain exigencies within the farming sector.  As I said this morning, the present system of taxation as it applies to certain farmers in a high risk area is undermining their confidence in the industry.  It is leading to a point where they are barely ticking over because they want to avoid tax. Consequently, the economy suffers.  The question of capital allowances was also discussed at that time by Mr. Rea he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we are dealing with the question of a taxable farm.  While I am sure that what <Col N="1314" /> Mr. Rea had to say is of considerable interest, it is not relevant to section 3.  If the Deputy wants to use the last few minutes quoting Mr. Rea I think it will invite certain comments from people.  We have very little time left but yet the Deputy has chosen to go back on an interview given five years ago rather than dealing with something more relevant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy O'Kennedy spoke at length on this matter on Second Stage but I got no opportunity of making a contribution then.  I have been here all morning.  Under this system the farmer can develop and intensify.  His tax bill will not increase and this gives him an enormous opportunity of using capital in the way he wishes rather than having to go to banks and pay bank interest and so on.  The number of farmers who will be exempt is important.  There is no mention of an upper threshold but there are a number of points the Minister could consider in a future Finance Bill that would help this Bill.  Thus, the economy would benefit and a greater level of income would be obtained in a more simple way. Many criticisms have been put forward by the Opposition.  It is amazing the way they change their colours when the occasion demands it.  They do this in a chameleon-like fashion.  They have done that and by that approach they have discredited the political scene.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The ICMSA in their discussions with the Minister demanded such a concession but it is not being granted.  I note that there is no provision for appeals against tax demands.  The appeals will be merely against the assessment of acreage adjustments. In hardship cases there will be provision for a suspension of the tax due but I am concerned the tax will be only suspended and not waived.  I can envisage circumstances where a farmer for reasons of ill health or otherwise could reach retirement age with a millstone around his neck in terms of tax.  The Minister should consider that aspect.  I should like him to reply to those points.</P>

Deputy Mac Giolla said he was not happy that the acreage starts at 20 but he would find it very difficult to survive on 20 adjusted acres, apart altogether from paying tax on it.  There is much to be said for no tax being paid in respect of holdings of fewer than 20 adjusted acres, for tax, and no accounts, to apply to holdings of between 20 and 80 adjusted acres and then for £10 per acre tax plus accounts on each adjusted acre over the 80 acre figure.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister consider some kind of option in respect of holdings of more than 80 adjusted acres whereby the people concerned would be liable for the £10 per acre but would have an option for a three or a five year period of accounts or alternatively some further type of tax such as a fixed rate of £3 per additional acre?</P>

      <P>The Government are anxious to bring in revenue and many farmers are anxious that the system be simplified so that their costs in respect of accountants and so on might be reduced. Deputy Noonan made a very important <Col N="1316" /> point with which I agree.  I refer to his remarks about the confusion regarding hardship cases.  Though the tax in hardship cases can be postponed without interest charges accruing, we should include a section specifically to define precisely the events that are to be regarded as giving rise to hardship.  I have in mind, for instance, a death in a family or a farmer being unable to work because of serious injuries sustained in an accident and when his wife would have to look after the farm.  There might also be some serious problems such as brucellosis or TB which might be the cause of wiping out an entire herd or there might be crop diseases and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Enright and Dowling have spoken a lot of sense but unfortunately we will have no time even to consider the implications of what they have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the proposal Deputy Enright has just made, there is an amendment from Fianna Fáil which proposes to give effect to the question of an option of accounts.  We do not have time to go into that now.  Instead we are engaging in this nonsense of pretending we have had an adequate debate on what is perhaps the most important legislation in terms of dramatic change that the Government have introduced.  We are talking about a change from assessment for income tax on the basis of income. This pretence is no credit to this House and it is no credit to the Minister who brought about the situation.  None of us will be forgotten in this facade, for pretending that we discussed such important legislation when we reached only section 3 out of 28 sections and when in the past three days the Minister introduced eight amendments to the Bill.  It is time we were honest enough to realise that is not the way legislators should go about their work.  I speak collectively when I say that we will not be capable of justifying ourselves so far as this debate is concerned but the Government who forced us into this position are doing a great disservice to the nation.  Farmers as well as the PAYE sector or any other sector <Col N="1317" /> will say after today that we have engaged in total nonsense.  Some serious points have been made from both sides of the House but the Government are deliberately not extending the time in order to allow those questions to be answered.</P>
    <P>All of us here would like to encourage the productive farmer or any other worker who is prepared to work, who has the commitment to work, but in this Bill the Government are doing the opposite. They are encouraging the fellow who will wish to opt out.  The Bill provides that a single man with 80 adjusted acres who decides to let his land on the conacre system, either because he has not the wit, the commitment or the energy to work the land, and who receives a payment of £100 per acre will pay only £800 on his income of £8,000.  That is an example of the nonsense the Government are indulging in.  Let us compare that with the man who works the land that he has taken on the conacre system or the man who works his own farm.  They will be penalised because they will pay on the basis of income.  Are we prepared to stand over that kind of nonsense?</P>

In other words, he will collect £8,000 while he sits back with his feet to the fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 14, &ldquo;1984&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;1985&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>The first amendment relates to the long Title.  The Bill was initially circulated in December 1984 with the objective of providing equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare and for that purpose to amend the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984.  Since then a further Social Welfare Act, 1985, was enacted and it was necessary for the long Title to be amended to refer to the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> This section of the Bill provides for the insertion of a new Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  The Schedules to the Consolidation Act contains the rates of benefit, which are updated every year.  When the Bill was circulated in December last the most recent updating had been effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1984, and reference to this Act was made in section 2.  Since then however, a further Social Welfare Act of 1985, inserted a later Schedule and it was necessary to make reference to this latest 1985 Act in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The final three amendments, all similar, were to section 7.  They are purely drafting changes.  Section 7 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which is referred to as the Principal Act by the insertion of a new subsection. However, the insertions themselves contained references to the Principal Act which are incorrect as they will become part of the Principal Act.  The correct expression is &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;.  The three amendments simply provide, therefore, for the substitution of the expression: &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Principal Act&rdquo; in three places in section 7 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £240,633,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Defence Estimates for the year ending 31 December 1985 is for a net sum of £240,633,000 of which £178,957,000 or 74 per cent provides for pay and allowances. This represents an increase of 7 per cent on the net provisional outturn for 1984.  The gross provision in the 1985 Estimate is £253,433,000.  It includes £74,476,000 for non-pay items.  The provision of £12,800,000 for appropriationsin-aid shows an increase of £2,593,000 on the 1984 provisional outturn.</P>
      <P>The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,590 officers, 60 cadets and 12,050 other ranks &mdash; a total of 13,700 in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> Heavy demands continue to be made on the Defence Forces, particularly in regard to security matters.  While the Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for internal security the involvement of the Defence Forces in this field derives from their role of rendering aid to the civil power.  The duties undertaken by the Defence Forces in support of the Garda Síochána are necessary to help in upholding security and the maintenance of the rule of law.  These impose a heavy burden on the officers and men of the Defence Forces as will be evidenced from the following summary of such duties carried out in 1984&mdash;</P>
    <P>Over 12,000 military parties were supplied in Border areas for operational duties, about 13,500 checkpoints were set up and about 16,000 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border and in other areas; escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on about 1,000 occasions; over 3,500 escorts for movements of cash were provided and about 100 requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces also provide guards for the movement of prisoners and assist in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives.  In addition certain vital non-military installations are protected either by permanent military guards or by military patrols.  These difficult and sensitive duties call for a high degree of efficiency and discretion and I am pleased to record that the officers and men acquitted themselves very well indeed in the performance of their duties.  This reflects great credit on the standards of training and instruction maintained and I should like to express my appreciation to all concerned on a job well done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the high level of efficiency shown by the Naval Service in carrying out their tasks and in particular the operation at sea which resulted in the capture of a large cargo of arms and ammunition consigned to a subversive organisation.  This incident is <Col N="1326" /> a salutary reminder of what we as a community are up against in regard to subversive activity.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise full well the threat posed to democratic government throughout Ireland by subversive organisations. In recent times the right of our citizens to live in peace has been increasingly challenged by criminal elements.  I saw a graphic example of that when I visited the town of Lifford yesterday when a large area of the town was devastated by an outrage committed by savage criminals.  The Government are determined, however, to eliminate violence from whatever source it may come and to take every measure necessary to counteract the activities of these organisations.</P>
    <P>It is almost inevitable, in the times in which we live, that members of the Defence Forces find themselves confronted in the course of their duties by dangerous situations.  On occasions they are placed in situations where life is seriously at risk.  The duties undertaken by the Defence Forces demand dedication and courage, qualities which personnel are required to display on a daily basis.  I think it is appropriate here to pay tribute to the officers and men of the Defence Forces and to acknowledge the contribution they make, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, in providing security for the community and in ensuring the preservation of law and order.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of developments in South Lebanon in recent times and of the significant contribution to the cause of peace which the Defence Forces continue to make through participation in the United Nations peace-keeping force in that country.  At the present time an Irish contingent of about 735 all ranks is serving with the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon &mdash; UNIFIL. This force is commanded by Lieutenant-General William Callaghan, whose appointment as Force Commander is a tribute to Ireland's long commitment and dedication to the cause of international peace-keeping.</P>
    <P>This record of peace-keeping began in 1958 when Irish officers first served as observers in Lebanon.  Since that time <Col N="1327" /> officers and men of the Defence Forces have contributed actively and continuously to United Nations peace-keeping missions in many parts of the world.  In addition to participation in UNIFIL, an Irish contingent of eight personnel is currently serving with the United Nations Force in Cyprus &mdash; UNFICYP &mdash; and 21 Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation &mdash; UNTSO &mdash; in the Middle East.  The Government have been following with concern the recent events in South Lebanon in connection with the withdrawal of Israeli defence forces from that country.  That withdrawal was characterised by increasing attacks on the Israeli defence forces by Shi'ite resistance groups and by harsh Israeli countermeasures.</P>
    <P>The new situation which has developed in southern Lebanon has made the position of contingents serving with UNIFIL increasingly difficult.  Troops of the Irish contingent have had to contend with a number of serious confrontations arising mainly from the activities of Israeli-backed militia in the area and occasionally Israeli defence forces themselves. The incidents in question were the subject of strenuous protests by us through diplomatic channels to the Israeli authorities and were also taken up with the Israeli authorities through the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Defence, I am particularly concerned regarding the welfare and safety of our troops in Lebanon and these matters are kept under constant review. In this regard troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection.  I am satisfied that their training, and the weapons and equipment which they are issued, are adequate to ensure the maximum safety of our personnel consistent with the discharge of their duties.  I should also mention that a proportion of personnel serving with each contingent have completed previous tours of peacekeeping duty overseas and have acquired experience and expertise in coping with the <Col N="1328" /> many difficult situations which arise on such missions.</P>
    <P>This year marks the 25th anniversary of the first involvement of units of the Defence Forces with the United Nations peace-keeping operations.  As a nation we can take justifiable pride in the contribution our personnel have made to restoring and preserving peace in many troubled areas in that quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>From the beginning the role of UNIFIL has not been an easy one.  While the objectives of the original UNIFIL mandate have not been totally achieved, nevertheless UNIFIL has played a valuable and vital role in bringing peace to its area of operations and in protecting the local population.  In the course of a visit to UNIFIL in October last I had the opportunity to see at first hand the prosperity and stability which had returned to the area and which, it is true to say, can be largely attributed to the UN presence. More recently in connection with the Israeli withdrawal, UNIFIL has provided security for the civilian population and has been effective in monitoring and restraining the activities of local militia and of the Israeli Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to the difficulties which face UNIFIL in southern Lebanon and troop-contributing countries must be careful not to take any steps, such as a premature withdrawal of personnel, which would be harmful to the interests of the people of Lebanon or of the United Nations itself.  In consultation with troop-contributing countries and the United Nations we are continuing to monitor closely the situation in Lebanon with a view to ensuring the security and standing of UNIFIL, and to enabling the Force to fulfil its role effectively.  Despite the difficulties, we can be assured that UNIFIL will continue to carry out its functions to the utmost of its abilities in this very important United Nations mission.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Force commander and the personnel of the Irish contingent for their steadfastness and bearing in an extremely difficult peace-keeping operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> As regards pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces, these continue to be maintained at a high standard. The Government are concerned to ensure that the remuneration of the Defence Forces keeps step with that of other sectors of the public service.  To this end the pay of all ranks has attracted the increase provided for in the recent revision of pay of certain civil servants which is payable in two phases &mdash; 3 per cent with effect from 1 January 1985 and 3 per cent with effect from 1 July 1985. The cost of pay increases will be provided for in the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions as required.  As I indicated in my speech on the Estimate for Defence last year, the pay of all personnel from private 2 star up to and including commandant has received the benefit of a 6 per cent arbitration award to certain grades in the Civil Service, the first phase of which &mdash; in the region of 2 per cent &mdash; has been paid with effect from 1 October 1983.  The second phase of this arbitration award, about 2.5 per cent, was paid with effect from 1 December 1984 and the remaining balance of this award is due to be paid on 1 September 1985.</P>
    <P>The current rate of pay of a recruit is almost £121 a week, rising after about 14 weeks basic training to just under £140. On advancement to private 3 star which usually takes place during the first year of service, gross pay rises to over £145, while after three years service, the gross pay of a private is over £158.  I am sure the House will agree that these rates of pay are reasonable.</P>
    <P>In addition, appropriate allowances are payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature.  The rates of these allowances are kept constantly under review to ensure that personnel are adequately compensated for the duties which they are required to undertake. The rates of allowance for service in the Border area currently amount to £18.55 per week for officers and £16.10 per week for men.  Personnel outside the Border area involved in rendering aid to the civil power such as guard duties on vital installations, cash escorts and prisoner escorts, are now paid a daily allowance of £7.90 <Col N="1330" /> for any such duties undertaken on weekdays and at the rate of £15.80 for duties undertaken on a Sunday or Army holiday.</P>
    <P>While general recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force is in abeyance at the moment, I am pleased to say that, in addition to the usual recruitment of cadets and apprentices, 679 recruits were enlisted during 1984, &mdash; 581 for general service to fill vacancies in highly operational units and 98 for the Naval Service. A further 50 recruits were enlisted for the Naval Service during January 1985. During the present period of restricted recruitment the names of individuals who apply to join the Permanent Defence Force are placed on waiting lists in the various commands.  As vacancies are being filled applicants will be called for interview from the waiting lists which are compiled in date order of application for enlistment.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army and Air Corps were held in 1984 and 32 cadetships were awarded.  A competition was advertised in May 1985 for further cadetships in the Army and Air Corps.  Twenty-four cadetships in the Army and ten in the Air Corps will be awarded and the cadets will commence training in November of this year.</P>
    <P>There used to be a belief, and it may still be held residually, that canvassing could assist an applicant in obtaining a cadetship.  I am satisfied that such belief was totally without foundation but in order to try to eliminate it completely, I introduced last year a rule against canvassing under penalty of disqualification. This rule has been imposed again this year and I would like to draw it to the attention of the House in the confident expectation that Members, being aware of it, will ensure that they will not have the embarrassment of disqualifying any young man from a military career.</P>
    <P>During 1984 apprenticeships in the Army and Air Corps totalling 107 were awarded.  Further competitions for the award of apprenticeships in both the Army (up to 60) and Air Corps (up to 20) were advertised in February last.  The <Col N="1331" /> apprentices will commence training in August of this year.</P>
    <P>Arrangements to ensure that personnel of the Defence Forces can avail of the best possible educational and training facilities continued during the past year. A total of 133 officers are undergoing various full-time courses at third-level educational institutions at present.  The practice of assigning officers to such courses is being continued in 1985 to meet the requirements of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, introduced some years ago, to train executive branch cadets of the Naval Service in Ireland, eight cadets trained under this scheme have been commissioned and a further four cadets are undergoing training at present.  Also, 15 officers have been commissioned to date under the scheme introduced for the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified marine engineer officers.</P>
    <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force who, in their own time, attend approved second level and third level courses of education may be refunded the tuition and examination fees involved.</P>
    <P>The scheme whereby personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades such as motor mechanic, sheet metal worker and bricklayer, continues to operate very satisfactorily. These personnel attend either full time off-the-job training courses, day-release courses or block-release courses. Selected personnel are also assigned to specialised third level courses in engineering, electronics and catering.</P>
    <P>In order that the level of knowledge and expertise may be kept in line with modern developments elsewhere, and to provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of the many sophisticated equipments in use in the Defence Forces, it is intended that a number of personnel attend courses in foreign military and civilian establishments during 1985.</P>
    <P>As regards the Reserve (First Line), the FCA and Slua Muirí, I regret that it has again been found necessary to reduce annual training by seven days.  The reduction continues to be necessary as part <Col N="1332" /> of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure.  The saving, lest anyone be in doubt, is substantial, being almost £2 million.  Notwithstanding the reduced period, however, I have again decided that the gratuity payable to qualified members of the Reserve who complete the maximum permissible period in 1985 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance at training for the shorter period.</P>
    <P>The non-pay provisions for this year total almost £74.5 million gross and are required to maintain the capabilities of the Defence Forces and to meet commitments already entered into.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for final payments for three of the five twin-engined Dauphin helicopters on order and due for delivery this year.  Two of the helicopters are for use in conjunction with the new patrol vessel &mdash; LE <i>Eithne</i>&mdash; which was delivered to the Naval Service late last year.  The other helicopter is the first of three which will enable more effective search-and-rescue, air ambulance and transport services to be provided.  The additional two helicopters are due for delivery in 1986.  These Dauphin helicopters are larger and more advanced than the existing Alouettes and will be capable of flying at night and in reduced visibility. An extensive training programme associated with the introduction of these aircraft has already commenced.  The incorporation of advanced avionics in these aircraft to permit of all-weather operations has meant that we have had to wait longer to bring them into service than would otherwise have been the case, but I am glad to say that the state of the art equipment specified by us will give them a navigational capability essential for safe operations in the hostile conditions to be encountered off our south and west coasts.</P>
    <P>A new radar installation was recently put into commission at Casement Aerodrome. This provides air traffic control surveillance of the surrounding air space and assists landings in conditions of reduced visibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> A sum of £8.35 million is provided in subhead S of the Estimates for building and engineering works as compared with an outturn last year of £6.1 million.  This is an increase of 37 per cent and will give added impetus to the ongoing efforts to improve accommodation and develop necessary facilities for the Defence Forces.  The provision includes a sum of £5 million for a range of new buildings and a number of major renovations.</P>
    <P>The main features of the programme for the improvement of accommodation and facilities include the provision of new billets and the refurbishment of older ones; the building of new catering complexes in some locations and the modernisation of existing facilities in others; the development of recreational areas and the construction of new administrative and operational accommodation where necessary, as well as the renovation of existing accommodation of this nature.</P>
    <P>In recent years new billets with central heating and modern amenities have been built at Finner Camp, Dundalk Barracks and Gormanston Camp and at other locations. Plans for new officers quarters at Finner Camp are well advanced.  Renovation of older billets has continued at many locations including Collins Barracks, Dublin, where a new central heating system is now in operation.  Arrangements are being made for the installation of central heating in Collins Barracks, Cork.</P>
    <P>Work is proceeding on the building of new single officers' quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, and on the renovation of the officers' mess there.  At Gormanston Camp a newly constructed brigade headquarters and officers' mess are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>New catering and dining facilities have been provided in recent years at a number of barracks.  Arrangements are being made for the provision of similar facilities at other locations, namely, Casement Aerodrome, Ballincollig, Gormanston, Griffith Barracks, Dublin, Fermoy, Haulbowline and Kilkenny.  It is hoped to have work commenced soon on the modernisation of the catering arrangements at Ballincollig Barracks, County <Col N="1334" /> Cork.  New catering facilities are being planned for Casement Aerodrome.</P>
    <P>Recreational facilities are also being provided, including TV and reading rooms in Casement Aerodrome and Ballincollig Barracks.  A new gymnasium is being planned for Collins Barracks, Cork, and for Custume Barracks, Athlone.</P>
    <P>Planning for the proposed new military barracks at Cavan is progressing and it is hoped to be in a position to commence work on the project early in 1986.</P>
    <P>Other new works under construction or being planned include the second stage of the rebuilding of Ceannt Barracks, Curragh Camp, the renovation of aircraft hangars at Casement Aerodrome, the provision of a new runway at Gormanston Camp and the construction of new transport facilities at Clancy Barracks, Dublin, and Collins Barracks, Cork. Refuelling facilities for helicopters have been installed at several military posts to improve the operational scope of the helicopters.  A new anti-tank range is almost completed in the Glen of Imaal.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased indeed that this comprehensive programme of building and renovation is proceeding at installations right throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I referred at some length last year to the question of providing married quarters for soldiers.  As I indicated then, the provision of family housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities but it has been the policy to augment the measures taken by local authorities in instances where soldiers' housing needs are exceptional. Repairs and renovations to existing married quarters continue to receive attention.  Last year agreement was reached with Dublin Corporation in regard to the transfer of the site of the old married quarters at Arbour Hill to the corporation for housing purposes. Arrangements have since been made with Kilkenny Corporation for the transfer of the site of the old married quarters at Stephen's Barracks, Kilkenny, to that corporation for similar purposes.</P>
    <P>The problem of overholding of married quarters is still with us and is one which <Col N="1335" /> does not lend itself to any simple solution. I am, however, having the problem examined with a view to mitigating its effects as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Turning to equestrian events, I am glad to report that 1984 has been the most successful year on record for the Army Equitation School.  Army riders achieved a total of 140 prizes in competitions both at home and abroad, which yielded prize money in excess of £62,000.  The outstanding achievement of the year was that of Captain John Ledingham on Gabhran winning the Hickstead Derby in August which carried the richest showjumping prize in Europe last year.  I am sure that riders and horses from the school will continue to enhance their reputation throughout the equestrian world.  Indeed, this year already our riders at shows both at home and abroad have notched up a series of firsts against leading civilian competition.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Asgard II</i> completed her full programme of 26 cruises planned for 1984 covering a total distance of nearly 10,000 miles.  Almost 600 people, mainly young boys and girls, participated in the cruises, many of them as members of groups. There was a significant increase during the year in the number of groups of students from vocational and community schools who took part in cruises.  There was also an increase in the numbers of young people from the inner city areas of Dublin, Cork and Limerick who availed of the cruises.  These are trends which Coiste An Asgard are most anxious to encourage.</P>
    <P>Among the highlights of the 1984 season was the visit of <i>Asgard II</i> to St. Malo in Brittany in April for a gathering of tall ships in celebration of the 450th anniversary of the voyage of Jacques Cartier from St. Malo to Canada, where he carried out the first exploration of the St. Lawrence.  Another notable occasion was the visit of <i>Asgard II</i> to Scheveningen in Holland for the tenth birthday celebrations of her sister sail training vessel <i>Eendracht.</i> Other European tall ships also participated in those celebrations and, in the sporting events that were held between the crews, a number of trophies <Col N="1336" /> were won by the young people on <i>Asgard II.</i></P>
    <P>From 1980 to 1984 Irish Shipping Ltd. handled a number of matters in relation to the operation of <i>Asgard II</i> on behalf of Coiste An Asgard and I would like to place on record my gratitude to the personnel of Irish Shipping for their assistance.  The liquidation of the company, however, made it necessary to make other arrangements.  The work is now being carried out directly by Coiste An Asgard which is to be given corporate status and has the aid of a full time secretary from my Department.  Advice and assistance on technical matters are being provided by the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>A full programme of cruises on <i>Asgard II</i> is being carried out again this year. The highlight of the season has been the visit to the United States.  The visit was undertaken in response to an invitation received from the St. Brendan Cup Committee in America.  This committee was organised a few years ago to commemorate the sixth century voyage of Saint Brendan from Ireland to America, to strengthen the bonds of friendship between America and Ireland and to foster greater appreciation of Celtic culture in the United States.  Among other things the committee are planning a biennial yachting event between Ireland and America commencing in 1987.</P>
    <P>After a voyage by way of Spain, Madeira and Bermuda, during which some extremely rough weather was encountered, <i>Asgard II</i> arrived in the United States in May.  The St. Brendan Cup Committee in America organised a programme that took the vessel to a number of American cities.  Some of these cities were far from the sea but were reached by a fine system of inland waterways.  The visit was very successful and I am sure that the young people who participated will benefit greatly from their experience.</P>
    <P>As regards Civil Defence the specific provision for this year is £1.72 million.  It represents an increase of about 15 per cent on the 1984 provision and is indicative of the Government's belief in the value of this organisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> The provision provides for the continuing recruitment, training and equipping of the local authority based Civil Defence services at their present level and the major items include the balance due in respect of the new stock of radiation dose-rate meters, manufactured at Shannon, and a further phase in the introduction of the new style Civil Defence uniform which was commenced last year. As regards equipment, earlier this year there was a further allocation of equipment to local authorities for Civil Defence use &mdash; a fire appliance, six ambulances, ten lighting and rescue sets and five landrovers which were an addition to the existing range of equipment.  I consider that the present equipment position is reasonably satisfactory &mdash; particularly so in current economic circumstances &mdash; and, apart from the major items which I have mentioned, the balance of the equipment provision is intended to initiate purchase action to replace unserviceable vehicles.</P>
    <P>Civil Defence is a valuable additional resource available to each local authority to assist the community in peacetime. The extent to which the organisation is developed and used in that capacity is very much a matter for local initiative but such use is encouraged by my Department on the grounds that it contributes to the effectiveness of the organisation in relation to its wartime role.  The guidelines on emergency planning issued relatively recently to local authorities by the Department of the Environment and the other promotional action by that Department, directed towards greater readiness to respond to any form of peacetime emergency, should help to foster a climate in which local authorities can consider afresh what further opportunities there are to make better use of Civil Defence and the associated voluntary aid societies.  I can assure them of the co-operation of my Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the wartime role of Civil Defence it is regrettable that there is a good deal of comment which is anything but constructive and which must be very discouraging to those who put in so much effort <Col N="1338" /> as members of Civil Defence.  It is easy to be critical and the consequences can be damaging.  Constructive criticism calls for a much greater effort and a prerequisite is a well-informed and positive attitude. Closer contact between the critics of the concept of Civil Defence and the Civil Defence organisation and more face to face dialogue rather than exchanges through the media would, I believe, lead to a much better understanding of the Civil Defence position and would help to foster those measures which are best for our people against the continuing risk of any war situation which might affect this country.  Both centrally and locally Civil Defence has shown itself quite prepared to participate in any such dialogue.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge the debt we owe to the members of the Civil Defence organisation who are giving such good example at a time when many disruptive elements prevail and I include in the expression of appreciation the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade for their continuing co-operation with Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1985, which is for a net sum of £35,972,000.  The net provisional outturn for the year ended 31 December 1984 was £35,745,000.  The 1985 Estimate represents an increase of £227,000, less than one per cent, on the 1984 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>Pensions and allowances provided for under this Estimate have attracted the increase by reference to the recent revision of pay of certain Civil Service grades which was payable in two phases &mdash; 3 per cent from 1 January 1985 and a further 3 per cent from 1 July 1985.  Provision for the increase will be made in the Vote for Increases in Remuneration and Pensions as required.</P>
    <P>The main increases in the Estimate in terms of overall cost are: £539,000 in subhead E.1 &mdash; Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes and £258,000 in subhead K &mdash; grants in respect of the provision of free travel, electricity, bottled gas, television licences and telephone rental for <Col N="1339" /> veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>A token sum of £1,000 is provided in subhead J for compensation payable by way of lump sum to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces who served with the United Nations Force and who were killed or wounded or who died or were disabled as a result of disease contracted during such service.  It is customary to make provision for a token sum only as it is not possible to estimate the demand on the subhead.  Amounts paid are recoverable from the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As regards military service pensions, subhead D, and special allowances, subhead G, the numbers involved continue to decrease.  There are now fewer than 1,300 military service pensioners and about 2,800 special allowance holders on pay.  There is, however, an increase in the number of ex-members of the Defence Forces on retired pay and on pension for whom provision is made under subhead E.1.  The total number of pensioners and allowance holders at present on pay is approximately 19,000.</P>
    <P>I commend both Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House. All of us can be proud of the men and women of the Defence Forces and happy in the knowledge that their traditional loyalty to their country and to each other is as strong as ever.  It is a great consolation for citizens to know that in an emergency they have the protection and support of a totally disciplined body motivated by a high morale which ensures that duty and not self-interest comes first and which conducts its operation with a professionalism and expertise second to none.  I look forward to the debate and I will be happy to supply any further information that Deputies may request in the course of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to reply to the Minister's speech on the Defence Estimate and I am happy to note that there has been an increase of 7 per cent on last year's outturn. I should like to pay tribute to members of all sections of the Defence Forces.  In the short time that I have been <Col N="1340" /> Opposition spokesman on Defence I have observed their diligence, dedication and exemplary discipline in spite of having many difficult and various services and tasks to perform on behalf of the nation.  The Army have been available to aid the civil power in a big way in the last two decades.  Since 1970 the Army have been involved in Border security at a major cost to the State.</P>
      <P>We must be positive in ensuring the protection of the people who live in this part of the island, especially those who live close to the Border.  There are no easy solutions to the problem and, ultimately, the only way forward is through a political solution.  The fact that our Army have to be involved on so many occasions, as outlined in the Minister's speech, at great cost to the Exchequer shows the amount of pressure on the Exchequer due to the difficulties that prevail at regular intervals in that area.</P>
      <P>The Army have provided security at various installations and in the transport of industrial explosives.  They have been involved in that work with the Garda Síochána.  Since 1978 there has been a need for an Army-Garda cash escort for the protection of large cash movements throughout the State.  We are aware of the high cost and the pressure this puts on the Defence Forces and the amount of time they are absent from their normal training and other duties.  The Army have been involved in supporting the Garda Síochána in guarding our prisons and vital installations which need military security at various times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want in particular to pay tribute to both the Naval Service and the Air Corps for the great work they have continued to do in the service of this country over the years, especially in fishery protection and rescue operations.  This has not been fully or properly acknowledged or understood by many people, especially the media commentators.  Recently we had the sad and harrowing Air India disaster off the south-west coast.  One of our naval vessels, the <i>LE Aoife</i>, was quickly on the spot and with the <i>LE Aisling</i> and the new <i>LE Eithne</i>, in co-operation with the Air <Col N="1341" /> Corps, made a major contribution to the rescue operations.  The <i>LE Aoife</i> was responsible for locating the general area of the Air India plane's &ldquo;black box&rdquo; which is still being sought for examination. We also had the services of the Royal Air Force which is normal in international rescue operations.</P>
    <P>As there were four Governments involved technically with this terrible tragedy, we had the services of other international agencies.  The Irish Government were involved because the accident happened off our shores and the crash control centre was in Cork.  Air India were involved as flight operators, thus involving the Indian Government.  The plane was leased from the United States, so the United States Government were involved.  The plane departed from a Canadian airport, so the Canadian Government were involved.  Because of all this governmental involvement the resuce operations had the assistance of the United States Air Force and a sophisticated Canadian rescue boat.</P>
    <P>In all the news reports on RTE radio and television scant regard was had for the Irish Naval and Air Corps services despite the fact that they were first on the scene, within a very short period of the distress call being put out by Shannon. In all reports RTE consistently informed everybody that the Royal Air Force and the Americans were involved in the rescue and always finished up saying &ldquo;and the Irish Naval Service and Air Corps are also helping&rdquo;.  The <i>LE Aisling</i> was in control of the area and co-ordinating the search, but this was not acknowledged.  I hope the contribution our Defence Forces have been and will be making will not get the same type of downgraded coverage in the future as they got on this occasion.  I especially appeal to RTE to ensure that the contributions of all Irish agencies and personnel, irrespective of the sector of the State service, are given rightful coverage in the future.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service have made a major contribution in protecting our fishing resources.  I want to pay particular tribute to them for that.  They now have to patrol an area within the Irish box of 132,000 <Col N="1342" /> square miles.  It is vital now, with the advent of Spain and Portugal as members of the European Community, that the Irish Naval Service would have the resources and the equipment necessary to protect this vital national interest.  We hope no effort will be spared in ensuring the provision of the resources necessary to combat the second arrival of the Spanish Armada around our coasts.</P>
    <P>The <i>LE Eithne</i>, our newest naval vessel, went into service recently.  It is 1,800 tonnes and has special radar and helicopter facilities, including a computer controlled Bofors gun.  It made its first arrest recently when a Spanish fishing vessel was in Irish waters.  This outstanding vessel of Irish design and make, a vessel of which the country can be very proud, will make a major contribution in supplementing and complementing the other important vessels the Naval Service have in fishery protection over the years.</P>
    <P>However, I am very disappointed that the Naval Service Training Headquarters have been moved from Spike Island to Ballincolling Barracks, Cork.  I regard this as a serious and rash decision.  It is vitally important that al members of the Naval Service, whether recruits or permanent members, would always operate in a maritime atmosphere.  They now have to train inland.  I hope if at all possible that this training could be transferred to another maritime area so that the proper atmosphere is provided.  I ask the Minister to investigate this and see what he can do to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Air Corps to this country since 1922 is immeasurable. They have been involved in major rescues and surveillance operations at vital times. They play a major part when international leaders visit Ireland and their contribution to the visit of President Reagan and Pope John Paul II received international recognition.  They play a major role in both surveillance and rescue operations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that five Dauphin helicopters will be provided this year and in particular two marine helicopters which will work in close co-operation with the new naval vessel, the <i>LE Eithne.</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> However, I regret that the Minister did not ensure that at least one Puma helicopter was purchased, because the Puma is much stronger and has a greater capacity than the Dauphin.  We had a Puma in the early eighties leased from the French. This was a vital asset to the country on many occasions, expecially during the snows of 1981.  A Puma would lessen the country's total dependence at times on the Royal Air Force in rescue operations. This was clearly illustrated on 18 February last when an accident happened off the coast of Galway on board a fishing vessel killing one man and seriously injuring another.  It took over three hours before a proper rescue helicopter arrived from South Wales because we had no helicopter of sufficient capacity or capability to perform the necessary rescue operation.  I appeal to the Minister to consider purchasing a Puma helicopter in the future in the interests of the nation to ensure that adequate safety and rescue facilities are available from the State to all citizens whether they be on land or sea, and to people from any part of the world operating on boats or ships or fishing alongside our coasts.</P>
    <P>I wish to be associated with the Minister's tribute to the equestrian section of the Army in which I know he has a particular interest.  I congratulate Captain Ledingham and his colleagues on their great successes over the past year. The Equestrian College has been a major shopwindow for this country and has brought international acclaim and many honours to it.  I should like to compliment and congratulate everybody involved in that college.  We look forward to many more successes for them in this year and the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the captain and crew of <i>Asgard II</i> on the successful completion of their many voyages during the past year.  I know that at times they encountered much turbulent weather.  I am delighted that everybody involved had successful voyages and that the young people on board enjoyed their major experiences.  This is an important contribution by the Defence Forces to <Col N="1344" /> giving young people here an opportunity of sailing the seas and travelling the world.  I commend this very important work.</P>
    <P>The cost of Army pensions this year is close to £36 million.  I would ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of paying pensions in a way which would enable the normal standard deductions which are made for regular members of the Defence Forces during their period there for saving and investments to be continued through the period during which they received pensions until these investments mature.  It would be a great help to retired members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note in the Minister's speech the amount of investment made for buildings and improvements.  In particular, I am glad to see that in early 1986 he proposes to go ahead with the new barracks in Cavan, as this is urgently needed.  I would also ask him to consider a similar building programme for the coming year and to continue to escalate it.  It is vitally important that proper housing be made available, and proper married quarters in particular, for members of the Defence Forces.  I accept that Army personnel should get the same consideration as civilians for all local authority housing, but this can often create surplus demand for this housing.  In particular, I would ask the Minister to outline in detail the exact position regarding the relocation of four Army personnel at present in four houses earmarked for demolition at the Holiday Square end of Arbour Hill.  I would be grateful if he could tell us when these people would be relocated and what the exact position is.</P>
    <P>The structure of payments that Army personnel receive at times may militate against their qualifying for maximum loans from local authorities, housing finance agencies, banks or other lending institutions, as often the permanent allowances which they receive are not taken into account by these agencies and institutions.  I would be grateful if the Minister could investigate the situation and see if full acknowledgement would be given to Army personnel when they <Col N="1345" /> make applications for loans, in order to ensure that they can qualify for these loans and purchase their own houses. This would ease the pressure on Army housing and ensure that Army people were at no disadvantage when they applied for these loans.</P>
    <P>In particular, I would ask the Minister to discuss with his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for the Environment, the possibility of allocating the new local authority special grant of £5,000 for Army personnel who wish to purchase their own houses.  The fact that they live in State Exchequer-paid houses should not militate against them in qualifying for this special grant.  Really, there is no difference between a person living in a local authority house paid for by State funds through the Department of the Environment and a person living in an Army house which is paid for by State funds made through the Department of Defence.  It would be in the interests of Army personnel and the Exchequer to ease the pressure on housing if this grant could be made available to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>It is now almost 30 years since we first became full members of the United Nations.  During that period of time we have sought to ensure in every possible way that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are fully respected. Ireland's approach over these years has been clear and consistent.  We want to see full respect for the independence and territorial integrity of all States throughout the world.  We want to ensure that the right of all peoples to determine their own future free from outside interference would be maintained at all times. We want to promote, in every way possible open to this country, a greater measure of justice and order in international affairs and relationships.</P>
    <P>I want to pay particular tribute to the many gallant Irishmen and women, as members of the Irish Army and Irish Defence Forces, who have played such an important part in international peace-keeping affairs throughout the world over the past 30 years.  They have operated under the most difficult conditions and <Col N="1346" /> have proved conclusively in several locations worldwide that Ireland is one of the few nations with the particular mettle and abilities that peace-keeping demands, irrespective of the situation or conditions in which our Army find themselves.  This has been internationally acknowledged. However, I regret that on the recent 25th anniversary of our first overseas mission held on 19 June many members of the Defence Forces who served over these years, many of them now retired, were not invited to that commemoration. I would request the Minister, in any future commemoration like this to ensure, if at all possible, that all those who served will be invited.</P>
    <P>At present we have a battalion serving with the United Nations International Forces in the Lebanon.  Their mandate is to supervise the withdrawal of Israeli forces, bring peace and stability to the area and supervise the transfer back to the authority of the people in the Lebanon.  During the past month and particularly over the past year our forces have come under fire from some illegal groups.  We are fortunate that there have been no casualties on either side.  The group's first commitment is to bring peace and stability to the area in which they operate under their mandate.  The people of the Lebanon have a great regard for the Irish troops.  They depend on them to prevent Israeli atrocities and to highlight the situation in which our troops find themselves.  The removal of the Irish battalion would be a disastrous blow to the morale of the United Nations Forces who are under the control of our own Lieutenant-General William Callaghan who is the overall UNIFIL Commander. I, too, want to pay tribute to Lieutenant-General Callaghan and all the members of his battalion and to assure them that they have our full support in endeavouring to bring peace and stability to a troubled land.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that the Government have consistently exerted severe pressure, through diplomatic channels, on the Israelis to ensure that our Army and Defence Forces would not be victims of any <Col N="1347" /> intimidation or incidents similar to those which happened over the past year on no fewer than 40 occasions.  I regret, however, that when the President of Israel, Chaim Hertzog, came here some weeks ago sufficient pressure was not exerted on him regarding these many incidents. As I understand, only one Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke to the President of Israel on that occasion.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that if any opportunity like this occurs, the position of Ireland and the Irish Defence Forces will be outlined in the strongest possible manner to any international leaders coming to our country.</P>
    <P>The Army's contribution to internal security is outstanding.  They carry out many extra duties alongside the Garda Síochána in many difficult situations.  I recognise the many long hours of duty worked by members of our Defence Forces and how much of this time is spent on protecting our people in certain difficult situations and in providing emergency services.  Although our Defence Forces work alongside the civil authority, on many occasions they do not get the same recognition or the same remuneration for the extra hours they work in the service of our people.  I wish to acknowledge their contribution and to pay tribute to them for their commitment and dedication to duty, irrespective of the locations or the long unsocial hours they have to work.</P>
    <P>The total establishment figure for all sections of the Army is in excess of 18,000 personnel.  The present strength of our Defence forces is 13,668 persons.  Therefore, we are under-strength by about 4,000 personnel.  The Army have played a major role in the development of our country and of our people in recent years, particularly those who have been fortunate enough to join the Army and to participate in the many disciplines attached to it.  We have many outstanding young people who would make a major contribution to our Army and to the Defence Forces if they were given an opportunity, and towards this end many unemployed people should be given an <Col N="1348" /> opportunity to join the Army, whether for a long or short period.  Through the training and discipline that is so evident in the Army they could make a major contribution in the years ahead, especially in national security and in leadership in our community.</P>
    <P>We hope that the major efforts made in the past will be made again in the coming years to ensure that Army strength is increased sufficiently and that there is proper and full training in all its aspects of our officers.  It is especially commendable to see women entering the forces and playing their part in the development of the forces.  However, I regret that very few women have been recruited in the past few years and I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have nearly 250,000 people unemployed and many of these people are disillusioned and disorientated. They are people of high educational standards, with keen intellects, and they have great ideals.  On their behalf and in the interests of the country I appeal to the Minister to expand recruitment to the Army as soon as possible.  I am sure he can confirm that in the past year many voluntary organisations, youth organisations and responsible employer bodies have made representations to his Department and to the Army to increase Army recruitment.  I appeal to him to provide the funds and at least to increase recruitment in the next year by approximately 2,000 members if this is at all possible.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister to consider the setting up of a special Army corps. This would give an opportunity for young people for short periods &mdash; perhaps one or two years &mdash; to make a contribution to Army life and to partake in military training and discipline.  There are many young people who want to make this contribution and the setting up of such an Army corps would provide an opportunity for them.  It would be in the best interests of the nation at this time.</P>
    <P>It is vital in modern times that the best people in our community be given an opportunity of joining the Defence Forces.  All of us have a sense of national <Col N="1349" /> pride.  All of us would like to make a contribution in a special way to the development of our country.  There are many idealistic young men and women who are anxious to join the Defence Forces and to make their contribution but they have not been given the opportunity at this time.  One of the great decisions made by the Army some years ago was to give an opportunity to young officers to attend educational courses in University College, Galway, in Kevin Street College of Technology and in the NIHE.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that proper training in all its aspects is given to all officers and that the opportunity in these colleges and in the third level institutions will be provided in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The FCA have given a major opportunity to many young people to become involved in our Defence Forces.  They are required as a back-up to the Permanent Defence Forces and their great ability is the detailed knowledge they have of their own localities.  National defence means the employment of the Permanent Defence Force and it also means general protection for the population as a whole. This was never more relevant than at present.  The FCA and the Civil Defence have a major role to play in this area.  In view of the many young people who are not gainfully employed, the FCA should be expanded to harness their abilities and to give them an opportunity of showing their commitment to our country.  At present the FCA operate only for a one-week training period in summer.  I appeal to the Minister to revert to having training courses of two or three weeks as in the past.  During the long summer months many young people have plenty of time on their hands and I ask the Minister to consider a training schedule lasting for one month for the FCA.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the great contribution of the Civil Defence organisation during the years and particularly since the establishment of the Civil Defence School in the Phoenix Park in 1951.  In this country Civil Defence is established as a part of the national defence structure, principally to provide for the protection of the civil population at all times <Col N="1350" /> and to assist in war time and in disasters and emergencies.  It is vital in modern times, where there has been such major technological advances in the level of arms available to all nations, that every assistance be given to the Civil Defence organisation to ensure that our citizens will be able at least to make the minimum arrangements necessary in the event of a national or international disaster, which we hope and pray will never occur.  As the spokesman with responsibility for Civil Defence, I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that those in the local authorities who are charged with the responsibility of promoting Civil Defence will be encouraged at all times to do so.  It is vital that sufficient co-operation be forthcoming between these local authority officers and the various Army officers who are involved in promoting Civil Defence in the commands throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there has been an increase of 7 per cent in the Estimate for the Department of Defence as against the outturn for last year.  I ask the Minister to expand in some detail on subhead A.2 which deals with consultancy services costing £10,000 and on subhead C which deals with lands.  In that case there has been an increase of 65 per cent over last year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to pay tribute to all the members of the Defence Forces, including An Slua Muirí, for their dedication and commitment to duty.  I also wish to sincerely thank the Minister and his staff for the co-operation and courtesy shown to me in the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): As the Minister of State with specific responsibility for Civil Defence, I would like to expand a little on what the Minister for Defence has already said.  The training of Civil Defence volunteers continues at local training centres throughout the country and at weekend camps which are run annually by many counties.  The organisation is in a very healthy state with approximately 20,000 active volunteers spread throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that the Members of the <Col N="1351" /> House, particularly those who are also members of local authorities, will be well aware of the niche that Civil Defence has established for itself within the community. Indeed, Civil Defence is an important part of the emergency infrastructure of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The life line of any voluntary body is the constant inflow of new members and I am glad to report that Civil Defence has attracted a large number of new members this year.  This inflow will more than replace those trained members who have ceased to be active for one reason or another.  These non-active members, so long as they remain within the Civil Defence organisation, would be expected to make themselves available for service should that need arise.  I have every confidence that they would do so without the slightest hesitation.  Indeed from my experience of meeting the Civil Defence volunteers, it seems that it is that type of organisation that once you have been a member, you never want to cut your ties with it completely even if you are no longer an active member.  I think this says a great deal for the useful work being done by the organisation.  A benefit of Civil Defence which is often overlooked is that by continually training new members a tremendous reservoir of people with some basic skills in first aid, firefighting, rescue and so on is steadily being built up within the community.  I see it as one of my responsibilities to make Civil Defence as attractive an organisation as possible, so that it will have no difficulty in attracting new members.  I would urge Deputies to actively encourage people, especially young people, to join Civil Defence.  I can think of no better way for a person to spend his or her spare time than by devoting it to an organisation like Civil Defence which serves the community in such a worthwhile and practical way.</P>
    <P>Very often the amount of voluntary work undertaken by the volunteers in Civil Defence week after week is not appreciated.  These people are available at the drop of a hat in all sorts of situations, whether rescue, fire service or any <Col N="1352" /> other.  All too often the organisation is not given the publicity it deserves whether by Members of this House, by members of local authorities or by the media.  In this connection I make a special plea to the media to use their forum to give encouragement to Civil Defence whose volunteers give of their time without any compensation whatever but at cost to themselves.  At times it is disheartening, after they have put much effort into preparations for competitions, both at regional and national level, to find that they receive only the minimal attention in the media despite the fact that these events are for them their all-Ireland final, as it were.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Noel Treacy in his call to members of local authorities who have the responsibility for organising Civil Defence.  I do not think that members of local authorities are made aware by local authority staffs of the function of Civil Defence in the various counties. At Estimate time in their local authorities, Deputies should pay particular attention to ensuring that Civil Defence is looked after properly and promoted in the various countries.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Defence mentioned a few moments ago, the allocation of equipment to local authorities continued this year.  I had the pleasure some months ago of handing over some of this equipment at the Civil Defence School. I assure the House that any equipment issued to Civil Defence is very much appreciated by the members and is put to very good use.  Among the equipment allocated his year were new landrovers, fire engines and other rescue equipment. This means a great deal to the volunteers. So long as I have responsibility in this area, I will fight to ensure that Civil Defence is given its fair share of the cake.</P>
    <P>One of the ways in which the Government can show their support and commitment to Civil Defence is by providing the organisation with all of the necessary equipment etc.  The fact that even within our stringent financial situation the allocation to Civil Defence has increased by more than 15 per cent in the past year is an indication of the present <Col N="1353" /> Government's commitment and concrete support for Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>It is easy for us in political life to praise members of organisations but these words sound empty if we are not seen to be supporting the people concerned by way of making available to them the equipment they need.  I am proud that we have been able to increase the allocation this year.</P>
    <P>Last month we had the last of this year's national competitions and this marks the end of one Civil Defence year and the beginning of another.  It is therefore opportune to stand back and review the year's work and to look ahead and see what the future holds.  Any organisation, no matter what its size or objectives, needs to react to the changing times in which we are living.  The Civil Defence organisation is no exception to this.  It is therefore my intention in the next few months to have a major review of the whole Civil Defence organisation carried out.</P>
    <P>Again, I would appeal to local authorities that if they have any ideas which they consider would be worthwhile either in promoting Civil Defence or in improving the organisation, they would put those ideas forward.  They would be very welcome so far as I am concerned personally and also so far as the Civil Defence School is concerned.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the type of organisation we have is the one that is best suited to present day needs.  We must ensure that we have an organisation capable of adapting to different situations and possible way and that we are getting the best possible value from it.  We must ensure that we have an organisation capable of adapting to different situations and different circumstances.  Any review which takes place must take cognisance of the fact that Civil Defence is a volunteer force, without those volunteers there would be no civil defence.</P>
    <P>In the last two and a half years I have derived tremendous pleasure from being associated with Civil Defence.  I have been extremely impressed by the enthusiasm and dedication of the volunteers who give so much of their free time to the <Col N="1354" /> service of the community and I can assure the House that tremendous value is being received from the money which is being allocated to Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months particularly we have succeeded in quelling the notion that Civil Defence in some way supported nuclear war on nuclear weapons.  The organisation do not support in any way the build up of nuclear weapons.  Civil Defence would make themselves available in the event of the type of catastrophe which all of us hope will never take place but in peacetime the organisation continues to play a tremendous role in dealing with emergencies of all kinds. This is not a political issue.  We are talking about a volunteer force of which we can all be proud and we must avail of every opportunity of supporting these people and of encouraging young people especially to join the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to thank the Minister for the courtesy I received in all my dealings with him.  I include in that all the people in his Department and the members of the Defence Forces with whom I had any dealings.  I compliment them and thank them.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on putting a very brave face on a very pathetic picture: a very threadbare Estimate is how it could be described.  He has brushed the Martin-Henry, taken it out from under the mattress, had the creases put in the right place but I am afraid it is looking the worse of the wear.  It might do for fatigue duty but, on an occasion like this when Estimates are presented for a year ahead, something better is needed.  I am positive that the Department &mdash; whether it be the Civil Defence section of it or any other &mdash; need a massive injection of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saddest feature of today's Defence Forces is that there is no recruitment, no new intake worth mentioning.  There are figures trotted out to us of the recruits taken on in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps during the year and there is a token amount taken up to make up for wastage.  But in times of frightful unemployment such as these there is very little <Col N="1355" /> wastage.  There is no hope of an Army career today for many boys and girls who are thinking in that direction.  The House will remember that there was an advertisement at one time showing the rangers, encouraging one to join today's Army. There was a great big poster at the entrance to the Curragh of where one should go if one wished to join.  All that has changed.  The areas from which traditionally Army people came &mdash; I was just mentioning this to my colleague from Wexford here &mdash; is an outlet no longer available and is denied them.</P>
    <P>One can fool a lot of people with statistics but in the Army apprentice school in 1984 there were 107 apprentices taken on in the Army or Air Corps whereas this year 80 &mdash; 60 and 20 &mdash; are being taken on.  That is a cutback.  Also the Reserve (First Line), the FCA and the Slua Muirí training is being restricted to seven days. The Minister mentioned a 7 per cent increase in 1985.  They did not receive sufficient in 1984.  Therefore a 7 per cent or even a 15 per cent increase as was mentioned in the Civil Defence Estimate will make no appreciable difference in the coming year.  There are more postulants entering convents today than there are recruits going into the Army.  The difference is that nuns are looking for recruits and cannot get them but the Army will not allow those who want to come in to be recruited.  The excuse advanced is our financial difficulties, that the economic climate is not suitable.  It is all a matter of money and it is really bad for morale.  There are extra duties imposed on those who are there and a break in the continuity or intake.</P>
    <P>There must not be the same interest in training when there are not that many to train.  There is a very bad balance beginning to be felt in the Army.  If the Coalition remain in office too long &mdash; though, thank God, that is unlikely &mdash; we will finish up with &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo;.  An army needs young people.  Young people are needed in the Navy, in the Equitation School, on the <i>Asgard</i> training vessel or whatever.  Worst of all is the fact that there are girls on the waiting list &mdash; this <Col N="1356" /> has been referred to before &mdash; with no earthly hope of their being taken on. They are being kept there on a string. Some years ago there were great fanfares when these girls were first admitted. There is now a waiting list.  The Minister could be sued for breach of promise now by these girls who had been hoping to get into the Army.  Why has not the Minister the honesty and sincerity to tell them that there is no hope for them, that they will not be taken on?  That policy should be changed.  It is up to the Ministers involved at Cabinet level to provide the money. How is there money for youth employment schemes, hundreds of millions?  At one time it was considered that £5,000 was sufficient to keep a recruit; possibly that figure would have to be raised now to approximately £8,000.  Indeed £8 million is not a lot to ask for, which would keep 1,000 recruits.  Think of the injection of youth, idealism that would mean. If one is talking about training for young people, what better training or experience could young people get than to serve in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet should be asked what they will do for our young people, young people anxious for a chance to serve their country, to channel their idealism in the right way.  If necessary &mdash; as our spokesman has said &mdash; a special corps should be established with an intensive one year course of military training, when we would have a very fine reserve force.  That is something worthwhile to which we should devote attention.  If we want to get young people into proper training, letting them do good for the country, there is an opportunity to do so rather than inventing schemes of less value.</P>
    <P>Last week I was in Germany.  I had the satisfaction of visiting Schleswig-Holstein near the Border and saw Border military police, if one might describe them as such.  While I yield to none in my admiration for the Irishman as a soldier, I must say that, when I saw the army camp there, the facilities they had, with its up-to-date transport system, comparisons with ours were very odious.  Most of our barracks are falling down, need <Col N="1357" /> replacement.  At present ordinary day-to-day maintenance is being neglected.  That is because of the recruitment embargo that three must leave before one can be recruited.  As far as I know there are now 90 labourers short in the Curragh Camp and there are tradesmen short too.  Work is being done there on contract.  There is much work to be done.  Why do we not recruit the people to do it?  Would that not be much better than inventing schemes or asking local authorities to think of any type of work people could do.  This work is there to be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what long term plans we have for bringing our military installations into the twentieth never mind the twenty-first century.  Any plans we have are mere stop-gap ones.  The new cookhouse or dining hall only helps to emphasise the drabness of the rest of the camp.  I think if Deputies had a look around the camp they would agree with me.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is a lot made of the £8.35 million provided under Subhead S of the Estimates, which represents an increase of 37 per cent, and a sum of £5 million for a range of new buildings and a number of major renovations.  Five million pounds would not go too far on a range of new buildings and a number of major renovations.  Many pious hopes are enunciated but there is no earthly prospect of them coming to anything in the coming year.  I agree that the items in mind are laudable but they will not be completed over the period of the present Estimate.  I was going to say &mdash; during the life of the present Government &mdash; but it might be asking too much to expect that they be completed in that time.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague when he mentioned Army housing and married quarters.  The married quarters I know are appalling, even the new ones are not good.  Some years ago I made a determined effort that the problem of overholders would be tackled with the co-operation of local authorities.  At that time in Kildare we had approximately 40 overholders.  I had hoped that over a five year programme we could have provided those people with houses.  That scheme <Col N="1358" /> would appear to have been shelved.  The Department of Defence always pass the buck, contending it is a matter for the local authorities to house these people.  I know of landlords who have people in their houses, who have given their lives in the service of a particular landlord, who feel an obligation to assist them to be housed; they do not just turf them out.  I believe the Department of Defence could provide an allocation each year &mdash; anyhow it all comes out of the same coffers &mdash; to enable this problem to be tackled. By allocation I mean a specific sum &mdash; I am not asking too much &mdash; that would build a certain number of houses in each area earmarked for Defence Forces personnel, that would be seen not to diminish the amount of houses available for civilians awaiting them.  Married quarters, even the new ones, are not the answer.  Young people, particularly young married women, like to go into them as a last resort only.  As I said before, the building of married quarters is only perpetuating the problem.  I should like to see schemes initiated in the proximity of Army barracks, like local authority purchase scheme houses, under which an Army man who signed on for 21 years, at the end of that period might see himself as the owner of his house.  His rent could be deducted from his wages during that time; he would eventually own the house and he would not then be placed on the housing list in middle age.</P>
    <P>I might refer to a very laudable idea that emerged during the year whereby people in the public service would be encouraged to have a career break.  I happened to raise at Question Time the question of an Army nurse who wanted to go and nurse abroad.  I asked the Department of Defence their attitude and if this girl would come under the guidelines laid down for this career break.  They said they would examine it and they eventually decided that Army nurses could get a career break.  By that time the young lady had gone to nurse in Africa.  The Minister for the Public Service decided that the scheme cannot be made retrospective in her case.  She was the guinea pig and everyone else who <Col N="1359" /> has gone after her will qualify for a career break.  That is sharp practice.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to change that decision.</P>
    <P>A new problem has reared its head in the Curragh.  At present there are 20 itinerant horses and caravans permanently camped on the Curragh and new ones have recently arrived.  There are mares and foals and even a piebald stallion. They are roaming at will around the Curragh interfering with race horses and they are in the full view of anyone who cares to look at them.  Fifty years ago the head ranger would remove stray animals or even people who had the temerity to drive with a horse and cart across the Curragh.  Who is responsible now?  Both the Army and the Garda recognise that these people are breaking the law but they cannot impound these horses if they know the owners.  Neither the Army nor the Garda can do anything.  That is ridiculous. What is wrong in Ireland today is that we are gone soft; the judges in the courts are gone soft and the people are gone soft.  Are the Army and the Garda going soft as well?</P>
    <P>During my term as Minister for Defence we used the Army to help to move a blockade of unfortunate fishermen from Dublin port &mdash; the fishermen were protesting to highlight genuine grievances about the payments on boats. They have plenty of reason to feel more aggrieved since.  Today a new breed of itinerants can flout the law and interfere with an industry which has given great employment in the Curragh.  They can put unfortunate apprentices, perhaps riding two year olds, in danger of being hurt in an accident, not to mention the danger of animal diseases.  Yet we are told we cannot do anything.  I demand that the Minister use the Army to remove these itinerants as they are in breach of the law of the land.  We send troops to the Lebanon and to the Border to keep the peace and we cannot keep the peace here and enforce the law.  Who is running the country?  The party to which the Minister belongs always prided themselves on being the party of law and <Col N="1360" /> order, but their record is fairly dismal. The Minister should enforce the law or get out and let somebody else enforce it. In his speech the Minister said that the duties undertaken by the Defence Forces in support of the Garda Síochána are necessary to uphold security and maintain the rule of law.  That is an empty phrase.  If we mean what we say we should start at home in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to our UNIFIL contingent in the Lebanon.  We continue to send out the battalions every six months on a dangerous peace-keeping mission.  It is right to do so.  They have done a good job, and I hope will continue to do so. The Army welcome the opportunity to prove their mettle abroad and to put their years of training into practice; but they have not got much co-operation on the other side either from the Palestinians or the Israelies, who should realise that they have a duty to help to keep the peace as well.  I am glad that this aspect was highlighted during President Hertzog's recent visit here.  I hope our dissatisfaction with their activities was brought home to them.  The role of the UNIFIL forces must be more clearly defined and their mandate should be more clearly outlined and the withdrawal of troops observed.  If our Army is to do a job with the UN forces we cannot be used as pawns on an international chess board. We are welcome into most trouble spots, whether it be the Congo, Cyprus or the Middle East, and we cannot be classified as being pro-West or pro-East.  We do not have an imperial remorseful conscience and we have no ideological hang up.  We are neutral and we want to stay that way. That is why we are acceptable as an independent peace keeping force anywhere in the world.  We can be relied upon to be independent and to have integrity.</P>
    <P>I must take the Minister to task in relation to neutrality.  Perhaps the Minister was sending up smoke signals or had been asked to fly a kite, but he gave me the impression that he was speaking from personal conviction when he indicated that our neutrality could be bartered, diluted or abandoned.  Other Cabinet Ministers disassociated themselves from <Col N="1361" /> the Minister's view; and, as public opinion made itself clear, their disassociation widened.  I hope that is the last we will hear of it and that the &ldquo;For sale&rdquo; sign will be taken down as far as our neutrality is concerned.  Any Irish man will say that he cherishes neutrality most; and if you ask one what De Valera was most remembered for, he will say it is because he kept Ireland neutral during the war.  The Minister's action has made him suspect in the eyes of the public, as did the Minister's miscalculation when he had an Irish contingent participate in the British Legion Poppy Day ceremony.  The Minister's subsequent actions continue to raise doubt in people's minds.  Our neutrality is in greater danger today because of a Coalition Government.  There was a suggestion that we would have a national day of remembrance in order to get away from a lot of this.  What has happened to that suggestion?  Has it been shelved, or has it been acted upon?</P>
    <P>I share the Minister's pleasure at the success during the year of the Army Equitation School, both at home and abroad, and I hope it continues.  I hope that the intake of special cadets, a scheme that was geared towards equestrian prowess, will continue.  I was pleased to learn of the full programme that the <i>Asgard</i> carried out during the year.  It is a glorious opportunity for a maritime country to show its wares, even though our shipping history is not so good of late.  Certain people make overtures that the Army School of Equitation and the <i>Asgard</i> could be dispensed with.  I know the Minister will resist any attempt to dispense with their services because they are well worth while.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister mentioned in his speech that canvassing for cadetships would disqualify a candidate.  If one told that to the people in the Curragh they would have a right to ask how canvassing did not disqualify the Minister for Finance's man for the job in the Corps of Engineers.  The Minister for Finance admitted that he used his influence to secure this appointment.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander and what is good for the cadets <Col N="1362" /> should also apply in the Corps of Engineers. To make the comparison worse, a cadet who did not pass his exam would not have any hope of getting through, but Deputy Duke's man did not pass the interview and still he got the job.  It would be hard to explain that to people who want a fair cut of the whip.</P>
    <P>I note during the year that we had constant media references and hysterical demands to withdraw our troops from the Border.  It would be well to remember that they are there to protect the people, not least the citizens of this State, and that they are doing an excellent job.  They are not there as policemen for Britain and they never acted in such a capacity. The rare events that happen should reinforce the opinion that they are needed there and that they cannot be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>I had thought that by now we would have had our new fishery protection vessel fully operational and that we would have the helicopters on board and working, because they are needed.  I am glad that arrangements have been made.  I hope that the deadline will be met and that the helicopters will be functional. Now more than ever we need a greater surveillance over a wider area and the helicopter bearing fisheries protection vessel should give us the opportunity to provide that.</P>
    <P>I envy the Minister.  He is lucky.  He is involved with our Defence Forces &mdash; the last bastion of discipline and patriotism in the dying years of the 20th century.  I appeal to him not to stifle them for lack of funds, not to turn their idealism into cynicism. The cynicism that is growing daily in our young people is possibly their greatest fault today, and I hope that it will not be increased.  We should allow the Army, the Navy and the Defence Forces generally to grow naturally by allowing a proper intake of recruits, of young people.  We should show our appreciation to the troops along the Border who work long hours day and night at a dangerous and demanding task.  We must not allow the FCA to be run down any further. We must give them an opportunity to be <Col N="1363" /> revitalised.  For instance, why in the last few years was a decision taken by some mole in the Revenue Commissioners that the few extra pounds the FCA people got for holiday duty would be subject to income tax?  They would spend that much travelling on buses across the city at night for the rest of the year to do their training. They do not deserve such treatment.  I hope a formula will be found which can satisfy the Revenue Commissioners or somebody with power to tell them that is no longer taxable.</P>
    <P>We have mentioned Civil Defence here.  It is peculiar that the Minister felt that it was maligned and got a raw deal on the media and the Minister of State felt that it had not proper public relations. That amazes me.  If this Government cannot provide proper relations for every branch under their care it is a poor look out for everyone else.  Civil Defence does a good job within the resources available to it, as do the Red Cross.  It deserves better treatment than it is getting.  We should, and I will, take the Minister's hint to use whatever influence we have at local authority level to encourage Civil Defence and to enable others to join.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have always been loyal and, I am sure, will always play their part and will perform any duty allocated to them; but the Government and the Minister of the day must play their part, too, and the forces deserve better treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the Minister's speech referred to the participation of the Irish forces abroad in the Lebanon and other places and, of course, we are all very proud of the work they do there. However, as a Border Deputy I wish to make a short contribution relating to the activities of the Army in the Border area. I want to express thanks on behalf of myself and the people of Dundalk, north Louth and Monaghan for the great work the Defence Forces have done over the last 16 years of tragic warfare in the North.  I congratulate the Army and the Garda Síochána for the job they have done in protecting my native town of <Col N="1364" /> Dundalk and ensuring that, despite the savage atrocities committed by the IRA in the North, there was only one retaliatory bomb, which, sad to say, took the lives of two citizens.  It is a great tribute to the 24 hour surveillance that the Army undertake that we have had only one such bombing episode.  I want to express the thanks of all the people in the Border region for the tremendous work done by the Defence Forces in that surveillance field.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his speech that over 12,000 military parties were supplied in Border areas and that over 3,500 escorts for movement of cash were provided. I want to voice my disapproval of the use of the Army for the transfer of cash to the commercial banks.  The banks are well fitted to pay for that and I fail to see why that support should be provided by the ratepayers for people who have the money to pay for it.  If the cost of that was quantified I am sure it would add up to a frightening figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relating back to the Border area, I want to draw the attention of the House and of the nation to the appalling drain on the State's meagre resources that subversive forces are causing.  The various shades of the IRA, whether Provisional, Official, IRSP, INLA or whatever, last year cost the State £186 million and over the last 16 years since the outbreak of the troubles in the North probably between £2 billion and £3 billion has been expended on Border surveillance.  That is a mind-boggling figure for a country of fewer than 3.5 million people.  If that money has been free for redeployment on the employment of people, I doubt if we would have anybody on the unemployment list.  That illustrates the terrible damage being done to our country by the forces of subversion, both internationally and economically.  I do not know how these people with perverted ideas of nationalism and republicanism can candone the expenditure of £3 billion.  In addition, the number of atrocities committed by them and the number of lives they have taken in those 16 years makes one intensely ashamed of them.  We should identify them as the greatest <Col N="1365" /> threat to this nation.  They pose the greatest threat to this State and its economic capability and the welfare of its citizens; and the nation would be well rid of them.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention also to the number of unacceptable incursions by the British forces in the Border region in the recent past.  I think the number is over 90 in the last two years.  By both land and sea in the Carlingford Lough area they have come in frequently and infringed Irish sovereignty. That is totally unacceptable. Recently we had the worst incursion of all when a unit of solidiers numbering up to 40 came a distance of 400 yards into County Louth and added insult to injury by issuing a statement that it was due to a map reading error.  That was an insult to the Irish nation because the incident occurred just a few fields from their barracks at 11 a.m.  They have got away with these frequent incursions.  In a previous debate on that subject I suggested that British Army personnel coming in here bearing guns should be arrested and charged in an Irish court.  Until that deterrent is provided these unwelcome incursions will continue to take place.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  In the incident I have referred to they would have come in even further but for the presence of the Irish Army and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the purchase of helicopters and there has recently been talk of the creation of a helicopter unit for the Garda.  Surely some type of arrangement could be made whereby Army helicopters could be provided for the use by Garda personnel on joint patrols, particularly in the Border area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rates of pay which the Minister enumerated, I would point out that, in contrast to the rates of pay for the Garda Síochána, the rates of pay for Border duties for ordinary soldiers is very low and should be upgraded.  The Minister might also direct his attention to the differential scale used for deciding the pensions of NCOs and others.  Apparently they are on a different scale to that used for officers.  This is unfair.  There is no difference in the length of service and the same scale should be used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> I would also direct the Minister's attention to the dangers under which the Defence Forces, Army or Garda Síochána, work.  In December 1983 a solider was murdered in Ballinamore and there has been a continuing toll of Garda personnel. Some deterrent should be provided for the protection of these people and of all Irish citizens.  Why is capital punishment still on the Statute Book but not implemented?</P>

I should like to comment on Deputy Power's reference, which was in extremely bad taste, to the Minister's participation in the Poppy Day ceremonies.  Deputy Power seems to have tunnel vision on matters of that nature.  The Poppy Day commemorations were for people who give their lives in defence of a free Europe, people from all the countries of Western Europe, members of various defence forces and the hapless citizens, millions of whom gave their lives against the oppression of the greatest madman this century has known, Adolf Hitler.  We should remember and honour the dead and not cast slurs on the Minister for attending.  I admire his courage and hope he will continue that practice for the rest of his period in office.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this debate.  The Minister in his speech dealt with the question of housing for serving Army personnel and the problem of overholding in the case of retired Army personnel.  The Minister at Question Time some weeks ago and in some speeches referred to the fact that there is very welcome liaison between the local authorities and the housing officers of the Army with regard to the housing of Army personnel.  Essentially the Minister is correct in stating that the housing of married Army personnel is the responsibility of the local authority. The Army have chosen in various towns to provide Army housing.  I do not know <Col N="1367" /> how many towns are involved but there are two Army schemes in Athlone and isolated Army houses both inside and outside the barracks.  When an Army person retires from service he is overholding and is not in receipt of benefits from the Army until he hands back his house to the Army authorities.</P>
      <P>Various solutions have been put forward over the years by successive Governments.  One solution was that Army personnel should have the option of buying the Army houses, but that was not feasible because in many instances the houses are either within barrack walls or close by.  It could be construed as dangerous to allow civilians to take up occupation of such houses.</P>
      <P>The growing liaison between the housing sections of local authorities and the Army housing authorities is to be commended. Various county managers and town clerks have entered into loose but worthwhile arrangements whereby when an Army person ceases service a house is offered from the local authority stock at the earliest opportunity.  This is a welcome development.  The system varies from area to area and I do not know if it has yet become formally established, but it certainly works in a very harmonious fashion in Athlone where an informal structure was set up some years ago.  I know from speaking to other Deputies and from listening to the questions put here some weeks ago that this arrangement operates in other towns as well.  I know that our spokesman and Deputy Power have already mentioned this subject but I hope the Minister will bear with the tautology.  The Minister has referred to the fact that debate is taking place between officials of his Department and others on this matter.  I would urge that this development be given an impetus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer in particular to the position of an Army couple who are now in occupation of an Army house in a town like Athlone or Dundalk.  They are not coming to the end of Army service and they decide to purchase a house for themselves now rather than depend on the <Col N="1368" /> local authority when the end of their service comes and they are not in such an advantageous position for an SDA or HFA loan.  A man of 30 to 40 years of age may wish to provide a family home as distinct from a house from the Army or local authority, but he is at a disadvantage when he looks for a local authority loan <i>vis-à-vis</i> urban or county council tenants of that authority.  Some weeks ago, in reply to a question on this matter, the Minister asked why a grant of £5,000 should be given to an Army man who does not occupy a local authority house or has not done so for three years, which is the criterion for the provision of such a grant.  He should receive such a grant because he has tenure under the housing authority even though that tenure is an Army one.  That housing authority has entered into arrangements with the local Army authority to facilitate movement within their spheres of activity.  Although it would be essentially a decision of the Minister for the Environment, perhaps the Minister for Defence could arrange for the extension to Army personnel of the different types of bonuses available to a local authority tenant upon vacating his house and purchasing another house. The family are eligible for the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, which is very advantageous. Under the SDA they are also eligible for a higher loan of £20,000, as distinct from the ordinary loan of £16,000 and for the £3,000 mortgage subsidy; and local authority tenants of over three years standing are eligible for the £5,000.  These bonuses are available to a local authority tenant when the family agree to surrender tenancy and purchase a private house, secondhand or new.  If it is new, an extra sum of £2,000 is available.</P>
    <P>Because the housing structures have become so intertwined between the housing authorities and the Army, those facilities should be extended to Army personnel.  They have an added reason for looking for them because they have occupied Army houses and will be surrendering them to the Army in good condition, which is a prerequisite for the receipt of any of these bonuses.  They <Col N="1369" /> have also been tenants of a housing authority and, above all, they have served their country.  We all serve our country in various ways by going about our daily work, but Army people do so in a special way, which has been recognised in the Minister's speech.  He has given due and welcome recognition to all aspects of Army life.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that about 600 people were recruited to the Army in 1984 and that recruitment for 1985 would proceed, as and when vacancies occur, from a list already prepared in order of date of applications.  I hope that this can be enlarged and that there will be further recruitment.  I am convinced &mdash; and I know that others share my view &mdash; that the standard of discipline and training which the Army enjoy in Ireland is extremely high and they can only benefit from an influx of very well educated young people.  Thankfully, through the efforts of many over the years, there are very good educational facilities available to most young men and women.</P>
    <P>Some three weeks ago at Question Time I asked about the non-recruitment of female personnel to the Defence Forces.  I received a courteous but unsatisfactory reply in which the Minister said that in a recession recruitment is limited to enlistment into combative areas of the Defence Forces.  I accept that females do not come within this area and I am not demanding that they should become a combative force.  I understand that last year there was merely replacement of females who had left and that this year, according to a letter which a constituent received, it is stated that, due to scarce resources there will be no recruitment of females to the Army.  I know that this does not come within the ambit of the Employment Equality Agency.  That may be in accordance with the letter of the law, but when a decision was taken to open recruitment to males and females the spirit demanded that it should be carried through, albeit in smaller proportions. I am not making any extreme demands but women should be interviewed and a proportion taken into the Army.  All Army activity is not combative <Col N="1370" /> and various other duties are carried out within the Defence Forces such as clerical and domestic duties and others which female recruits could do.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>It would not be right or proper for Deputies to miss the opportunity, which only presents itself once a year, of expressing their appreciation and that of the public generally to the Army and to extend their grateful thanks and gratitude to them.  From the foundation of the State to the present the Army have excelled themselves in dedication, loyalty and in the discharge of their duties.  I doubt if any other small nation enjoys the services of such a well trained, fully disciplined, loyal and dedicated force.  I should like to join with other Members in expressing our appreciation to all members of the Defence Forces from the Chief of Staff to the most humble dedicated solider and in the tributes to the Air Corps and those connected with administration at Baldonnel. A very high standard of efficiency is evident at that centre.  There is little need to recall the honour, distinction and joy that the members of the School of Equitation have brought to many people, especially those who follow the exploits of the Army jumping team.  I should like to make a special plea to the Minister &mdash; I do not think he needs a plea from any Member because of his special interest in that school &mdash; to provide more money so as to ensure that the best horses are made available to the school.  It is important that the name of Ireland is held in high esteem in horse jumping arenas throughout the world.  A special tribute should be paid to those who have brought honour and distinction to themselves and the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right that I should extend my appreciation to those dedicated people connected with the Naval Service.  The standard of loyalty is very high.  I am sure it is agreed all around that there is a need to expand the Naval Service.  Many people fail to realise the importance of Civil Defence.  It must be remembered <Col N="1371" /> that we are living in an age when any irresponsible lunatic may press a button and cause a nuclear disaster.  If such a disaster occurs many European countries are not prepared for it.  I should like to associate myself sincerely with the opinion of Members that we should have a revival of interest in Civil Defence.  Not alone must our people be alerted to the danger of a nuclear disaster but we must provide accommodation to deal with it. The plea for more involvement in Civil Defence should be taken more seriously. The director of Civil Defence and those connected with it deserve our praise.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I was anxious to contribute to the debate on the Estimate was to refer to the contribution the Defence Forces make to the UN peace-keeping operations.  Our Army personnel engaged in UN peace-keeping operations throughout the world have brought an untold amount of credit and distinction on the country.  Those engaged in the difficult task of peace-keeping in the Middle East deserve our praise.  They are known to be efficient and responsible. On the two occasions I visited Cyprus I was proud to hear in Famagusta, Nicosia and other towns the wonderful tributes paid to the Irish Army.  The late General James Quinn is still spoken of with great respect and affection throughout Cyprus. It was a revelation for me to hear Turkish and Greek Cypriots unite in tribute to the Irish peace-keeping force.  It is pleasing to hear the stories of courage by Irish soldiers in the face of great danger when trying to save the populations of villages during disturbances in that country.</P>
    <P>I have heard many stories from people who hold high positions in the country of the heroic deeds of Irish soldiers.  They told me that they had not witnessed before or since the courage and gallantry of the late General Quinn and his men who on more than one occasion succeeded in stopping attacks on innocent civilians.  As a result of their courage in intervening hundreds of lives were saved. Of all the countries that served in a peace-keeping role in Cyprus, the Irish get most credit for their gallantry.  In Nicosia daily <Col N="1372" /> tributes are paid to our soldiers who performed an excellent peace-keeping role.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of our Army and we should be concerned to keep it at the highest standard.  An excellent type of person is in control of administration in the Army and well educated people serve in it.  Never before have we had an opportunity to send to troubled areas throughout the world courageous soldiers who are well trained in peace-keeping.  They have proved efficient in dealing with many difficult problems and excelled themselves in bringing about peaceful solutions to many problems in the Middle East.  I salute the members of the Irish Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give special recognition to all former members who served in the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State.  If he pursues this with the Army authorities he will be pushing an open door.  We do not give these men sufficient recognition for their outstanding contributions to the preservation of peace and law and order.  We will never be able to give sufficient gratitude to the founders of our Defence Forces, many of whom are still alive and well.  We see these people walking through our streets but very little official recognition is given to them for their loyal and dedicated service.  It is a pity the younger generation do not know the gallantry and courage of these men and the dangerous undertakings in which they participated.  They took risks to give us freedom, to give us the right to run our own country and, above all, to ensure that the public had the right to own property and to live and act as free citizens within the law.  We owe a debt of gratitude to all those who served in our Defence Forces.  During my short period in the Department of Defence I wondered what I could do to ensure that these men got the recognition to which they were entitled.  Let us never be niggardly with these people.  We should give monetary recognition in their advanced years to those who served this nation so well and with great distinction.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Army authorities should review the presence of our <Col N="1373" /> Army on the streets.  People in democracies see an Army presence on the streets as a sign of governmental dictatorship. The Army should assist the Garda in safeguarding life and property.  Our Garda are an unarmed force giving an excellent service but there should be a greater Army presence in our towns and cities where there is evidence of lawlessness. Thugs should not be allowed to put people's lives in danger and the Army would have a great contribution to make in keeping our cities safe for our people to walk in day and night.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to all connected with the Army Apprenticeship School.  I also want to mention the pensions for retired members of the Defence Forces and the special allowances for the Old IRA. There are not many of them left and as the numbers are decreasing there should be no question but to increase the allowances to those still with us.</P>
    <P>The Army should acquire more modern equipment.  Our Army transport vehicles are out of date and I hope that in the near future efforts will be made to replace many of those vehicles which have long outlived their usefulness and that the Army will have new, modern vehicles.  Pennywise and pound foolish &mdash; we feel we should get as much as we can out of these vehicles but in my view it is right to replace these vehicles as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a very special tribute to the members of the Defence Forces on Border duty.  This is a very difficult task. It is easy to say that we are spending too much on Border service, but we must protect our territory and prevent anybody from invading it.  The necessary steps must be taken to ensure that there will be an Army presence on our side of the Border in the event of any incursion, no matter from what source.  I want to pay a tribute to the Army officers and men who in very difficult times, particularly during the winter months, have given such loyal and gallant service to this country while on Border and prison security duties.  I am aware of the contribution the Army are making to prison <Col N="1374" /> security at Portlaoise.  I would be very pleased if the Minister would convey to the Army Chief of Staff the sentiments being expressed by Members of this House in recognition of the gallant service given to this State by the members of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>No Member has referred to the Army bands.  This is Music Year and the Army bands have brought gladness to the hearts of many.  The No. 1 Army Band and the other bands are the pride and joy of all music lovers.  It is only right that we should put on the record of this House our compliments to the director of the Army bands and to express the hope that as far as possible these bands will be expanded and that there will never be a curtailment of funds.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a tribute to the contribution made by young and older Army officers to the Irish language.  I have been immensely impressed on every occasion on which I have visited Renmore Barracks in Galway and other Army barracks in which the Irish language is part of the life of the young Army officer and of many of the senior officers as well.  It is only right that on the occasion of the annual Estimate we should put the Minister for Defence and the Army Chief of Staff in a position to pass on the compliments of this House, particularly of those of us who are concerned with and dedicated to the complete revival of the Irish language.  Our members of the Defence Forces on foreign service bring the name of Ireland abroad, as do our Naval Service. It is good that our language is being spoken so freely by so many members of them.  I salute them and ask the Minister to give them every possible encouragement in their advancement of the Irish language.  Their families have also excelled themselves in the promotion of that language.</P>
    <P>On occasions when I addressed cadets and young Army officers, I always spoke about ambition.  There is no greater platform for ambition than the Army, particularly for those who are making an Army career.  There is only one Chief-of-Staff and there can be only one.  However, every young Army officer must <Col N="1375" /> endeavour to reach the pinnacle of success, with the target of being Chief-of-Staff. This will bring Army personnel to the highest standard of training, leading to a highly disciplined and dedicated Army of which our people can be rightly proud.</P>
    <P>I have never heard criticism from any taxpayer about the amount of money being spent on the Army.  Now is the time for the Minister for Defence to be armed with the support of all parties in this House in approaching his Cabinet colleagues, the Defence and Security Subcommittee of the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance with a request that money be provided for the Defence Forces in addition to what has been provided this year.  Young Irish boys who want to serve their country and who are unemployed and disheartened, with little future, would love to have the Defence Forces as a career and they should be enabled to join the Army.  I am entirely dissatisfied with the low numbers of Army recruits. We have the barracks, the parade grounds, and the facilities.  All we need is the money and that can, should and must be made available.  A country which cannot defend its people and its resources and cannot uphold law and order and pay its Army well is in a serious situation. The Army should have from 5,000 to 6,000 more recruits.  I ask the Department of Defence to endeavour substantially to increase the numbers.</P>
    <P>It is very disheartening for public representatives to be meeting so many people who would love to join the Army, get military training and enjoy the wonderful facilities in sports training and gymnastics and other facilities readily available in the Army.  Why keep these great facilities, physical and otherwise, from young people who want to avail of them?  I ask the Minister to have a change of heart and to open the various barracks and take in those well educated and highly qualified people who want to serve the nation, experience foreign service and follow in the fine tradition of the courageous men who were the founders of our Army.  There are many young <Col N="1376" /> people very eager to serve in the Army or other branch of the Defence Forces.  I want to salute everybody connected with the Army.  The very short time during which I was in the Army was perhaps the most exciting in my life.  I saw the inside workings of the Army, its administration, discipline and, above all, its loyalty and dedication to people and country.  I doubt if there is any section of our people more dedicated to upholding democracy and safeguarding life and property than are the members of our Defence Forces.  I ask that they be given every encouragement and that no barrier be put in their way.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in so far as possible, our members when called upon by the United Nations will always be ready to serve in the cause of world peace.  I venture to say that there are records in the Department of Defence readily available for the Minister to inspect in which the Secretaries-General of the United Nations, present and past, have written in glowing terms of their great contribution, far ahead of that of other nations.  Ireland has something to contribute in its Army. Let us not be afraid to invest courageously in the building up and strengthening of our Army, for our own country and for the maintenance of our neutrality but, above all, for a great contribution towards world peace.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation of the services of the Minister and of all Ministers of Defence of all parties who have done their part in encouraging our Army.  Let us hope that there will be a new awakening and a complete review of every aspect of Army life and discipline and, above all, of the contribution which members of the Defence Forces can give to the Garda Síochána and all other authorities for the security and protection of our country as a free, neutral and independent nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell Deputy Browne that the Minister must intervene in the debate at 10.15 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as possible because my colleague, Deputy Wilson, wants to make a few comments. <Col N="1377" /> While we are regarded only as a small nation, we can always say that the makeup of our Defence Forces and their personnel are well organised and highly disciplined, with a record of outstanding achievement both at home and abroad equal to many bigger nations.  Our Army at present are providing a very worth-while back-up service for the Garda Síochána in many different roles of security and protection.  Yet the role of the Army may not always be appreciated by the general public.  This must be a source of concern to us all.</P>
      <P>The Army have become involved in many roles, protecting the security of our country and its people.  Much of this involvement has been of a dangerous nature, yet the Army personnel have never shirked their responsibilities and through sheer courage and bravery have always put the protection of this country and its people first.</P>
      <P>We are living in the era of the criminal, when life is no longer sacred.  It is important that the Army provide this back-up role to the Garda in such circumstances, to fight such issues as crime and subversion. Their services are now required, in conjunction with those of the Garda, in the movement of money, particularly between banks and throughout the country. This is one area I should have to question.  The banks, who are making massive profits, should have to pay towards their security.  It is immoral that the taxpayers should have to pay while the banks are not paying their fair share. The Minister should encourage the banks to make a valuable contribution towards paying for this service and for their security. The Army have been involved in checkpoint duties, in escorting the delivery of explosives and in trying to combat the dangers of subversive activities within the country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army personnel have served this country and Governments with loyalty and commitment during the years.  They are providing a service of which we should be proud, but we should not take it for granted.  The Minister and his Government should continue to recognise their vital role and ensure that pay <Col N="1378" /> structures are adhered to, that unsociable hours worked are compensated for in monetary terms and that living accommodation is brought up to normal standards. I contend that a number of Army barracks are outdated and are not suitable from the structural or accommodation viewpoint to meet the required needs of the modern-day Army.</P>
    <P>Another area I should like the Minister to consider seriously is recruitment to the Defence Forces.  For almost four years regular recruitment to the Defence Forces has more or less ceased.  I suppose the reasons are financial and are due to embargoes and cutbacks.  Week after week at my clinic &mdash; and I am sure this happens at other clinics throughout the country &mdash; young men and women plead for an opportunity to join out Defence Forces.  They cannot find work in their own environment due to the lack of job opportunities.  These able-bodied people do not want to consign themselves to the dole queues but are prepared to join the Defence Forces and to play a positive and active role in the protection of their country.  I understand quite well that the Minister is somewhat restrained by the financial position of his Department, but surely it must be in the best interests of all that young people who want to serve in our Defence Forces should have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>In the past few years millions of pounds have been collected by the State through the youth employment levy but most of it has been misspent on Mickey Mouse training schemes that have no long term benefit for the young people.  The Minister for Defence should consider ways and means of having some of the moneys from this levy transferred to his Department in order to allow young people to join the Defence Forces and enable them to be trained in the world of work and discipline.  In this way we can ensure that we will always have a young, highly trained, highly skilled Army. These young people are well educated and they want to play a vital role in the development of the country.  This is an ideal opportunity to bring them into the <Col N="1379" /> Army and to train them in basic skills and disciplines.</P>
    <P>Many young people in my locality and elsewhere are members of the FCA. They are unemployed and are anxious to pursue a full time career in the Army. They have spent many hours training and adhering to a very strict code of discipline comparable to Army life.  The Minister has a duty to see that they have an opportunity to join our regular Defence Forces. In the event of recruitment again becoming a reality, I hope the Minister will ensure priority to members of the FCA.</P>
    <P>Another area of contention that exists at present is with regard to the recruitment of women in the Army.  Women consider they are being discriminated against and that an unofficial embargo against them exists in the Department. Many excuses have been put forward, such as lack of finance and lack of proper living quarters and it is stated that they would be unable to participate in combat. I contend that some of the women in my area would be well able to be in the front line and to look after themselves.  The Minister will have to agree that in the past few years it has been impossible for women to join the Army despite the fact that the posts are supposed to be open to them.  The Minister must ensure that adequate living facilities are made available.  When Deputy Molloy was Minister for Defence he introduced the concept of women recruitment and he ensured that facilities were made available.  I ask the Minister to give women the opportunity once more to enlist in the Army.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service has expanded its role and the general public have become more aware of the importance of having this service.  At present the Navy are playing an active role in protecting our valuable fishing industry from the illegal exploits of foreign fishing fleets such as the Spanish, the Dutch and the French. The Minister should ensure that the Naval Service is constantly kept under review with a view to having them <Col N="1380" /> expanded further to meet the increasing needs of protecting our coastline.</P>
    <P>The recent decision to turn Spike Island into a prison brought to light the shabby conditions in which the naval personnel had to live.  It seems amazing that when the Navy pulled out of the island the living quarters had to be renovated, that new kitchens and central hearing had to be installed, that the dormitories had to be refurbished and that all kinds of modern conveniences had to be installed to cater for the criminals being transferred there.  Obviously what was good enough for our Navy personnel and their families was not good enough for men and women who do all in their power to undermine the institutions of the State. Such shabby treatment for our naval personnel is totally unacceptable.  The Minister should ensure that people who work such unsocial hours in difficult and dangerous conditions are cared for in an adequate way.  I am not being critical of the Minister but I am merely expressing the views and the expressions of concern made known to me recently about the changes made at Spike Island, which has been more or less turned into a holiday camp.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has seen fit to increase the allocation for the running of Civil Defence by 15 per cent.  It is not adequate but it is a help and I ask the Minister to do everything possible to have it increased further.  Throughout the country there is a strong commitment by local authorities to the Civil Defence organisation and the positive role it can play in the community in time of war and during disasters.</P>
    <P>In Wexford we have an excellent Civil Defence service manned by men and women of outstanding dedication and loyalty.  I am heartened by the number of young people who are involved in Civil Defence.  I concur with the remarks of the Minister of State when he asked us to encourage young people to become more active in Civil Defence.  He also asked us to enlighten them as to the positive role they can play in their community. The Civil Defence organisation is <Col N="1381" /> a very worthwhile body and we should encourage young people to join.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to associate myself with previous speakers in paying tribute to the wonderful work done by our Defence Forces in Lebanon and in the Middle East generally.  They are doing an excellent job in the matter of peace-keeping, as they have done in the past in many areas throughout the world. The role of peace-keeping is a difficult task, one that requires a disciplined force led by skilled officers.  Our officers and troops have responded to the challenges in a manner of which all of us should be proud.  They have brought honour and dignity to themselves and to our country and they have proved worthy ambassadors in the name of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in paying a tribute to our Defence Forces, whether land, air or sea forces.  From personal knowledge, I should like to put on record my appreciation of the quality of officers and men &mdash; a comprehensive term nowadays &mdash; in our forces.  When the late and lamented Commandant John O'Reilly was in the Curragh I had occasion to meet many Army officers at that time and I was very impressed by their intellectual quality, their integrity, the vigour of their intellectual discussions and their commitment to this State.  This is something we tend to take for granted here but it is something that cannot be taken for granted in all countries at present.</P>
      <P>I refer in particular to the sterling service given in the Border areas.  There has been an enrichment of the life of the Border towns by the people who are serving in our Defence Forces in those areas. From the economic and social point of view they have added strength to the towns.  In all of those areas, and particularly in my own county town, the welcome the people extended to the Defence Forces when their numbers had to be increased because of the trouble in the Six Counties was something that was very consoling to people in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that work on the new Cavan barracks is not scheduled to <Col N="1382" /> start in 1985.  The Minister said that 1986 would be the year in which the work would begin.  I hope he is genuine in this and that it is not a question of merely postponing this very worthwhile project into another Estimates year.  Many years ago officers and men from the Cavan military barracks approached me about the work.  I was told that a well directed kick from an Army boot would knock some of the walls in the old barracks.  I appreciate that there was some delay in regard to the acquisition of a site for the new premises but I should like the Minister to bring forward some of the construction work to 1985.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to our soldiers for their work abroad.  As a member of a Government, at one stage, and especially after some members of the Army had been shot dead in the Middle East, I had doubts about the UN mandate or about the wisdom of sending troops to that part of the world.  However, we had a demonstration from Army personnel of the work being done by their colleagues in the Middle East.  I know that these men are ice cold in their judgment and that in many tight corners this has proved a very useful peace-keeping weapon in that area.  What I was concerned about at that other time was whether the officer commanding had orders or a mandate that were strong enough.  I am convinced that the situation has improved and the officer commanding in that area now is a man for whom I have great respect.</P>
    <P>All of us here and the people generally appreciated the establishment of the State of Israel.  That appreciation still obtains but some of the &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; which our troops are experiencing there is not what they deserve.  I am aware that the Government and other responsible people have indicated to the Israeli authorities that our role in South Lebanon is a peace-keeping role and that consequently there is no justification for the attitude being adopted to our Army personnel there in some cases.</P>
    <P>On the matter of apprenticeships, I urge the Minister to ensure that when the people concerned return to civilian life, <Col N="1383" /> the qualifications they have obtained in the Army will be given due recognition.</P>
    <P>The third level education provisions are highly desirable and I am very pleased about the studies abroad.  This must give an added dimension to the training of our officers.  We have a special strength in that regard.  I think it was Chesterton who said that the Irish do very well as soldiers because, though they are imaginative, they are realistic and they know that you cannot prove you won a battle when you have lost it or <i>vice versa.</i>  It is good that our people should match their skills against others in courses abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that Irish Shipping were providing a service for our Naval needs.  I hope this service will be continued although Irish Shipping no longer exist.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to the voices of all those who spoke urging the recruiting of women to the Defence Forces.  I do not accept that women are not employable in the combative areas.  From the Minister's constituency I had an account of how Russian infantry women liberated one of the more notorious of Hitler's concentration camps in 1945.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute also to the Army jumping team.  Commandant Ahern, who was a very prominent member of the team when they were put together first, was from my area; so I grew up with a pride in the team and in the Army Equitation School.</P>
    <P>There are many other points on which I should like to comment but there would not be time.  I should like to comment on the radiation does rate meters referred to by the Minister.  I hope there will be liaison between the Army and the civil authorities regarding the radiation that the Army would be concerned with. Deputy Gerard Brady has raised this matter in the House several times as he has raised also the matter of radiation in the seas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that I am as committed as were my predecessors to the revival of the use of Irish in the Army. I regret that I do not have sufficient time to reply to all the interesting points &mdash; some technical, some political &mdash; made in the course of the debate but all of which require an appropriate answer. Because of the limited time available to me, my reply will be truncated and will not include comment on some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the tributes they paid to the personnel of the Defence Forces.  I will have pleasure in conveying those tributes to the Chief of Staff.  For my own part, I would like to re-echo those tributes.  They are entirely deserved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson referred to a matter that is fundamental, that is, the live commitment that members of the Defence Forces have to their country.  That is patriotism in the purest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general theme of the contributions was to ensure that the facilities and equipment available to the Army are the best possible.  In that connection I will deal with a number of issues that were raised. Regarding the acquisition of helicopters, Deputy Treacy deplored the fact that we were not replacing the Puma, which had been on lease for some time.  The need for a Puma helicopter is not as acute now as it was then because the new Dauphin helicopters have an enhanced passenger carrying capacity compared with the present fleet.  The models on order can carry ten people &mdash; seven passengers and a crew of three.  They will also have the capacity to operate at sea in adverse weather conditions and to perform rescue missions such as the Pumas were engaged in recently.  As a troop carrying helicopter and for operational reasons it would <Col N="1385" /> be nice to have a Puma, but these machines cost £8 million each and that amount would buy two Dauphins.  Therefore, the Deputy will realise why we have not been able to buy the pumas.</P>
    <P>The question of Army strength was raised by a great number of Deputies &mdash; Deputies Treacy, O'Rourke, Power, Browne and others.  Of course I would share the wishes of the Deputies to see Army strength considerably increased but it gets down purely to a question of cash resources.  One hundred men cost approximately £750,000 to £800,000 per annum for pay alone, excluding food, equipment, housing and all the other things that go with it.  Deputy Treacy thought we should increase the Army by 2,000 extra men.  Certainly I would love to be able to do that but that would cost in the region of £15 million to £16 million for pay alone.  Quite frankly, the Exchequer, in its present position, is not able to afford that sort of money.</P>
    <P>It is fallacious economics to argue that because we are spending certain money on youth training schemes we should divert that into recruiting more soldiers. It is just not a simple equation of transfer of money from one scheme to another. There are extra expenses involved and there are very significant marginal costs indeed.  It it not possible to cure an unemployment position by recruiting people into the public service because they have to be paid out of taxation.  As Deputies on the other side of the House know, part of our present difficulty is due to the fact that that experiment was tried: there was a rapid expansion of the public service following 1977 and, of course, huge borrowings to pay its cost, which is now one of the factors contributing to our economic difficulties.  Unfortunately it is not possible to solve the unemployment problem or even to mitigate it by recruiting more soldiers.  I should like to see increased numbers and that is something to which I will be giving attention with my Government colleagues when next year's Estimates come to be prepared.</P>
    <P>On the question of women there seems to be a view growing on the opposite side of the House that there is a deliberate <Col N="1386" /> policy on my part not to recruit women. Women are not being enlisted at present because there is a restriction on the numbers we can carry in the Army and women are restricted in the role they can play. They are exempted from having a combatant role.  That is part of the conditions under which women are recruited &mdash; they are excluded from having a combatant role.  Deputy O'Rourke pointed out that there are people in the Army doing clerical jobs or driving and that women could do these jobs.  What she overlooked is the fact that the men who are doing these jobs are all trained soldiers, deployable in operational roles and potentially would have to undertake a combatant role should the need arise.  Therefore it is not an answer to say that there are jobs available for women in the Army suitable to them.  There are, but they also have to have the second capacity to engage in a combatant role should the need arise.  We are very constrained in numbers and this puts intense pressure on operational troops, and, unfortunately we do not have room for women recruits at present. It is not a question of quarters or other excuses, as Deputy Browne said.  There are quarters available for them.  The question of quarters arises with regard to female apprentices.  We do not have quarters for them in the apprentice school in Naas.  As Deputy Wilson rightly points out, there are some very urgent priorities in terms of building to house the present personnel in the Army that must be attended to first.  Cavan barracks will be started in 1986.  Nothing can be done in 1985 because planning is going ahead this year and, of course, planning must be completed before work can commence. But the planning team have an instruction to move with all urgency on the building of Cavan barracks and I am confident that the actual physical work will be ready to commence in 1986.</P>
    <P>On the question of overholding referred to by Deputies Treacy, O'Rourke and Power &mdash; cases of Army personnel in Army houses who, on termination of their engagements, do not have any other house to go to, and end up being overholders.  It is a problem <Col N="1387" /> mainly in the Curragh.  It was ironic that Deputy Power should have been Minister for Defence and a member of Kildare County Council for years.  Essentially to solve the problem of overholding what is needed is close liaison between the military authorities and the local authority. Deputy O'Rourke and I know from our experience in Athlone that there is good co-operation and the problem there, while not totally absent, is not a major one and we can deal with it as it arises.  The problem arises mainly in Kildare.  I would appeal to Deputy Power, in his absence and other members of Kildare County Council to co-operate with the military authorities, who would be only too willing to offer their co-operation.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 grant was introduced as part of a general housing policy, payable to local authority tenants to encourage them to vacate local authority houses so that that stock of houses would be available to people coming into the housing market for the first time and would save the Exchequer having to build new houses for them.  The people vacating the houses would be in a stronger financial position to build their own houses.  That particular rationale does not apply to Army houses because there is not the same demand for them.  It is general policy that members of the Defence Forces should be housed, like ordinary citizens, in local authority houses.  Should that happen they will then, as local authority tenants, be entitled to take advantage of the £5,000 grant.  That is not to say that I am not pressing my colleagues to try to extend the scheme to take account of persons in occupation of Army houses.  I do not know how successful I will be.  It is a scheme which from the point of view of the local authority has had, I am glad to say, a tremendous uptake because it is a most attractive one. I have other ideas in connection with assisting Army personnel to house themselves, which I am at present investigating and which hopefully will come to successful fruition before the end of the year.  It will have, if you like, inbuilt <Col N="1388" /> attraction for Army people to move out of Army houses and house themselves, or indeed move out of local authority houses as well.  Between all of these things hopefully the problem of overholding will gradually diminish and eventually disappear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power raised the question of trespass by itinerants on the Curragh as if it were something that happened only recently.  That has been going on since 1982 &mdash; I am sure he will recall that since he was Minister for Defence in 1982.  I am sure his suggestion that we should deploy the Army to remove these people by physical force was made facetiously because it is not possible; they have to be dealt with according to the law.  They have been asked to move by the rangers and the military police.  They have failed to do so.  We shall now implement the legal powers under the Curragh of Kildare Act to ensure that they are removed because, as Deputy Power rightly pointed out, that particular trespass of that place, because of the presence of race horses and so on, is particularly dangerous and bad and will have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I should like to see recruitment in times of limited resources to the FCA expanded and a restoration of the fortnight summer camp.  It is my experience that members of the FCA are centres of excellence within their communities and I should like to encourage that force.  I take the point made by Deputy Browne that priority might be given FCA members when recruitment in the army does reopen.  When the suitability of candidates is being assessed obviously a good record and keen service in the FCA will be a factor that the recruiting officers will take into account.</P>
    <P>The role of the Defence Forces is a dual one: the defence of the State against external aggression is its primary role and its secondary role is in coming to aid of the civil power.  Traditionally it is the secondary role that has come into focus because, happily, we have not had to repel an external aggressor.  Our policy of neutrality is one to which I subscribe in spite of the myth being propagated by <Col N="1389" /> the far side of the House.  I fully subscribe to the joint programme for Government which says that this country shall remain neutral outside military alliances.  I subscribe to that.  Some time ago I speculated about whether, in the developing European scene, we would be able to maintain a position of total neutrality in military terms.  Purely because one speculated on that one was labelled as being anti-neutral. Indeed, I heard Deputy G. Collins from the Opposition benches on radio a couple of weeks ago say that I had advocated that we join NATO.  I never advocated any such thing.  May I remind Deputies that neutrality 40 years ago, when the war in Europe ended, had been protected by 56,000 men under arms and that neutrality is only by the grace and favour of superpowers if we are not prepared to defend neutrality ourselves.  The cost of defending neutrality in terms of equipment for the numbers we would need would amount to approximately £400 million and extra manpower would cost approximately another £40 million annually.  These are the costs we should be prepared to face up to if our commitment to neutrality is to be on a par with the other traditionally neutral countries &mdash; for example, Sweden or Switzerland.</P>
    <P>There are many points that emerged in the course of the debate.  I am sorry that I do not have time to go in great detail into a number of points.  I re-affirm my commitment to attend Saint Patrick's Cathedral again this year and confirm that the new committee has proposed a new national day of commemoration which, hopefully, will come into operation next year.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.  The points they have made will be noted and if possible implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment in the year ending 31 December 1985 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide up to £5 million to Irish Steel Limited in the period to December 1985 to meet the company's working capital requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the House last week, in the course of a debate on a Private Members's motion, that Irish Steel's <Col N="1391" /> financial position has deteriorated considerably as compared with what was projected when the Oireachtas approved legislation in June 1984 to enable the investment of £89 million in the company. It is now clear to me and the Government that the £89 million investment package has not achieved its main objective &mdash; that of making the company financially viable and not dependent on further aid from the State.  The company now requires further funding if they are to be able to continue in operation.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that the Government submitted an application to the European Commission on 3 May 1985 for approval to invest up to a maximum of £24 million by way of additional equity in Irish Steel Limited.  I understand that the Commission will be taking a decision soon on this application.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that there is no point in making a further substantial investment in the company if this is only going to last another year or two.  It would be a waste of taxpayers' money if the Government committed a further £24 million to the company with their present uncompetitive cost structure, as this money be quickly swallowed up in further losses.  It is essential to bring about, where possible, a major reduction in costs if the company are to have any hope of becoming viable.  Otherwise, we might as well close the company now and instead invest the money in other commercially viable projects which would be capable of providing lasting employment and a positive return on the taxpayer's investment.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the board of Irish Steel have recently put proposals to the workforce for a pay freeze and 100 redundancies in an effort to cut costs.  I understand, that the plant could be operated just as efficiently with 100 fewer employees.  The proposed measures may appear to be draconian.  It may even be argued that it is unfair to penalise the employees fo Irish Steel when the company's major difficulties are outside of their control.  However, the company <Col N="1392" /> must get their costs down as far as possible if they are to have any hope of surviving.  Even if this means that some jobs have to go, I am sure the House will agree that it is better that 100 jobs are lost rather than all 650 and possibly more in other industries.</P>
    <P>I met the workers in Irish Steel through their unions.  I realise that we are talking about people with families dependent on them and that the prospect of redundancies, however limited, is something that can never be contemplated without grief. It is accepted by the company that 100 redundancies are necessary.  I know that the 100 redundancies are not just figures on a ledger but these redundancies are necessary to protect the remainder of the employees in Irish Steel.  I accept that the people concerned have families to be educated, mortgages to pay and so on, but to look at it in this way does not assist one in selling steel and Irish Steel must operate in a market where they can sell their product.  If other companies in other countries reduce their labour costs by making similar sacrifices and we do not make these sacrifices, the end result will be worse for us because we will lose all our jobs and they will at least preserve some of theirs.  There is no point in preserving an uncompetitive cost structure which results in building up stockpiles of unsold products or in a product being sold at a price well below what it cost to produce.  It is important that everybody in Irish Steel realise that action along the lines indicated in my statement must be taken in order to protect the vast majority of jobs in Irish Steel.  The measures outlined in my statement are taken in a spirit of achieving the greater good and I hope the people will realise that there must be a tempering of concern with realism in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government are, therefore, not prepared to invest any further funds in Irish Steel unless there is agreement between the company and their employees on (i) a pay freeze to the end of 1986, (ii) a redundancy scheme which would have the effect of reducing the company's present labour costs by at least 10 per cent and (iii) the elimination of all <Col N="1393" /> restrictive working practices.  I wish to make a strong appeal to management and employees at Irish Steel to reach an early agreement on cost-cutting proposals.  If such agreement is not forthcoming by the middle of August the company will not be able to continue in operation for any length of time thereafter.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that the Government are not prepared to support Irish Steel at any price.  The taxpayer has already paid dearly towards the maintenance of employment at Irish Steel and is now being asked to make another contribution. With the equivalent of a grant per job of over £135,000 provided last year and a possible commitment of over £40,000 per job sought now, it is only reasonable for the Government to demand, on behalf of the taxpayer, that Irish Steel's employees should themselves make a significant contribution towards the continuation of the company.</P>
    <P>In informing the chairman of Irish Steel of the Government's decision regarding the future of the company, I expressed my grave concern about the company's poor financial performance.  The level of losses in 1984-85 at around £17 million is unacceptable, especially in the light of the £89 million equity investment made last year, and having regard to the fact that I informed the Oireachtas that the company must survive on their own without further resources to Exchequer financing at that time.</P>
    <P>There are several factors, in addition to a reduction in labour costs, which will influence the Government when they take their final decision about the future of Irish Steel towards the end of the year. These include developments regarding the price of scrap.  As Deputies are aware, this essential raw material is the most costly element in Irish Steel's production process.  The recent fall in the composite price of scrap, if sustained, could result in an appreciable improvement in the company's finances. However, some reduction in scrap prices usually occurs at this time of year.  The durability of this reduction will thus have to be assessed over the coming months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The Government consider that the availability of third party investment to Irish Steel would improve significantly the long term prospects of the company remaining in operation.  This possibility will be investigated vigorously by Irish Steel.  It would result in a reduction in debt charges, through an equity injection, below the level beyond which under ECSC rules Government subsidy may not bring these debt charges even assuming the maximum contribution we could make.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel must demonstrate that they can operate as competitively as possible. To this end I have asked the company's board to immediately reassess all aspects of their operations with a view to making the company more efficient, productive and, I hope, profitable.  Only if everything possible is done to create conditions on which the Government can be satisfied as to the long term financial viability of the company will the balance of the £24 million be paid to Irish Steel at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>To comply with the Government's aid application to the EC Commission, it is envisaged that enabling legislation would be introduced later this year to convert this grant of £5 million into share capital and, if necessary, to provide for additional share capital if the Government decide later in the year to further assist the company.  I would remind the House that the Irish Steel (Amendment) Act, 1984, enables the Minister for Finance to invest a further £1 million in the share capital of the company and this money will also be advanced to Irish Steel, if necessary, in the light of the company's working capital requirements.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that I have instructed my Department to approach the EC Commission with the object of finding out whether ECSC funding would be available to assist redundant steel workers.  Every effort will have to be made to put our case as vigorously as possible but there is no guarantee that the Commission will make the moneys available.</P>
    <P>In taking their decision to invest up to £6 million in Irish Steel the Government <Col N="1395" /> considered all possible options, including the closure of the plant.  The Government have made the choice to provide further aid to the company having regard, in particular, to the considerable adverse impact the closure of Irish Steel would have on the economic life of the Cork region which has still not recovered from the closure of Fords, Dunlops and Verolme.</P>
    <P>By way of conclusion, I would like to reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that Irish Steel cannot afford to pay unrealistic redundancy payments nor indeed have they the ability to fund any further pay increases in the foreseeable future. This stark fact must be understood by the company's employees.  I would, therefore, urge them, for the good of the company and the Cork region, to conclude their negotiations with Irish Steel's management as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I now commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks I would like to say that what the Government are doing is designed to put all the ingredients in place that would maximise the prospects of sustained survival for Irish Steel. The first steps have to be taken by the workforce, although other steps, some of which I have alluded to in my speech, would need to be taken subsequently.  A very complex set of factors must be put in place, but there is no point in putting money into the company unless everything is done to ensure that once that is done they will be able to survive on their own.  I appeal to everyone here who has any influence on those involved to use that influence to ensure that realism and co-operation are the watchwords in the approach to the very critical decisions that have to be taken in the coming weeks and months directed towards putting this company on such a footing that they can survive on their own.  I hope that I can count on the support of all in this House in making this approach work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some satisfaction, tempered by the inadequacy of what the Minister is proposing, that I realise that <Col N="1396" /> the motion that we had before the House last week on the question of the Government ensuring the continuation of Irish Steel has eventually prompted them into some action.  While I support the Supplementary Estimate of £5 million, I know that £1 million floating around in some contingency fund has to be added.  Nevertheless, I have no intention of giving unqualified support to what is being proposed just now by the Minister or to what was suggested in points given at a meeting held yesterday between the chairman of the board and the workers.</P>
      <P>Sufficient commitment has not been given by this Government to Irish Steel. Anybody who had occasion to see the news tonight at 9 p.m. will know that we had an extraordinary public relations exercise again from the national handlers. I welcome the setting up of jobs anywhere in this country at this time because they are dearly and severely wanted, but the Minister made this fantastic announcement about the 600 jobs that will be achieved in two years time, mark you &mdash; not tonight, as it would appear from the television programme. Anyone listening carefully would realise that they will appear in two years time. This Minister and this Government are toying with an industry that already has 600 workers in it.  I could comment in that vein a little further, but it would be unfair of me to take too much time from my colleagues from the Cork area, and I am glad to see three of them on the Government benches and I am sure they will want to say something on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me revert to a little over 12 months ago, May 1984, when we had a Supplementary Estimate before this House seeking approval for £89 million to be put into equity in Irish Steel to pay off some of the capital accounts that were there and some of the interest that was due. We gave it our support and approval, despite the fact that we asked the Minister to let the House have the consultants' report on Irish Steel.  The Minister neglected, for whatever reason, to give us that report.  It was indicated that by giving this money to Irish Steel the continued viability of the company would be <Col N="1397" /> assured.  What has now happened to the viability we were told about?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the handling of this project by the Minister and the Government has been nothing short of criminal.  The responsibility for what is happening must be laid fairly and squarely on them.  I am not qualified to indicate to the board and management of Irish Steel how to organise their affairs but I and many others realise that the performance in the operation of the mill leaves a lot to be desired. However, I will not allow this Minister to lay the entire blame on the workforce. He has appealed to us to get the workforce to keep the mill going as if nobody else were involved and no Minister had any responsibility, as if there were no Government.  Of course many people throughout the country would say that we have not got a Government.  The condition in which they have left Irish Steel is adding to that impression.  We do not have a Minister capable of looking after industry or a Government capable of making decisions on behalf of this industry that will ensure its continuance. They should not blame the workforce for all that is happening in Irish Steel.  What is management for?</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to work practices. It is only now that he and the Government realise that there is something wrong in the work practices of Irish Steel? It is only now that the management and the board realise there is something wrong and have decided the workers are to blame?  Where is the leadership or commitment, the effort to get people around the table to sort out the problems? Would it not be more positive for the Minister to adopt some such suggestion?</P>
    <P>I do not condone malpractices in the workplace but it has not been established that they exist here and nobody has said what they are.  If they exist, why not get the people concerned to sit down and talk about it?  If such a problem exists it would not be conducive to proper operations but why not discuss the problem with workers' representatives and the people concerned?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government will <Col N="1398" /> not be allowed by me or my party to abrogate their responsibility to Irish Steel.  They have been totally and absolutely negligent in this matter.  The uncertainty about the future of the industry is aggravated by the indecisiveness of the Government.  That indecisiveness has been very evident over a period of time, not just today or last week when we brought a Private Members' motion before the House.  They are generating further doubt by these proposals.  I said last week that the talk of redundancies and closure had the very obvious effect of undermining the workforce in Irish Steel.  That situation should not have been allowed to develop and the Minister must take full responsibility for the current frame of mind of the workforce.</P>
    <P>It was indicated one year ago that the company would be made viable through an injection of £89 million.  There were warnings given during that debate that one element was causing concern, namely, energy costs.  We were told those costs were having a detrimental effect on the cost of production, as well as a number of other cost factors.  The Minister and the Government did sweet damn all about the problem of energy costs and we were told recently that these costs are having a tremendous effect on the viability of the company.  Nevertheless the Minister now sees that the fault lies with the workforce.  Why was something not done about the cost element?  The Minister was asked to find a solution to that problem and several others.  There is no evidence of any effort on the part of the Minister or his colleagues in Government to correct this glaring problem which Irish Steel were facing 12 months ago.  It has been restated in recent days that energy costs are having an effect on production costs at the mill but the Minister's solution is to tell us to go away, talk to the workers and use our influence to get 100 redundancies.  Six months ago the board advised the Minister that because of a number of factors the company would face financial problems before the end of 1985.  Why did the Minister and the Government sleep on <Col N="1399" /> this issue until they were prompted into some action six days ago?</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me or anybody else to indicate to the Government the immense contribution Irish Steel are making to our economy.  Their total contribution amounts to £24.85 million. Surely the Government are aware that their contribution to the balance of payments is £45 million.  We will not accept the Minister's proposals.  It seems now that he has decided to confront the workers with measures so unpalatable that he will bring about a confrontation between managers and workers.  He will then close the factory and blame it on the workers. The thinking of the Minister and the Government is very clear in regard to Irish Steel.  They think they will divert responsibility to the workforce and so avoid political damage.  They should have a rethink in that regard because it will not wash with the people in Irish Steel nor with the taxpayers to whom the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>My information is that at a meeting held yesterday, the chairman indicated that he had come from a conference with the Minister, Deputy Bruton and the chairman indicated that the sum of £6 million would be forthcoming in stages provided that the programme of 13 June 1985 would be agreed by the date set by the Minister, 15 August 1985.  I should like to again put on record the board's recommendations of 13 June 1985.  They were: (1) that there would be an instant pay freeze at all levels until the end of 1986; (2) that the numbers employed by the company would be reduced by approximately 100 persons.  I do not know who is doing the Minister's sums. He indicated some time ago &mdash; and he is correct &mdash; that there would be a reduction of 10 per cent in the wages bill if 100 workers were made redundant.  Irish Steel has a wages bill of £10 million.  A sum of £2 million was paid in overtime in Irish Steel last year.  By reducing the workforce by 100 persons, is it the Minister's intention to pay out more overtime? Would it not be better if the <Col N="1400" /> Minister reduced overtime and got the management and workers of the firm to streamline the operation?  If payments for overtime were reduced by a sum of £1 million, those 100 workers could remain in employment.  Has the Minister considered that aspect of the cost in Irish Steel?  The third recommendation was that redundancy should be restricted to the statutory requirement plus one week's pay for every year of service.</P>
    <P>We have had enough redundancies in the Cork area and we are not trying to get any in Irish Steel.  We are only too well aware &mdash; and the Government must also be well aware &mdash; of what becomes of workers made redundant.  We have had too many sorrowful experiences in Cork in this regard and we will not be a party to creating more redundancies.  The workers of Irish Steel fully realise that if there is a possibility of saving their jobs it is much better to do so than to make them redundant.  I wonder if it is necessary to develop that point, as everybody knows &mdash; certainly public representatives in Cork know from public meetings which have been held &mdash; how workers feel about redundancy.  The Minister can forget about redundancies in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The fourth recommendation was that the 1.7 per cent increase by way of the analogue review for 1984 which was recommended by the Labour Court should be paid.  However, that got very short shrift from the Minister this week because the chairman indicated to the shop stewards that the Minister has removed the fourth recommendation and will not sanction it.  Another recommendation was that undesirable work practices would have to be eliminated and there was no elaboration by the chairman in regard to this point.  If such practices exist and are shown to be detrimental to the successful ongoing operations in Irish Steel, everybody concerned will have to work in their own interests because I could not condone undesirable work practices, whatever they may be.</P>
    <P>I notice that management have been instruced to negotiate redundancies. When the board's recommendations were issued in June, it was clearly stated <Col N="1401" /> that the proposals were not negotiable.  I am satisfied that new thinking was brought to bear on that decision and that negotiations may now continue &mdash; if that is the right word after yesterday's meeting &mdash; but there are other matters to be discussed other than redundancies.</P>
    <P>There was no reference in the Minister's speech to the fact that there would be a sum of £1,500 for each redundant worker although this was indicated to the representatives yesterday.  There was no elaboration on this amount, to whom it would apply or how it would be calculated except that it could be negotiated by the Minister's Department over the next six months.  I sincerely hope it will not arise that we will be discussing the £1,500 because that figure is for redundancies.  I hope that is not a carrot being dangled in front of the workers.  If it is I can tell the Minister, with a degree of certainty, that it will not be accepted.  The people involved want their jobs and not dangling carrots of £1,500.</P>
    <P>It was also indicated on 30 June that the company's balance amounted to £7.6 million and that the Minister was informed &mdash; I presume at yesterday's meeting &mdash; that at the close of business on Friday last, 5 July, there was a balance of £3.4 million in the company's account.  It was indicated to the Minister that that sum would be reduced to £1.4 million by mid-August and that by the end of September a further reduction would leave the figure at £0.7 million.  The Minister's response to this &mdash; he may correct me if I am wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was that it was absolutely necessary that the unions would reach agreement before 15 August.  The Government, it was indicated, would be prepared to release £6 million if the proposals &mdash; the pay freeze, the redundancies, or work practices &mdash; were agreed on.  All of a sudden the Minister has realised the exact position within Irish Steel. What the Minister, the Government, the Department, management and the board have been doing for the past 12 months <Col N="1402" /> has not been explained to me.  Is the Minister aware that the workers' rep-representatives have expressed the view &mdash; I tend to support that view &mdash; that the Government's proposals are nothing short of industrial blackmail?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficult position he has placed trade unions in, to negotiate and have the proposals accepted by 15 August?  I have heard the phrase of cracking the whip but there is a fair lash out of that whip and that demand by the Minister which I am sure is being made on behalf of the Government. The Minister in his speech tonight again referred to a possible closure.  The Minister, and the Government, are prolonging the agony of Irish Steel according to phraseology used in the Minister's script.  I can tell the Minister that we will not have that from the Government or the Minister.  We will not have a prolonging of the agony in Irish Steel with a decision by the Minister to see what will be done with Irish Steel by the end of the year.  The problem is a lot more serious than is indicated by that type of whip-cracking over the workers of Irish Steel. I have no doubt they will play their part given the encouragement, the understanding, the leadership and the commitment but there was nothing for them in the Minister's speech or what he said through the chairman of the board yesterday.</P>
      <P>The funding that the Minister is conditionally offering is insufficient given the financial circumstances of the company and it is my honest view that it will do more harm than good.  Why must there be a demand for redundancies in Irish Steel?  It is a demand, not a request.  Is the reason to let 100 workers to to save £1 million?  It appears, if one calculates the total figures and the amount of overtime, that 100 workers would be let go to save £1 million.  If the operation was examined that sum could be saved by reducing half of the amount paid out in overtime.  I am not satisfied, and it has not been established for me, that the redundancies are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a trade unionist for many years, a shop steward for a good number of years, <Col N="1403" /> a chairman of the local branch of my trade union and a member of the Cork Council of Trade Unions I can tell the House that in our time we would not stand for 100 workers being out out on the road while the amount paid in overtime was doubled.  It would be unacceptable. Surely the sums can be done by somebody if the Minister and the Government cannot do them.  Is it the intention to reduce output?  That has not been mentioned so far.  Is it not logical to contend that if the workforce is reduced by 100 the overtime bill will grow beyond £2 million.  I do not think it is in the minds of any workers that they should work overtime while their colleagues are idle. Basically that is what they are being asked to do.  I am sure any trade unionist would agree not to work overtime while their colleagues are idle.  We never did it and I doubt if the workers today are any different from us when we were working at the bench.</P>

      <P>I will get into top gear now. When the leader of our party and a group of local representatives visited the plant recently we found everybody gainfully employed.  Will the Minister some clean on Irish Steel?  Has a decision been made in Irish Steel &mdash; there are references to a closure in the Minister's speech &mdash; in regard to a closure?  The Minister should stop fudging the matter and restore the morale of the workers.  He is doing a disservice to them by his behaviour, his warnings and threats.  I do not understand how the Government could consider, as they appear to have done, the closure of Irish Steel.  Is this a threat?  Would the Minister clarify this for me?  I would be <Col N="1404" /> happy to know that the reference to closure in the Minister's speech this evening is not being used as a threat to anybody working in Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>Since there are only 40 minutes left and there are still five Members waiting to contribute, I will cut my contribution to the bone.  The speech we have just heard for the past 35 minutes was one of the most disgraceful I have heard in my three or four years in this House.  It was totally irresponsible.  My impression is that some of the people on the opposite side would like to see Irish Steel close for political gain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister called for realism and co-operation in the weeks ahead and there was nothing in the speech I just heard which lends itself to realism and co-operation.  This is a time when we should not be indulging in political flag waving, but the last speech was a blatant attempt to politicise the issue and was structured to influence voters and to win votes in a forthcoming election.  It will inflame passions in the steel plant when the speech is read.  Nobody blamed the workforce and if anybody reads the speeches made last week he will see that questions were posed concerning management and the workforce and the suggestion was made that both sides should come together to examine these problems in depth to safeguard the future of Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened for 35 minutes to Deputy Lyons's speech and he mentioned a number of problems in Irish Steel but put forward very few solutions.  Are we to put in £24 million of taxpayers' money without questioning why there is a haemorrhage in Irish Steel?  Should we just plough ahead with what has been happening there over the last number of years, putting in another £24 million to follow the £89 million we gave last year, and spend more next year?  We cannot do that.  We cannot call for a drop in taxation levels and still push money indefinitely into an operation which is clearly losing <Col N="1405" /> money.</P>
    <P>Last week I mentioned the £2 million paid in overtime and down time &mdash; 51 per cent in 1983-84 and down this year to 39 per cent.  These issues need to be investigated and have to be taken on by management and unions.  However, there are external factors which have to be considered also &mdash; the price of scrap, electricity prices and the level of the company's debt.  I welcome the Minister's proposals to put £6 million into Irish Steel provided there is agreement between management and unions.  I am glad he consented to the proposals put forward last week.  This £6 million is a fragile life line to the company and the company, management and unions must come together in the next few weeks and work out a compromise agreement about the internal problems of the plant.</P>
    <P>As I said, there are major external factors affecting the operation of Irish Steel which I identified last week but which, because of time, I will not go into in detail tonight.  These factors are the responsibility of the Minister's office and they must be looked at in the next few months.  The Minister must also consider restructuring the tariffs for electricity charges to commercial users.  That is a millstone around the neck of Irish Steel at present and it must be examined and considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a joint venture. This is an interesting concept and must be brought to a successful conclusion at some stage because the company's debt is one which, despite all our efforts, could close the mill if not tackled urgently.  I am encouraged by the reduction in the prices of scrap.  If they continue to drop, there could be a saving of a few million pounds.  What is required at the present time are cool heads and co-operation between union and management and decisive action by the Minister and his officials between now and the new year to deal with the external factors I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The redundancy offer made to the workers must be reconsidered and there must be some flexibility.  As I mentioned last week, redundancy is not the pot of gold <Col N="1406" /> at the end of the rainbow as Cork workers know.  Tonight I appeal to everyone in Irish Steel to sit down and discuss the problems in the plant in a calm and constructive manner and I ask the Minister to attend to some of the major external factors affecting the plant in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I too will be brief in order to give other speakers an opportunity to contribute.  I welcome the injection of money into Irish Steel and to any industry which is suffering from the recession.  The Minister's speech tonight was similar to last week's &mdash; nothing positive and no encouragement to that industry.  Last Wednesday I said that steel companies throughout Europe will be seeking financial aid in the region of £10 billion.  One would think Irish Steel was the only industry in difficulties.  The Germans are asking for £350 million; the Italians are talking about £5,000 million and the French £250 million, but we are not talking about that kind of money to keep Irish Steel in business.  What are other steel industries in Europe doing at the moment confronted with the same problems? I am sure of one thing: their Governments are not talking about redundancies and closures.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have mentioned that in his speech.  Last week he laid great emphasis on problems being created by countries outside the European Communities.  The Minister should also have informed us of what was happening in other steel industries in Europe and what action was being taken by them to overcome their problems.  We thought perhaps at a later stage, in this House or elsewhere there would be a discussion about the whole position regarding Irish Steel and what has been happening in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister introduced a dictatorial atmosphere into the debate tonight.  If has been a long tradition in this country that trade unions, workers <Col N="1407" /> and management always have been advised to get around the round table to discuss their problems and come to some agreement.  Are we now departing from that tradition?  Are the Government now telling the workers, trade unions and management that, if they do not agree to this, then they must close?  I am sorry that this approach has been brought into the debate.  I believe that we have closed the doors against any negotiations which could bring about commonsense in this matter.  The Minister is saying no to that, but if I were a worker in Irish Steel that is what I would think.  I hope that they do not think that.  We should never force anything on workers, trade unions or management.  They have the intelligence, understanding and will to save an industry by co-operating with one another, rather than having, as Deputy Lyons mentioned, a whiplash over them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the workers of Irish Steel, the management and the trade unions to be more realistic now in their approach, in the interests of the majority of jobs in that industry.  I am almost convinced that agreement has been reached at Cabinet level about the future of this industry. Everything which has happened in recent times is convincing me more.  In the presence of the Minister, the Deputies from Cork and the management, I should like to question the chairman's address made publicly not long after the Minister's visit to that plant.  I question especially the time the statement was made.  Everybody was aware of the problems of Irish Steel except the workers.  I do not think that management were aware that the chairman of Irish Steel was about to make the statement which he made.  Nobody got the warning.  With all due respect to the Minister, there was something very suspicious about that statement and its timing.  I cannot go into further details, but wish I had a little more time.  I want to oblige other Deputies who wish to make contributions.</P>
    <P>I hope that everybody will sit down and discuss the future of Irish Steel and what is to be done to save that industry.  After the chairman's statement was made, <Col N="1408" /> there was only one other member of the Government who made a statement. That was a senior member of the Cabinet, in Cork the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who repeated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he wake up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any reflection on any Deputy.  He repeated the exact words that were in the chairman's statement.  I would have assumed that the Minister present now, as the responsible Minister, would have made the statement first.  There are other days when we will be questioning certain activities and certain statements made and their timing. These events became known through the city and county of Cork and the belief was that the Government must now have made their final decision to close that industry.  Ask any of the workers in Irish Steel and they will tell the Minister exactly what I am saying here tonight.  I have to be very cautious in view of the Minister's statement, lest I cause any further interruptions, in the hope that everybody concerned will sit down and discuss the future of Irish Steel.  I am disappointed that the Minister was not prepared to let us know exactly what is happening in Europe and what other Governments are doing.</P>

      <P>Would I be asking too much if I were to ask the Members of the Opposition to give credit where it is due? Having listened to them last week and again tonight, it seems that they are a little disappointed that this aid has now been given to Irish Steel.  Granted, there are certain aspects of the Bill about which I would be concerned and to which I will refer later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lyons said that he had no intention of giving unqualified support. That is quite legitimate.  He accused the Government of being indecisive.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  He also accused them of lack of commitment. Would he not consider £95 million a significant commitment to this industry?  I <Col N="1409" /> think it is.  Mention was made of the energy costs.  I referred to that in my speech last week.  I would like again to remind Deputy Lyons about Deputy Reynolds' speech of 28 June 1984 regarding energy costs to Irish Steel and the reservations which he expressed on that occasion.  There was no commitment from Fianna Fáil on that date that they would do anything positive regarding energy costs and that is on the record of this House, if anybody doubts my word.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that it was the motion before this House which prompted the Government into action.  I do not think those who suggest that really believe it in their hearts.  Certainly, the workers in Irish Steel will not be fooled by that ploy.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a week is a long time in politics.  Having listened to what Deputy Wyse had to say last week and again tonight, that is illustrated in no uncertain terms.  In last week's debate that Deputy accused the Minister, more or less, that it was his visit to the Irish Steel plant which prompted the announcement from the chairman.  He has now expressed doubts as to whether this was the case.  I wish he would make up his mind.</P>

      <P>The role of the Labour Party in Government was criticised by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald during last week's debate.  On that occasion I expressed my confidence in the participation of the Labour Party in this issue.  Indeed, I am proud to be part, as a back bencher, of the Government, that have taken this <Col N="1410" /> decision.  This is the first positive step that we have seen towards the winning back of jobs in Cork.  We have to preserve jobs before we create them.  Up to now we have been on a slippery slope, with closures all over the place, but this is a very definite step towards resurgence of industry in the Cork area.  I am proud to be here tonight to support the Minister's Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving of 560 jobs plus the ancillary industries.  The Deputy should look at the positive aspect of it. These will have to be taken into account. Last week the Deputy was complaining about the impending closure but now he must realise something is being done.  I accept that certain conditions have been laid down and I shall refer to them.  As a trade unionist I must express my reservations about the package presented by the Minister in his speech tonight.  The union are being put in a position of disadvantage. It is against the principle of good negotiations to set out pre-conditions. That is not the correct approach.  We must remember that two weeks ago we were told there would be negotiations and the fact that these negotiations will now take place is progress in itself.  I have the utmost confidence in the trade union negotiators that they will fight every inch of the way in the interests of their members.  They have my full support in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is a departure from what has been the traditional way of dealing with redundancies in that the Government have made an application to the European Coal and Steel Commission for aid for redundant steel workers.  I hope we will be successful in that connection.  It is only right that I should caution the Minister that it will be extremely difficult to sell a package to the people in Irish Steel who will be made redundant when one takes into account the payments already made to people in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister acknowledges that the proposed measures appear draconian.  I <Col N="1411" /> hope the discussions will be tempered with commonsense and that they will be fruitful.  It has been suggested that there could be a third party involvement but I do not think it is realistic to assume that somebody will be interested in taking a share in a company that is in such difficulty. It is not an attractive proposition at the moment.</P>
    <P>A matter that was mentioned yesterday in the discussions with the chairman and union representatives was areas of demarcation.  There has been mention of the elimination of all restrictive working practices.  I would prefer to speak of the elimination of all wasteful work practices. To expect that in the course of these negotiations which must be concluded by 15 August one can eliminate a tradition of many years is quite unrealistic.  I accept that an effort should be made to eliminate all wasteful work practices and I am sure that will get a positive response from the union.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  Last week I expressed a fear that this could be the beginning of the end.  I am now confident it is a new beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the supplementary Estimate and the Minister's speech is a warning to the workforce either to accept what is proposed or to be thrown on the scrapheap.  What we need is scrap at a cheap price rather than throwing 650 people on the scrapheap. The whole tenor of the Minister's speech was negative.  There was nothing constructive in it.  He warned the workforce to accept a pay freeze and a redundancy scheme and to eliminate all restrictive working practices.  However, he did not give us any details on what he considers to be restrictive working practices or redundancy schemes.  We had vague references about approaching the EC to get funding in respect of redundancies but the whole tenor of the speech was destructive to the workforce.</P>

    <P>From what I hear from people in the steel industry, there is a need for the restructuring and streamlining of the system and of work practices in Irish <Col N="1412" /> Steel.  However, not all the blame can be placed on the manual workers.  Management must take a certain amount of blame for what has happened during the years.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to cutting costs by a cut of 10 per cent in respect of pay.  This would amount to £1 million.  As far as I am concerned this is pie in the sky.  The Minister's reference gave the impression that Irish Steel will not be saved by the Government.  I ask him to come clean regarding the Government's intentions.  The Minister adopted a negative approach.  The management and the workers have been set on a collision course.  If and when they close Irish Steel, the Government want to place the blame on the workforce alone. The Government must change their approach.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, there must be co-operation between the workforce, management and the unions if a solution is to be found to the problem. The approach taken by the Government and this Minister is not helpful to the future of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to reconsider his approach so that there will not be another closure of a major industry in the Cork area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">

      <P>Regarding the steel industry in Europe generally, the reality is that in a period of ten years the steel and coal producing countries were forced to shed 350,000 jobs.  That is the scale of the climate of the European steel industry in which we are talking about Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of £6 million of taxpayers' money to Irish Steel. Last week the Minister stated the barometers by which he was making this amount available.  He had a duty and a responsibility to the taxpayer as well as to Irish Steel to do so.  The Minister said then that he had to consider such factors as the commercial viability of the company, the effectiveness of cost cutting measures and the impact that closure would have on Cork.  He said that he had to balance all those factors against very scarce Exchequer resources.  Within one <Col N="1413" /> week he has come back to the House and announced that the Government have decided to support Irish Steel.  Therefore, this should be an evening for some degree of rejoicing in this House and of course in Irish Steel also.  But there is a price to be paid for this.  It would be irresponsible of the Minister to say that Irish Steel will be protected by an endless flow of money from the taxpayer who is already paying too much tax.  Therefore, the Minister has a duty to place severe restrictions on the release of this money to Irish Steel. The making available of the money is a significant act of faith and confidence in the future of the company but I trust that the kind of emotive language used by the first person from the other side of the House to speak on this Estimate will not inflame passions because that would not be the way to do service to Irish Steel.  I do not believe the Deputy intended his remarks in that sense.</P>
    <P>The reality is that in 1984-85, the losses in Irish Steel are £17 million.  There is a recognition on the part of the Government that external factors were to blame largely for this loss and that is why the Minister is giving further assistance to the company.  The losses that accrued cannot be attributed to the workers or to anyone involved in Irish Steel.  If one can be optimistic about such a difficult industry, one might say also that scrap prices are falling faster than was the case this time last year, that interest rates are easing and that there is the possibility of a third party investor.  Leaving philosophy aside, that prospect is worth considering purely on its merits with a view to introducing additional equity that would not otherwise be available.  This might enable us to have access to markets that might not be easy to penetrate otherwise.  Therefore, a strong partner in Irish Steel would make a lot of sense.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the agony that would result from redundancies.  He has already made an application to the European Coal and Steel Community for a subvention to help fund redundancies and reduce the impact on the workforce. I am mystified by the tone of the Fianna Fáil response this evening because I have <Col N="1414" /> here a copy of <i>The Way Forward</i> which is a definitive document of policy which contains the statement that a system of monitoring the performance of commercial semi-State bodies was being introduced to ensure that they operate efficiently and remunerate a substantial amount of Exchequer capital invested in them and that manning levels and pay rates consistent with this policy and with the specific efficiency requirements will be one of the elements taken into account in this monitoring system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism could have written that.  If it were taken literally and if the other party were in power, we might not be presiding over this relatively happy event this evening.  It is ridiculous of Fianna Fáil to say that they want an open cheque for Irish Steel.  Such an attitude is not fair to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I expect that most Members were under the impression that only Cork Deputies would be contributing to this debate but I wish to make just a short contribution.  The closure of Irish Steel would have far-reaching effects in addition to the devastating effect it would have on Cork and particularly on the Cobh area.  The Minister's emphasis on the need to push the workforce into accepting redundancy is an example of the way in which the Irish workforce have been carrying the weight of the crisis in the economy for the past number of years.  The Minister has made a mistake. He should back off from pushing in that direction.  I appeal to him and to the Government and indeed to the management of Irish Steel not to force the workers into a corner because that line could only have the kind of result that we all fear most.  My appeal is that calm negotiations be entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frightening to contemplate that the Government would even consider closing Irish Steel in view of the contribution the company make to the economy.  I do not intend referring to the various areas and cost factors except to say that the figures do not seem to add up.  Apparently 100 redundancies would save the company <Col N="1415" /> about £1 million but I understand the cost to the State in terms of unemployment benefit and tax and insurance loss would amount also to £1 million and that is why I appeal to the Minister not to push the workers into a corner.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  It represents a step forward and is an indication of the commitment of this Government to Irish Steel.  Since the Government have been returned to office I have been aware at all times of the commitment of the Minister to Irish Steel and of his confidence in the company.  Last year when we agreed an Estimate of the order of £89 million we did not expect that Irish Steel would be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate once again but the losses last year of £17 million were disappointing by any standards.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons expressed grave concern about the 100 redundancies but we are talking about 650 redundancies and about approximately 1,000 families.  It seems to me that the Deputy would prefer that the livelihoods of 1,000 people would be lost as opposed to the livelihoods of 100 people.  More than half the workers come from the Cobh area which is represented by Deputy Ahern and myself and he has indicated that there is an awareness on the part of the workers of the need for restructuring and for streamlining. Deputy Lyons represents the Blarney area and he is inclined to think that there is no need for restructuring within the company.  However, the important point is that in effecting the 100 redundancies, there is a break with what has been the practice in the past and that the redundancies are effected from top to bottom in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point to be made in seeking these 100 redundancies is that, unlike many cases in the past, they are to be effected from top to bottom.  We are not talking merely about worker redundancies; we should also be talking about the same level of management redundancies. It is within that framework that we <Col N="1416" /> must ensure that we retain a steel plant in this country.  As Deputy De Rossa said, it is not only a question to be considered for the Cork region; it is a national asset and one we must endeavour to maintain.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Irish Steel Limited will remain in being and that there is a bright future ahead for them once they get over this difficult passage.  This phase will not be overcome by irresponsible statements but rather if approached in a cool, rational and objective manner. That is what is needed in the months ahead.  Statements that practically incite violence will not help in any way.  When the workers of Irish Steel Limited read Deputy Lyon's statement next week they will see that he has not given them any credit for any intelligence.  They know how business operates.  They know that one cannot run a business incurring a loss of £17 million annually.  They are not fools; they are intelligent people and know the redundancies must be sought.</P>
    <P>The question of redundancy, not only in relation to Irish Steel Limited but in the country generally, must be tackled. Certainly the people of Cork know that redundancy is of no great benefit to anybody, because after one year of pay-related and unemployment benefit one is then means-tested for unemployment assistance, when redundancy payment is taken into account, often leaving a person with only £3 or £4 per week.</P>

      <P>Although I noticed that the Minister for Labour is not present, I shall proceed.</P>
      <P>The reason Fianna Fáil wish to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House is mainly because of the failure of the system to afford one an opportunity, throughout the year to question the Minister for Labour with regard to his scheme outlined in the document <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987.</i>  Because of the Question Time programme the Minister for Labour has not answered questions in this House since 1982, as far as I am aware, and certainly not since I became Opposition Spokesman on Labour.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has appeared I apologise to him for bringing him in at such a late hour.  I was making the point that, under the Question Time programme, the Minister has not answered questions since I became Opposition Spokesman on Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987,</i> issued at the very beginning of the parliamentary year, the Government made great play of the importance of employment.  I might quote from page 25 paragraph 1.26, under the heading &ldquo;Unemployment&rdquo;, which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The underlying increase in the numbers out of work has slowed steadily since early 1983, judging from the Live Register data.  However, the increase in the Live Register is the net difference between flows on and off it.  These gross flows, which are considerable by comparison with the net changes, reveal a significant level of activity in the labour market.  For example, during 1983 there were almost 206,000 movements on to the Register and 178,000 movements off it.  In the first six months of 1984, the net increase of 7,000 in the Live Register was the result of over 106,000 inflows and over 99,000 outflows.</P>
    <P>On page 83 of that same document there is a heading &ldquo;A New Social Employment Scheme&rdquo; which was then laid out in detail.  Throughout the year we supported the Minister and the Government in that effort, although we regarded it as unsatisfactory, since it gave no sustainable employment and did not form part of any coherent manpower policy.  Certainly it had nothing to do with an agricultural or industrial policy but rather was devised as a way of affording young people an opportunity to engage in short term employment by way of convincing them that something was being done to satisfy their needs.</P>
    <P>On this, now the last parliamentary day of the current session, I want to place on the record the total failure of the employment and unemployment policies outlined in that document.  The plan was to create 10,000 jobs, the money being made available, the goal being to achieve a participation level of 10,000 within the year.  It is now almost a year since that national plan was announced.  In spite of all our support, nothing really happened until January last.  There were no meaningful negotiations with anybody.</P>
    <P>On the basis of parliamentary questions answered on 25 June and again today the lack of success of the scheme is demonstrated.  We are told that there are at present 323 persons employed by local authorities on 16 projects.  That was <Col N="1419" /> the information given in answer to a question in the House today.  There is just a handful of local authorities involved.  For example, we were told that Wexford County Council have employed 111 people with most other local authorities employing fewer right down to Waterford County Council which employ only eight.  The Dublin figures are not issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had Cork for most of this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to a parliamentary question on 25 June last we were told that the target for the first year was 10,000 jobs while to date the number of jobs approved is in excess of 2,300 involving 300 projects.  The scheme has amounted to a major con game, a major failure.  We are now asking the Minister for Labour what policy the Government have with regard to unemployment.  It should be remembered there is now widespread emigration. Anybody who examines the statistics now emanating from the Central Statistics Office will see that as a fact. Last week there were people here from the United States who clearly stated that they had not even been asked by this Government to involve themselves in any way to assist those unemployed people. In recent weeks I met a number of agencies in London, Birmingham and Manchester involved in dealing with the thousands of young people emigrating to the United Kingdom.  Accepting that fact, examination of the June figures shows that unemployment of young people is rapidly increasing.  If the Minister for Labour has any integrity &mdash; of which I believe he has much &mdash; he will tell this House tonight that the programme contained in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> has failed totally as far as unemployment is concerned, that the scheme was a sham, contains many ambiguous regulations and is not operational, so that the money provided almost a year ago should now be diverted to <Col N="1420" /> some other scheme.  Any jobs provided have been of an unsustainable, temporary nature, mostly involved in environmental work schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware that he is one of the key members of the Cabinet with regard to the implementation of the schemes outlined in the national plan, the gospel of this Government, and which has failed totally.  We are now almost at the end of the seventh month of the financial year and national finances show clearly how serious is the problem.  We want to know from the Minister if he holds out any hope of improvement, or will he accept that what he has done to date has failed totally?  After almost three years in office this Government have no credible policy by way of helping young people, providing them with a future, whether by way of temporary or part time jobs.  They have no concrete proposals whatsoever and those contained in the national plan outlined by them have failed miserably.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are not implementing the employment schemes outlined in that document and the Department of Labour, even in their best endeavours, have failed.  We would ask the Minister at least to spend the recess period endeavouring to convince his colleagues that, when a financial crisis arises somewhere, they should not take the easy option by way of costly redundancies instead of being innovative and creating sustainable jobs.  If those policies are continued there is no future for this country.</P>
    <P>On page 26 of <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987,</i>  Table 1-2 &ldquo;Main Features of Projections, Employment and Unemployment&rdquo; it was projected that over the lifetime of that national plan unemployment would rise from 209,000 to 210,000. I know this or any other Minister is beyond embarrassment with regard to such figures, but I must emphasise that those projections have now become irrelevant, that the statistics contained in the document are now totally irrelevant.  I am not interested in that.  I am interested in the fact that almost 70,000 young people a year are coming on to the labour market and we have failed to provide a <Col N="1421" /> future for them or even credible policies that might work.  The social employment scheme which was to provide 10,000 jobs has failed.</P>
    <P>I intend to give my colleague, our spokesman on Education, Deputy O'Rourke some of my time to highlight where the scheme has failed.  In reply to questions on the last day of the session we were told that only 300 people were employed in this short term employment scheme by local authorities who were meant to be the great initiators in the scheme.  Will the Minister at least spend his summer, apart from his annual leave, trying to convince his colleagues, industry and employers that the unemployment situation is causing unbelievable hardship to thousands of families and that it cannot continue.  The Government should do something about unemployment and not just offer glib statements about seasonable adjustments of figures.  We have waited until the end of the term and we now ask the Minister to do something about it in the short term.  Because of the policies being pursued by the Government nothing can be done for long term unemployment as long as this Government last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on <i>Building on Reality</i> last October I described the social employment scheme as imaginative.  I outlined the scheme for the canal in Mullingar and in Westmeath. Ten months on, my hopes for this scheme are completely dashed by the figures that have been produced tonight and also because of my experience of those schemes.  It was envisaged that 10,000 persons would be employed under this scheme this year at a cost of £29 million. We are into the month of July now and not even a quarter of the potential of that scheme has been realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are anomalies and shortcomings in these schemes and even at this late stage I would ask the Minister to rectify these discrepancies.  I know that County Westmeath has achieved a minimal amount of employment through the scheme.  At present interviews are being <Col N="1422" /> conducted in Athlone through the Manpower offices for a major scheme on the Shannon.  This will not work out because the qualification to obtain employment is that a person must be over 25 and unemployed for over 12 months.  Despite three calls on the local labour exchange for suitable persons the numbers qualified have been very low.  If applicants under this scheme are to be offered a job they are asked if they are the holders of a medical card, are they in receipt of free footwear, free butter or free milk.  It is appalling that these questions are being asked.  I never thought we would be back to the days when people built roads to nowhere and useless statues just for the sake of giving people work.  I had thought the scheme imaginative and that it would benefit the environment and the community.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday a young man who fulfilled the qualifications visited me in my house.  He had an asthmatic medical problem for which he had been granted a medical card.  His medical problem would not interfere with him working.  The man had decided not to take employment under the scheme for fear that he would lose his medical card.  The whole scheme fell to ashes before my eyes.  When I came to Dublin I spoke to Deputy Ahern about it and we decided that we must do something to have this exposed by the end of the week.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give us an assurance that such questions will not be asked in future.  I fail to see where that is in the spirit of the scheme.  However long it takes, the health authorities will link up with some other authorities and if employed under this scheme that young man would lose his medical card.  That is my main purpose in raising this question to night.  I am convinced by the Minister's expression that he was not aware that this sort of thing was happening.  The Minister should immediately do something about it.  The scheme was sold as a massive PR exercise.  The people were invited to meetings at which they were told how exciting and dynamic the scheme would be and what a great benefit it would be to the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> An imaginative scheme has been put forward by the Athlone UDC and the Westmeath County Council which would work on the banks of the Shannon for a considerable period.  There are difficulties in obtaining the workers because of the difficulties I have outlined &mdash; the fact that a person must be over 25, unemployed for over 12 months and so on.  I would ask the Minister to broaden the parameters of the persons available for work by lowering the age limit and reducing the number of months a person will have been unemployed.  I would also ask the Minister to eliminate the insulting and discriminatory questions that are being asked.  This reminds of when I became spokesperson for Education and the medical cards became a <i>cause célébre</i> with the issuing of free transport tickets. I do not like the idea that one can go into any CIE office which runs a school transport service and on a computer a child's name will be shown beside the number of her mother or father's medical card.  I always understood that the issuing of medical cards was a matter for health boards only and that it was not for other personnel of other Departments to know the people in receipt of free health care.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme has been a failure.  Much of the failure has to do with the limitations which the Minister's Department put upon the persons who might wish to apply for those schemes.  Failure arises as a result of the degrading treatment of people.  They are asked what their entitlement is.  When they are asked if they have a medical card or this, that or the other the implicit follow on from that is they are going to be whipped from them, although that is not stated.  On that basis I wish to add my voice to that of our spokesman on Labour here to night to ask the Minister to do something about unemployment. This scheme has potential but the potential is not realised.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me put on record, if the official reporters have not yet picked it up, my <Col N="1424" /> apologies to the House for not being here at the start of this Adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>I recognise the constructive spirit in which this matter has been raised.  In the short time available I want to try to reply in the spirit in which the matter has been raised by both Deputies opposite.  I want to put the facts into the record in addition to the facts that have already been elicited by way of parliamentary question.  I have here an internal management sheet dated 5 July which indicates that, the number of participants on the projects actually working is 567, of whom 297 or 52 per cent are in the public sector and 48 per cent in the voluntary sector.  I will talk in terms of participants or potential employees rather than individual projects. The total number of potential jobs which the monitoring committee have cleared and which are now waiting for the sponsors, be they local authority, public authority or voluntary, is 2,912.  Projects coming through the system ready for clearance within the Department are another 2,590, all in all 6,069.  They are the numbers.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the scheme has been a failure.  I am disappointed in its takeup to date and I accept some of the criticisms that have been lodged here tonight in the spirit in which they have been offered.  My intention is to respond to the exhortations of Deputy Ahern and Deputy O'Rourke regarding the improvement of the operation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the takeup been as slow as apparently it has been?  There are administrative problems which we have to sort out for which I am not blaming anybody else.  This is by way of explanation rather than excuse.  We are responsible and they will be sorted out.  The takeup in some sectors has been much slower than we would have thought.  We had an information-publicity campaign around the country. Rather than preaching to people we travelled around and tried to answer questions on the ground in about eight venues.  There were difficulties in people not being available when they were approached.  They were not interested in the work because from their point of view <Col N="1425" /> the marginal benefit was not worth the effort.  In so far as we can form any judgment or evaluation of it, in Deputy O'Rourke's area approximately 500 people were contacted by the NMS office in that area and the response in terms of people who came in and expresed an interest was of the order of 40.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is not to answer the Deputy's question in her contribution to this Adjournment debate.  It is not in the spirit of what we are trying to do. Over 100,000 people are on unemployment assistance.  By definition the vast majority of those people have been unemployed for more than a year.  My belief, which I think is shared by everybody in this House, is that many of them are single and getting far less than £70 a week; and of the 100,000 the vast majority of them want, as everybody in this House wants, more income than they are getting currently.  More to the point and more poignant, they want activity &mdash; some kind of a job that they can stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at least 10,000 jobs that can be done.  For example, in the educational infrastructure we can think of caretakers and clerical assistants.  With the co-operation of the teaching unions in the national primary school system in particular we have identified 800 jobs which we expect will be taken up in the academic year commencing in September.  A number of local authorities have disappointed me in their slowness in responding to the scheme, and I invite Deputy Ahern as leader of the Fianna Fáil group on Dublin Corporation to look actively at how the scheme can be applied in the area of Dublin Corporation.  The large urban areas are the slowest to respond to this kind of scheme, be it through the public <Col N="1426" /> authorities or voluntary organisations. We get applications from relatively small, isolated rural communities whose problem in terms of unemployment is less than it is in the greater Dublin area in every sense of the word.  I suggest that Deputy Ahern raise this matter with all the other councillors in Dublin Corporaction. I recognise the presence in the House of Deputy De Rossa of The Workers' Party who is also a member of Dublin Corporation.</P>

We are accepting full responsibility for the operation of the scheme.  We have been disappointed at the response in the takeup from some local authorities, not all.</P>
      <P>I do not regard the scheme to be a failure, to use the phrase that Deputy O'Rourke used.  I am personally disappointed at the response to date.  We have identified certain administrative problems which we can unravel and we are in the process of unravelling them.  It is not fair to say that it is virtually a year since the scheme was decided upon, although I know that is a debating point. It was publicised in the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> and designed to start on 1 January 1985, not before that.  I am confident that we can still reach the target of 10,000 people on the scheme by the end of this guaranteed year and I am committed to working to achieve that.</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy supports it, and the constructive support he has offered to date enables me to feel that the target is reasonable.  The public sector, the public infrastructure &mdash; because the trade unions, the monitoring group, are an integral part of this process &mdash; have co-operated on the scheme <Col N="1427" /> despite their initial reservations about the displacement effect it might have on some areas of employment.  On Monday last at the most recent meeting of the monitoring committee we cleared a number of projects and potential participants.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the scheme is designed to provide employment for those people who are on long term unemployment as an alternative to simply paying people out of the Exchequer who have exhausted insurance contributions which they made, paying them for doing nothing when most of them want to do something, and a great deal of work can and should be done around the country.  I recognise the manner in which the two Opposition Deputies have raised this matter.  I understand the motivation and the constructive way in which they have put their points.</P>
      <P>In relation to the exhoration from Deputy Ahern, he can rest assured that we are already working to improve the administration of the scheme and streamline it, because we have been dissatisfied with the response to date.  I will in particular make inquiries about the points raised by Deputy O'Rourke and I will write to her formally and clarify them or get some kind of indication, because as the House is adjourning tomorrow we will not have an opportunity in this House for the next three months to respond.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that both the maximum and average annual emissions of sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere from the 300 megawatt generating unit to be commissioned this year at Moneypoint power station will be about 23,000 tonnes per annum.  The emissions of the further Moneypoint sets to be commissioned in 1986 and 1987 will be of a magnitude similar to that of the first set.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any trials carried out in short rotation forestry in west Cavan. However, it may be that the Deputy is referring to work on the project of this nature which has been carried out in County Leitrim.  The work in this case was undertaken by An Foras Talúntais <Col N="1208" /> and the National Board for Science and Technology with the co-operation of two farmers.  I understand that, while the project to date has not been a complete success, nonetheless the potential for the growth of short rotation forestry has been established and the NBST are confident that the programme can be brought to a successful conclusion.  They have prepared a proposal for a second phase of the project.  My Department are considering the question of giving financial assistance towards the proposal.</P>
    <P>To date this year my Department has not spent any funds on short rotation forestry but some of the funds which I have set aside for such activity are likely to be expended during 1985 on the Leitrim project.  This project does not qualify for EC assistance.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of dental benefit requires persons over 23 years of age to have had not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions were paid before the date of commencement of the treatment.  The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 14 March 1985. According to the records of the Department he had a total of 79 weeks of insurable employment up to 5 April 1984.  Even if he had further contributions continuously from that date to 14 March 1985 he could not have reached a total of 156 contributions by the latter date.  His claim could not, therefore, be approved. Both the claimant and his dentist were notified of the position on 17 April 1985.</P>

Recreational facilities include piped television, video projector for showing of films and pool tables.

    <P>1 (a)  The final cost of work done in Arbour Hill Prison, on demolition of old Army dwellings, redevelopment of the cleared site as a secure rear entrance, replacement of the perimeter wall along two sides of custodial precincts, surfacing of exercise yards and construction of a two level building to house education, work-training and <Col N="1238" /> production of braille material, is likely to be approximately £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>1 (b)  Included in that figure is approximately £16,000 for the erection of temporary fencing on a steel framework, to enclose the principal exercise yard and enable it to continue to be used by prisoners while the perimeter was being replaced and the other works outlined were in progress nearby.</P>
    <P>1 (c)  Renovation of the Governor's House in Arbour Hill was undertaken as part of work related to the security enclosure of the western side of the prison.  The work included demolitions, reconstructions, walling of areas in front and at the rear, high secure fencing between custodial precincts and the staff residence, work to the main gate of the prison, construction of staff posts at the entrance area, improvement of access and considerable surfacing.  The cost was about £160,000.</P>
    <P>1 (d)  Construction of a new building fully equipped and furnished for admissions-discharges and visiting commenced in Mountjoy Prison in 1979. Work continued until 1982 and the prison had to be kept operating securely while the work proceeded. Adjoining this building a perimetered exercise yard suitably laid out for outdoor games was provided.  Additionally, in this sector of prison precincts, the appropriate part of underground ducts and piping-cabling etc, for all services required when the prison is fully modernised was constructed, the overlying pathways and roadways were laid and surfaced and the new lighting was installed.  The work cost approximately £3.2 million.</P>
    <P>1 (e)  Reconstruction of the lower ground level of a wing of St. Patrick's Institution, to provide a modern separation sector (containing cells, work and association facilities) in half the area and workshop accommodation for the institution generally in the other half, disclosed structural deterioration <Col N="1239" /> affecting the entire wing which necessitated consolidation of foundations, replacement of the floor overhead in reinforced concrete and major work to services.  The cost was approximately £790,000.</P>
    <P>1 (f)  The final cost of the staff residence in Loughan House, including related site works, is likely to be approximately £1 million.</P>
    <P>1 (g)  The final cost of replacing the steel walkways, giving access to cells at upper level throughout Arbour Hill Prison, and of fire resistant floorcovering throughout the prison wings is estimated to be nearly £400,000.</P>
    <P>2  The cost of preparing Loughan House as a place of open custody &mdash; including site preparation, roadways, water and sewerage services, lighting, major structural adaptation as well as servicing, equipping and furnishing of the original buildings and fencing &mdash; was approximately £1.2 million.  The final cost of work carried out since then is likely to be about £1.7 million.  This work &mdash; excluding the staff residence &mdash; includes a gymnasium, stores, maintenance workships, a boilerhouse, water and fuel storage, electrical and mechanical emergency installations, roadways, carpark, and (since the place reverted to use for older offenders in May 1983) prefabricated buildings for visiting and work-training.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Prison officers are given instruction in the handling of disturbances during their induction training course.  They are given further instruction in the course of their normal duties on the steps to be taken in the event of a disturbance or fire occurring in the institution in which they are serving.  These instructions may vary from one institution to another depending on the type of institution involved.  Practical demonstrations in the use of fire fighting equipment are given periodically.  Procedures for handling disturbances are kept under review.  For security reasons it would not be appropriate to disclose in greater detail the instructions given to staff in this context.  As I have already stated in reply to an earlier question, training generally of prison officers falls within the term of reference of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System and the committee is expected to report shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 157 on 2 July 1985 in which I dealt with the overall effectiveness of Neighbourhood Watch. The Garda authorities inform me that it is too early to make a definitive assessment of the neighbourhood watch scheme in Finglas but that, as in other areas, the scheme has had positive effects <Col N="1241" /> in terms of crime prevention and detection and better Garda/community co-operation.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 729 on 2 May 1984, it is not the practice to allocate a specific proportion of Garda resources in any area to the neighbourhood watch scheme.  I am informed by the Garda authorities, however, that they are satisfied that overall Garda resources at Finglas are adequate to cater for the needs of the scheme which is essentially a network of public spirited people who observe what is going on in their own neighbourhood and report suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.</P>
      <P>As regards Garda strength at Finglas station, the Garda authorities report that the current overall strength assigned there represents a net increase of 19 members over the strength on 31 December 1981 and that the question of replacing two members from the station who were reassigned to other stations in the DMA Northern Division earlier this year is being kept under review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The number of candidates who qualified at the competitive interview in the 1983 Garda Síochána recruitment competition was 1,944 men and 987 women.  The interview was conducted by the Civil Service Commission who placed the candidates in order of merit, notified each candidate of his-her placing and informed each one that the Garda Commissioner would write to those candidates who came into the running for appointment.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 1,195 men and 93 women have todate been called for medical examination and, where appropriate, oral Irish tests.  The numbers appointed to date are 774 men and 50 women, and further groups of recruits are due to be appointed in August and October next.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that any candidate who has not been called for medical examination and who inquired as to his-her prospects of a call-up was informed that the Commissioner was not in a position to indicate the likely number of appointments to the force from the current list or if the candidate was likely to come into the reckoning for a call for medical examination, but that he-she would be informed of developments in that area as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision has not yet been taken as <Col N="1244" /> to precisely how many of those who qualified in 1983 will be offered appointments. This will depend on factors such as the number of vacancies arising and also, of course, on the number of candidates who pass the medical examination and the number who accept an offer of appointment.  I might add that I would consider it to be imprudent for any person who qualified to relinquish other employment until he-she has been offered appointment.</P>

      <P>My Department is giving priority to the finalisation of draft regulations to implement the EC Council Directive 82/501/EEC of 24 June 1982 on the major accident hazards of certain industrial activities (the Seveso Directive) following consultation with the other Departments concerned and the Dangerous Substances Advisory Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive is concerned with the prevention of major accidents resulting from a range of industrial activities involving the use of dangerous chemicals and with limiting their consequences for man and the environment.  The directive imposes duties on manufacturers and on the State.  Manufacturers are required to <Col N="1249" /> identify major accident hazards, to draw up plans both for the safe operation of the plant and for dealing with any malfunction that might arise and to provide evidence that these requirements have been met.  Member states are obliged to set up a competent authority or authorities which will be responsible for receiving and examining this evidence and ensuring that an emergency plan be drawn up for action outside the installations concerned.  The directive also requires that persons liable to be affected by a major accident be informed in an appropriate manner of the safety measures and the correct behaviour to adopt in the event of an accident.  The proposed regulations, when they come into operation, will supplement the existing legislative measures, namely Dangerous Substances Acts and regulations, which are enforced by my Department and which cover petroleum and other designated dangerous substances.</P>
