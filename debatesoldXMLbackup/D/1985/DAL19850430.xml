      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  Funding was provided by my Department to the Coolock Community <Col N="1928" /> Law Centre to the extent of £41,000 in 1983 and £45,000 in 1984.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency a payment of £15,000 has been made to the centre this year and the question of a further payment is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of cases coming to the Coolock law centre is constantly increasing? The centre provides an essential service in the absence of State-funded services.  Is he aware that the centre has been suffering from inadequate funding for a considerable time?  Would he or his Department consider direct financing since it is very obvious that coming within the ambit of the combat poverty scheme will not be adequate to meet the needs of the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters will be considered as soon as the Combat Poverty Agency is established.  The question of ongoing financing of the centre is meanwhile under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it proper that this law centre has on a number of occasions been on the verge of closure because of the failure to provide permanent financing?  Does he not consider it essential that some firm financial basis should be provided for the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that with the establishment of the Combat Poverty Agency the question will be put on a firm basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State or the Minister for Social Welfare met the committee of the centre during the past 12 months to discuss their requirements?  Does he not consider that the centre is playing an important and useful role in that area where there is an obvious lack of State-funded services of a similar nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister seriously reconsider the decision &mdash; if it <Col N="1929" /> is a decision &mdash; to place that centre under the Combat Poverty Agency?  Many of us would not see that as an appropriate way of dealing with the centre.  It is a counselling, guidance and legal advice centre and anybody who knows the centre would not consider it appropriate that it should be brought under the umbrella of a Combat Poverty Agency. It is <i>sui generis</i> that it should be dealt with and funded as a separate type of organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be up to the permanent agency to decide whether and to what extent the centre should be funded by the agency.  It should not be assumed that the new agency will see it as their function to fund the centre indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That reply indicates a very uncertain future for the centre. Would the Minister not accept that, as Deputy Haughey suggests, there should be direct funding for the centre from the Department but perhaps involving also the Department of Justice?  Would the Minister not agree that this is an agency which should not come within the realm of the Combat Poverty Agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole matter raises a number of questions and these questions are ones for the Combat Poverty Agency to sort out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people would go to this centre genuinely seeking advice of a legal or quasi-legal nature, that they are people who could not be regarded as poverty victims and that therefore to put the matter into a combat poverty context is to misunderstand the whole function and nature of the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is a cause for concern in that he is indicating that there is no secure future for the Coolock Law Centre.  Can he say whether the Government wish this centre to remain in existence and, if so, whether they propose providing funding for it?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding for the Coolock Law Centre has continued on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from 1976 to date.  As I have stated already, the question of future payments is under consideration and no final decision on the future of the centre will be made until the Combat Poverty Agency have been set up.  The House will be aware that a Bill in that regard is at present before the Seanad so we shall not have too long to wait.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing arrangements unemployment persons from the Mitchelstown area have their weekly unemployment benefit and assistance claims certified at the local Garda station and they are paid at Mitchelstown post office.  These arrangements are working satisfactorily and the opening of an employment office in Mitchelstown is not contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the increasing unemployment in the Mitchelstown area, would the Minister not agree that the situation has been reached where there is not the capacity to deal with the numbers claiming unemployment benefit and assistance and that consequently there is a need for an employment office there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The present arrangements in Mitchelstown in respect of social welfare payments are operating satisfactorily. There have been no complaints from the public in that regard.  Deputy Myra Barry made representations on this matter in November 1983.  In February 1977 the then Deputy Cronin raised the <Col N="1931" /> matter of the provision of an unemployment exchange at Mitchelstown.  However, having regard to the numbers of unemployed there and the fact that the present arrangements are proving satisfactory, the opening of an employment exchange in the town is not considered warranted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will take steps to eliminate the long delays in the processing of applications for social welfare benefits in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for the delay in issuing disability benefit cheques and other allowances over the Christmas period; and if he will investigate the reason there was a sudden stoppage in the issuing of a large number of cheques from 12 December onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>Due to the substantial increase in the Department's workload in recent years and the constraints on staffing resources, there has been pressure on all of the Department's schemes and services. Despite the best efforts of the staff concerned in their response to these difficulties, this pressure has resulted in certain inevitable disimprovements in the Department's ability to process claims, appeals and inquiries.</P>
      <P>There do not appear, however, to be any particular or special problems in this regard arising in the Cork area.  There was a short postal dispute in Cork from 12 to 18 December which caused some interruptions of service, particularly in the issuing of disability benefit cheques. Special arrangements were made to meet this problem by transmitting queries regarding delays by telex from the Cork office to headquarters which enabled cheques to be issued with little delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> During the Christmas period, generally, delays can arise from the seasonal pressure on the postal system.  In order to mitigate the effect of such delays special arrangements are made to issue the bulk of the disability payments before the usual time, including, in many instances, in advance of the receipt of medical certificates. These bulk payments were made on 18 and 21 December.  Thus, with the exception of persons who have only recently commenced a benefit claim, all recipients are issued with advance payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's reply.  The postal strike in Cork was a contributory factor to the delays at Christmas but is the Minister aware that there were similar delays during the Easter holiday weekend and that some of his Department's officials are on record as saying that the problem arises partly from the arrangement whereby civil servants have a free day after a bank holiday weekend?  Would the Minister take the steps necessary to avoid a repetition of the humilitation suffered by people in the Cork region as a result of the delays in forwarding social welfare cheques?  Regarding the second question, are there any plans to eliminate the waste of public moneys that results from the duplication involved in regionalising the payment of disability benefit cheques? Even as an initial step, would he consider the setting up of a pilot area in the Cork region for the regionalisation of payment of disability benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of regionalising the system is a seperate one at this stage.  What the Deputy has stated is correct to the extent that there are difficulties which have resulted from constraints that have arisen from the Government's policy in relation to overall staffing numbers in the public service.  This policy has caused some problems but these are not problems that are peculiar to Cork.  I should explain that once a disability benefit or occupational injuries claim has been authorised, payment issues within a day of receipt of the medical certificate at <Col N="1933" /> headquarters.  Certificates are processed centrally in regard to payment.  This operation is carried out by a special subsection &mdash; Benefits 17.  No distinction is made between various geographical areas.</P>
      <P>Payments could be delayed if arrears build up and this occurred to a very limited extent over the Christmas period when post was particularly heavy. Every effort was made to keep arrears to a minimum by means of overtime and other special arrangements.  Therefore, maximum delays were kept to one or two days.  In the Easter period also, when there are shorter working weeks and additional leave taken, the difficulties would be added to by constraints on staffing numbers.  The impact of staff shortages would be felt at these periods and in a week when there is a public holiday.  However, I assure the Deputy and the House that every effort is made to keep delays to a minimum and that, even at the worst times, the maximum delays were only one to two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a serious problem when local health board officers are on record as saying that the claims for supplementary welfare allowances trebled and even quadrupled over bank holiday weekends? Does the Minister agree that there is a strong case for the regionalisation of the disability benefit payments system? When we can withdraw money from a bank by means of a plastic disc, surely there should be some way of putting disability contribution records on computer and allowing people to receive their money locally?  A pilot scheme should be introduced, perhaps in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the operation of social welfare and all its ramifications are at present the subject of review and a very intense examination by the Commission on Social Welfare which was set up nearly two years ago. They will issue their findings later this year.  I expect that the questions Deputy <Col N="1934" /> Allen posed will be examined by the commission to see if such a suggestion would improve the payments system.  There is a difficulty in so far as that when a claimant for social welfare benefit obtains assistance from the relevant health board certain communications have to be made between the health board and the Department in order to get the necessary refund.  When the claim is ready for payment in the Department but the information is not available it can cause difficulty. The payment could be delayed by the Department pending clarification of what the applicant received from the health board to ensure that a double payment was not made for the period.  Perhaps improvements could be achieved in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been simplistic in his explanations regarding delays in disability benefit cheques in Cork by blaming them on the Post Office strike.  Is he aware that what happened in Cork happens throughout the country? Social welfare recipients, particularly those on disability benefit, did not get their cheques at Christmas, which was very embarrassing for them.  Has he any explanation as to why this happened on a nation wide basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>When people do not get their cheques it is natural that they should make this known and I am not complaining about it; they should do so.  I should state that 33,935 long term disability benefit recipients were issued with cheques in advance on 17 December 1984.  On 18 December 1984, 24,399 cheques were issued in advance of certification to short term claimants and on 21 December 1984 24,683 cheques were issued similarly.  Therefore, approximately 12,000 claimants, out of a total of 70,000, were not included in the special arrangements.  These were mainly people who had been on benefit for fewer than four weeks.  As about half the total of the 250,000 disability benefit claims made each year last for fewer than four weeks, the exclusion of the 12,000 claims from <Col N="1935" /> the special arrangements is most reasonable. The whole question should be put in perspective; almost 60,000 claimants were paid in advance of the payments being due and many were paid in advance of medical certification being received.  It is clear that the Department do everything possible to alleviate hardship, especially at Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that 12,000 people on disability benefit for a period of approximately four weeks had not been included in the special arrangements. I am sure the Minister is aware that Christmas is very important to families and it does not much matter to a family whether someone is sick for one week, two weeks, three weeks or ten weeks.  If you are entitled to disability benefit you particularly need money at Christmas.  Does the Minister agree that it was insensitive to exclude 12,000 people from those special arrangements just because they had not been sick for two months or so beforehand?  Does he realise that it is not a person's fault if he or she suffers a coronary on 7 December instead of 7 November?  Should their families not get payment because of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about payments of social welfare sickness and disability benefit without the necessary medical certification being received in the Department.  As I stated, out of 70,000 such cases, all but 12,000 were paid without the necessary certification.  From the statistics, it is reasonable to assume that possibly approximately 6,000 people would have to refund payments to the Department of Social Welfare subsequently, which would mean great hardship for them, particularly at Christmas time.  I have always found health boards, especially the community welfare officers, most attentive to any case of hardship and I would be surprised to hear of any one suffering hardship. That is the reason for the existence of the supplementary welfare allowance system and I doubt if there is any case of dire <Col N="1936" /> hardship.  Most of these people were in full time employment for 11 months of the year up to then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>They got sick.  It was not their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The priority the Department give to longer term people at this time of the year is to pay them in advance without the necessary medical certificate. In the circumstances that is a reasonable arrangement.  Not only would it cause administrative difficulties to pay all of them but it would create hardship because when people get their cheques naturally they cash them.  It might be proved subsequently that they did not have the necessary certificates to cover them.  Then there would be the difficulty of getting refunds from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that many of the 12,000 people who were victimised by the Department because they did not receive payments on time failed to make contact with the social welfare officers of the health board to get supplementary welfare allowances at Christmas?  Many of them had to go to the voluntary organisations and rely on the friendly shopkeeper or publican to get a few pounds for their families at Christmas.  This happened and there was real hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of victimisation.  If people do not receive social welfare sickness benefit because there is no evidence that they are sick that cannot be described as victimisation. The Deputy cited the case of someone getting a coronary a few days before Christmas.  If the Deputy knows anything about social welfare payments he must know that at least seven or ten days have to elapse.  The first certificate must be sent in and then a week later an intermediate one before payment is made.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the total amount of money paid as rent subsidies by his Department to landlords under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, in respect of each year since the Act came into effect.</P>

      <P>Section 23 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, provides for the payment of allowances to tenants who would otherwise suffer hardship because of rent increases following the decontrol of rents formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1960 and 1967.  Subsidies are not paid to landlords under the Act.</P>
      <P>The following amounts were paid by way of allowances in each year since the scheme commenced: 1982, £237; 1983, £304,783; 1984, £1,143,659.29.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say how many people are in receipt of rent subsidies and if his Department require evidence of the standard of accommodation for which this subsidy is paid?  I am sure the Minister is aware that many of the houses for which landlords demand exorbitant rents are merely hovels and the Department are subsidising the rent for these hovels.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982 was enacted to deal with the position which arose after certain parts of the Rent Restrictions Act were declared unconstitutional. It was estimated that 30,000 dwellings would be affected.  The Act provides for such matters as the terms of tenancy of dwellings which were previously subject to control, the fixing of rents for such dwellings and the registration of such dwellings.  These aspects of the legislation are administered by the Department of the Environment.  The Act also empowers the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations enabling him to pay rent allowances for tenants of formerly controlled dwellings who would otherwise suffer hardship by reason of increases in the rents.  The Act which came into operation on 2 August 1983 provided for the setting up of a rent tribunal to take over the functions of the court in the fixing of new terms of tenancy including rents.  The social welfare rent allowances regulations 1982, which provided for the payment of rent allowances, cames into operation on 26 July 1982. These regulation have since been amended by revising means limits following the general increase in social welfare payments in 1983-84 and extending the provisions for the payment of rent allowances to persons whose rents are fixed by the tribunal.  The rent allowance is payable, subject to a means test, to a person who is entitled to retain possession as a tenant of the dwelling the rent of which was controlled before 26 July 1982 provided that the terms of the tenancy are fixed by the court or the rent tribunal under the Act and have been set out in written form, signed by the landlord or his agent and a copy thereof has been furnished by the landlord to the tenant and the landlord has complied with the requirements of any regulations under section 24 of the 1982 Act for the time being in force.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply was very interesting but it was not <Col N="1940" /> an answer to the question I asked.  Do the Department take any interest whatever in the condition of the houses for which they pay a rent subsidy?  The Minister may not be aware that regulations under section 26 of the Act stipulate that the houses must be in a certain condition in order to qualify for increased rents. Do the Department take any interest in whether the landlord has complied with these regulations before they agree to pay the rent subsidy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that is a function for the court or the rent tribunal under the Act in fixing the rent.  The Department of Social Welfare are concerned about the financial circumstances of the tenant.  Our function is to ensure that if a tenant is entitled to assistance from the Department to help to pay the rent the tenant gets it.  The Department are not in the business of assessing the type of structures or the structural or other condition of the dwellings.  Their function is to assess the means of the applicant for assistance and to award an allowance accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that the subsidy being paid is an indirect payment to the owners of the houses, the landlords of the houses concerned.  Would he consider ensuring that a representative of his Department would attend at the hearing of the rents tribunal to ensure that, where money is being paid indirectly to these landlords, the accommodation they are providing for the exorbitant rents they are getting is habitable and suitable for humans to live in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is raising a very broad question.  If the Department of Social Welfare were to follow that line of action, we would have to investigate how every payment made by the Department was being spent and to whom it was being paid.  This is a subsidy to the tenant. It could be said that a fuel subsidy paid by the Department of Social Welfare is a <Col N="1941" /> subsidy to the fuel merchants, or that the old age pension is a subsidy to shopkeepers. The Deputy is making the point that the Department of Social Welfare should provide special inspectors to see that we get good value for the money we issue by way of assistance to various people.  I do not think that kind of argument is sustainable in any social welfare system throughout the world.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that something over £1 million was paid out in 1984 on this subsidy by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am suggesting that the Department should ensure that the money is well spent.  I do not mind if the Department ask the Minister for Finance to send out tax inspectors.  It might be interesting to learn what they would find out.  The Department should find out whether the houses on which economic rents, as they are termed, are being assessed are habitable, or whether the Department are subsidising landlords to enable people to live in houses which are nothing more than hovels.  It is the responsibility of the Department to ensure that they are not actively maintaining a situation in which people are expected to live in conditions of utter degradation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to see this as a function of the Department of Social Welfare.  The rents tribunal fix these rents.  I am not readily familiar with all the provisions of that system, but I imagine they take into account the kind of accommodation and that the rent fixed bears some relationship to the standard of the accommodation.  The Department's function is to pay this assistance &mdash; that was the original intention of the legislation &mdash; to help people who otherwise could be left homeless to pay whatever rent is fixed by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The functions of the proposed Combat Poverty Agency are set out in the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985, which has been introduced in Seanad Éireann.  One of these functions is, in consultation with the Minister, to foster and assist projects of community development and activities to overcome poverty.  Such assistance may be by way of financial assistance or otherwise. When, following enactment of the legislation, the agency is established, it will be a matter for the agency in the first instance to determine its criteria for allocating grants.  I am not, therefore, in a position at this stage to specify the types of projects which will be assisted other than to draw attention to the explicit reference in the Bill to projects of community development among those to be assisted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that in a case where an applicant for a non-contributory old age pension has a husband who is working, even on a casual basis, she is assessed in her claim on the gross earnings of her husband except for what is allowed under PRSI; if he is aware that income tax and other deductions are not taken into account; and if he will make a statement on the matter with a view to having this anomaly removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In assessing means for old age pension purposes in the case of a married couple, the total means of the couple are established and the applicant is assessed with half the joint means. Under the legislation, account must be taken of any income in cash which is <Col N="1946" /> likely to be received during the succeeding year.  In the case of earnings from employment, gross income is assessed but all expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning the income are allowed as a deduction.  PRSI contributions are regarded as an expense arising from employment and are allowed as a deduction.  Income tax, however, is not regarded as such.</P>
      <P>The method of assessment is in accordance with the statutory provisions, and it is not considered that any change is warranted in the legislation which would have the effect of providing tax relief through the social assistance system.  In any event, in the case of old age pensioners, entitlement to pension is not in general affected by the fact that gross income rather than after tax income is assessed as means.  The exemption limits for income tax purposes are such that persons whose incomes exceed these limits and who are, consequently, liable for tax would generally not qualify for pensions, even if the after tax income rather than the gross income were taken into account in assessing means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the veiled apology in the Minister's reply, would he now agree with me that it is about time that the law was changed and that income tax deductions be taken into account as far as income is concerned in the case of applicants who are old age pensioners and non-contributory old age pensioners?

      <P>If there were additional resources available to me to give some supplementary payments to old age pensioners, I would not be inclined to apply them in the way the Deputy suggests. The greater the income tax deduction, the greater the income of the applicant for the pension; the greater the income of the applicant for the pension, the less need there is for a non-contributory pension.  I would not see it as a fair way of distributing any extra resources which <Col N="1947" /> might become available to do what the Deputy suggests.  I would not do it in that way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a double week's payment was not made to the long term unemployed last Christmas in view of the fact that money budgeted for unemployment payments in 1984, but not spent, would have covered the cost of this; if he will ensure that sufficient funds are budgeted to pay a double week to this category at Christmas 1985; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Provision was not included for a double payment last Christmas in the original 1984 Budget.  This was also the position in previous years.  In the light of overall budgetary trends both on the spending and funding sides, the Government, however, subsequently found it possible as the year progressed to allocate a maximum of some £20 million for a double payment.  Within this amount, it was not possible to provide a double payment for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>The question of a double payment at Christmas 1985 is a matter which will be considered by the Government in the light of budgetary developments during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I then ask the Minister if it is not true that the money was paid from the saving made on unemployment payments, which amounted to £68 million and which could have been used to cover the double payment to long term unemployed if the Government had so chosen to do?  Could he indicate why it was not chosen to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>While it would have been possible to provide for a double payment to the long term unemployed out of the savings on unemployment payments, the Government in their decision to grant double payments to pensioners and other recipients had to take into account the overall target set for expenditure and revenue on the current budget side.  The overall level of savings in the current budget in 1984 was some £50 million, which led to a reduction of £49 million in total Exchequer borrowing requirements for the year to £1,825 million.  Up to the final quarter, there were serious dificulties in raising the necessary domestic funding to meet the Exchequer borrowing requirements and this put considerable pressure on the Government to keep spending at as low a level as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the needs of the long term unemployed are at least as great as and in many cases greater than, those who are currently given a double week?  Now that the double week has become almost an established pattern in social welfare &mdash; and I should not like to see the Government reducing that commitment currently &mdash; would the Minister give us any commitment that this double payment will be a priority in the spending of his Department, and that the extension of the double payment to the unemployed will be included in arrangements for payments this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that the cases of some of the long term unemployed are far more deserving than some cases included in the 1984 double payment.  A proposal for a <Col N="1949" /> Christmas payment in 1985 to all long term social welfare recipients, including the long term unemployed, has been put before the Government in the context of the 1985 Budget.  A definite commitment to the proposal was not made in the budget.  The possibility of a Christmas payment in 1985 for these categories will depend to a large extent on the overall situation on the Vote during 1985.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to inaugurate a new era for the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal as a public amenity under the expert care of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two canals involve more than 250 miles of waterways, together with their extensive banks, towpaths, docks and harbours, and have been with us for about 200 years.  They have enormous potential for development.  The effect of this Bill will be to put these valuable facilities on a par with other major amenities, such as the Phoenix Park, St. Stephen's Green, Killarney National Park and the Shannon Navigation, which are already cared for by the commissioners to our considerable benefit and enjoyment. The Bill provides the necessary flexible <Col N="2106" /> framework in which the two canals can flourish in their new role as a public amenity.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, at the same time, also relieve Córas Iompair Éireann of a considerable burden which, for more than 20 years now, has had no direct relationship with its essential function as a public transport provider nationwide.  The transfer of the canals from Córas Iompair Éireann will be a further important step in the fundamental reorganisation of Córas Iompair Éireann proposed in the national plan now under way.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that the Government wish to have the canals transferred quickly after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Córas Iompair Éireann has owned the Royal Canal system since 1945 and has owned the Grand Canal system since 1950.  A brief outline of the history of the canals may help to put this Bill in context.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal system is the older of the two, having been begun in 1756.  It appears that over £1 million was spent on its construction, much of it from private sources.  In all, the Grand Canal system, comprising the main line from Dublin city to the River Shannon near Banagher, and off-branches and the Barrow Navigation, involves more than 160 miles of waterways.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal system was actually proposed much earlier, in 1715, as part of a comprehensive national plan to improve navigation and drainage.  Construction work did not begin in earnest until 1772 when the Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal, comprising major landowners and other notables, was formed by an Act of Parliament to undertake the construction of the canal from the River Liffey in Dublin city to the River Shannon near Banagher, County Offaly.  It took more than 30 years &mdash; about 1805 was the finishing date &mdash; before boats could complete the 80 miles from Dublin to the River Shannon.  In the meantime considerable expense was incurred in the provision in 1791 of an alternative link from the Grand Canal to the River Liffey at Ringsend &mdash; rather than from James's Street as originally <Col N="2107" /> intended &mdash; and in the construction of extensive docks at Ringsend by 1796.</P>
    <P>In addition, lengthy off-branches to the main line of the Grand Canal were provided to Ballinasloe, Kilbeggan, Monasterevan, Mountmellick and Naas. Eventually the Grand Canal was linked to the River Barrow at Athy.  Navigation on the River Barrow from Athy to St. Mullins, Country Carlow, was the responsibility of the Barrow Navigation Company, established in 1790, and remained so until 1894 when the Barrow Navigation became part of the Grand Canal system and the Barrow Navigation Company was dissolved by an Act of Parliament of that year.</P>
    <P>In 1848 the Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal became the more flexible The Grand Canal Company, which operated until 1950 when it was dissolved and the Grand Canal system was transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann by the Transport Act of that year.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal was begun in 1789 to link the north bank of the River Liffey in Dublin city to the River Shannon at Tarmonbarry, a distance of just over 90 miles by a somewhat circuitous route. The Royal Canal Company, comprising major landowners and other notables, undertook the construction of the canal as a challenge to the Grand Canal which had been begun over 30 years earlier, in 1756, and was already open to traffic for some distance before work on the Royal Canal was begun.</P>
    <P>From the start the Royal Canal was a doomed commercial enterprise, largely because it was too close to the main line of the Grand Canal.  Even so, it appears that over £1½ million was spent on the construction of the 96 miles of the Royal Canal system, a vast amount of money at that time.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal Company experienced considerable financial and physical difficulties in undertaking the construction of the Royal Canal.  Despite repeated parliamentary assistance, it had to be dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1813.  The completion of the Canal was entrusted to the Directors General of <Col N="2108" /> Inland Navigation &mdash; the predecessors of the Commissioners of Public Works whose establishment dates from 1831.  It is a question now of handing over the canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Directors General completed the 90 miles link to the River Shannon by 1817 and in 1818 handed over the completed Royal Canal to The New Royal Canal Company formed by an Act of Parliament of that year.  The original Royal Canal Company had also hoped to emulate the Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal by providing offbranches from the main line to major towns.  But one offbranch only was ever constructed, a stretch of just approximately five miles to Longford.  This did not open formally until 1830.</P>
    <P>While The New Royal Canal Company made a modest success of its undertaking, the tonnage carried was still only a fraction of what was carried on the Grand Canal.  The coming of the railways marked the end of the Royal Canal as a transport artery.  In 1845 the Royal Canal was acquired by the Midland Great Western Railway Company of Ireland with a view to constructing a railway line along the bank of the Royal Canal.  This it did and the railway runs alongside the Royal Canal for about 53 miles from Dublin city to beyond Mullingar, Country Westmeath.</P>
    <P>In 1877 the Midland Great Western Railway Company opened Spencer Dock on the Royal Canal near its link with the River Liffey.  This greatly benefited the railway undertaking but the Royal Canal continued to decline.  This was rather ironic because in 1792 Parliament authorised the Royal Canal Company to construct Spencer Dock as part of the Royal Canal system and had grant-aided that company for the purpose.  The work could not be done by that company because of the various difficulties which had beset it from the very outset.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal has remained in railway company ownership since 1845.  It has done so through the 1924 amalgamation of the Midland Great Western Railway Company with other railway companies to form the Great Southern <Col N="2109" /> Railways Company which in turn was dissolved to form Córas Iompair Eireann under the Transport Act, 1944.</P>
    <P>The extension of the railways and improvements in the roads network hastened the decline of commercial traffic on both canals.  The decline accelerated greatly from the beginning of this century, despite some increased usage in the war years.  The result was that the Transport Act, 1958 gave Córas Iompair Éireann power to close the canals &mdash; or any part of them &mdash; to navigation, which had not been used for public navigation for three years or more, while the Transport Act, 1960 gave Córas Iompair Éireann power to close the entire Royal Canal to navigation.  The Dáil and Seanad Debates on the Bill for the 1960 Act &mdash; which I listened to as a parliamentary reporter &mdash; make very depressing reading indeed.  No real future was envisaged for the canals with the result that proposals were advanced to construct new roads over long stretches of both canals in Dublin city.  Fortunately, considerable public objection prevented the implementation of those proposals.  More important, the present Bill safeguards both canals against such developments in the future.</P>
    <P>It is to the great credit of Córas Iompair Éireann that, despite their other pressing commitments over the years, the 80 miles of the Grand Canal main line from Dublin city to the River Shannon are still fully navigable today, as is the over 60 miles stretch from the main line of the Grand Canal to Athy and from there along the Barrow Navigation to St. Mullins, Country Carlow.  The 96 miles Royal Canal was closed to navigation by Córas Iompair Éireann in 1961, as it was empowered to do by the Transport Act, 1960, and over 30 miles are now dry, including the off-branch to Longford. There are six culverted bridges over the Royal Canal in Country Longford which render through navigation impossible.</P>
    <P>Much has been done to improve and restore parts of the Royal Canal by way of considerable voluntary local effort and with the assistance of Córas Iompair Éireann, An Chomhairle Oiliúna and <Col N="2110" /> local authorities.  That effort and assistance is much appreciated but, of course, it must be admitted that much remains to be done, not only for the Royal Canal but also for the Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation.</P>
    <P>So much for the past and present, but what about the future?  Lest there be any misapprehension, let me say categorically that it is the Government's commitment to retain the navigability of the canals in so far as it is already in existence and, wherever possible, to improve and develop it.  The Government have also decided that adequate resources will be made available to the commissioners to implement this Bill.  The first task of the Commissioners of Public Works on taking over the canals will be to make a thorough assessment of the structural condition of the canals and their potential for development.  It will be for the commissioners to decide and tackle priorities in the light of available resources, including assistance from local groups and other public authorities.  This will require patience, and the understanding of the public that everything that needs to be done to the canals cannot be done quickly and that some restriction in the use of some parts of the canals may be necessary for a period so as to have repair and improvement works carried out for the public benefit.  The new public amenity role of the canals calls for a caring response from the public at large and local communities in particular, so as to safeguard and improve the amenity value of the canals.  The people in Dublin should be as loath to spoil the canals by rubbish or damage as they are to spoil St. Stephen's Green or the Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works will welcome all suggestions for the safeguarding and improvement of the canals as a public amenity, and I have no doubt that they will give very careful consideration to any suggestions which Members of this House may wish to make to them at any time in the matter.  I need hardly stress that all interested groups, including Bord Fáilte, local authorities, amenity and other community groups, leisure interests, should make contact with the <Col N="2111" /> Commissioners of Public Works in regard to the canals and establish appropriate liaison arrangements for the future. The commissioners have confirmed to me that they will be consulting interested groups in relation to the canals, as they do extensively at present in relation to the Shannon Navigation, for example.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the Bill I should stress that its purpose is to secure the future of the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal as an amenity for the benefit of the public. The Bill provides for the transfer of the two canals to the Commissioners of Public Works with the obligation to maintain them for the enjoyment and recreation of the public, whether for navigation or fishing or other leisure pursuits. Obviously, the commissioners must have power in the overall public interest to decide on the most appropriate mix of uses, or principal uses, at particular times or in particular parts of the canals, and the Bill gives them the necessary flexibility to do so. There is no reason to believe that the commissioners would exercise that power, or any of the detailed powers in the Bill, unreasonably.</P>
    <P>I should also mention the two important safeguards which were written into the Bill by the Seanad. The first is a guarantee in relation to the conditions of employment of the 75 or so canals staff on their transfer to the commissioners and is provided in subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill. This requires a full comparison between the conditions of employment &mdash; including pay, superannuation and so on &mdash; of the canals staff in Córas Iompair Éireann and under the commissioners, and the giving of appropriate residual compensation in every case where this is warranted. Compensation would only arise where the new conditions of employment under the commissioners could not take full account of the loss of certain specific benefits &mdash; for example, travel concessions &mdash; which are not available outside Córas lompair Éireann. As Deputies may be aware, there are significant differences in pay and other benefits between the two employments. The Labour Court <Col N="2112" /> will decide any questions which may arise about compensation for any canals staff. The Government will decide in due course how the cost of any compensation arising will be met.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to quantify the appropriate residual compensation, if any, in any case, until the negotiations with the canals staff are sufficiently advanced. These negotiations are already under way and it is earnestly to be hoped, in the interests of all concerned, that they can be brought to a successful and early conclusion so that the canals can be transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works and begin their new rõle as a public amenity.</P>
    <P>The second safeguard inserted by the Seanad concerns canal fisheries and is in subsection (2) of section 5. This requires the commissioners to consult with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in relation to all matters which affect or could affect fish, fish life, fish stocks or fishing in the canals. The detailed arrangements for this consultation will be settled by the special liaison committee which the Government have decided to establish between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. The Government are satisfied that these provisions fully protect the canal fisheries and, therefore, the important contribution which they make to tourism earnings in many areas. From the fisheries aspect alone, the scope for improvement of the tourism potential of the canals is obviously enormous and must be tapped.</P>
    <P>The last point which I wish to make concerns the date on which the canals will be transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works. That date will be fixed by order under section 18 and will depend primarily on when the Bill is enacted, and also on the completion of any practical arrangements for the transfer. It is clear from what I have already said, and also from the general public welcome for the Bill, that the earliest possible transfer of the canals to the commissioners is desirable. That will secure the canals in their new rõle as a public amenity and end an unnecessary imposition on Córas lompair <Col N="2113" /> Éireann. Therefore, I look forward to the support of this House in securing early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill. I welcome the recurrence of the word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; throughout the Bill and the Minister's speech. I welcome the Bill on behalf of Fianna F il in so far as it goes. I have some suggestions to make that it should have gone further, but it is in keeping with a growing movement in Ireland and throughout the world which has made its objective that of preservation of amenities. It even has a political manifestation in the Greens movement, movements of ecologists and environmentalists. It is an indication of the wakening up of people to the dangers of development and the necessity to look after our environment and amenities so as not to allow technological or industrial development, whether it is the agricultural or manufacturing industries, to harm the environment in which we live.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the brief history of the Grand and Royal canals &mdash; he was being a bit exclusive there and I will have something to say about that later. The history was interesting. It was interesting to note that the people who undertook the building of the Royal Canal did it to do the Grand Canal people in the eye. They quarrelled and tried to defeat them. That was an interesting sidelight on individualistic development in a community and the result of it was that the Royal Canal from the word go was doomed to failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Canals at the moment seem to have a certain romanticism attached to them, and indeed, throughout history anywhere a canal was cut. Xerxes cut one when he was invading Greece and deLesseps, when he was cutting the Suez Canal, found the remains of an old canal which had existed at a time when modern man thought people were not quite so advanced in thinking. The Old Dublin Society have carried out a good deal of study of the canals which start in Dublin, the Grand and the Royal. Some time ago I read a very interesting article in the <Col N="2114" /> journal of the Old Dublin Society about the building of the hotel at Portobello. That magnificant structure which is still in use &mdash; I believe it is being used as a nursing home &mdash; cost £10,000 to construct fully furnished. The building is being well looked after. It is a revelation of the differences in the value of money to think that it was purchased for £10,000. The study I referred to had some interesting facts about the barges used on the canal, the food available, the quality of the mutton, the fares, the cost of meals and so on. Those meals seemed to be comparatively expensive. There was some inflation at the time from the Napoleonic wars but considering the wages people were paid they appeared to be quite expensive.</P>
    <P>In a sense we have in the canals an indication of the effect of technological change. We have grown accustomed to very speedy technological change over the last two decades. The people who invested in canals were caught rather quickly by the development of the railways. They could not possibly have though that the canals would become outmoded so soon. In Ireland those who developed the canals were caught by what was a major technological advance which held the stage for a long time. People at the end of the last century and into this century who invested money in railways thought there would not be an end to the railway as a means of transport here so quickly. Again, technological change put the railways in the position they are in. Of the £100 million-plus which the House votes for CIE, about £70 million at least is attributed to railway losses. I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a special interest in this. I note that I have alerted him and I probably have done him a good turn to keep him alert by mentioning one of his pet studies.</P>
    <P>The heavy investment that took place in the 18th and 19th centuries in the canals was overtaken as the Minister said, and as is well known to students of industrial history, by the development of the railways. The railways, in turn, were outstripped by the development of trucks <Col N="2115" /> and motor cars.  We have had a couple of decades of highly accelerated technological change and we would be as well to be very careful about what we put our money on for the future.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; was stressed time and again by the Minister.  One big deficiency in his speech was that there was no foreshadowing of a kind of national plan for the canals.  That could be done very easily, insisting on the co-operation of the various interests that will now have to deal with the development of the canals. Boating is the one that occurs to me first. In the United Kingdom canals have been developed for pleasure boating.  The Grand Canal has been kept open and I had the doubtful privilege of being abandoned at the wheel, as a joke I believe, approaching a bridge.  The approach to bridges is never straight.  The bridge is always at an angle to the main flow of the canal.  I was left at the wheel to see how strong my nerve was.  I managed to hold out without damaging the boat or the bridge or run into it but only because the skipper returned in time to see to it that I did not do so.  I was inveigled in a midland city in England to go on a canal in the summer time and I found that the waters smelled.  They were fetid.  For the most part that is not something we have to suffer in the mid stretches of the Grand Canal.  Admittedly, they have all suffered from indiscriminate dumping, bad citizenship, social sins.  Those of us who regard Croke Park as a place of pilgrimage will always remember the horrific dumping that used to take place there of old bicycles, tyres and, I presume, stolen goods.  At the rate things are moving it will be the graveyard of BMWs to a large extent if we do not get that problem under control.</P>
    <P>Fishing is a big consideration here, in Great Britain, and on the Continent.  I come from an area that has developed a modest tourist business on the basis of the interest of coarse angling clubs in Great Britain.  Members of those clubs travel to fish the lakes and rivers in Cavan and Monaghan.  I am aware that the canals are drawing increasing numbers of people who wish to fish for coarse fish.</P>
    <Col N="2116" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the citizens of Dublin but the people in his constituency polluted those lakes also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not necessarily say that it was the citizens of Dublin.  The Deputy did not hear me use the words, &ldquo;citizens of Dublin&rdquo;.  I did not say where the pollution came from but if the Deputy accepts responsibility for the citizens of Dublin I will not argue with him.  The Deputy is probably referring to the lakes where game fish are found that have come under pressure through highly developed pig farming in my county.  That is true but it is a subject for another debate.  The new administration for the fishing industry is important.  It takes a more sophisticated person to catch a trout than it takes to catch a bream, a tench, a rudd or a pike.  We have had pike development also and it is possible to have pike in a canal.  Those very sensitive and astute people who are watching our environment have been complaining that pike is being over-killed by continental fishermen.  It is claimed that pike caught here is frozen and sent back to the continent. We would need to watch out for that development.  Some years ago we were taking pike out of the lakes, canals and rivers wherever we wanted to have trout.  Now there is a danger of running short of pike through killing and over-fishing. It is important to realise how delicate is the balance of nature.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the noisome experience I had on a canal in the English Midlands. Most stretches of our canals are clean and flow through wholesome, somnolent, healthy countryside.  Anyone in Dublin who passes any of the canal harbours will notice that young boys and some girls use them for swimming.  This is an important amenity which will carry implications for dredging and weed cleaning, as well as some kind of regulation with regard to fishing and boating, lest they fall foul of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without mentioning two of our modern poets who had a particular interest in canals.  Paddy <Col N="2117" /> Kavanagh loved the Grand Canal and celebrated it in verse.  Some very percipient people have dedicated a seat in memory of Kavanagh on the bank of the Grand Canal.  I will not quote the poem but it celebrates the water in the canal. It is rare to find such a thing.  We cannot forget Brendan Behan and the Royal Canal where &ldquo;the oul triangle went jingle jangle,&rdquo; much to the amusement of everybody who knew him and those who still celebrate him.</P>
    <P>A national plan could co-ordinate all those interests together with the newly acquired interest of the Office of Public Works.  It is for that reason that there is something lacking in the Minister's speech.  He should at least foreshadow that kind of co-ordinated development of the canals as an amenity.  People dedicated to their own kind of objective can be very unaccommodating when they clash with people who have another objective.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of another reference to the canal by a man who paid this State some service, Todd Andrews.  In his autobiography he relates that he was upset at one stage by people who, if not called the &ldquo;undertakers&rdquo; of the Grand Canal, at least had that mentality.  The term &ldquo;undertakers&rdquo; is applied in Ulster to those who were involved in the plantation of Ulster.  As chief executive of Bord na Móna Andrews had to deal with a legitimate drainage problem and he thought that the Grand Canal people were being somewhat recalcitrant and not very helpful.  To the horror of his board, he suggested at a meeting that these imperialists &mdash; that is the kind of rugged, vigorous and stylish prose he uses in the book &mdash; were blocking progress and that a bomb should be placed to blow the side out of the canal at a particular place, thus getting rid of the vexatious blockage.  The board were horrified that somebody in such an important position should advocate such a radical approach, although it did not happen.  He had a legitimate interest as boss of Bord na Móna in doing something relevant to the canal.  The canal people had their own interest to satisfy.  This underlines the <Col N="2118" /> importance of a plan to co-ordinate all efforts in making these two canals an amenity.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that some development has been made as a result of the Seanad debate with regard to the CIE employees.  The Minister said that discussions were going on concerning a guarantee and was generous enough to admit that Government amendment No. 1 came about as a result of proposals put by various speakers in the Seanad.  The amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 23 and 24 to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  A person to whom subsection (1) applies shall on the vesting day enjoy conditions of service not less beneficial in aggregate than the conditions of service to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day having regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any adjustment to the scale of pay by reference to which such person was remunerated or the conditions relating to the grant of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement or death to which he was subject immediately before the vesting day, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  any compensation given to such person in respect of becoming an officer or servant as the case may be of the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where a disagreement arises on or after the vesting day as to the amount of compensation (if any) given to a person to whom subsection (1) applies in respect of becoming an officer or servant as the case may be of the Commissioners, such disagreement shall be referred to the Labour Court which shall determine the amount of the compensation (if any).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether the trade unions involved accepted that as a satisfactory resolution of the difficulty which the workers saw. Some time ago I met the representatives of the workers and they were very perturbed because it was difficult to establish relationships between remuneration and <Col N="2119" /> other perquisites they were enjoying and any grading in the OPW.  The Minister said in the Seanad that discussions were under way.  Perhaps he would let this House know what advance has been made in these discussions since 28 March and if all the difficulties have been resolved. My meeting with the workers representatives was before that date.  There is a question of wages, amenities and conditions.  The grapevine had it that there was a provision in the Bill right up to the drafting stage and that then it suddenly disappeared, to the shock and alarm of the workers.  When I was putting through this House legislation transferring workers from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to two semi-State bodies I gave the sharpest guarantees to those workers with regard to conditions of service.  I gather there are 70 or 80 CIE workers who worked in the canal section and no doubt their experience at various levels developed over the years, as well as the traditions.  Like railwaymen and busmen, very often the employment has been over several generations and there has been a handing down of information and traditions all of which will be useful to the Office of Public Works in their new role as developer of the canals as an amenity.  I said at the outset that I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  I wish to remind the Minister that there is a canal known as the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal which has been the subject of much discussion, feasibility studies, engineering studies and various other studies for many years in the context of its development.  This waterway is 38 miles long and is in an area that has tremendous potential.  By the end of the century all the activities we have been talking about up to now will be very important in our social life and there is no area with greater potential in that respect than the one that begins at Ballyshannon, which continues through the two Lough Ernes and which can be linked to Ballyconnell and Ballinamore.  The eventual idea is for a linkage of Erne and Shannon.  Through the auspices of Deputy Mary O'Rourke, the President <Col N="2120" /> of the Chamber of Commerce in Athlone some years ago approached me regarding the possibility of twinning Enniskillen with a view to developing a water freeway between the two.  Because of the availability of an airport and of the waterway, there is tremendous potential for development in the area.  We are dealing here with the taking over of the Royal and Grand Canal systems but why not go all the way and take over all the canals and put them into a national plan for the development of canals?  I will be tabling an amendment to that effect in the hope that at long last we will have a home for the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal and so that we may hope for its development and for the development of that area generally.</P>
    <P>Some people say that boating through the midlands is not very exciting.  I do not agree that the midlands is a dull part of the country.  With the developing stresses in our society where so many one-ulcer men are in two-ulcer jobs, boating in the midlands will become very popular.  Even if that area is not a land of roses, it is an area that any decent salesman should be able to sell not only to our citizens, who should be first in importance, but also to visitors.  The sight of the somnolent Hereford or Friesian raising his head in pleasant meads, as the poet said, is very relaxing and consoling as one moves slowly along the Grand Canal.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, too, would be part of this national plan.  I have referred to boating, fishing and swimming.  I do not wish to be quixotic about it but I submit that it was short sighted that proposals for the building of bridges were turned down by local authorities and culverts put in them instead.  Perhaps it is easy for me to say that.  I do not have the problem of funding and I expect that the provision of bridges would be much more costly than provision of culverts but by the end of the century we will be regretting having opted for the culverts.  The exigencies of the moment are all-important for an administrator and one can see his point in the sense of his having to make a decision in the light of the cheapest way of solving the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2121" /> I might add that if the Government do not begin funding the roads we may be using the canals once again as a transport system.  I am crucified with complaints about roads.  At least so long as there is a certain water level in the canal, one could travel on it without subjecting oneself to the same risk of breaking a leg as is the case when travelling on some of our roads.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of talent available to the Office of Public Works apart from their own official expertise which is multifaceted and which can be brought to bear on the sort of development I am outlining but local authorities and their engineering staffs must be involved also.  The power to close the canals to navigation, a power that was exercised in the case of the Longford stretch of the canal, is one that should be subject at least to some control by the Minister but Bord Fáilte should be involved on a large scale.  They are linked with fishing but there are other aspects in which they could be involved to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>We hear people say sometimes that because of the troubles in Northern Ireland, fishermen from abroad will not come to this part of the country.  That is a lot of nonsense.  Promotional groups who go abroad and talk to angling groups can succeed in bringing them here.  These fishermen have no interest in political developments or troubles.  If Bord Fáilte or local groups along the Royal or Grand Canals formed their own committees and formed direct links with angling clubs in England, they would succeed in bringing fishermen from there to this part of the country.  Bord Fáilte, mainly through the farm guesthouse scheme, should be able to provide adequate accommodation for the visitors.  In passing, I should like to compliment the board for the standard they have achieved in respect of farm guesthouse accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister would need to indicate to the House what kind of resources will be made available for the development of the canals.  There is about £168 million available from youth employment levies, social fund contributions and from the imposition of 1 per cent on this or that. <Col N="2122" /> If a substantial fraction of that money were put into the development of the canals in general, including the two I am talking of, we would have a very worthwhile project, one which would have tremendous potential for the enjoyment of our citizens and for selling to tourists, especially those living in very cramped and crowded industrial sites all over Europe, not merely in the UK, which has drawn most of our attention up to now in the coarse fishing area, but in the Ruhr Valley and other areas.</P>
    <P>The writings of people like Heinrich Böll indicate that there are areas where there is tremendous potential to attract people to the midlands even though it does not have the grandiose scenery of Cork, Kerry, Donegal or Wicklow and cannot boast about the sunny climate as they do in the south east.</P>
    <P>The youth employment levy, the AnCO levy, the European social fund levy, environmental and education grants could provide money for development and, if the Minister does not avail of these sources, it will be passing the ball from CIE to the OPW and the same use will not be made of the ball as was made by Ciarán Fitzgerald and his men during the year.</P>
    <P>There is a myth mentioned in modern histories that Guinness's stout, when transported by a canal barge, tasted much better.  They enjoyed a nicer stout in Limerick than they did even in the home of Guinness.  There is another myth which old people tell us, that when they were young if they rested a pint on the counter it was so strong that it stuck to it if they did not drink it fairly quickly.  That is not very convincing when I saw that Guinness spent thousands of pounds to try to get that stickiness out so that it would not rot the guts of the people drinking it.  People who tell that story are convinced that it was much better because it was so sticky. The original promoters of the Grand Canal were called undertakers.  However, the railwaymen because of technological advances, proved to be the real undertakers and that means it is in the amenity field.  It is consoling to think that <Col N="2123" /> the amenity, environmental and ecological fields are now becoming more and more important.</P>
    <P>We do not know if the canal will ever be used for transport in the future.  We were very glad to have it during the last war.  If we ever had to use it again, the Grand Canal could be put into some kind of shape but the Royal Canal would need a great deal of money spent on it.  Anyone who remebers <i>The Illustrated Social History of England</i> by Trevelyan will know that in the 18th century in England it was much safer and faster to go by sea from Yorkshire to London than by land because of the road system and we might reach that stage here.  Trevelyan indicated that there were so many footpads, purse snatchers and robbers along the way that it was safer to go by sea anyway. We could also reach that stage as far as robbers and violators of the old are concerned.  If the Minister gave consideration &mdash; I know he has a special interest in it &mdash; to the development of an overall plan for the canals, including some of those which have been left out, we would be obviating the danger of passing it from CIE, who have no transport use for it, to the OPW as a kind of receptacle and one which will not be energised unless plenty of money is made available.  I know that there are highly sophisticated and dedicated people in the OPW who would be only too glad to address themselves to the problem of development if finance is provided for them by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I intend to put down an amendment re the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal and I also intend to put down an amendment regarding the transfer of employees.  I may do that when I examine the Minister's statement in more detail and also when I have read the Official Report of the Seanad on the debate and made contact with the employees.  I am very glad that interest was aroused in the Seanad regarding the fact that provision will be made for the transfer of historical documents connected with the establishment, operation and development of the canal system.  I mentioned already that, many years ago, <Col N="2124" /> I saw a study in the records of the Old Dublin Society regarding the canals.  It is not contained in the <i>Early History of the Grand Canal</i> by Henry Philips although I am sure he had access to documentation when he was putting this together.  It is not quite as interesting as the one which I also read in the Dublin historical record which I have some place but not to hand.</P>
    <P>It is important that the records should be transferred and preserved.  Some time ago, I had occasion to look up old national school roll books of the 19th century.  Most of the documentation regarding the canals will be from the same period and I regret to say that the records were very damp.  The binding was coming apart and it was difficult to read the pages because the wet was spreading the ink and the documents were in a poor state of preservation.  I hope that the Minister, whose special field this is, will see to it that not merely are those historical documents transferred but that they are preserved.</P>
    <P>Níl morán mór le rá agamsa ach failtiú roimh an Bhille seo ar son Fhianna Fáil. Tá súil agam nach obair in aisce atá i gceist.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh plean chun na canálacha d'fhorbairt agus nach mbeidh orainn fanacht i bhfad chun teacht ar an bplean sin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an t-eolas agus, is dócha, an tídealachas in Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí chun an plean seo a chur ar fáil dúinn, agus má tá an Rialtas toilteanach an t-airgead a chur ar fáil beidh an fhorbairt againn.  Tá plean ollmhór ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí cheana féin mar gheall ar an Éirne ach ní bhfuair an OPW an t-airgead chun an plean sin a chur i gcrích. Dá bhrí sin, is é an rud atá ag teastáil uaimse ná oll-phlean agus an t-airgead ón Rialtas chun an plean sin d'fhorbairt.</P>

      <P>I welcome the move to transfer the ownership of the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  The canals represent a valuable amenity which can be of tremendous value environmentally and socially to city, town and rural village alike.  It is my sincere hope that with the transfer of the canals to the OPW they will be used <Col N="2125" /> to the maximum benefit of all interested parties whether for commercial or pleasure purposes.</P>
      <P>For too long the canals have been neglected.  This is not because of any lack of interest on behalf of people working on the canals.  We should take this opportunity to compliment them on the excellent work they have done through the years with limited finance.  I am glad the Minister has entered a section in the Bill which protects their interest.  I have no doubt but that the OPW will do an excellent job in maintaining this tremendous amenity.  Those of us who have dealings with the board know that they can be slow and tedious but when they take on a job they do it to the best of their ability and the end result is always something we can be proud of.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be speaking on the Canals Bill because if the pressures which were brought to bear on CIE in the early sixties, especially in Dublin, to allow the canals to be developed as roadways or drained for other purposes had been acceded to, we would not have this Bill before us today.  It is to CIE's credit that they did not close the canals and I pay tribute to them for the way they dealt with the canals over the years.  It would have been a tremendous mistake to close the canals.  This amenity would have been lost to the city forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE became owners of the Royal Canal system in 1945 and owners of the Grand Canal system in 1950.  About that time, traffic on the canals began to decline and it was no longer a profit making venture.  I have very happy childhood memories of the canals.  I watched a flourishing traffic on the canals during the war years.  They were the means of bringing goods, especially turf, into the city of Dublin.  At that time, petrol for transport purposes was very scarce and this was a cheap and efficient way of serving the needs of the city.  The Grand Canal runs through my constituency.  I remember that there was a station at Baggot Street Bridge where the local residents went to collect turf which had been brought from the midlands by a canal barge which was often drawn by a horse. <Col N="2126" /> The horse walked along the canal bank drawing the barge after him.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the commissioners will take over the ownership and care of more than 250 miles of waterways but the areas of the canal with which I am most familiar are those within the city boundaries. Dublin Corporation have a canals subcommittee of which I am a member.  I am pleased to note that the Minister of State has accepted the recommendation of the sub-committee for consultation with the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry in any case where works are proposed on the canals which might affect fish life.  The Minister should be congratulated for his prompt acceptance of this recommendation which is incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The use of the canal for fishing is to be strongly encouraged.  Dublin Corporation sponsored a very successful junior angling competition last year.  The House may be interested to know that over 250 young people took part and almost all caught fish.  Of these there was one young boy from America and two from England. Several thousand fish were caught and all were returned to the water.  A special species of fish was caught which was not recorded before.  It was taken from the canal at Portobello.  It is now proposed to extend this competition along all stretches of the canal with the assistance of the other local authorities involved.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation commissioned the Central Fisheries Board to carry out a survey of the fish stocks in the canal. Following their recommendations over 6,000 rudd and tench were released into the Grand Canal last November. Restocking of the canals will be carried out on the recommendations of the Central Fisheries Board over the next few years.  The section of the canal from Phibsboro to Finglas is used regularly for fishing and there are a number of active clubs in this area.  Competitions are held in conjunction with the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland.  This aspect of the development of the canal is very important and has tremendous <Col N="2127" /> potential.  It is essential that the development of fishing, restocking, competition and so on be carried out in consultation with the CFB and the National Coarse Fishing Federation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation over the years have always accepted the amenity and recreational possibilities of the canal despite their abandoned condition.  It was possible with the help of the environmental works improvement grant to carry out a number of worth-while improvements along the banks of the canal.  These consist of the laying of tarmac footpaths and landscaping, planting trees and erecting wayside seats.  It was also possible to carry out clouting work on the bed of the canal.  In some cases local residents associations carried out this work.  Dublin Corporation provided trucks and lorries for the removal of the debris.  Dublin Corporation have also grant-aided canoeing clubs.  This sport is most attractive to watch and could improve if the canals were properly maintained.  Dublin Corporation, the inner city group and Arthur Guinness Limited combined in an employment scheme to construct canal gates which have since been put in place by CIE.</P>
    <P>All of these improvements have been worth while.  I accept what Deputy Wilson said in his speech.  A strategic development plan must now be prepared by the OPW so that local authorities, including Dublin Corporation, can contribute in whatever way possible towards providing a permanent recreational facility especially in the city area.  Dublin Corporation would be anxious to cooperate with the OPW in every way.  We have a good track record in providing public facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the voluntary canal amenity groups who have done a tremendous job in preserving the canals in their areas.  I especially name the Royal Canal amenity group.  I know many people have joined branches of this organisation and give up their evenings and weekends to do hard work in terms of pulling weeds, cleaning debris and so <Col N="2128" /> on.  In a society where the State is asked to do almost everything their contribution is worth recognising.  With the transfer of the canals to the OPW the goodwill of these organisations should not be lost.  The OPW should do everything in their power to channel the efforts of voluntary organisations into their programme of preserving the canals.</P>
    <P>I should like to reflect on the construction of the Royal Canal as outlined by the Minister in his speech.  Work on its construction commenced in 1772 and was completed in 1805.  While that work was going on an alternative link with the Liffey in Dublin was provided in 1791 at Ringsend instead of the original link from James's Street.  Extensive docks were constructed at Ringsend by 1796 at very considerable expense.  I am sure that in the heyday of the canals the docks at Ringsend were used extensively.  For the past number of years the docks at Ringsend have been empty and they have now become derelict.  Numerous representations were made by different organisations, including Dublin Corporation and the Inland Water Association, with a view to having a marina established in this area.  The canal base forms a natural setting for a marina.  No civilised city today could fail to recognise such a facility within a mile of the centre city and with walking distance of this House.  I urge Deputies to visit that site and see the amenity I am speaking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The residents of Ringsend have a seafaring history and have expertise in boat building.  A marina in this part of the city would add colour to the area, provide an amenity and give excellent employment to a community who are deeply interested in boats, sailing and fishing.  The Minister has a reputation since taking office of restoring our heritage in this city.  I would be failing in my duty as a Deputy if I did not bring this excellent amenity to his attention.  It is completely unutilised.  I urge the Minister to contact the Office of Public Works and <Col N="2129" /> have this area redeveloped along the lines I have suggested.  I welcome the Bill which gives responsibility to the Commissioners of Public Works to maintain the canals as a public amenity for navigation, fishing and otherwise for the enjoyment of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill the purpose of which is to transfer the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and their tributaries from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners of Public Works are a very responsible body and they will do a tremendous job in developing the canals over the next few years.  For the past six or seven years the Office of Public Works have been contemplating having the canals transferred to them from CIE. There were several legal and other difficulties to be surmounted.  Eventually they were surmounted and I am delighted that this Bill has come before us and that the two canals, which are a very important amenity, are being transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works.  I hope they will make a great success of the development of the canals.</P>
      <P>The canals are comprised of about 250 miles of waterways.  They were designed first for the transport of goods.  They are now being turned into amenity waterways. They were designed and built about 200 years ago and they were very well constructed.  Many of us have looked at the canals and watched the flow of the water.  How slowly it flowed.  We must have had wonderful engineers who were able to construct those canals at that time.  It is important to remember that when they were constructed there was no machinery.  The work was done with a pick and shovel.  There were no excavators, no diggers and no lorries to take away the material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Grand Canal was constructed in 1756 and it runs from the River Liffey in Dublin and joins the Shannon at Banagher. It cost £1 million and took about 30 years to complete.  Branches were constructed eventually to Ballinsloe, <Col N="2130" /> Killbeggan, Monasterevin, Mountmellick and Naas.  The Royal Canal commenced in 1798 starting at the north bank of the Liffey and entering the Shannon at Tarmonbarry.  The Royal Canal cost £1,500,000 to construct.  It was not a great commercial success as a waterway and eventually it was purchased by a railway company who built a railway line along the canal.  It ran for 53 miles to Mullingar in Westmeath.  Trains took over the transport of the goods which the canals had carried.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested to hear my colleague Deputy Wilson say we may have to use the canals again because the conditions of our roads are not so good and we have so much traffic on them.  Possibly Deputy Wilson is right and we may have to use the canals again when the Office of Public Works have done a good and effective job on them.  CIE did a very good job in looking after the canals and they deserve our congratulations.  I suppose this work was not in their field apart from the transfer of goods.  Having the canals taken over by CIE did not serve any useful purpose.  They took over the Royal Canal in 1945 and the Grand Canal in 1950.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Commissioners of Public Works will be taking over the canals and developing them as amenity waterways.  They will be a tremendous asset and they will be of tremendous value to our people environmentally and socially.  The Commissioners of Public Works did a great job on the Shannon Navigation and I am sure they will do just as good a job on the development and restoration of the canals.  As amenity waterways they can be used for boating, fishing, ski-ing and possibly a marina can be established here and there.  They can also be used for cruising and the cruisers on the Shannon will be able to use the canals when they are dredged.  They will be used for general recreational purposes. Our canals should be restocked with fish, as this would be a great amenity to tourists and others.  At present there are more than 500 boats plying for hire on the Shannon and we hope that the <Col N="2131" /> number will be increased substantially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As well as the Commissioners of Public Works, many other Departments will have to become involved in the development of the canals, such as the Department of Fisheries and of the Environment and also Bord Fáilte and the local authorities in the different counties.  The Office of Public Works are attached to the Department of Finance, but the most important Department is that of Finance and the most important man the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in making money available to the Office of Public Works for the development of the canals. We all know that the commissioners cannot do a good job unless the finance is made available to them.  We hope that in the next budget &mdash; whatever Government will be drawing it up &mdash; there will be a substantial sum of money allocated to the Office of Public Works from the Department of Finance for the development of the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will be the commitment of the Commissioners of Public Works to restoring the canals for navigational purposes? That is most important.  Possibly, it will be easy to restore the Grand Canal for these purposes, but there will be more difficulty with regard to the Royal Canal. Some local authorities have dredged and done amenity schemes on the Royal Canal very successfully.  I do not live in one of those counties, but it has been conveyed to me that the local authorities concerned have done a very good job on part of the Royal Canal.  AnCO can play a very important role.  People are in training at AnCO who could do a lot of work <Col N="2132" /> on the canals through the Office of Public Works.  That office have the necessary machinery for arterial drainage to dredge and develop the canals.  It will be much easier for them as a body to dredge and clean the canals out and do a good job.  I have great confidence in them because during my term with that Department I visited the Shannon on a couple of occasions and went cruising on that river and considered that the Office of Public Works have done a tremendous job on the Shannon.  With the necessary finance, they will do just as good a job on our canals.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be a satisfactory transfer of staff and that they will enjoy the same conditions as they have at present and will be suitably compensated for any loss of status.  The Minister mentioned this and I hope that in future negotiations the staff of CIE who are attached to the canals will be made quite happy. With my colleague, Deputy Wilson, I met these people some time ago and had a discussion with them.  They were then very perturbed.  I ask the Minister of State to have a discussion with them with a view to satisfying them on the transfer to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>We are very lucky to have such an important amenity as these canals.  They are of benefit with regard to cruising, boating, fishing, canoeing and swimming. Now that people work only five days a week, they need recreational facilities and the canals will fill that need in the future.</P>

      <P>Those of us who live in coastal counties do not appreciate the advantages which the canals afford to those living in inland counties.  Certain amenities such as canals should be made available to those who do not have the advantage of living by the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Office of Public Works will do a tremendous job on the development and management of the canals, but much will depend on the availability of finance and resources.  A good job cannot be done unless the finance is <Col N="2133" /> made available.  I hope that in two years time, perhaps three, the Grand and Royal Canals will be as fine for navigational purposes as any canals in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the introduction to the House of this Bill. It is most important since it at last sets out a course whereby the canals and their environs will be taken out of the limbo in which they have rested for a number of years.  I do not necessarily mean that to be a criticism of anybody.  Quite simply, for a long time the difficulty in relation to the development and maintenance of the canals arose from the fact that CIE, the national transport sompany, were the owners and obviously were not in the business of doing anything other than maintaining what they had as best they could.  In the case of the Grand Canal, they have done a reasonably good job, with much local assistance.  In the case of the Royal Canel, which is very close to where I live, they were not so successful, simply by virtue of scarcity of funds.</P>
      <P>The major element in this transition will be, as the last speaker has indicated, the availability of funds.  While responsibility for the canals will be handed over to a very responsible Department that take a great interest in our national heritage and have done tremendous work of restoration in various fields, nonetheless the important feature will be the provision of necessary funds to carry out the works, particularly under the powers listed in the Bill in section 6.  These powers are very broad and if they are to be exercised it will undoubtedly mean that a considerable amount of expenditure will have to be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill must surely be an answer to the prayers of those who have been involved on a voluntary basis in the maintenance and restoration of the canals over the last ten to 15 years.  I am thinking of people like Dr. Ian Bath, who became involved in setting up the Royal Canal restoration committee and the Royal Canal amenity group several years ago.  Were it not for the vision of such people and the dedication of those who became involved <Col N="2134" /> in the committees, probably we would not have, particularly in the case of the Royal Canal, the asset we have today.  At least the bones of the structure are still in good working order.  It has been maintained because of the tremendous efforts of the Royal Canal amenity group.  We should not forget that for quite a long time voluntary subscriptions and voluntary effort did a lot to ensure that today we have something to hand over to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Under the new system the matter of financing the canals will be most important. Like other speakers, I have been a member of the local authorities committee that was set up to co-ordinate the efforts of various authorities who had an involvement in the canal system.  From that we were able to gain experience from what took place not only in our own areas but also in other counties.  For instance, we were able to recognise the efforts of Dublin Corporation at an early stage in the restoration process where they were in a position to make grants available and did make them available.  In relation to the Royal Canal, county councils in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford made contributions that were most valuable in helping to keep the structure intact.</P>
    <P>Two or three points immediately come to mind and they were mentioned by other speakers.  One such matter deals with finance.  Deputy McEllistrim said that a special allocation should be set aside in the budget each year for the development and maintenance of canals and I agree with that.  An extra allocation must be made available to the Office of Public Works if they are to incur the responsibilities involved in this Bill.  If they are to play a meaningful role in relation to this matter, obviously they will need extra money.  Much work has to be done in the near future and the only way is to start off on the right foot by making a specific allocation to them.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to fisheries conservation.  The work that can be done here is unlimited.  I should like to see an involvement on the part of the Central <Col N="2135" /> Fisheries Board or some similar organisation where they would have any input with regard to restocking and the control of fishing in the canals, along with the other voluntary organisations involved.  Much time and energy is spent in seeking recreational facilities, particularly in the densely populated areas through which the Royal Canal flows. Here we have an obvious recreational amenity that has been available for a long time but we went close to allowing it to slip away from us because of lack of maintenance.  Everything possible should be done to develop that amenity to the fullest extent.  Other countries have recognised the value of such amenities a long time ago and they have done something about it but we have left it a little late.  I am not talking about the voluntary organisations but about the statutory bodies who long ago should have given greater recognition to the importance of developing a canal system as an amenity. The fishing potential of such an amenity is a matter that has to be considered urgently.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give some clarification at a later date regarding the roads system, with particular reference to the Grand Canal.  In that case there are roads that were not owned by the local authority &mdash; in some cases ownership was vested in CIE and in others no owner was found &mdash; but some means must be found to ensure those roads are maintained and developed.  We have had such a situation for quite a few years in County Kildare.  They are referred to as section 51 by-roads and nobody seems to have responsibility for their maintenance and upkeep.  There is not much sense in having an amenity where the road alongside it becomes impassable and obviously it would be a waste of money to develop a facility in such a situation.  Responsibility for those roads must be accepted by somebody and I should like the Minister to keep that point in mind.  A rather sensitive issue in some counties is the fact that the lines of the Office of Public Works and the local authority may cross at times, literally and metaphorically.  It <Col N="2136" /> might be wise if it were easier for a local authority to carry out road or bridge realignments and to accept responsibility rather than having two statutory bodies becoming involved in all the administrative difficulties that can and will arise.  In the past a few local authorities did not consult with the other responsible bodies and they realigned a number of roads and bridges to the detriment of the canal system.  In some instances the canal in the area in question is no longer navigable. It is a pity that was allowed to happen.  I mention those points as something the Minister might keep in mind as fundamental to the success of handing over the canals.</P>
    <P>Section 6 states:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall have all such powers as are necessary for the performance of their functions under this Act and shall, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, have power to undertake the care, management, control, maintenance, repair, improvement and development of the canals and other canal property and to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) dredge, widen, deepen, alter the course of or otherwise improve the canals....</P>
    <P>That is sufficient indication of what we were talking about when we spoke about funds because all of that involves a considerable amount of funding.  I should like to give an illustration of what I mean. In Kilcock two and a half years ago a local committee set up a canal restoration group.  They had no budget but they had some people such as Mick Clinton who had some ideas and they had a number of dedicated supporters who considered the canal system should be reactivated. After a short time they managed to spend £15,000 and they did this wisely.  They were also able to raise quite an amount of money.  In the course of their work they found the banks of the canal had become defective and they had to undertake major dredging operations.  They had to dig a trench along the canal and backfill it with the kind of clay used in such places to make the canal watertight. <Col N="2137" /> It was a major construction job and it could not have been undertaken without heavy mechanical dredging equipment.  I know the Department of Labour did give some assistance towards that project. Under the heading of recreational grant schemes that Department should be in a position to give grant aid normally available for capital recreational and amenity works.  That was a major capital work undertaken at great cost.  Were that work not done the remainder of the operation would fall by the wayside because the canal would no longer remain a watercourse. That was one town only where an effort was made.</P>
    <P>Right along the route of that canal there have been groups established in every town and village under the aegis of the Royal Canal Amenity Group.  They have raised funds, and employed contractors with heavy plant and machinery to undertake the heavy work.  They have become involved in youth employment schemes and now in team work schemes and others which have given employment. It has also given young people an indication of where their constructive efforts have gone, seeing the finished product, knowing that they have participated in its provision in a very real way. By being involved in that way, ultimately those same young people will have greater respect for the amenities they help to provide.</P>
    <P>The amenity aspect of the canals system should not be overlooked.  With present demands for recreational outlets the ones to which most attention should be devoted are those already in existence and the canals system constitutes one.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal has been more successful from its construction than its poorer neighbour, the Royal Canal.  To date it has been more successful in that most of its course is navigable and used by native and foreign tourists.  It is well populated by leisure craft in summer time.  Its fisheries have been well developed, not without a considerable amount of local assistance.  A great deal of credit must go to people like the late Fr. Murphy who was involved in Robertstown Muintir na Tíre&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right.  He did a wonderful job, managing to imbue the local community with the kind of spirit required.  He helped them recognise that they had something which should not be allowed slip from under their hands.  He did tremendous work there for which he is rightly fondly remembered.</P>
      <P>In the last couple of years a considerable amount of work was undertaken by a local group, with the assistance of Naas Urban District Council on the section of the canal into Naas.  I do not know whether it is a matter of coincidence but in the midst of a recession, when the general boom period of the sixties and seventies receded, there has never been greater awareness of the importance of that kind of amenity.  The resurgence of interest is laudable and the dedication of the various committees in the course of their work over the past five or six years has been tremendous.  I hope it will be maintained.</P>
      <P>I might reiterate an earlier point in regard to funding.  When the canals system is handed over under the provisions of this Bill I should like to see a system obtain under which local voluntary groups might themselves be able to qualify for grants.  I see no reason why there cannot be full co-operation between the Office of Public Works and the voluntary groups that have been involved for so long and who made many sacrifices when it was not popular to do so.  I remember approximately ten years ago attending a meeting organised in Maynooth by Dr. Bath and his colleagues. Some person at that meeting suggested that the canals should be filled in and roads or footpaths made of them.  Those committees had to overcome all of those kinds of difficulties.</P>

      <P>That is right, we will keep an eye on them.  Those voluntary groups had to overcome all of those problems in <Col N="2139" /> difficult times.  Now that they have done so they should be eligible for some type of grant aid from central funds.  We should continue to reward consistent local community effort with the kind of financial recognition it deserves.</P>
      <P>I hope, Sir, you will pardon me now for being somewhat parochial.  In my town of Maynooth there is a very active restoration committee established in the last year or year and a half.  It is comprised of young people who have been employed under the youth employment or AnCO scheme, working under a local co-ordinator, an offshoot of the original community council.  They have been tremendously successful in carrying out the necessary works there.  They undertook a task that seemed impossible in the beginning, that of clearing the canal banks for three or four miles on either side of all the bush and rubble that had grown over long years of neglect.  For the first time last summer, and hopefully again this one, people have been able to walk along the banks of that canal, the first time in 15 years.  I visited them on quite a number of occasions and I was most impressed with the way they remained on the job, even in the depths of winter when the weather was very inclement and when many less dedicated young people might have felt it just as easy to remain on unemployment benefit or something else. We should be prepared to continue to give them some type of grant aid each year in the same way was done by local authorities but to a greater extent in order to reward their consistent efforts.</P>
      <P>Considerable works have been carried out in Leixlip in recent years.  Kildare County Council assisted in the restoration of the spa situated alongside the canal adjacent to the local Louisa bridge. Kildare County Council, of which I am a member, have been somewhat hampered in this area through lack of funds.  All bodies have suffered from the same malady and Kildare has been no exception. Nevertheless, each year they saw their way to make some kind of grant available, giving heart to the groups who were attempting to maintain and restore the canals on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> In the future Bord Fáilte could have an important role to play, I think Deputy McEllistrim also mentioned this.  If all of our objectives are realised, then in the case of the Royal Canal we shall have a waterway restored to full navigation.  The next step will be to ensure that its facilities are properly marketed and utilised throughout the entire year.  There should be no difficulty in doing so.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for the provision of water sports and it would be a shame not to develop the Royal Canal to cater for that, to the same extent at least as the Grand Canal.  That is not to say that the Grand Canal should be allowed to remain as it is.  We must continue to improve and extend.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  On Committee Stage we will go into a number of areas in greater detail but I compliment the Minister for introducing this legislation and I would emphasise the importance of the Minister and of his colleagues in Government ensuring that the finance required to do the job will be available as the need arises.  We must not fail to give recognition to the voluntary groups who have, over the last number of years, continued a lonely struggle to maintain and develop the canal system as an amenity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very pleasant afternoon of gentle history.  It has made a welcome change from our often acrimonious debates.  I welcome this Bill which allows for the transfer of ownership of the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary groups have worked for many years to preserve the canals and they were often unheralded and unsung, as Deputy Durkan said.  They often worked in the face of stiff opposition.  For the last couple of years there has been general recognition of the amenity value and the very worthwhile environmental value of the canals and canal banks. Amenity groups in towns and villages along the canals have endeavoured to safeguard the canals as a valuable amenity. About ten years ago this was not the <Col N="2141" /> case.  I remember being at a meeting at which it was vehemently advocated that a stretch of canal be covered in for use as a roadway, a skating rink, a school or other projects that people had in mind. Many sane, sensible people agreed with this type of proposal and the people who wished to maintain the canals as amenities were regarded as being cranks with little on their minds except this silly project. It is odd how with the passage of time values change and now there is a huge contrast between crowded streets, pollution, vandalism and the ills which beset society today and the great concentration of people's minds on environmental values and on what they can save in their neighbourhoods.  The canals and their surroundings will benefit from this shift in attitude on what is worthwhile in life.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill said that the Government had decided that adequate resources would be made available to the commissioners to implement the provisions in this Bill and that the first task of the commissioners on taking over the canals would be to make a thorough assessment of the structural condition of the canals and their potential for development.  In winding up the debate on this section would the Minister of State say if he proposes to impose a time limit during which the commissioners will undertake a feasibility study of the existing structures and a planned programme of what would be necessary to carry out the desirable works on the canals?  This is very important.  The transfer of ownership is largely a legalistic process which must be implemented by legislation here but there is a danger that work which needs to be carried out on the report on the condition of the canals and so on will be put on the long finger. Deputy McEllistrim was loud in his praise of the Commissioners of Public Works, and of course they are admirable, but big bodies move slowly so I would like the Minister to implement a time scale to ensure that the necessary works will be carried out in a reasonable time.  When this legislation is passed I am afraid that people will breathe a sigh of relief, go <Col N="2142" /> back to their desks and leave the work to the voluntary groups.  The voluntary groups welcomed the introduction of this Bill.  In my constituency there are various amenity groups involved in the preservation of the canals, and the Westmeath County Council are part of a coalition of local authorities who have come together to discuss how the canals and their surroundings impinge upon the work of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is making arrangements for the settlement of workers who had been employed by the railway companies down through the years and who are now going to be transferred to the commissioners.  It is only right that the Minister should do so.  I met with groups of those workers in Athlone and here in the House and Deputy Wilson, our spokesman in this area, will keep in touch with them to ensure that the arrangements which have been worked out are as they had hoped.  I am glad that the Minister has provided that safeguard for those workers.  The Minister also said that the Government had decided to establish a special liaison committee between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. That is an agreeable suggestion but the Minister should also set up a liaison committee between the commissioners and the group of local authorities who have responsibility for the canals and their surroundings.  Local authorities have been involved particularly with regard to roads, canal banks, bridges and so on.  It would be useful if there was liaison between the Office of Public Works and the local authorities involved. Those authorities have already formed themselves into structures, a ready-made umbrella body.  The work of voluntary groups cannot be stressed enough.  At one time they were regarded as semi-cranks but now they enjoy the utmost respectability and many people are anxious to join them.</P>
    <P>I was struck by what the Minister and Deputy Wilson said about the need to compile the records of the canals and keep them safely.  So often such records <Col N="2143" /> are lost.  We must remember that history is not only about battles of long ago.  It also concerns how people lived long ago, what they ate and how they amused themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Deputy did not mention wine.  I recall that when teaching history I read a description of the viands served on the Grand Canal.  The compiling of a history of the canals dealing with the people who used them, the types of barges involved, the effect on them of the introduction of the railways as a mode of transport, the threat to do away with them, the erection of ridiculous bridges across some stretches and the efforts of the voluntary groups to revive interest in them is essential.</P>
      <P>The study of the canals is fascinating. It is amazing to think that the idea of a canal was mooted almost 300 years ago. I accept that it was almost 100 years later before people cruised on the canals.  We are participating in an historic debate. Throughout the world water has played a huge role in civilisation.  The history of towns that were built along the banks of canals is fascinating.  Towns like Athy, Kilcock and Ballinacargy in County Westmeath come to mind.  Those towns progressed because they had a waterway on their doorstep.  Thousands of years ago wherever there was water there were settlements of people.  The canals have cut out their own niche in our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider establishing museums in some of the towns along a canal.  I accept that some amenity groups have established museums but the Minister should give special responsibility to a particular group to establish a museum and prepare a history of the canals.  The history should trace life along the canal to the present.  I hope amenity developments will continue in the future.  I accept that the points I have put are small but they arise out the genuine interest I have <Col N="2144" /> in the canal system from an historical point of view and from my work on a local authority in County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is passed we must not rest on our laurels.  We will be putting forward positive suggestions for consideration on the appropriate Estimate for amenity developments along the canals. Almost daily I pass the stretch of canal at Kilcock, referred to by Deputy Durkan and I note that improvement works have commenced there.  It is unusual to see the railway line, the public road and the canal alongside each other there.  This morning at an early hour canoeists were going up and down that stretch of water and I have no doubt that as the weather improves young people will be swimming and diving in the canal.  The progress on that stretch of water is an indication of what can be done.  Such developments are taking place in all counties through which the canals flow.  I am enthusiastic about the canals and I hope the Minister will adopt the idea put forward by Deputy Wilson and produce a plan for canal development.  I suggest that the Minister produce a White Paper or Green Paper on such development.  Perhaps a Green Paper would be appropriate bearing in mind the words of Patrick Kavanagh about the canals, &ldquo;so stilly green&rdquo;.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker, I welcome the Bill.  This is one of those quiet, uncomplicated and non-acrimonious Bills that passes through the House almost unnoticed although the consequences will be a change in Irish life in a positive way with more significance and reality than many of the Bills that arouse so much acrimony and controversy. I do not feel well qualified to speak on the Bill because, unlike other Members who have contributed, I do not have a canal running through my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I was born and grew up in the town of Bagenalstown which has a beautiful stretch of canal.  One <Col N="2145" /> of my earliest memories of national school is of the canal boats travelling on the canal to deliver Guinness, I believe, something I did not have much interest in in those days.  I remember well the sense of excitement which the arrival of the canal boat caused to us in junior infants.  We were always allowed out to see what was happening.  This debate brings back to me very vividly the important role the canals played in our transportation system.  That was not all that long ago &mdash; longer that I may wish to think &mdash; and they were an important means of transport.  They played an important part in the normal pattern of the lives of the towns on them.</P>
      <P>Like other Members I welcome the Bill.  It would be very difficult to oppose it but, like other Members, I cannot help wondering why it has taken us so long as a country to get to the stage of handing over the canals in the hope of implementating a proper canals policy in a rational way.  It is extraordinary and a source of regret to us all &mdash; we cannot take any pride in this &mdash; that our canals are only now being seen clearly and explicitly as a national amenity.  One cannot help wondering if some of the other European countries had the man-made canals and those sections of canalised rivers we have what they would do with them.  I have no doubt that they would be the centrepiece of the transportation system and a large section of the tourist system.  I suspect, and I regret, that from the point of view of transportation there is not a great deal of future for our canals.  It seems to be the conventional wisdom that the capital cost of the barges, the building of new piers and the bringing in of new equipment for the docks, would be so enormous that any benefit from the cheaper form of transportation would be outweighed.  That is the conventional wisdom but I hope the study which is to be undertaken by the OPW will include the possibility of the canals being used for transportation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange to contrast the way in which canals are used on the Continent. The large canals and the Rhine have an almost unending stream of large barges <Col N="2146" /> transporting oil, gravel and all sorts of material.  People still find it efficient and cost effective to use even the smaller canals and backwaters for transport.  I hope that the feasibility study will include the possible use of the canals in the transport infrastructure.  Anything which would take some of the burden off the roads would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>A definite time scale should be established for the completion of this study. The matters involved are too important to be allowed to linger on because money is needed or because important, hard decisions have to be taken.  I am a great believer in giving all Civil Service Departments targets and timescales for the completion of these types of study so that we can have the possibilities and the answers stated at an early date.</P>
    <P>The main point of the Bill is to develop our canals under a new system.  It is extraordinary that is has taken us so long to get to this stage.  CIE were telling us long ago that the canals were no longer commercially viable and one can have a great deal of sympathy with them in the role they have had to play during the past few years.  In spite of their financial difficulties, CIE were left with the responsibility of maintaining the canals at a usable level without the resources and encouragement from Government or the capital to do so in a proper way. When I say that our canals have been badly neglected I am not putting the blame on CIE.  This neglect is not just in those areas where the canals have fallen into disuse and buildings are in such a state of disrepair that they can never be used again.  The biggest loss of all is in those wasted years when many developments could have taken place and the sort of planning to which we are now looking forward could have been undertaken so that the full potential of the canals could have begun to be realised.</P>
    <P>There is a growing realisation of the important role our canal system can play, especially in the areas of tourism and amenities.  There is a great deal of local goodwill for the Office of Public Works. It is also very clear that the scale of the problem is massive and the amount of <Col N="2147" /> money needed will be enormous.  I wonder if it is worth passing this Bill if there is not to be a fairly substantial commitment of public resources to carry out the intentions behind the Bill.  Nothing would be more counterproductive than to hand over the canals to the Office of Public Works and then to starve them of the resources necessary to make the operation worthwhile.  The Minister has said it is the intention that the canals should continue to contribute to the wellbeing and development of the community but in new ways.  Perhaps the Minister has some ideas as to what these new ways will be &mdash; whether for fishing, navigation or otherwise for the enjoyment of the public.  The Bill is designed to give the canals this new role and to enable the commissioners to attain these objectives.</P>
    <P>While fully supporting the intentions behind the Bill, I would raise the question of whether the Office of Public Works are the body best suited to carry out these objectives.  I do not have the answer to this question and I am certainly not proposing that we go to the expense of setting up a new State board to meet these objectives. I agree with Deputy McEllistrim and other speakers that the Office of Public Works do first-rate work.  Their standards of workmanship are usually way above what can be found in the private sector, although I suspect that if the private sector had the same financial cushioning they could probably reach the same standards.  All Deputies have dealings with the Office of Public Works and we know they are a slow and cumbersome organisation.  Probably of necessity &mdash; although I do not accept it &mdash; they are over-centralised.  They are not particularly responsive to local pressures, demands and needs.</P>
    <P>If our canals are to become the major national amenity the Minister spoke about, much of the input and imagination must come from local communities, be they tourist organisations, development committees or the local authorities themselves. We have heard from speaker after speaker examples of how these local organisations have, at great cost to themselves <Col N="2148" /> but little or no return, ploughed energy and money into the development of the canals in their area.  These are the people who have a strong vested interest in seeing the development of the canals and seeing them integrated into the overall amenity facilities of their own area. They have shown in the past that they have the enthusiasm, the ideas and the commitment.  It may well be the intention of the Office of Public Works to capitalise on the availability of local expertise and enthusiasm.  My past experience of Government organisations is that, generally speaking, even when the political direction comes from the top they are slow to enter into partnerships of this kind with local bodies.  The partnership is rarely one of equality.  Government organisations simply do not work that way.  There will be all the usual bureaucratic safeguards which they, perhaps rightly, insist upon but which hinder communications between the OPW and the local bodies and certainly slow down the decision-making process.  This slowness can put a great damper on the enthusiasm of local bodies.  Unless the Office of Public Works are prepared to enter into some sort of partnership based on equality with the local groups, then the intention behind this Bill will not be realised as fully as the Minister hopes and much of the potential will go untapped.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works in their new role will certainly be called upon fairly frequently to adjudicate between various local bodies who have a claim on the use of the canals.  There will be times when there will be conflicting interests, for instance between angling and boating interests, between those who want to develop the canals for some limited mode of transportation and those who see this as being in conflict with tourists.  I hope that from the beginning the OPW will establish a proper consultative mechanism whereby all local interests can be heard and where as far as possible reasoned decisions with full consultation will be the order of the day.  It is essential for the success of the Bill that the Office of Public Works be instrumental in setting up a series of regional users' councils <Col N="2149" /> for the canals, to bring under regional umbrellas all those with an interest in the development and working of the canals. If this can be done in an orderly way the local interests will be heard, new ideas will emerge and a sense of partnership will be established.  I cannot labour the point strongly enough that the potential and the goodwill is there but the last thing needed is the dead hand of officialdom handing down decisions from some remote office in Dublin, telling local enthusiasts that this is the way it must be done.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention and it would not be the intention of any elected politician in this House.  We are responsive to local interests.</P>
    <P>The only way in which the legislation can be effective is by way of consultation with local communities and by having them participate in whatever is being done.  I am fearful of the Civil Service in this regard.  I fear that once the responsibility is handed over to the Office of Public Works there will be a feeling among them that with their expertise, their background and their fulltime professionalism, they know best and that consequently there may be a tendency to override or ignore genuine local interests. Therefore, from the beginning I should like the Board of Works to embark on their new responsibility with a strong sense of the resources and the goodwill that are available in the local communities and to try to build up a situation of genuine partnership with local bodies; but, if the Office of Public Works adopt a we-know-best attitude and if they try to impose decisions, there will be problems. By and large bureaucratic bodies think they know best.  They may be on their guard occasionally, when they suspect they are being watched, to appear to be democratic; but it is against the nature of bureaucracy to behave in an over-consultative or over-democratic way.  In this case unless the Office of Public Works are seen to behave democratically and unless the Minister keeps a sharp eye on what is happening, it would be better that the Bill were never enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2150" /> Both Deputies Wilson and O'Rourke have referred to the question of local records.  As has been said very well on the Opposition benches today, history is not merely about old and happy far-off days, about battles of long ago and battles usually lost.  History is about the sum total of the lives of the people.  The canals were an extremely important part of the history of the development of a large section of the country.  I am heartened to hear that there are records in many parts of the country in this regard and that it is the intention of the Minister to ensure that these records are gathered together safely and made available to scholars, be they full time historians or local historians, so that our understanding of that era may be deepened.  There is in the preservation of our records a manifestation of a new and very welcome interest on the part of the public and of the State. The National Archives Bill, which is at present before the other House and which we hope will be before this House soon, will represent a major breakthrough in the professional preservation of our records.  I trust that the example to which the Minister has referred in terms of this Bill today will encourage other large organisations to preserve their own records instead of throwing them out.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, I have major reservations about whether the Office of Public Works are the best agency to undertake this operation.  However, I have no alternative suggestion to make. Consequently, I appeal to the Minister to urge the Board of Works to effect the greatest partnership and consultation possible with local interests so that the full potential can be developed, not in a centralised way but with each area knowing what is best in its interest and therefore being in a position to contribute fully on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill but I must ask why such a long period of time has elapsed in bringing before the House a Bill to deal with such an important amenity.  I initiated the legislation in <Col N="2151" /> 1980.  I appreciate the mapping difficulties and so on in regard to putting the legislation together, but five years is a long time to have had to wait for the Bill. Deputy Manning raised a valuable point in that regard.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy posed the question as to whether the Office of Public Works are the right agency to operate the legislation. I do not share those reservations because I am confident that the Office of Public Works have the engineering expertise and the manpower necessary to undertake such a task.  Their only problem would be a lack of the proper financial allocation to enable them to do what is necessary.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to secure the future of the Grand and Royal Canals as an amenity for the benefit of the public. The Bill provides for the transfer from CIE to the Office of Public Works of responsibility for those canals, and in this context I wish to pay tribute to CIE for the energetic manner in which they spent the very minor amounts of money allocated to them in respect of the maintenance of those canals.</P>
      <P>I recall during my time as Minister for Transport an occasion in Guinness's Brewery when I inaugurated one of the very laudable schemes organised by Dr. Bath and the Canal Amenity Group. Guinness's also played a significant part in that scheme.  The purpose of the scheme was the restoration of the lock gates that had rotted.  At that time the organisers were trying to find someone who would put the lock gates in place and I recall making a commitment on behalf of the Department and CIE to the effect that CIE would put the lock gates in place according as they were made by the young people concerned.  As recently as the past four or five months I checked to find if that commitment had been honoured and I was glad to learn that lock gate No. 17 had been reached and was fully restored.  Regardless of the criticisms that may be levelled at CIE in various respects from time to time, it is only fair to put on record that they honoured that commitment and played an important part in that very worth while scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> I have a soft spot for the canals.  As a boy, I learned to swim in a canal.  However, I cannot boast about Longford local authority in this regard because in our county we did a lot of damage by destroying fine bridges and replacing them with culverts.  Perhaps in the stringent economic situation at the time that was the cheapest way out but in hindsight it was a mistake.  Neither Deputy Wilson nor I know what the circumstances were in the early sixties but there is a major job to be done in Longford in relation to making the Royal Canal navigable again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty miles of it are dry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five major jobs to be done there.  I have heard references to a sum of between £4 and £5 million.  That sort of money might well be needed to deal with those 30 miles alone.  Obviously, then, the work would have to be done over a period of time.  I join with Deputy Wilson in saying that the way to approach the task is by way of a national plan for the development of the canals, but any plan is only as good as the money allocated to it.  I welcome the commitment from the Minister in regard to the Government providing adequate funds for the development of the canals.  For far too long we have underestimated the value of the potential of our inland waterways.  Both the French and the British have ensured that their inland waterways yield maximum return. In both France and Britain this is one of the great moneyspinners of the tourist industry.  By comparison our inland waterways are very underdeveloped. With proper development boats could come in at Dublin and go right through the inland water system.  If the Ballyconnell Canal were linked with the Erne, which in turn could be linked to Belfast Lough, one could envisage boats coming in at Dublin, going through the whole system and finding their way out at Belfast or, alternatively, coming in at Limerick and finding their way right through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important factor to bear in mind is that the holding capacity of that <Col N="2153" /> inland waterway system would be approximately six weeks.  The canals system in Britain or France cannot compare with that holding capacity.  We have at our disposal the greatest holding capacity of any inland waterways canal system in Europe and that should be taken as the objective of any strategic or national plan in exploiting our inland waterways system to its maximum potential.</P>
    <P>For a country that depends so much on foreign earnings and which needs jobs so badly a two-pronged approach is necessary, that is, developing the canals system and making it navigable and developing it as a local amenity for fishing, boating and so on.  All that would provide a significant number of jobs and would help with the crisis in unemployment.  This area would pay for itself over and over again in the years ahead and priority financing should be directed towards it. Are we getting value for money from the £160 million administered by the Department of Labour in their many training schemes?  Are we not turning out thousands of young people with nowhere to go at the end of those schemes?  It would be better to direct priority spending to this area which would enhance a national asset.  Unfortunately, the potential was ignored in the sixties when other economic developments probably overshadowed it.  It would be a great attraction for tourism and for foreign earnings.  On a cost benefit analysis this area should rank high in any Government's priority spending.  I hope it gets the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>We could also avail of the non-quota section of the EC when we talk about restoring the Ballyconnell Canal.  We could maximise the amount of money if we had a strategic plan, although this would not happen overnight.  There should be an annual commitment to it, as other speakers suggested.  The canals in Britain and France are great money spinners and, if we did our job properly, our canals could be just as popular.  This will play a major part in our tourist policy document which is being prepared by our <Col N="2154" /> spokesman on tourism, Deputy Flynn, and I hope that the Government, in tackling this on a planned basis, will reflect some of the ideas put forward here.  Much of the work carried out so far would not have been done but for the unselfish involvement of the voluntary groups. Tribute has been paid here to Kilcock and anyone driving down that road can see why.  We have a very active voluntary organisation in the Ballinacargy-Abbeyshrule area of County Longford and they have done more than their bit in relation to it and are very happy to carry on this work.</P>
    <P>I know, as Deputy Manning said, that when you are trying to get co-operation between public and voluntary bodies somebody has to be the decision maker, but that is to be expected.  We appeal to the Office of Public Works to make full use of the commitment of the voluntary organisations.  If a national strategic plan were produced all the communities along the canals would be motivated to get involved in their own areas.  There is a great amenity lying there untapped and it should be developed.  For many communities it could even provide an opportunity to learn to swim.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wilson and Manning referred to the fact that records of the canals are still available and it is marvellous that this is the case.  I have some records also containing timetables, fares and merchandise rates and, although they are prized possessions, I should be glad to make them available in the interests of having full records.  The history of the canal system was ably recounted here today by the Minister and added to by one of the great historians in the House, Deputy Wilson.  I will not venture into the historic aspects of the canal system except to say that I have a personal interest in the development of canals.  I see them as a marvellous amenity.  I welcome the Bill and I will give it all the support I can in or out of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sorry that it did not see the light of day sooner.  As the Minister is probably aware, Dublin Corporation have a canals <Col N="2155" /> committee who wrote to him when the Bill was going through the Seanad.  He accepted one of their suggestions, incorporated it in the Bill and I wish to pay tribute to him for accepting the suggestion of that committee of local representatives.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a canals committee in every local authority area through which the Royal and Grand Canals run and I hope that the Minister might suggest to each local authority that they should form a canals committee.  At the instigation of the Dublin Corporation's committee all the local authorities along the line of the canal have nominated members of the authorities to a committee. That committee have been meeting and putting together a policy for the canal which I hope the incoming caretakers, the Office of Public Works, will have regard to.  I am sorry that the local authorities are very late in getting themselves organised in trying to defend this great amenity.  Local authorities in certain areas have vandalised this amenity and have allowed themselves to be pushed into a development of roadways which has totally ignored the use of the canal and handicapped it to such an extent that it could only be considered an act of national vandalism.  It is all very well now to say that there were certain priorities in the sixties.  However, the necessity to provide roads did not give a right to vandalise facilities which cannot now be put to right except by the expenditure of vast sums of money.  People who make such decisions and members of local authorities who vote for them should be held to account for their act of gross national vandalism.  It is a disgrace to see this facility abused in such a way.</P>
      <P>I am glad that all of the nonsensical suggestions which have been made &mdash; particularly the suggestion that the Grand Canal in Dublin should be turned into a roadway &mdash; have been dealt with as they should be: they have been totally ignored.  I want to see this waterway, which is a central amenity in my constituency, developed properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds said quite correctly <Col N="2156" /> that many people learned to swim in the canal.  However, fewer people, because of the dirty, untidy and unsafe state of the canal in certain places, will do so.  A great effort has been made to develop parts of the Grand Canal in Dublin.  The corporation have been instrumental in getting the fisheries board to stock the canal with fish and have organised competitions for school-children during the summer.  They are from deprived areas and might not otherwise have an opportunity to learn the skill of fishing without travelling great distances and having a licence, which most of them could not afford.  That kind of development could take place on a more permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I should like to see facilities provided adjacent to the canal in order to encourage swimming and the development of other sports.  For example, showers could be provided.  Anyone who has travelled abroad will note that some of the seashores are badly polluted, especially in countries such as France.  However, a shower is provided on the beach and people can wash.  It is composed simply of a pipe and a showerhead.  People could use the canal for swimming, subaqua sports, water safety training, rafts for children as well as fishing, boating, canoeing, training in mariculture, breeding fish, walking along the banks and so on, but people will not go near the canal because they are afraid of contracting disease from dead dogs and a generally unhealthy environment.  I would like to see this facility used.  Showers should be provided adjacent to the canal.  Shower houses are not needed.  People are quite capable of making their own arrangements for changing.  If such a facility is provided people could learn some of the skills I mentioned which at present are only available to a select group in society. Would it not be wonderful to see people from the inner city and deprived areas of my constituency having an opportunity of being trained in some of these sports which they see on television?</P>
    <P>In developing this amenity it is essential that OPW do so to the same extent as they have developed St. Stephen's Green or the Phoenix Park and ensure <Col N="2157" /> that dirt and weeds are removed regularly with the exception of those weeds which affect fish life.  I recommend to the Minister that there should be a specific hefty fine for anyone who disposes of dead animals, pigs, dogs, cats or anything else in the canal.  It is wanton vandalism and an unsocial act to dump dead animals in the canal.</P>

If dirt and weeds are removed from the canals, if animals are not drowned and left to rot in the canals and if minimal shower facilities are provided, then the canals can be used, without any great cost to the State, in a way which will be beneficial to the community.  I hope the Minister will consider having an annual canal week which would highlight the uses of the canal.  I am delighted that the Bill is before the House.  In the not too distant future, when OPW are in control of the canals, the relevant Oireachtas committee might have an opportunity to discuss the development of the canals with them.  I hope the Minister will ensure that OPW consult regularly with the local authorities on the development of the canals as an amenity for people who live alongside them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill mainly because it touches on an environmental topic.  One seldom gets an opportunity to say anything in relation to the environment either inside or outside the House mainly because very few people are interested in environmental matters.  That is a sad reflection on the people who frequently praise the natural beauty of our country.  When tourism is debated in the House there are a large number of speakers because that affects every area of the country, but they are not really interested in subjects such as the environment.  It does not require very much imagination to see what the populace think of the environment when one travels around the <Col N="2158" /> country and sees dumps outside every town and village and in every beauty spot, dip and vale.  All local authorities seem to think they are for is for filling up with rubbish.</P>
      <P>The canals give us an opportunity to examine the environment and the relationship between the people and the environment.  I pride myself on being an environmentalist but have been saddened by being one for the last 20 years.  It is a painful experience to be interested in the environment when one witnesses the total destruction that local authorities and the people inflict on the environment every day.  It is painful to see the neglect, the poisoned rivers, lakes and canals. When I was growing up in Dublin the local children used to swim in the canals. A common illness children in Dublin suffered from was rat poisoning which they got from the canals.  There was no attempt to keep them in good order.  We have so little respect for the environment that we dump litter and rubbish from the boots of our cars into the ditches and byways of our countryside.  It is sad that, every time Dublin expands a little into the country, the first thing that happens in the surrounding countryside and in the lanes and roads around the new estates is that they are littered with plastic bags, old prams, beds, tyres.  At the dead of night sneaks pull up in beautiful country lanes, open the boots of their cars and dump rubbish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The story of the canals is a sorry saga.  It tells us a number of things about the people who lived in the eighteenth century.  They invested about £1 million in one canal and £1,500,000 in another.  These were enormous sums of money invested in the future.  They would be the equivalent in today's money of investing tens of millions of pounds in modern transport such as a subway system or a rapid transit system.  Instead of that we have witnessed the destruction <Col N="2159" /> of the environs of Dublin due to this massive expansion.  This is to be seen in the report which suggests the building of four new towns around Dublin to turn it into a sprawl such as London to the detriment of the living city we have at the moment.</P>
      <P>The underprivileged and the less well off children could not afford to go to the seaside in the past two decades.  They used the canals for fishing, boating and swimming.  It is a commentary on the neglect of some people that the canals were not taken care of properly.  I am interested in fishing.  Any child living around Dublin who wants to learn how to fish starts fishing in the canals.  They fish the canals for a couple of years and then they find that the locks have been closed off and emptied.  The feeding grounds for the fish are destroyed and what they had built up over a few years is gone and they have to start off again. Nobody gives any consideration to the cycle necessary for fishing.</P>
      <P>I do not think the fact that the care of the canals is going from CIE to the Commissioners of Public Works will make much difference.  The record of that Department would not shake the world. It has been suggested that people should be patient about the way in which the canals will be tackled.  In the past few years a number of voluntary societies got together and tried to clean sections of the Royal and the Grand Canals so that they would have pleasant places to walk or that people could learn to fish and to canoe.  At the moment 6,000 youths are using the river Liffey every week for canoeing. That is not encouraged as is evidenced by the scandalous decision of Dublin County Council to turn the Liffey valley into a massive rubbish dump for Dublin city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The canals go from the Shannon to the River Liffey basin and out into Dublin Bay.  Dublin Bay is a sewer.  There is only one mechanical plant in Dublin city, with a population of over one million people, treating sewage.  The rest goes into the bay.  It is important to remember that the canals have been treated in the same way. We can take no bows for the manner in <Col N="2160" /> which they have been maintained or not maintained over the past 200 years.  If people could have even the beginning of an awareness of the importance of our environment, there might be some merit in debating this Bill.  My experience over the past 20 years has been that Irish people are totally disinterested in the environment.</P>
    <P>Deputies come into this House and debate tourism and tell us how important tourism is and how devastating the 23 per cent rate of VAT is for the hotel industry. Every little hotel or tourist spot advertises three things usually as attractions for tourists: golf, fishing and pony trekking or horse riding.  Whether unwittingly or not, we have set out systematically to destroy fishing and water sports and water activities through our neglect and our culpable, meaningless and ignorant disregard for future generations.  There will not be a tourist industry here in the 21st century if we carry on as we are carrying on now.  We are polluting every lake and river.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to praise or laud the manner in which the canals have been maintained.  The Royal and Grand Canals in the environs of Dublin city are filthy and dangerous places for children. They are overgrown with weeds.  There have been many drownings.  The water was poisoned.  God knows how many children suffered from illnesses from which they died as a result of swimming in the canals.  We have not maintained them.  There is never enough water in them to keep a water flow.  They usually stagnate in the summer time and the water becomes putrid.  Small, innocent, uneducated, deprived children use them because they have no one to bring them to the seaside.  If we had any consideration or love for our children we would try to do something about this.  Deputy Mitchell said that the penalties for infringements should be more severe.  I agree. They should be very severe.  Fly tipping is a phrase used in the trucking business by haulage contractors or truckers who are going around with loads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I appreciate your advice.  I grew up in Dublin and I used the canals myself.  My brother, who is now a medical doctor, got rat poisoning from the Grand Canal.  Many other children in the district suffered from the same malady.  It was all to do with neglect of the canals.  This indicates our total lack of concern for the environment.  The Minister said that the purpose of giving the canals into the control of the Commissioners of Public Works is to provide an amenity.  If they are to be an amenity this has to do with the environment.  If we are talking about the canals which link the Shannon to the Liffey we must be talking about the environment.  The Minister is suggesting that they will be used for entertainment, sport and boating.  That has to do with the environment.  We are not talking about a strip of water which will be used for commerce.  The Minister has made it quite clear that the original purpose of the building of the canals was for commercial <Col N="2162" /> use, a need which has now passed.  As proof of what I am saying, in 1960 during the debates in this House, it was suggested that the canals be used for roadways and there was an outcry in Dublin that the canals might be used as a fast roadway out of the city.  It is very valuable to have a connection between the Shannon and the Liffey.  If this were properly developed, many people would make the journey between those two rivers.  That would constitute a great asset.</P>
      <P>I must remind the House of the amount of money spent on building these canals 200 hundred years ago.  I am trying to use the opportunity of this debate as a reminder of past sins, perhaps unknowingly, perhaps through ignorance, against those who use and live along the canals. It is not sufficient to have neglected stretches of water running between the Shannon and Dublin.  If they are to be developed, let us develop them properly and, more important, let us raise the consciousness of the people to the environment.  So much of our future and so much of our earnings depend on that environment.</P>
      <P>If for no other reason than the enjoyment of those who live here, we should take better care of that environment.  I would hope that the laws could be strengthened with regard to damage to the environment and that anybody who is seen dumping or throwing rubbish into the canals would be fined very heavily. That kind of damage is done as a result of a deliberate act by people who sneak out at night time or when nobody is watching.  They deliberately destroy something which belongs to us all.  They should, therefore, be punished accordingly.</P>
      <P>I would also hope that as a result of efforts made by the commissioners in taking over the canals an example will be set on their use.  I have seen this happen when CIE cleaned up certain sections between locks on the Grand and Royal Canals which had been full of junk.  They regularly dredged them and trimmed the banks and people respected what they had done and took better care of these places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> It will be necessary to have a good flow through of water in order to ensure that there will not be stagnation and that children will not be prevented from using the canals or have to be prohibited from swimming in them.  I do not like the part of the Bill which mentioned that the commissioners can do what they like to certain sections of the waterways because this would prevent proper fishing.  I maintain that tens of thousands of children learned to fish as a result of catching perch and pike in the canals.  I do not think that this country has ever suffered from rod fishermen, or that the laws have ever been really broken by them.  They are the salt of the earth and one meets the most pleasant type of people fishing. This should be encouraged and the Commissioners of Public Works should not be allowed to shut off the water flow so that the fish die and it takes years to restock. This means that the children have no chance of catching a decent sized fish for perhaps five or six years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the attention being given to the canals.  I am glad that somebody will be responsible for them but I am unhappy that there does not seem to be any money available for their maintenance and running. Something should be done about the culverts running across the Royal Canal, especially in Longford, blocking through-passage.  The Minister has mentioned that they are permanent features and that nothing will be done about them.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the amount of money expended in the 18th century, £2½ million and £3 million or more, on the building of the canals is in today's terms a phenomenal amount.  To build such canals running 80 or 90 miles now would cost a fortune.  We should take advantage of that expenditure and use it to the full.  We should be able to bring life from the Shannon and other parts of Ireland back to Dublin.  Some of the canals in Britain have been used very successfully in this way.  Voluntary groups have been very successful in the past few years in removing rotten lock gates, rebuilding them and restoring them.  Like the railways, there is a great affection for <Col N="2164" /> the canals.  It is very pleasant to walk undisturbed along the banks of the canal out of the city for a few miles.  However, one of the most depressing features is the stagnant water that creates unpleasant smells.  Neither is it a pleasure to walk along the banks when the water level has dropped.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for what it proposes to do, namely, transferring responsibility for the canals from a body who tried to do a good job, even though it was not their business, to an office who will have as their responsibility the care of the canals, as they have with regard to ancient monuments.  I hope they realise the importance of the job they have been given.  If the job is to be done properly it will cost a lot of money.</P>
    <P>The canal is serving a city that is four or five times the size it was when the canal was first constructed.  It can provide valuable amenities for the people.  It is the only waterway that goes out into the countryside from Dublin.  Many sports can be enjoyed on that waterway.  Artificial lakes and ponds can be constructed and stocked with fish.  Not only in the time of Joyce but even in the late fifties and the sixties families spent Sunday afternoons on walks by the banks of the canal.  In that time people thought nothing of walking for eight or nine hours, either up in the Dublin mountains or out in the countryside.  I should like the Office of Public Works to have regard to all of this when they take over the responsibility given to them.  In terms of the present, the sums of money invested originally in the canals would build subways in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to commend the Minister and the Government on the decision to put the canals under the aegis of the Office of Public Works, transferring them from CIE.  From an environmental point of view it is one of the most imaginative decisions they have made.  The Office of Public Works are a most suitable organisation to look after the national canal network.  I hope they will bring the canals as an amenity to the same level as some of our national parks.  There is a <Col N="2165" /> growing interest in waterways in Europe and continental tourists enjoy them greatly.  There is a good future from the point of view of tourism if we exploit them sensitively and intelligently.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the area of responsibility.  I am a member of Limerick Corporation and we are often frustrated in our attempts to find out who is responsible for the canals.  We are told the ESB may be responsible for the fisheries aspect, the Office of Public Works for the banks and CIE for the actual water.  I should like the Minister to clarify whether the Commissioners of Public Works are responsible now for the maintenance of the banks of the canals. Some of them have been allowed to deteriorate during the years.</P>
      <P>In Limerick there was considerable property on the banks of the canal belonging to the Shannon Navigation Company and the Grand Canal Company. There were some beautiful houses there but because of public vandalism by public authorities those lovely buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair.  The Minister might look seriously at the prospect of restoring those houses that are so beautifully situated on the banks of the canal.  In particular I refer to the house of the late Dan Troy who worked for the Grand Canal Company in Limerick. There is a house there that the local restoration company were anxious to use for their boats and the implements they used for the restoration of the canal.  I should like to compliment the Canal Restoration Committee in Limerick for doing a wonderful job on the stretch of water between the Shannon and the entry to Abbey river at Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the unintended bad effects of the ESB electrification scheme in 1929 was that they diverted the waters of the Shannon at Killaloe to make a new canal which became the headrace for the ESB scheme.  While that was a magnificent development at the time it had one sad by-product.  The Mulcaire river and the stretch of the Shannon below the Black Pipes in Limerick are two of the finest salmon rivers in Europe.  However, when <Col N="2166" /> the water was diverted at Killaloe the flow in the main Shannon river before it came into Limerick was lessened.  As a result there was a pile-up of sand underneath the water which had been washed down into the Shannon from the Mulcaire river.  As a boy I remember spending my youth in that area, swimming, fishing, camping and hunting.  It was then a beautiful stretch of water with a very small island.  As a result of what has happened, the Shannon there has almost become blocked up with sand islands.  For generations families such as the Frawleys, the Crowes and the Shanahans had made their living clearing the sand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to undertake an immediate programme of action to combat the appalling unemployment situation in Cork city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been known that, in relation to the remainder of the country, the Cork area has suffered badly from the recession, that many of our traditional, high employment industries, have disappeared taking with them into oblivion many hundreds of jobs.  The construction <Col N="2167" /> industry in the whole area is in the doldrums with the area suffering the consequences of this lack of activity.  What little has been done to date by the Government to correct this situation has been too piecemeal to be of any value. The local job creation agencies are doing what they can but it has become abundantly clear that the initiative required to correct the situation must emanate from the Government.</P>
    <P>I might recall the establishment of the task force to report specifically on the situation in Cork.  It must be said that they approached their work with commendable speed, their terms of reference being the specific objective of bolstering the Cork area with their report.  Despite many requests that report has never been published and, like others, I still wonder why not.  It prompts me to pose the question, does it contain something which the Government believe the public should not be aware of?  If that is so, then I pose the further question, why?  Apart from the right to know, the whole affair is symptomatic of the manner in which the Cork area is being treated by this Government. It is a matter to which we believe the most urgent attention must now be given.  We propose this motion in the hope that it will prompt the Government into taking the necessary action and initiative in our area.</P>
    <P>The latest live register figures show a staggering 25,194 people unemployed in Cork city and county.  In 1981 Cork had 8.6 per cent of its labour force unemployed. That figure has now more than doubled, at 17 per cent.  In 1982 in the city alone there were 12.8 per cent unemployed rising steadily to 17 per cent in 1983, to 21 per cent in 1984 and still rising.  Yet the Taoiseach has said on many occasions that we have turned the corner, that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I suggest that he will need to turn a few more corners and see more light in many more tunnels as unemployment continues to rise, emigration grows and closures continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> We have suffered already from the closures of traditional industries and many others that have not had the dubious distinction of national notoriety.  Many firms went out of business when these traditional businesses ceased to operate, the many service-supporting businesses that have ceased to operate and many others are just managing to hold on with reduced staff numbers.  In this regard we have experienced the cosmetic exercise of globe-trotting Ministers of this Government giving the impression that they were wooing alternative industry to Cork, and they came home empty-handed.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal specifically with an industry that should be given every encouragement.  I speak of the construction industry.  In what I have to say in this respect I hope I would be somewhat more positive &mdash; indeed it would not be difficult for me to be more positive &mdash; than the Government.  It is recognised and accepted that spending on construction is the quickest way to generate employment, the construction industry being highly labour-intensive.  While the ratio of labour and materials varies in individual projects, on average labour accounts for 40 per cent of costs.  Eighty per cent of materials required are home produced, the majority being produced /assembled in Cork by Cork-based companies, for example, sand, gravel, blocks, roof trusses, windows, doors, paint etc.  Need I continue?  The spin-off effects would be most advantageous to the Cork area. Once completed construction projects become a tangible asset serving to improve the standard of living, whether through the improvement of roads, the provision or improvement of sanitary services, houses, office accommodation etc.</P>
    <P>The creation of a proper infrastructure is important to the manufacturing and commercial well-being of the State.  I suggest that at least we maintain the jobs of those at present employed in the construction industry in Cork and create and maintain additional construction jobs in the Cork area.  That constitutes the key note.  As I have said, it is widely accepted that spending on construction constitutes <Col N="2169" /> the quickest way of generating employment. Why must we have to repeat this to this Government who seem to be closed off in their attitude to the construction industry?  It is important that it be recognised and accepted that the Cork area is one warranting special treatment at least for a period of time.  The existing proposals in relation to the infrastructural needs of the area can be accelerated and commenced, and should be commenced, as soon as possible.  The necessary road works, bridges and so on, have all been clearly identified.  In a report known as LUTS &mdash; short for Land Use or Transportation Study &mdash; it is maintained that the existence of that plan is fortuitous and points to the fact that a considerable amount of preliminary work has already been done.  Consequently, the lead-in time from decision to commencement of work would be relatively short.</P>

      <P>The trend in the reduction <Col N="2170" /> of the number of new private houses being built was evident already by the doubling of value-added tax in this budget which will accelerate that trend. In Cork county the number of new private houses completed in 1981 was 2,486. In 1982 it was 2,104, in 1983, 1,700, in 1984, 1,313.  In the city area in 1983, 737 private houses were completed, which dropped to 607 in 1984.  This decline must be halted.  One of the main ingredients missing in the construction industry is confidence.  Since the beginning of this year at least 14 construction companies have ceased trading.  The majority are in voluntary liquidation.  These were companies struggling to survive and they found the cost of insurance premiums, employers' liability and so on too high. There was also a lack of incentive for private investment.  The doubling of the VAT was the straw that broke the camel's back in their effort to continue trading. Despite every effort by this party and the CIF to convince the Government that that 5 per cent was a killer blow, they introduced it in the Finance Bill.  It is too early yet to forecast accurately the number of private houses to be completed this year but I can say with a degree of certainty that it will be much below last year's level.  The real effect of the budget on housing construction will not be felt until 1986.</P>
      <P>This Government have let the Cork area down in many ways.  For instance the free port area for Ringaskiddy was announced in May 1984 amid a great hullabaloo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was before the European elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That announcement was timed to come before the European elections on the 14th of the following month. We have waited almost 12 months for the introduction of the legislation to give effect to this free port area promised by the Government.  Despite the number of times that I and my colleagues from Cork raised this matter in the house there has been no indication that the required legislation will be introduced.  I presume we <Col N="2171" /> will have some announcement before 20 June next.</P>
      <P>In relation to oil exploration, the formal establishment of Cork as an official base for oil exploration in the Celtic Sea, and as a base in the event of oil being found in commercial quantities off the south coast, would have had a tremendous effect on the area.  But the Government parties could not agree as to what they would offer the oil companies. We had some sort of an agreement last week but while the Government were foostering and having ideological problems, Cork was gradually going down the river.  Cork has a tradition of servicing oil rigs and has many years of experience in heavy industry.  Much of the servicing for oil companies could have been done from Cork dockyard but the Government with their 48 per cent stake holding in VCD closed it down.  Included among the promises we had was one from the Minister in the House who told us that negotiations were at an advanced stage with people outside this country who would reopen the dockyard.  Unless Fianna Fáil get back into Government that dockyard will not be reopened for shipbuilding, ship repairs and the servicing of oil rigs and so on.  Cork also possesses storage and jetty facilities and a refinery at Whitegate.</P>
      <P>The expansion of natural gas services in the area is very important.  The discovery and bringing ashore of natural gas from the Kinsale Head should have been followed by work to pipe this gas to houses and factories over a wider area of Cork. This would create substantial amounts of work and we would have had a network of gas pipes which would have helped to attract industry to the area.  This would also help our balance of payments since it would reduce our bill for the importation of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are enormous sums of private money available for investment in industry.  This money would be invested if a climate which would restore confidence to industry and to the Cork area were created by the Government.  Only the Government <Col N="2172" /> through their policies can give a lead in restoring confidence.  If we had some new thinking, new initiatives and a commitment to the Cork area we could restore confidence.  The entire Cork area is in a very depressed state as regards employment but it need not continue to be so if the Government agreed that Cork deserves priority treatment so as to restore Cork to its rightful place as the centre of activity in the south.</P>
    <P>The policy of decentralisation was part and parcel of our commitment to Cork and we promised that An Foras Forbartha would be brought to Cork, but on the change of Government, because it suited one Minister to tell his constituents that An Foras Forbartha would not go to Cork, the decision was changed.  The housing and office accommodation markets are at a low ebb but if even one Government Department were transferred to Cork it would give a tremendous fillip to the area and would create a demand for office accommodation and for residential accommodation.  This would create confidence in this area of activity and would encourage further development as well as encouraging the financial institutions to invest.  How long will this Government wait?  We keep telling them what they ought to do for Cork but it goes in one ear and out two ears.</P>
    <P>The passenger car ferry would be a life line for the south-west area.  The Government must be indicted for neglecting the south-west area by not providing a car ferry.  An allocation of £5,000 towards the efforts of the local groups, the local authorities, Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, towards the contributions for the provision of that ferry, was welcome, but the Minister and the Government dillied and dallied about it and the £500,000 commitment given on a once-off basis was too little and very much too late.</P>
    <P>The ferry must be provided and the Government, even at this late stage, should make a positive decision and instruct the State companies to provide it for the benefit of the region, for the benefit of trade, commerce and industry <Col N="2173" /> and, in particular, tourism.  We are all conscious of the fact that Cork is celebrating the 800th anniversary of the granting of its charter and this is an opportunity for the Government, presented by the people of Cork, to provide a ferry to bring the visitors to the city to celebrate this occasion.  However, the Government have let those who wish to visit the city down.  Those people cannot blame Cork people.  The local authorities in the area provided the encouragement.  They got together and sought a commitment from the Government but the Government's help was too little and too late.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall the threat of resignations made by Government TDs in the Cork area.  One of those Members got banner headlines in a local newspaper when he declared that if Cork did not get the ferry he would resign his seat.  We do not have a ferry in Cork, and since Members have not been called to the Cork area for a by-election campaign, we have not had any resignations from the House.  So much for credibility.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with unemployment in the area we have the twin evil of emigration which has surfaced again, especially unprepared emigration.  It is understandable and regrettable that people who cannot find work at home would wish to try their luck overseas.  The Government cannot even tell us how many people have left seeking work abroad.  The country is losing people with valuable skills and professions.  Such people will certainly be needed in the future.  When we return to Government we will have need of them but the Coalition do not have any need. All that is left for them is the emigrant ship.  Young people are being put at risk. Many of those leaving our shores go abroad on speck in the hope that something will turn up.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind my colleagues from the Cork area on the Government benches about the promised political influence indicated in the Cork region in the last election.  People were asked brightly and often to vote for Fine Gael and give Cork political influence.  So much for the political influence that the Cork people gave them when returning a <Col N="2174" /> majority of Government Deputies.  The Government have not made any effort to tackle the problem of unemployment. They have destroyed the confidence of our people, have demoralised our youth and are unable to give incentive, leadership or encouragement to create even an attitude of mind in the people to help them out of the morass in which they have found themselves.  By not addressing the problem of unemployment the Government seem to be totally unaware of the many consequences that arise socially and otherwise from the present unacceptable position.  The Government are engaged in a public relations exercise like that which took place during the most important debate of the year, the budget debate when introducing a supposed amendment to the 1979 Act dealing with family planning.  In Cork we are not looking for condoms or abortions; we are looking for jobs and for our industry to be restored to the level it was when the Government took office.  Shame on the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Our motion calls on the Government to undertake an immediate programme of action to combat the appalling unemployment problem in Cork.  We are not here to try to gain political points on this serious matter.  I do not think any Deputy, irrespective of his or her political affiliations, will deny that the problem in Cork has reached disaster level.  Unless the Government are prepared to respond immediately many more problems will arise in the months ahead.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time to outline the many areas where jobs can be created.  I recommend that the Minister gives further consideration to the submissions made by the Cork task force on unemployment by the building construction industry.  Those submissions contain a litany of projects that would result in immediate employment for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry is the most obvious area to be considered.  Labour content is high in that sector and has an enormous spin-off effect.  Many projects have been accepted already as necessary <Col N="2175" /> for the Cork area such as the erection of new education establishments and the extension of existing ones.  There is a need for a comprehensive housing programme but that has been held up due to a lack of finance.  The proposal to build a new juvenile detention centre in Cork jail is worthy of comment.  We are all aware that the Government place a lot of emphasis on what is happening in our cities and towns but although the provision of a new juvenile detention centre in Cork would mean employment for 100 people the project is not going ahead. The extraordinary thing is that the project was approved as far back as 1979. There is little use in any of us deploring the increase in crime, the stealing of cars and the spate of house robberies if the Government do not provide the money to erect a detention centre for such vandals. The building has been designed and is ready to go ahead when the Government provide the money.</P>
    <P>Many of the projects will be future assets to the Cork area.  There is an urgent need for an extension of the runway at Cork airport to facilitate tourist traffic. Tourism plays a major part in the economic development of the Cork and Kerry regions.  Nobody will deny that money invested in that industry will create employment.  A number of our textile industries have survived the recession.  A financial injection now could create more jobs.  The Minister should request An Bord Pleanála to make immediate decisions on some of the many appeals which are held up in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I am confining my contribution to areas where I know employment can be created. I would like to know from the Minister, as Deputy Lyons has already touched on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Lyons has a meeting outside also.  I would like to know from the Minister what development has taken place regarding Verolme Cork dockyard.  Here we had one of the most modern engineering establishments in this country, yet the Government have done little or nothing to revitalise that industry.  I do not want to go back over the Minister's words, but he promised this House that everything possible would be done to encourage an interested party who we understood at the time was from Great Britain or Germany but no statement has been made by the Government, the Minister or any spokesman of the Government party on this industry.  The former workers, who now line the dole queues, are asking what is going on in the yard at the moment. We know that some kind of activity is going on there, yet nobody seems to know what it is.  I ask the Minister tonight that in his reply he might give us some up to date report on what efforts he, his Government or anybody else is making to reopen this most important industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention here tonight something I have taken a very keen interest in and I would like the Minister to take particular notice of it.  Efforts should now be made to prepare a register of the number of young people in the Cork area who have not completed their period of apprenticeship to various trades because of redundancies or lack of sponsorship.  I ask that arrangements be made to include them in a special grants scheme for youth employment so that they could be employed in their own trades and be given the necessary opportunity to complete their apprenticeship training.  At least they would have equal opportunity of seeking employment as fully qualified <Col N="2177" /> people in their own trades.  It is vital to this nation to know that our young people are ready and fully qualified to contribute to the building of our future economy.  I am making a special appeal to the Minister. I have done a great deal of work in trying to get statistical information about the many young boys and girls who have been employed for a period in a trade and who because of the recession were deprived of qualifying in their trade.  If nothing else is achieved tonight I ask the Minister to give this aspect careful consideration together with his colleague, the Minister for Labour.  It is terrible to be a young boy or girl going around being called an unbaked or a half-baked tradesperson.  It is affecting not only Cork but the whole nation.</P>

      <P>Tremendous work has been done by AnCO, building industries and so on, but unfortunately because of the recession those young people are being deprived of their right to qualify as full tradespersons in their own trades.</P>
      <P>Finally, the protection of our existing industries in Cork must be the concern of all.  The recent increase in employer liability insurance must give cause for great concern.  The impact of this enormous increase by insurance companies will undoubtedly close down some of our industries, especially the smaller ones.  If not, certainly it will mean the laying off of many employees.  I contacted the Minister some weeks ago on this matter and I am hoping for some very positive action by the Government in this respect. The impact of this increase will do untold damage to the whole structure of our economy especially where industry is concerned.  I hope the Minister will report very shortly to this House, to the nation and to the many people who are out there trying to establish little industries to provide their own living and who are now forced out of business because of this enormous increase in employer liability insurance.  We must place great emphasis on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> I ask the Minister not to delay in making some statement on what is happening. I know that he must be inundated with requests from industries throughout the length and breadth of the country because of this increase in employer liability insurance.  I hope that the insurance companies will face up to their responsibility for the welfare of our industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;concerned about the level of unemployment generally, endorses the policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government to promote investment and to create the economic and financial conditions in which new employment can be created throughout the country including Cork City and County.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much point in this sort of motion.  Here people are trying to pretend that the problem of unemployment is somehow unique to Cork.  The fact is that every part of Ireland is suffering from unemployment at the moment and no good will be served simply by taking resources away from one part of the country and giving them to another.  That does not solve the unemployment problem, it simply disadvantages one area to the advantage of another.  We must remember that we are one country, and there is too much of this sort of thing from the other side of the House.  If those talking happen to be Cork Deputies they say that Cork has all the problems; if they are Kerry Deputies they say that Kerry has all the problems.  It is a pity to see a party who used to be a national party taking such a sectional view of our national problems.  We must have a national view of how to solve this problem and we must have national unity in regard to solving it; not national unity in the political Tone-imposed sense that the people opposite occasionally try to use <Col N="2179" /> for electoral purposes but national unity to try to restore the economic self-confidence of our people.</P>
    <P>The type of wailing we have been listening to from the Deputies opposite for the last 45 minutes does nothing to restore national confidence.  Indeed, the solutions they are putting forward are totally false.  If I had a calculator to hand I am sure I would calculate that the two Deputies who have spoken promised to spend something in the region of £115 million.  They said that if they had their way all these promises would be carried out, but where in God's name is the money to come from?  Do they not think that people are paying enough taxation? Do they really think that if the Government spend more money that would solve the unemployment problem?  Of course it will not.  All it will do is lead to higher taxation, and people are paying enough taxation already.</P>
    <P>The public spending handout approach to the solution of the unemployment problem advocated by Deputy Lyons and Deputy Wyse simply will not work in Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary or any other part of the country and the sooner we face the realities of the unemployment problem and get away from this type of political posturing the better.  This is pure opportunism on the part of the Deputies opposite.  Instead of using this time to discuss the true issues facing the economy, they decide to bring in a motion this week dealing with Cork.  I presume next week the motion will be about Kerry and the following week about Limerick, with Deputies saying the same things but with the geography changed.  That is not making a contribution to solving any problem.  What we want and should be getting from the Opposition, but we have not had it yet, are serious proposals which are an alternative to those being pursued by the Government.  They have not produced serious proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Let me be frank about it, there has been an unacceptably large increase in unemployment in Cork in the last year due to a number of factors &mdash; the recession, the very rapid growth in the labour force and the fact that there are more people seeking jobs for the first time than there are retiring but, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this problem is in some way unique to Cork is foolish. The situation is quite the opposite. Taking the figures from February 1984 to February 1985 we see that there has been a smaller increase in unemployment in Cork than in the State generally, yet the Opposition are looking for special treatment in an area where there has been a smaller increase than in the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>I want to give a few examples of success stories in Cork.  I am not taking credit for them on behalf of the Government because the Government do not deserve and do not claim credit for them.  The credit rests with those positive thinking people in Cork who are doing something about their problems rather than wailing like those on the other side of the House.  Carridoun Potteries took on 45 employees last year; Bourns Electronics (Ireland) Limited have created 36 new jobs; Iprodex Manufacturing Limited, an extra 67 new jobs; Irish Crown Cork Company Limited, an extra seven new jobs; Lierbert International, 94 jobs, Western Digital (Ireland) Limited, 89 extra jobs; Blarney Handcrafts, 50 extra jobs; Mechcon Limited, 92 extra jobs; CPT Limited, 49 extra jobs; and Sunbeam Limited, 51 extra jobs.  Let me stress that I am not taking the credit, and the Government do not deserve the credit, for these extra jobs. The people who deserve the credit are the businessmen and the workers who built those industries, who found new markets overseas and who were able to create extra jobs.  In most cases these are <Col N="2182" /> Cork people who made good in Cork.  It is about time Fianna Fáil gave a little credit to what is achieved in their own county by the people who got on with the job rather than coming to this House looking for special treatment.  Nobody in this country needs special treatment; what people need is encouragement. They are not getting it from the Opposition but they are getting it, and will continue to get it, from the Government.

As far as the commitment in the <Col N="2183" /> task force plan for Cork is concerned, we have already established downstream activities for the new plant Biotechnology (UCC) Limited.  This company is in operation and employing a number of people.  The official opening is to be performed in the near future by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry. I have no doubt that the Deputies opposite will be there on that occassion to complain as they are doing this evening.</P>

      <P>The IDA executive committee have also approved the development of the National Microelectronics Design Centre for Cork and, as an interim measure, space for this is to be provided in the form of 600 square feet in the enterprise centre.  Two overseas companies have already expressed interest in locating in the National Microelectronics Design Centre &mdash; Altira and Silico Systems.  These are things which are going on in Cork and of which the Deputies opposite seem to be blissfully unaware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of the enterprise centre in Cork is under way and is expected to be completed in August or September 1985.  Furthermore, small industries clinics were conducted in 14 towns in Cork during 1984 in accordance with the commitment in the task force report to pay particular attention to small industry promotion.  I also emphasise that as far as the solution of Cork's problems is concerned what is needed is co-operation between all the interests in Cork, and in particular between the Chamber of Commerce and the trade union movement. One of the commitments given in this regard was that the IDA would discuss with the Cork Chamber of Commerce and the trade union representatives the establishment of a community self-help centre in Cork city on the lines of the walk-in centre operated by the IDA in Dublin.  I ask the Cork interests and the Cork Deputies to get the Chamber of Commerce and the trade union <Col N="2184" /> movement together on this.  Unfortunately, the IDA seem to have had difficulty in getting these two interests to meet with them to do something about this.  If Deputies opposite want to do something positive for Cork I suggest that they use their good offices, if such they have, to get these local interests working together with the IDA for the establishment of the walk-in centre.</P>

      <P>However, I am glad to be able to tell the House that the IDA have agreed to participate in a working group involving Cork Chamber of Commerce, the NBST, Cork Corporation, the county council and UCC to examine the feasibility of the establishment of a Cork business and technology centre as recommended in the study Cork Towards 800 &mdash; Crisis and Opportunity.  This study is being commissioned by the EC and was carried out originally by Conal Fanning. The IDA are acting on those important recommendations.</P>
      <P>These are the ways in which the problems of this city and county will be solved. They will be solved by people getting together and taking risks, going overseas and looking for markets.  I have led a number of trade missions in the recent past, two of them to the Middle East.  I hope to leave on another mission to Spain this year.  I want to see more Cork companies travelling overseas on export promotion.  If people in Cork want more jobs, the place to find them is not in Leinster House, Merrion Street or Kildare Street.  That is not where they will find viable jobs.  They will find viable jobs in the market place in France, Germany, Spain, the Middle East and Britain.</P>

      <P>Deputies opposite who are genuinely concerned about finding <Col N="2185" /> a solution to the employment problem should urge companies in Cork to become involved in exports.  If any Cork firm has found difficulty in obtaining representation on a trade mission I should like to know about it.  I am quite sure there has been none.  I challenge Deputies opposite to get more Cork firms involved in exporting.  I would urge Cork County Council and the local IDA development board, in conjunction with Córas Tráchtála, to set a target whereby within the next 12 months 100 Cork firms will be involved in exporting who are not doing so now.  That would be a realistic target which would involve positive action by the people concerned.</P>

      <P>We will not make progress unless people are prepared to take action of this kind.  I can assure Deputies that the IDA are continuing with my full support actively to promote Cork for foreign industry.  I am glad to say that in 1984 there were 107 first-time site visits for foreign industries to Cork.  These were industrial promoters from all over the world and negotiations are proceeding with some of them with a view to bringing new projects into being in Cork. That such a large number of foreign industrialists could be brought to Cork in a 12-month period indicates the commitment of the IDA to solving the problems of Cork, a commitment in which they have the full support of the Government. In addition to the 107 first-time visits there were return visits from a further 33 companies, giving a figure of approximately 140 firms brought from overseas to Cork by the IDA.  All of them were given an extensive programme, probably spending three or four days in Cork, visiting ten, 12 or 14 local industries, talking to all the agencies, discussing at considerable expense to the IDA all the possibilities for locating in Cork.  If that fact does not demonstrate that this Government are committed, together with the IDA and their agencies, to solving the problems of Cork and bringing additional <Col N="2186" /> industry to the city, I do not know what proof is required.  That is the most eloquent proof that could be produced.  I will repeat as many times as necessary to convince Deputies opposite that the problem will not be solved by the IDA, by the Government or by fatuous motions of the kind before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about the 25,000 unemployed if that is necessary. This Government have introduced more measures to help people who are unemployed to do something to help themselves than any previous Government. Was the enterprise allowance scheme introduced by the party opposite?  It was not.  Was the social employment scheme introduced by the party opposite?  It was not.  Was the team work scheme introduced by the party opposite?  It was not. All these are measures designed to help people who are unemployed to set up their own businesses, to improve their skills to enable them to apply for jobs. All these initiatives were thought up and implemented by this Government without any prompting or help or suggestions from the people opposite, who deal only in negative criticism.  We have to carry entirely alone the burden of producing positive ideas.  No positive ideas such as those I have mentioned in relation to the longterm unemployed are emanating from Deputies opposite tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government established the Cork Small Industries Board.  There were unemployment problems in Cork when the previous Government were in office but they would not trust local initiative and local IDA people to make decisions about Cork.  All these decisions had to <Col N="2187" /> be taken in Dublin while the previous Government were in office.  This Government have established a Cork Small Industries Board with business people from Cork sitting alongside IDA personnel making decisions about Cork projects and industrial expansion.  That is the way it should be.  We have confidence in the ability of Cork people to make decisions about their own future.  We did not demand that these issues be centralised in Dublin, as was the case before we came into office.  Since we established the Cork Small Industries Board a total of 111 projects involving additional employment and output have been approved by that board and the total investment figure arising from these 111 projects is £5.65 million.  The total number of jobs to be created as a result of these projects is 872, all a result of the devolution of responsibility to the people in Cork to run their own local Small Industries Board.  This clearly indicates an approach which is deserving of support from those who give the matter serious thought.</P>

In Macroom General Semi-Conductors Limited have embarked on the second phase of their project to manufacture voltage suppressors.</P>

      <P>So the Deputy has returned.  The National Development Corporation will be concerned first with improving the equity base of Irish manufacture. There are many Irish companies who must rely unduly on bank borrowing.  Unfortunately, when times are rough those companies find themselves in trouble because their bank managers are demanding interest on the nail. There is a need for more equity in Irish business, more risk capital and investors who will not be demanding a return until a company are making a profit.  One of the important jobs of the corporation will be to invest equity in Irish companies and thereby to leave them less reliant on the bank manager and to put them in a more healthy state.</P>
      <P>In doing this, the corporation will be operating alongside what the Government initiated by way of the business expansion scheme, a scheme that will be improved radically by means of the Finance Bill this year and whereby private individuals who have money to spare will be given a very generous tax incentive to put their money into manufacturing.  Too many people in this country regard the only profitable investment as being in the area of property, in houses, office blocks or some other non-productive form of asset.  By way of the expansion of the scheme we will be encouraging more people to put money to productive use while assuring them of the support and partnership of the National Development Corporation in improving the equity base of Irish industry and consequently its profits and export promotion.  Many good ideas for new jobs emanate from the universities and Cork can be proud to have one of the best universities in northern Europe.</P>

      <P>We do not hear the people involved in that centre wailing as the Deputies are wailing.  My point is that the people in UCC should avail of the opportunities that will be provided by the National Development Corporation. One of the mandates of the corporation will be specifically to invest in research based ideas, in ideas emanating from the universities, from the regional technical colleges and NIHE.  More of those people in academic life should become involved in enterprise, be prepared to take risks, to set up some businesses and to put their ideas &mdash; brilliant as they are &mdash; to the test in the market place.  There are great opportunities in Cork for such ventures. The people are there and the money is there so far as the Government are concerned to back ideas emanating from UCC.  If the Deputies opposite wish to do something productive and useful, I suggest that on their way back to Cork they invite the people concerned in UCC to avail of the opportunities that are being presented by the National Development Corporation but Deputies must do so quickly because Deputy Allen has an unparalleled record in promoting university based industrial activity.  Deputies opposite will need to be fast to keep up with him either in this or in any other endeavour on behalf of the people of Cork.</P>

      <P>It is very important that small companies have the opportunity of co-operating with other companies experiencing similar problems in regard to developing to their full potential.  It is not feasible for a ten or 15 man operation in, say, the clothing business to have a <Col N="2191" /> marketing manager in France and another in Britain; but if ten clothing companies in Cork or elsewhere, each employing from ten to 15 people, joined together, it would be possible for them to have a marketing manager not only in London or Paris but in Glasgow or Bonn as well.  By way of the National Development Corporation and of the group marketing scheme launched by Córas Tráchtála, a scheme that is being promoted aggressively at present, we will provide financial assistance to small firms to enable them to come together and consequently to succeed in ways in which they could not succeed individually. These ideas were not in existence when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  They have come into being only since this Government were returned to office.

      <P>The construction industry was the major employer in east Cork but that is no longer the case.  If we had not had the construction of the holiday resort at Trobolgan, very few builders would have been working over the last year.  The number of houses built has consistently fallen over the last five years, from 2,500 in 1981 to 1,300 in 1984. From speaking to some of the remaining builders, it is clear that fewer houses will be built in 1985.  Among those emigrating are masons, carpenters, electricians and welders, skilled workmen who are essential for building houses, bridges and factories in future.  If there is an improvement in the economy it will be <Col N="2194" /> very difficult to get these people to come home and we will be short of necessary skills in future.  It is a catch 22 situation because the creation of proper infrastructure is essential for the future of the country. The Government, despite their cries, are borrowing but are not spending on capital programmes.  They are merely spending to keep their own people happy.</P>

Farmers who make money spend it &mdash; despite what people say &mdash; on renovating old buildings and sheds and in putting up new sheds.  However, the farming side of business has been hit over the last year, especially and their income has fallen dramatically.  Consequently, the building programme of these people has been put aside until Fianna Fáil are returned to power.  The abolition of the farm modernisation scheme has also contributed to the decline in building.</P>

Eight farms have closed down over the last 12 months due to lack of work.  I was speaking to people recently whose businesses are barely staying afloat and they are afraid that they will not be able to keep going for much longer.  One of the biggest and most crippling burdens is employers' liability.  People are receiving bills this year which are 300 per cent greater than last year.</P>

      <P>We do not want a dictatorship, which has been the case over the last three years.  Cobh is one of the finest towns in the country but its soul is being embittered by the lack of employment opportunities available to the 1,100 people on the unemployment list there. For years Verolme Dockyard provided employment for over 1,000 people and they also trained apprentices for many crafts and trades.  Due to the shortsightedness of the Government, Verolme is no more and their invaluable machinery is going to waste.  This priceless facility should not be left rusting or sold for an unrealistic price.</P>
      <P>Maritime Industries used to build trawlers in Cobh but they went into receivership in December 1982 with the loss of a couple of hundred jobs.  There is now no shipbuilding or facilities for repair in the Cobh area, which is a shame not only for Cobh but for the country as a whole. We also have Irish Steel, but for how long?  They are labouring under massive electricity charges which may be the albatross which will destroy them.  It is common knowledge that a high powered delegation from the EC visited the plant very recently and one hopes that their report will be good.

East Cork Foods, a successful enterprise which employed between fulltime and seasonal staff about 400 people each year, now has a staff of around 20 people.  In November 1982, when Fine Gael were electioneering, <Col N="2196" /> they said that there would be no threat to the workforce of East Cork Foods. The Coalition Government were formed in December.

There has also been a complete change by this new company in relation to dealing with farmers.  The same acreage is being harvested, but this year only half the number of farmers are growing the same acreage of peas.  These are the big farmers and it is known that not many of them support the party on this side of the House.  IMP was a successful business for many years but ran into difficult times.  It was closed down for nine months.  It was reopened and work practices were changed. There was better control.  This is necessary if a company is to be successful.

      <P>Over the last three years the town has become a ghost town except for two months of the year.  Hundreds of people have emigrated out of this small town.  Youghal Carpets and Seafield Fabrics fell victim to the recession but Blackwater Cottons was a factory which could have been saved. Government consultants and outside consultants all agreed on that, but what happened?  There was no commitment from the Government to give the necessary guarantee for a small amount of money to enable the factory to continue trading. The closure of the factory is an indictment of the Fine Gael organisation, <Col N="2198" /> especially in east Cork.  A small fishing co-operative is operating in the town of Youghal which covers from Ardmore to Ballycotton.  But for this co-operative the fishermen would have no market for their fish.  At present the problem of a relatively small catch is threatening the existence and life of the co-operative but they came up against a wall when they approached the Government agencies for help.  Help should be given to them because the cost in the long run through unemployment benefit and assistance will be greater than the amount required now. A stitch in time saves nine.</P>

      <P>On the adjournment of the House Deputy Ahern has been given permission to raise the imminent closure of Dublin port and Deputy De Rossa has been given permission to raise the same matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  I will share my time with Deputy Brady and Deputy De Rossa.  I put down this question to ask the Minister for Communications to outline the present position relating to Dublin port and its subsidiary Dublin Cargo Handling in view of the danger of closure and if he would give an assurance that its future will be secured.  For a number of months there has been uncertainty about the position of the port and about what exactly will happen to Dublin Cargo Handling.  It is stated in the Horgan report that there were major management problems and that the future was at risk if there were not major changes.  The Minister confirmed that he was looking <Col N="2201" /> at the problem and made it quite clear that there was no further money for Dublin port and docks.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago there were a number of fairly sound rumours to the effect that the Minister had changed his mind in some way and that there was finance available for the port.  Over the past few days the Minister met the people concerned in the port and the unanimous opinion of those people is that there is a danger that the port could close this week, that the Minister sees no possibility of picking up the debts and will not put in any further money.  I gather that at one stage he said he would listen to suggestions but the unanimous view of the people he met is that there will be no action and that while his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour, have been discussing the position with him, a final decision will be made at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday morning.  The unanimous view of the people the Minister met so urgently, senior trade union people and people who have worked for their entire lives in the port, is that there is no future for the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put an end to the uncertainty and to give a clear indication of what the position is, where the negotiations stand and whether he is or is not in a position to make extra finance available. The arguments are straightforward and are well known to the Minister. Dublin port has been the premier port for generations.  It ran into management and other difficulties.  It has had industrial difficulties.  Nobody is disputing that.  The Marine Port and General Workers Union have tried over a long number of months to get industrial peace in the port.  With Dublin Cargo Handlers they tried to come to some agreement on working rosters, flexibility and redundancies. They have conceded as much as workers can possibly concede.  They stated that they will not concede on the right to strike, but they want a long period of industrial peace.  They have worked on a week on week off basis.  The numbers working in the port now are down to <Col N="2202" /> about 120.  This number is sufficient to deal with only one ship at a time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That number is inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 120 working at any one time.  They are losing business to other ports.  Their charges are far too high.  The other ports on the eastern coast are picking up the business.  Both sides claim that there are major management problems and worker problems.  There is an obligation on the Minister to put an end to the uncertainty and try to bring both sides together, rather than holding the stick over their heads and saying no further finance is available and that a major port can close down despite the sacrifices made by the workforce.  The contracts and the work being lost to the port cannot be picked up again.  People who traditionally used Dublin will go elsewhere, to Wexford or to the North.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would like to see a solution to the problem, but he has done absolutely nothing to try to resolve it.  People tend to say that the workforce in the Port and Docks Board are involved in industrial strife all the time.  They have not received the 24th wage round which was due on 7 March 1984.  They received nothing under the 25th round.  They have been on short working time for approximately 18 months.  They are now in the final stage of pay-related benefit.  A number of them are now on medical cards even though they are meant to be fully employed.  That shows the kind of money they had earned in the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>At the Dublin Chamber of Commerce the Minister said he was prepared to do everything possible to help the Dublin Port and Docks Board to resolve their problems but there was a limit to the assistance he could give.  It is generally felt that that statement led to much of the uncertainty and led to people pulling out of Dublin port and going elsewhere. It also caused the unhappiness in the port at present.  The meetings in recent days have substantiated the fears of the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister follow the Horgan <Col N="2203" /> report?  Will he ask the board to resign? Will he set up a commission?  Will he abolish Dublin Cargo Handlers?  Will he allow Dublin port, which has been there for generations serving the entire city and giving jobs in large parts of the inner city, to close on the basis that £8 million is not available?  I would prefer if the Minister could have spoken first and I could have answered him.  At least tonight we will hear what is happening. What is at stake is £8 million.  I am sure everyone will agree that £8 million would not break the Government in view of the fact that probably 600 to 700 jobs are directly or indirectly involved.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of the dockers or the stevedores.  It is the entire workforce. They do not know where they stand. While the Minister met one section the remaining sections feel they are being left out.  They will have no jobs if there are no ships coming into the port.  I ask the Minister to clear up this uncertainty and I maintain my right in the next day or two, after I hear what the Minister has to say, to follow up on the meetings I know are taking place tonight and tomorrow. The Minister waited for a number of months after he got the Horgan report to say anything about this matter.  I will be glad if the Minister makes a clear statement tonight so that we can follow some definite line in regard to the future of Dublin port.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I should like to endorse everything Deputy Ahern has said.  It is a great pity that the Horgan report, which was published during last year and went into great detail, has been lying on the shelves in Government Departments since then gathering dust. It was very evident from that report that urgent and emergency action was required as far as Dublin port is concerned. We all know that there have been industrial problems there for a number of years.  Unfortunately, these problems have accelerated since the new company, Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, were formed.  It must be remembered that when that company were formed in 1982, <Col N="2204" /> international recession was rampant. Indeed, at that time trade into Dublin port had been reduced by some 15 to 18 per cent.  One can assume that the management decision then to set up DCH was a disastrous one.  Unfortunately, I was a member of the board at the time and the role of members of the board representing local authorities &mdash; my role &mdash; was purely one of rubber stamping ministerial decisions.  That disastrous situation should not have been allowed to continue for any great length of time.</P>
      <P>All of this was made very evident in the Horgan report.  It is a great pity that the Minister did not act more swiftly in taking some action along the lines proposed in that report.  When DCH were formed they purchased debts in the region of £4.8 million and in order to take over 100 per cent holding of the company 18 months later they subsequently incurred additional debts &mdash; somewhere in the region of almost £2 million.  This was at a time when the company were losing something in the region of £250,000 per month.  What sense does that type of activity make?  No board, company or management could be condoned for such behaviour.  In addition, we had very bad industrial relations, running battles day in, day out, between management and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know and accept that dockers all over the world are rather sensitive types of people.  They need extra special handling.  Unfortunately, that has not been evident in Dublin port for the past number of years.  Rather than conciliatory measures and talks at that time, a dictatorial and doctrinaire approach was adopted by management towards the workers.  That is one of the sad reasons for the present situation.  Apart from the losses being incurred by the port at that time, further losses continued because national confidence in Dublin port was totally lost.  As a result, business has been transferred on a massive scale to smaller ports around the country which have far fewer facilities than Dublin but provide more stability as far as importers and exporters are concerned.  This lack of stability <Col N="2205" /> is one of the weaknesses which has existed in Dublin port for some time.  It has been claimed that Dublin port is in its present situation because of very serious and gross mismanagement.</P>
    <P>The Horgan report has no axe to grind with anybody.  It made this very clear and called on the board to resign and on the Minister to dismantle that board and appoint a commission to run the port until such time as more positive and definite arrangements were made for its future. At present, the workers understand that they may have only a few days of employment left in Dublin port.  That is a very serious situation for 240 workers.</P>

      <P>They are already on one week on and one week off.  I shall conclude because Deputy De Rossa wants to contribute.  In effect, there are 120 workers employed in the port.  As Deputy Ahern pointed out, they have not had any increase since 1984 and they are more than anxious to co-operate in every possible way with management to give greater assurance that Dublin port will continue into the future.  The Minister will know, being a Dublin man, that it is very important that Dublin port, which has played such a prominent part in trade here, should continue because Dublin is ideally situated geographically for business of that nature.  I call on the Minister here tonight to take immediate action to get Dublin port and DCH out of these grievious financial difficulties and ensure that the jobs of the workers will not be destroyed this week.</P>

This is not a situation of which the Minister or the Government can claim to have been unaware, or to have been kept in the dark about, as they claimed about Irish <Col N="2206" /> Shipping.  The port has been in trouble for very many years, as far back as the early seventies.  Dublin Cargo Handling Limited were set up to try to rationalise the stevedore situation in the port, unfortunately with disastrous results.  They have not carried out the revitalisation of the port, for which they were established. I agree with the Horgan report that this was due in large measure to under-capitalisation and management incompetence. There is obviously a need for immediate action.</P>
      <P>The Horgan report, commissioned last August, reported, I believe, in October and made very clear and unambiguous recommendations to the Minister for Labour and urged that these be pressed with his colleagues in Government for immediate action if a disaster were to be avoided.  Unfortunately, it would appear that that report and its recommendations have lain dormant and have remained since then on the Minister's desk and, presumably, with the respective people involved in the port.</P>
      <P>Anyone with the slightest knowledge of the situation of Dublin Port and Docks Board and Dublin Cargo Handling would realise that loans to the Dublin Port and Docks Board are not the answer to the problem of Dublin port.  They are not capable at present of servicing even their existing debts, never mind additional debts.  The Government must take on the responsibility, not only to the workers, directly involved in the handling of cargo, important as they are, but because the port that we are talking about is the port of the capital city of this State.  The Government have a responsibility to the people of this State to ensure that that port remains open for exports and imports and to ensure that a wide range of jobs, not just those in the port, are protected and are not endangered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a risk that the Government may avoid some of the recommendations of the Horgan report because they are opposing a semi-State company to replace Dublin Port and Docks Board.  It would be bad if the potential of the port were sacrificed because of the private enterprise bias which the Government <Col N="2207" /> obviously pursue.  It would also be a mistake to sacrifice the very important resources, in terms of land and so forth, under the control of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  It would be unfortunate if those resources were squandered for some short term financial gain &mdash; and I am speaking specifically about the site behind the Custom House.  It would not be an answer either to the development of the port or the protection and maintaining of it as a viable cargo handling resource simply to sell off the resources of the port.  There is more involved than simply keeping the port open.  There is the question of developing it as a location for industrial development.  It is important that that aspect be kept in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Cargo Handling Limited are in a very difficult situation.  The company are wholly owned by Dublin Port and Docks Board which have funded DCH and guaranteed borrowings by the company.  On 8 March I announced a package of measures approved by the Government to assist the board to overcome their problems but the board have recently informed me of difficulties which they have encountered in implementing those measures.  I am now examining the position as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clearly understood why Dublin port is in difficulties.  Apart from problems arising from the recession and changes in trade patterns the port has been losing business because users have lost confidence in the ability of the port to <Col N="2208" /> guarantee efficient and reliable service. The unfortunate record of interruptions and stoppages in recent years, coupled with unwarranted manning levels and other restrictive practices, has given Dublin port an unenviable reputation which has led to diversion of traffic to other ports.  Over 20,000 man-days have been lost in the past few years through stoppages, and I raise the question whether today's half-day stoppage and the publicity that will inevitably follow it is the kind of action that will enhance the future of the port and restore the confidence of users and potential users.</P>
    <P>I attach much importance to Dublin port.  I believe it can overcome its difficulties, but neither I nor the Government can save the port.  The future of the port lies in the hands of those directly involved, both at employer and worker level. It is important that those whose future jobs depend on the port demonstrate their commitment by providing the stability and continuity of service that is necessary. The imperative, the infrastructure and the potential, is there.  What is needed is confidence, but no measures that I or the Government can take can provide that.</P>
    <P>If the workforce are prepared to demonstrate their faith in the future by agreeing to more rational manning and work practices and by ensuring a prolonged period of industrial peace, then I believe confidence will be restored and trade will return.  If that stability is provided, I believe the circumstances will then exist that will justify a financial package to enable Dublin port to continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The remedy is in the hands of those directly concerned.  Both sides know the time scale available to them.  I shall deal now with some of the points raised by Opposition speakers. Deputy Ahern said that nothing had been done or said for two months and then he went on to quote what I said on 1 March at the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  He did not quote my statement of 8 March in <Col N="2209" /> which I announced the financial rescue package for the port but as I have said, that has not worked.  In his interjection just now Deputy Brady said that the result would be more redundancies. However, in his own contribution he spoke about the Horgan report and the implementation of that report.  This shows he has not read the Horgan report properly because that report spoke precisely about redundancies.  A very serious situation exists.  The Opposition recklessly came into this House today and spoke about bankruptcy and insolvency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The total number of persons engaged in the mining industry (coal mining and extraction and preparation of non-ferrous metal ores) together with the number of industrial workers is shown in the following table for September of each of the years 1979 to 1984.  The figures for the years 1979 to 1981 are obtained from the annual census of industrial production and the figures for the years 1982 to 1984 are estimated on the basis of the quarterly industrial inquiry. Those inquiries cover establishments with three or more persons engaged. Miners are not separately distinguished in these inquiries, but they constitute most of the industrial workers shown in the table.  The figures for September 1984 are the latest available.</P>

      <P>It would be a matter for any interests contemplating an arrangement with the Receiver for the re-opening of the Ballingarry mine to carry out a feasibility study of the project themselves, whether their approach was on a co-operative or other basis.  There are no funds available to my Department to finance such a study, but grants in respect of feasibility studies are provided by the Industrial Development Authority in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 23 April, any proposal by the workforce to operate the mine on a co-operative basis would have to be addressed to the Receiver of Flair Resources (Ireland) Limited in the first instance.  If any such proposal is put to me by the Receiver I will give it due consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 553, 554 and 555 together.  No specific direction is given to ambassadors abroad in regard to receptions on St. Patrick's Day.  It is for each ambassador, having regard particularly to local custom and entertainment priorities, to decide what form his official representation should take over the whole year.</P>
      <P>Representation and foreign service allowances which are paid to officers posted abroad are intended to cover the additional cost arising from the posting abroad as well as the costs of official representation of which entertainment forms a part.  These allowances are also intended to cater for currency fluctuations. The allowances at present payable in Copenhagen are £19,195 for an ambassador, £15,185 for a first secretary and £10,165 for a third secretary (married rate in each case).</P>
      <P>No reception was given in Copenhagen because in the opinion of the ambassador, large national receptions are no longer the normal practice in Copenhagen and in his view the costs involved could be used to greater advantage in higher priority areas of the embassy representational programme.</P>

    <P>Grants for water and sewerage cannot be allowed because a previous grant was paid in respect of similar works in 1976 and there is a ten year waiting period specified in the regulations.  Neither can a bathroom grant be allowed because the particular works have already been grant <Col N="1975" /> aided by the local authority under the disabled persons grant scheme.  The maximum grant of £600 in respect of the carrying out of necessary repairs to the basic fabric of the house was paid in this case on 18 January 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who was made redundant last June would not have been entitled to a retirement pension from my Department until reaching 65 years of age.  However, on 14 January 1985 on being certified medically as permanently unfit for work he became entitled to a pension on ill-health grounds.  I understand that the necessary procedures under the relevant regulations <Col N="1992" /> have now been completed and that payment of pension will commence shortly.  I regret that due to a misunderstanding of the situation of the position regarding payment of pension in this particular case was incorrectly stated in the reply to a question by the Deputy on 23 October 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most trout fisheries in the country have a pike population.  The fisheries boards operate on-going pike control programmes in these fisheries and such programmes have been implemented in all the principal trout fisheries including the midland and western lakes.</P>
      <P>The types of gear used in pike control are gill nets, long lines, wire traps and trawl nets.</P>
      <P>I understand that the control programmes have been reasonably successful in reducing pike stocks and improving trout fishing.  It is not the practice to put trout into pike infested waters.  In lakes where the trout fishery is being developed, restocking with trout is combined with a pike reduction programme.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 1 February 1985 and submitted a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment to the inspector of taxes on 5 March 1985.  The figure for tax deducted, as shown on the form P.45 (cessation certificate), which was submitted by the taxpayer in support of his claim, appears on the basis of the figure for earnings shown on the form and the amount of the tax-free allowances granted to the taxpayer for 1984-85, to have been incorrectly computed by the employer.  The inspector wrote to the former employer on 5 March 1985 for clarification of the position and again by way of reminder, on 25 April 1985.  As soon as the employer clarifies the figures for pay and tax deducted on the relevant form P.45, the taxpayer's liability for 1984-85 will be reviewed and any tax found to have been overpaid will be refunded to him.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes, a refund of tax is not due in this case.  A provisional review of the liability of the taxpayer's husband for 1980-81 (the latest year in which the taxpayer is recorded as having been in employment) to take account of the combined income of both spouses, indicates that there was a very small underpayment of tax for that year which it would be uneconomic to collect.</P>
      <P>The inspector has been unable to trace receipt of a claim for repayment of tax from the taxpayer for 1981-82 or for any subsequent year.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that a refund of tax is not due in this case.  Reviews of the taxpayer's liabilities for the years 1979-80 to 1983-84, recently completed, have indicated that a net underpayment of tax has arisen for those years.  Details of these reviews will be sent to the taxpayer in the near future. The taxpayer will also be requested by the inspector to supply certain additional information which is required for the purpose of having his tax position for 1984-85 and 1985-86 brought up-to-date.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on the basis of the information available to the inspector of taxes regarding the amount of the taxpayer's estimated income for 1985-86 he is not entitled to exemption from income tax for that year.  However, as his estimated income is only slightly in excess of the relevant exemption limit, he has been granted a measure of marginal relief subject to review after 5 April 1986.  An amended certificate of taxfree allowances incorporating this relief was issued to him on 24 April 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> On 18 April 1985, a review of the taxpayer's 1984-85 income tax liability was carried out and a cheque in settlement of the refund due will be issued to him as soon as possible.  An examination of his tax position for the year 1983-84 has indicated that a refund is not due for that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that according to the information available to the inspector of taxes the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension and a social welfare invalidity pension both of which are chargeable to income tax.  The social welfare pension is paid gross and it is standard practice in such cases to collect the tax attributable to it by restricting the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE which are set against the retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The amount of the net tax free allowance for 1985-86 is lower than that for 1984-85 because the restriction made for 1984-85 was under-estimated.  As the taxpayer has not completed a return of income since 1980 the inspector will now issue a form to him for completion.  On receipt of the form, duly completed, the taxpayer's tax free allowances for 1985-86 will be amended as necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil and Public Services Staff Union took industrial action in the benefits section of my Department with effect from Friday 12 April.  The action took the form of refusing to answer telephone calls from members of the public or to provide a telephone service between the benefits section and the Department's information and public offices.  The union concerned escalated their action from Monday 29 April.  From that date the staff have refused to answer any telephones, including all direct lines, in the benefits section.  The only exception to this concerns telephones in a sub-section that deals with the health board for supplementary welfare allowance purposes. In addition, they are also refusing to process any correspondence except that coming direct from members of the public.</P>
      <P>The most immediate effect of the action taken is that claimants cannot now take what is often the most appropriate and effective step in pursuing an inquiry in relation to problems with their claims, that is, discuss the matter by telephone with the staff involved in dealing with the claim.  Representations on behalf of claimants by public representatives and community welfare workers etc. cannot be dealt with either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> The dispute has arisen over the numbers of staff required to administer the work of the section.  The difficulties in this respect have resulted from constraints imposed arising from Government policy in relation to overall staffing numbers in the public service.  Discussions to resolve the dispute have taken place and further efforts to secure a satisfactory resolution of the problem are being pursued.</P>

Payment which included pay-related benefit from 10 April was made at the maximum personal rate pending receipt of particulars of his dependants.

Benefit was discontinued from 17 January 1985 after he was examined by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was not then incapable of work.</P>

The person concerned was engaged in intermittent employment over a period of time and claimed unemployment benefit for the periods she was not working.  Following inquiries to establish whether she fulfilled the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit her claim of 3 January 1985 was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work other than the employment in which she was intermittently engaged.</P>

The claim of the person concerned was disallowed because it was held that she did not satisfy this condition. The claimant was notified to this effect on 23 July 1982.  She indicated that she wished to appeal against the decision but failed to pursue her appeal at that time.</P>

      <P>A claim was received on 10 April 1985 from the person concerned but in view of the fact that the date of desertion was given as 3 April 1985 her claim could not be accepted.

His claim was disallowed on the grounds that he was not not genuinely trying to find work and accordingly he was not available for employment.  He appealed against the disallowance and his case has been referred to an appeals officer for consideration.  Arrangements are being made to have his case heard at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 14 February 1985, following an examination by a medical referee who considered him <Col N="2034" /> to be capable of work.

      <P>The person concerned was paid a total of 52 weeks disability from 25 February 1984 to 22 February 1985. Payment was temporarily suspended from that date as inquiries into his insurance record were necessary to establish if he was entitled to payment of futher benefit.

      <P>The case referred to concerned a person who having been found capable of work and had his disability benefit stopped subsequently claimed unemployment benefit but was not then allowed to prove unemployment retrospectively from the date of disallowance <Col N="2040" /> for disability benefit.  Following representations by the Ombudsman on his behalf, however, retrospective signing was allowed in his case.</P>
      <P>Where a person is disallowed for disability benefit he is informed in the normal course that, if he is capable of and available for work, he should apply as soon as possible for unemployment benefit or assistance.  If he makes a claim to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance within a week or so of the issue of the disallowance notification he is allowed to prove unemployment retrospectively from the date of disallowance for disability benefit.  Where, however, the delay in claiming is longer than a week, retrospection is not normally allowed unless the person concerned can show that special circumstances applied. In the case referred to it emerged in the course of the Ombudsman's investigations that special circumstances existed and retrospective signing was justified.  It is not proposed to make any changes in the general arrangements for situations of this kind as present arrangements are considered reasonable.</P>

      <P>The person concerned appealed against the disallowance of his <Col N="2045" /> unemployment assistance claim and arising from contentions raised in the appeal the case was returned for further inquiries. When the inquiries were completed the case was submitted to an appeals officer.  The appeals officer assessed his means at £105 a week derived from profit from his holding and from the weekly value of capital.  He is therefore entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £6.40 being the appropriate rate payable £111.40 less means £105. He was notified of the appeals officer's decision and all arrears of unemployment assistance due have been paid.  Further weekly payments are being made as they become due.</P>

      <P>He was however paid unemployment assistance pending the completion of inquiries to ascertain the precise date of his entry into insurance for the purpose of ascertaining his entitlement to pre-entry credited contributions.  Following the completion of these inquiries his contribution record was clarified and his unemployment benefit claim was allowed at £34.80 weekly with effect from 7 June 1984.  Adjusting arrears less the amount of unemployment assistance advanced to him were paid on 13 September 1984 and weekly payments followed as they became due.</P>
      <P>He is at present in receipt of a combined weekly payment of £34.10 representing flat rate unemployment benefit £32.50 and pay-related benefit at £1.60.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable in place of disability benefit to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 17 December 1984.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia</i>, have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year. Therefore, the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 17 December 1985.  The person concerned has been transferred to the monthly system of certification in connection with his disability benefit claim.  He will be examined by a medical referee on 9 May 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from this <Col N="2059" /> Department for the period 15 January 1965 to 31 March 1973.  This benefit was paid in accordance with the 1960 Reciprocal Arrangement between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  This arrangement provided that in the case of persons who moved between the United Kingdom and Ireland benefit was paid by the country of residence using the insurance record in the other country, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The EC Regulations on Social Security came into force on 1 April 1973 and from this date the Reciprocal Arrangement no longer applied to persons covered by the EC Regulations.  These Regulations provide that responsibility for a claim to benefit rests with the country under whose legislation the claimant was last insurably employed.  Therefore, the claim of the person concerned was transferred to the UK authorities as from 1 April 1973 and payment of invalidity benefit has been made from the Department of Health and Social Security since that date.  It is not possible in view of the provisions of the EC Regulations in the matter, to pay Irish invalidity pension instead of British invalidity benefit to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 4 March 1985 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an occupational accident on 3 March 1985.  Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was allowed disability benefit on an interim basis from 7 March, the fourth day of incapacity and pay-related benefit from 26 March the 19th day of incapacity.  The disability benefit including increases in respect of his wife and four dependent children amounted to £96.55 a week. Pay-related benefit was paid at the rate of £3.47 which brought the combined payments <Col N="2060" /> to the limit payable of 75 per cent of his reckonable earnings in the relevant tax year 1983-84.</P>
      <P>On completion of investigations, injury benefit was allowed from 4 March first day of incapacity.  Injury benefit is limited to the claimant's weekly earnings at the time of the accident.  The rate of injury benefit payable was therefore, limited to £108.25 a week.  This however exceeded the limit of 75 per cent of his reckonable weekly earnings for pay-related benefit purposes in the relevant tax year and accordingly pay-related benefit was not payable.  An adjusting payment in respect of injury benefit over and above the disability and pay-related benefit already paid has been issued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned exhausted his title to unemployment benefit on 13 November 1984 when he received 390 days benefit.  He engaged in intermittent employment after the date on which he received unemployment benefit for 156 days but following an investigation of the insurability of that employment it was decided that he was not employed in employment which was insurable at a contribution class which provided cover against unemployment.  He was advised of the decision in his case and of his right to appeal against the decision of the deciding officer.  He was paid unemployment assistance from 14 November 1984 to 19 January, 1985 after which he ceased to sign as unemployed.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 11 March 1985 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have him examined by a different medical referee at an early date.  His entitlement to further payment of disability benefit will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report following this examination.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment benefit from 11 March 1985 and payment was authorised by the employment exchange. He refused to accept payment on the grounds that it might prejudice his disability benefit claim.  Supplementary welfare allowance was advanced to him for the period 11 March to 23 March 1985 while the position in relation to his unemployment benefit claim was being clarified; however, it cannot continue to be advanced to him while he is entitled to payment of unemployment benefit.  His claiming unemployment benefit pending further medical examination will not prejudice his claim to disability benefit should he be found to be incapable of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 719 and 720 together.</P>
      <P>The particulars sought in the question, in so far as they are available, are given in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures for overtime do not take account of the many developments that have occurred in improving the effectiveness of the force e.g. in relation to equipment, new technology, new rostering systems etc.  Moreover, since the Government assumed office, the strength of the force has been increased by about 750 members.  Accordingly, while the <Col N="2082" /> number of hours overtime worked has decreased, it does not follow that there has been any reduction in the effective level of policing &mdash; and I do not accept that this is the case.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 720, the Garda authorities report that records of the total number of hours worked by members of the force are only available in respect of each division of the Dublin Metropolitan area and that to calculate the hours worked at district level would involve diverting Garda manpower from other more pressing duties.</P>
