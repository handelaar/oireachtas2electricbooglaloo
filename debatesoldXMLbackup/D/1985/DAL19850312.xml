      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if a decision has been made on the location for the new customs clearance station at the Dundalk-Newry Border.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>A site for a new customs road station has been purchased at Carrickcarnan adjacent to the existing frontier post.  However, in view of the possible construction of a new North-South motorway the scale of the proposed development on the site at Carrickcarnan is being re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that the customs station will be built on that site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is a complicating factor in this arising from the route of the new North-South motorway.  We will have to look at the longer term implications of that for the siting of the customs post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a possibility that the station will not be built on that site having <Col N="1970" /> regard to the possible route of the North-South motorway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say to the Deputy, and I am sure he will agree with me, is that there is general agreement on the need to move the station from the Newry road site.  That is the first priority and that will move to Carrickcarnan.  That is the immediate change that will be made.  The longer term implications of the routing of the motorway will have to be considered and it is for that reason that I said that the scale of the development at Carrickcarnan will have to be reviewed in the light of the line of the new road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the work on the building of the station commence before work on the motorway is completed or, perhaps, before it starts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I said, the first priority is to move the station from its present location in Dundalk out to Carrickcarnan. Longer term aspects will have to be reviewed in the light of the decision which has now been taken on the line of the new road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>Maintenance of completed coast protection schemes is being undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Coast Protection Act, 1963.  There is no coast protection scheme under construction at present.</P>
      <P>There were eight full-time employees and ten temporary employees engaged on coast protection works in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has suffered a lot from coast erosion.  Has any allocation been made this year for coast protection work?  It would seem rather strange if no allocation were made, in view of the seriousness of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be a different question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is no new scheme of works for this year. As the Deputy is aware from the debate on the national plan, the suspension of coast protection work for the duration of that plan refers only to the execution of new schemes under the Coast Protection Act of 1963.  The maintenance of the <Col N="1972" /> present schemes goes on and there are a number of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an indication when any new schemes will be undertaken?  Would it be next year or at what time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparation of present schemes is not suspended.  It has been spelt out in the national plan that there will be no new schemes during that three years.  The planning for the present schemes can continue.  I am sure that the Deputy is well aware that this involves protracted preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>

      <P>An engineering survey of the Lee (Tralee) catchment area has been carried out as a prerequisite to the formulation of a comprehensive drainage scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  However, pending the outcome of the review of arterial drainage policy and having regard to the number of schemes which precede it on the priority list of minor catchments drawn up for possible examination under the Act, I cannot say when a scheme for the Lee catchment might commence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of land is being flooded by the River Lee in the Tralee area.  We have to differentiate between this River Lee and the River Lee in Cork. <Col N="1973" /> Could the Minister give any indication of when that Tralee drainage scheme will start?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme is No. 19 on the list and the Deputy is aware of that.  A survey has been carried out. There are many other schemes which have not got to the stage of a survey having been carried out, but I could not, at this time, give any undertaking of when this scheme might start.</P>

      <P>The question of allocating funds in respect of projects undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works, but paid for from the Votes of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Roinn na Gaeltachta, is a matter for those Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not that information.  Works are being undertaken at present for other Departments in Mayo.  For instance, in Killala there is steel sheet piling on the pier, which are ancillary works; on the Bone Rock the provision of a lighted beacon; on Inch Island the removal of a silt bar; and in Belderg the provision of a landing platform. These works are being carried out for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and are funded by them.  I cannot discuss what their estimate might be.  The works sponsored by Roinn na Gaeltachta are at Rinroe, namely the extension of the pier there.  I am not able to give the allocation for these projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans for drainage of the River Nanny, which formed part of the Corrib-Clare drainage scheme, would have to be re-designed and costed to take account of conditions obtaining in the area at present.  All arterial drainage planning has been halted by Government direction pending the outcome of a review of arterial drainage policy.  Accordingly, progress on proposals to drain the Nanny must await a Government decision on the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why this scheme is being re-designed when there are just a few miles of the river to be drained.  This scheme was started 25 years ago.  Can the Minister give an undertaking now that this small portion of the river will be completed and that work will start immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy said is correct to an extent.  The Nanny was included in the scheme sanctioned by the Minister for Finance but, because of the possibility of silt damage to the Tuam waterworks the work did not go ahead. There were lengthy discussions with the county council.  In July of last year it was agreed that the Commissioners of Public Works could proceed with the outstanding drainage work.  There are other factors which might alter the design.  The re-exhibition of the proposed works in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act would be necessary to update the design and to formulate an estimate of the cost of the scheme to take account of the present conditions on the ground.  For that reason it will be necessary to re-design much of the scheme.  I am not suggesting that it will be a full design.  As I said, all arterial drainage planning has been suspended pending the outcome of a review of arterial drainage policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Office of Public Works and the council agree that it is feasible to carry out this work, will the Minister arrange for discussions to take place immediately between his office and the council to have <Col N="1977" /> this scheme completed as soon as possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The council have said we can go ahead with the remainder of the drainage.  There has to be a re-design because of certain factors which did not arise originally.  By Government order the planning of schemes has been stopped until the review is considered.  It is coming to the Government soon from the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The existing facilities for access by the disabled to Leinster House were provided in 1978.  Until late last year the Office of Public Works had not received any request from the Leinster House authorities for the provision of additional facilities.  However, following a request in November 1984 from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, a preliminary survey on the feasibility of providing access for the disabled throughout the Leinster House complex has now been completed and has been submitted to the committee for consideration.  Further instructions from the committee are awaited.</P>

      <P>One of the houses was last occupied on 13 November 1973 and the other on 17 November 1977. These houses were retained on the instructions of the Department of Justice for possible use as a Garda station in the event of an alternative site for a new station not being secured in the area. However, a more suitable site for the new station is being considered and on the instructions of the Department, the Commissioners of Public Works are now arranging to dispose of the houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister justify the fact that houses that were relatively newly built &mdash; I am sure the Minister has on his file the date on which they were built &mdash; remained vacant, one since 13 November 1973, almost 12 years, and the other has been vacant since 1977, almost eight years?  I am sure the Minister is aware that there have been numerous inquiries from persons in the locality who were willing to either buy or rent the houses in that period.  Therefore how can the Minister justify the fact that those houses were left vacant for so long?  Furthermore, is he aware that both are at present rat infested?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice advised the Commissioners of Public Works in June 1984 that they were no longer required.  After that the Department of Justice had to circularise all other Departments to ascertain whether they might be required by them. That refers to all property and accommodation they have on hand.  No Government Department expressed an interest <Col N="1982" /> and, as the properties are now surplus to State requirements it is proposed to dispose of them.  As the purchase of the new site for a Garda station has not been finalised we were not rushing.  We only received instructions during 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental question arises here of State property and the income that might be derived from it. The Minister tells us now that 11 years after one of these houses remained vacant his Department were informed by the Department of Justice that they had no further interest in them.  That was in June 1984.  Furthermore, the Minister said that there is an obligation on him to ask all other Departments if they have any use for the houses.  At a time when we all recognise that finance is scarce, particularly for the public service, surely there must be some way of expediting the sale of these houses in order to ensure that the maximum income will be derived from them?  It is totally unjustified that they remained vacant for so long.  Surely they should have been let to somebody if it was necessary to keep them.  Now that the Minister has received word back from the other Departments that they have no further use for the houses what has he done to ensure their expeditious disposal? For example, has he offered them to Monaghan County Council?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the question to apply to that part of the industry which supplies drugs and medicines to the health services.  Since 95 per cent of these drugs are imported the basic prices, and consequently the level of profit for the parent companies, are determined outside our jurisdiction.  We can, and do, control prices here by relating them to those charged in the United Kingdom, which is the source of 85 per cent of our drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control of prices generally is a matter for the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism on the <Col N="1984" /> advice of the National Prices Commission. The prices of drugs and medicines for the health services are governed by an agreement between the Department of Health and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.</P>
    <P>The current agreement between the Department and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries provides for a direct relationship between trade prices here and in the UK.  No company may charge more than 15 per cent in excess of UK price and the average industry-wide differential may not exceed 7½ per cent over UK trade prices, allowances being made for the currency differentials.  In addition, discounts are provided for both hospital and GMS purchases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospect has been examined on a number of occasions in the past two and a half years but there are considerable difficulties in that regard because of the multiplicity of brand and generic drugs used.  Furthermore, most of the pharmaceutical companies operating here are branches of the large multinationals and 95 per cent of our drugs are imported through these companies.  The price of generics within the Republic is not significantly cheaper than the imported brand products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of great benefit <Col N="1985" /> to this country that the British Government have significantly reduced the price of drugs and the profits of drug companies in the UK.  From August to December 1983 the UK controls cut the price of drugs by £25 million and further reductions were introduced by the UK Government which will effect a saving of £60 million this year and £100 million in 1986. We benefit from the reductions which the British Government have imposed on UK manufacturing companies and the price of drugs has dropped considerably. I estimate that, since 1983, we saved up to £25 million in payments for drugs.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I are examining this prospect within the framework of a national development corporation.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 20 together. The maternity unit at Bantry General Hospital closed on 16 April 1983.  The question of the provision of out-patient maternity services at the hospital is a present the subject of discussion between <Col N="1987" /> the Southern Health Board and the Irish-Medical Organisation.  I am keeping the matter under review.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recent decision of the Surpeme Court, I am at present examining its implications and would not propose commenting on it in relation to Bantry Hospital until I have completed that examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the maternity unit in Bantry closed in April 1983.  Not alone are the people of west Cork deprived of a maternity unit but they are also without an ante-natal out-patient service.  Does the Minister now accept that it was wrong to close the maternity unit in Bantry and to leave the people of south west Cork, particularly those in Castletownbere, 100 miles from their nearest maternity unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Up to the end of 1982, there were 13 maternity beds in the hospital and the number was reduced to seven beds as part of the drive by the Southern Health Board to control expenditure.  In 1982 there were 191 births, three or four per week, and seven beds were quite sufficient to cope with the workload.  Contrary to popular belief, there has never been a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist at the hospital in Bantry.  They used to employ a consultant physician who did maternity work but, when he became ill in February 1983, he was unable to provide a service and the Southern Health Board decided not to seek the appointment of a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist.  Indeed, Comhairle na nOspidéal or I would not have given approval for such an appointment because he would not have enough work in the delivery of three or four births a week.  He would spend most of his time playing golf and enjoying the excellent boating facilities of west Cork. Since 1983 there has been no maternity service in the hospital, apart from emergency cases which are admitted there. Since then, I have been endeavouring to get the agreement of the Irish Medical Organisation to provide an effective <Col N="1988" /> maternity out-patient clinic in the hospital with consultants from other hospitals attending.  I am still hopeful that I will get the agreement of the consultants to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister accepts that Comhairle na nOspidéal would sanction the appointment of a consultant to Bantry hospital?  They always made the case that Bantry was an exception and would need an obstetrician as there are so many people in the area who are isolated from hospital services generally.  Even the old Fitzgerald report made an exception of Bantry because the people are so far removed from essential services.  Would the Minister accept that if he appointed an obstetrician to this hospital, the number of deliveries there would increase because more women would opt to have their babies at that hospital?  This has been the case in every other instance in which an obstetrician was appointed to a local hospital.  Would the Minister accept also that there are up to 700 births each year in the south west Cork area, some of these in Cork city, some in Skibbereen and some in Tralee and that if Bantry hospital were given the opportunity to prove that they could operate a viable maternity unit, the Minister by appointing an obstetrician to the hospital would be providing an essential service for the people of south west Cork?  It is highly unlikely, for many good and legitimate reasons, that there will not be a consultant-based out-patient maternity facility in Bantry hospital because a consultant obstetrician would not be prepared to travel the 50 miles journey to provide that type of out-patient facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultants generally in the Cork city area maintain that there is no reason medically for the provision of out-patient clinics at Bantry. They maintain also that it is not in accordance with their common contract that they should be obliged to travel to Bantry from Cork.  The matter is currently the subject of dispute and interpretation but I am hopeful that it will be resolved in a <Col N="1989" /> suitable way.  However, I make the point strongly to the people of west Cork that babies should be delivered in a fully staffed unit where there is a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist present and preferably where there is a paediatric consultant available close by.  It is not possible to have that type of unit unless there are between 1,500 and 2,000 children born in a hospital each year.  There never has been a consultant obstetrician at Bantry hospital.  Children born there were delivered by the physician but when he became ill he was unable to continue with that aspect of the work.  The position is that the women of Dunmanway, Bandon and further up towards Cork city go to the city for the delivery of their babies just as people from Arklow, for instance, which is 40 miles from here, come to the general hospitals in Dublin. Likewise people from Athy in south Kildare travel to hospitals in Dublin.  Admittedly there is a question of distance but I am anxious that through the health boards we provide facilities for emergencies and for out-patient use.  I am continuing that work.  Deputies from south west Cork from both parties have been in touch with me regularly in connection with facilities at Bantry.  The Leader of the Opposition has promised that, if returned to office, he would establish a full scale unit at Bantry.  In other words, he would be prepared to spend up to £750,000 on a facility that would not be of benefit to the women of west Cork, a facility that would be limited in scope and for which the search for a consultant gynaecologist-obstetrician would hardly be successful because of there not being sufficient work.  I doubt if we would succeed in finding someone to take the job.</P>

      <P>Would it not be well for the Minister to come clean on this matter, to say that he has no intention of re-opening a maternity unit at Bantry, and that it would be impossible to provide out-patient facilities there?  Is the Minister not proceeding with all haste to close more surgical wards at Bantry hospital? It will be only a matter of time before the <Col N="1990" /> entire staff of the hospital are out playing golf at Glengarriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter must be put in perspective.  When I assumed office, there were seven maternity beds at that hospital.  In addition there were 37 medical beds there.  I have not made any decision in regard to those and neither have I made any decision in regard to the 63 surgical beds there.  A reduction in the number of beds, in accordance with the requirements of the area, would be a matter for the Southern Health Board.  There are also 16 children's beds in the hospital.  All I am saying is that on the basis of the best professional advice available to me in the Department of Health, I cannot agree to the provision of in-patient maternity services of a consultant nature at Bantry hospital.  The hospital never had such a service and would not have a sufficient number of patients to enable the provision of such facility.  The average number of births in the area is from 150 to 190 per year.  It would not be possible to provide a maternity unit with qualified maternity nursing staff and a consultant obstetrician for a unit in which there would be only two or three births per week.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there are at least 800 births annually in the south-west Cork area, that the area has never had an obstetrician but that if one were appointed, most of the women would opt to have their babies at Bantry hospital?  I would agree that the ideal is that a woman have her baby in a fully staffed unit, but what the Minister is asking women from towns such as Castletownbere to do in order to be delivered of their babies is to travel a distance comparable with the distance from Belfast to Dublin or from Nenagh to Dublin.  A woman from Belfast would hardly be asked to go to Dublin to have her baby on the basis that in Dublin there was a unit with three consultant obstetricians.</P>

Despite the enormous level of playing of politics locally we must be honest on this issue.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there will be a serious drop in the level of services this year as a result of the reduced allocation to the Southern Health Board and that perhaps also the quality of care will be lessened?  This is the position also of the other health boards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I know this area very well and I do not accept what the Deputy says.  The allocation for the Southern Health Board for this year is £137.62 million.  This includes provision for the full year's expenditure on the new hospital in Tralee.  The corresponding allocation for 1984 was £127.75 million so that there is an increase this year of nearly £10 million.  There is no question of a reduction in the level of services in Cork or Kerry.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if one were to have an accident in that region, one would almost have a nervous breakdown in trying to decide which hospital to go to because there are so many of them.  They are all open and flourishing and there are no cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The number of staff employed by the Southern Health Board has increased by 300 in the past 12 months because of the opening of the Tralee hospital at a cost of £3 million or £4 million.

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the deep and widespread anxiety that exists in the west of Ireland following the recent spate of attacks on elderly people; and if he will make a statement on the matter in which his Department and the Garda intend to deal with this critical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): At the outset I wish to reiterate what I said in the statement I made on this matter yesterday, that is, that I view these latest attacks on elderly people with great concern.  All of us have been shocked at the incident at the weekend involving the burning down of the home of a brother and sister in Mayo.  I wish to extend my sympathy to the people involved on the ordeal they have suffered.</P>
      <P>People may say that sympathy alone is not enough in the present situation and they would be right.  More than that is needed and much more is being done. There is every reason to hope that what is being done will achieve results quickly. It goes without saying that the Garda are determined to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.  They believe they know the identity of some of those involved in a number of recent attacks and they are following a definite line of inquiry.  They also have information relating to the makes and registration numbers of the vehicles suspected of being involved in some of the crimes.  For obvious reasons I cannot say more about that at present except that I am satisfied everything possible is being done by the Garda to detect and apprehend those responsible and to bring them to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the House is entitled to some factual information about what is happening on the ground.  For the past two weeks a special unit has been operating in the Galway area under a detective inspector from the Technical Bureau. This unit has been assisting local gardaí in co-ordinating their efforts to locate these criminals.  Yesterday another special detective unit was dispatched to Sligo to perform similar functions there. This morning a deputy commissioner of <Col N="1996" /> the Garda Síochána who is in overall charge of the investigations held a special conference with local divisional chief superintendents to review Garda strategy. I understand immediate steps are being taken to intensify Garda efforts and that additional manpower is being devoted to the investigation by drafting in gardaí from neighbouring divisions and also by redeploying existing resources in the areas affected.</P>
    <P>The Garda are also carrying out an urgent reappraisal of preventive measures to improve protection for elderly people who are living in isolated areas and who may be at risk.  In this regard, the community alert project sponsored by Muintir na Tire is being assessed.  The Garda have already been working in close co-operation with local community groups and have been advising those groups and individuals on security measures. The evidence available suggests that the advice given to people not to keep large sums of money in their homes is having an effect, although of course I cannot say if it had any relevance to the fact that in the most recent attacks very little cash appears to have been stolen.</P>
    <P>Arising out of reports of certain statements by some Opposition Deputies, particularly Deputy Woods in Fianna Fáil, I want to make it quite clear to the House that I regard the investigation of those crimes as a matter for the Garda Síochána.  I have every confidence that a solution to the problems is within the competence of the force.  I do not believe there is any role the Army can usefully play at this stage.  For example, there is no evidence to suggest that arms or military-style tactics are being used by the criminals or that there is a dimension to it that requires military intervention.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that a ground-to-air surveillance system should be set up and that Knock airport should be used as part of the system to detect the thugs who are terrorising elderly, defenceless people.  Practically all the attacks have taken place during the hours of darkness and obviously ground-to-air surveillance could not operate during those hours. <Col N="1997" /> The Deputy also called for the re-establishment of the divisional task force. Every time there is some outrage this proposition is brought forward, despite the fact that on more than one occasion I have dealt comprehensively with the reasons the commissioner decided to reorganise these units and if anyone wishes to check, I would refer in particular to a statement I made in the House on 24 January 1984.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that those units were very wasteful of scarce Garda resources, that they were structured in such a way as to create serious problems of accountability for their activities and it is widely acknowledged in the local managerial structures of the force that the personnel involved as reorganised in the normal Garda command structure are now much more effective in tackling crime.  To be specific, these views are shared by the overwhelming majority, if not all, the Garda divisional officers throughout the force, those who have been appointed by the Government of the day to be primarily responsible for the local deployment of resources for the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, let me recall that the task force were set up and equipped and operated in a way which was then considered to be the most effective way of dealing with the special threats posed by armed mobile terrorists operating in military style.  There is no suggestion that these features are present in the case we are dealing with here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also referred to overtime restrictions and the closing of rural stations.  The simple but central fact is that financial considerations are not, and are not being allowed to restrict in any way the effectiveness of the Garda operations in relation to these crimes.  I want that to be clearly understood.  It is also untrue to say that rural stations are being closed.  The Deputy is under a misapprehension because it is not just a matter of his being wrong in suggesting that stations are being closed in rural Ireland; in fact no rural station has been closed for years past, certainly not since I became Minister or over the last decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> Finally, I think it is important to say that the operational control of the Garda Síochána is vested in the commissioner of the force and that while I am glad to answer the House for the exercise of my functions, I could not agree to be pushed, for reasons of understandable concern for serious crime or otherwise, into improper and potentially very damaging interference with the functions of the commissioner. The problem will, I have no doubt, be solved and the Garda are in the process of solving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say there will be no further closure of rural stations.  Would he give the House an assurance that where possible gardaí will be resident on a full time basis in their appointed areas?  What are his comments in relation to the completion of the scheme for the proper equipping of the Garda from a mobility and communications point of view?  In relation to the experiments at present being carried out in centralised policing in south Mayo where crimes as serious as murder have been committed, would he ask that this be reviewed with a view to its termination? Would he further encourage the community at large to participate in the passing of information to the Garda in relation to strange activities?  Would he comment on the allegations that the response in some of these areas has been to set up road blocks where everybody has been put under the eye of the law?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy welcomed the fact that there would be no further closure of Garda stations, but what I said was that since I became Minister no rural Garda station had been closed and my information is that none was closed during the term of office of the previous administration either.  It is over ten years since a Garda station in rural Ireland was closed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy asked if it was policy that gardaí <Col N="1999" /> be resident in their functional areas.  Of course it is, but obviously there is a difficulty in imposing that policy because while one can require a garda to be present while on duty, there is no power I know of which can be imposed on a garda's wife and family to be resident in a particular place.  I agree with the sentiments of what the Deputy said.</P>
      <P>On the question of Garda communications and equipment, the Garda communications and radio networks will be in operation within a number of weeks in all rural areas and within the next couple of weeks the contract will be placed for the Garda network for the greater Dublin area.  That is well on target and there is no problem with either finance or contracting in that area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to the pilot scheme of rural policing in his constituency and county.  That pilot scheme is being carried on in two parts of the country, Mayo and Kilkenny, and when the period of pilot study is over it will be assessed.  I have no plans at the moment to make it a permanent part of policing. I think the pilot scheme should be let run for another while and then we will be in a better position to calmly evaluate its effectiveness or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I would like to encourage the public to provide further information to the Garda Síochána.  My understanding is that there is good co-operation at present that the public, like everybody here, are horrified at these cowardly attacks on the old people in the west and that they are coming forward with information when they have it.  As I indicated in my reply, a good deal of accurate information has come to the Garda already.</P>
      <P>I am not able to comment on the last point the Deputy raised concerning road blocks.  It appears that a road block system is one way of attempting to deal with mobile criminals travelling in vans or cars.  I would refute any suggestion that this is the only Garda response.  I have already referred to a series of responses they are making in my reply.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that part of the problem is the isolation of the people concerned and that one way of overcoming this problem would be the provision of a telephone at a reasonable cost to these people?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The isolation of old people living alone certainly is a factor.  The community alert scheme being sponsored by Muintir na Tíre is a good scheme and the Garda are evaluating it to see what they can do to extend it further.  I understand that part of the suggestions being made by the people organising that scheme is that some ready system of alarm would be available for old people.  In my view, the best system of alarm would be where neighbours are aware of the risk to old people in their community, that they would keep an eye open for them and report to the Garda any strangers in the area.  The information available to me suggests that strangers coming into the area, possibly with locals to pinpoint certain houses, are the source of the problem.</P>

I would like to ask him if he would indicate when these types of attacks started and how many recorded incidents he has over the past year or two. As far as the community are concerned, nothing has been done and the Garda have failed to contain these vicious attacks by gangsters.  I would like the Minister to comment on words attributed to Superintendent Kennedy of Ballina and reported in the national press today. He said these were gangs of itinerant traders using high powered transport and who were directed by godfathers on both sides of the Border.  Is it true that the Garda, because of recent cutbacks, have lifted the checkpoints on the Border and <Col N="2001" /> that we are solely dependent on mobile partols now?</P>

On the question of the particular statement, I have not seen it and I am not prepared to comment on it.  It is appropriate to inform the House that the RUC are co-operating with the Garda in this investigation.  There has been no reduction in security along the Border and, for a variety of reasons, security has to be maintained there.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of those involved in the attacks which took place in Donegal went through Garda checkpoints and that Garda morale is very low because they did not get back-up?  Is the Minister for Justice considering providing a back-up service by requesting the Minister for Defence to let the Army get involved?  Is the Minister aware that over the last four months there have been 35 such attacks in County Donegal?  Does he accept the reply he gave me last Thursday that while attacks of this nature would always have to be regarded as serious, he understood that in only one case was physical injury caused to an elderly person?  Is the Minister suggesting in that reply and his statement here today that the other 34 attacks were not serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that there are people in my county who were held at knifepoint for hours, who had blankets held over their heads and that they were kicked around the house in order to ascertain if money was available?  Does <Col N="2002" /> the Minister accept that when money is not available now because the people have lodged their money with the banks and other financial institutions, the attacks are becoming more vicious? Could the Minister tell us what has happened to the task force which was allegedly sent to Sligo around Christmas to try to curb the vicious attacks in County Donegal and the north-western region?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is the second spate of attacks in the west. When the first spate of attacks occurred, a task force was put in, the crimes were investigated and many people were arrested, charged and brought before the courts.  In the first series of attacks the type of attack was different from the type of attacks experienced over the weekend. Quite a number of people were murdered in the autumn in various places from Tipperary, through Galway to Donegal and that was dealt with on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of Deputy Gallagher but at the moment there is no information to suggest that there is any military type involvement in the people who are perpetrating these attacks and it would not be an appropriate response to use the Army.  The Garda have the resources at their disposal, with the help and co-operation of the local community to deal with the cowardly thugs who are perpetrating these attacks, whatever side of the Border they come from.</P>

      <P>Do the Garda or the Minister subscribe to the theory that there is a small group involved in these attacks, that they are living in the Six County area, in the Enniskillen area I understand, and that these people have been carrying out these raids on a regular basis during the last few months with the aid of locally based accomplices?  Will the Minister state whether or not that is the position because old people throughout the west are living in fear thinking that every house will be attacked?  Can the Minister offer any comment to reassure <Col N="2003" /> elderly people living alone that positive action is being taken so that these people who, it seems, are known, will be hauled in and brought before the courts?  Will the Minister give an assurance, and contradict what has been said by a representative of the prison officers this morning that if these people are arrested and put into jail it will not result in another group of people being released?  Is it true that our jails are packed to the doors, that there is no room for the criminals and there there is a general reluctance on the part of the Garda to arrest and prosecute the people on the basis that people are being given jail sentences and are being released after a few days?  There is an air of disquiet throughout the country.  We owe it to the elderly to give them an assurance that the State is concerned and is taking positive action.  Will the Minister offer some hope to the elderly people in the west other than the bland comments and ineffective action which has been taken up to now?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I assure the House that the full resources of the Garda will be used to track down these cowardly thugs who have attacked old people.  It is also necessary for the community to get involved in the protection of the old people who live amongst them. On the theory of who perpetrates these crimes with the aid of local people, at this point in the investigation I am not prepared to comment on Deputy Molloy's suggestion.  There is obviously a problem in prisons at the moment but I inherited that problem from the previous administration who are now in opposition. At present there are over 1,700 people in prison.  When I came into Government and became a Minister there was accommodation for 1,230 prisoners. There are an extra 500 people in prison but we still have a serious accommodation problem.  As far as I can see the Garda are not reluctant to prosecute because of this.  One of the problems is that the Garda have been so successful in bringing people before the courts and getting them convicted that there are an <Col N="2004" /> enormous number of people coming through the courts who have been convicted and sent to prison, especially since 1 January last.</P>

There has not been a directive from my Department to any divisional superintendent in the west to cut back on overtime.  The overtime is there and it is an open decision to use it as they see fit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill has two main objectives. First, it provides for increases in the various rates of social welfare payments which were announced in the budget. This is in line with the Government's firm commitment to protect the living standards of those who through no fault of their own have no other source of income for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second objective of the Bill is to give practical effect to the Government's equally firm resolve to stamp out abuses of the social welfare code which was clearly stated in the economic plan published a few months ago.  Section 12 provides for substantial increases in the fines which the courts may impose on persons <Col N="2109" /> found guilty of this type of fraud and section 13 strengthens the powers of inspectors of my Department.  Before coming to the details of the Bill I would like to outline the general policy considerations which are reflected in the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government's social welfare strategy is set out in very specific terms in the plan.  A central objective of the strategy is to ensure that, even in the face of scarce resources, social welfare services will continue to be developed by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;maintaining long term payments at least in line with inflation and short term unemployment and disability payments in line with take home pay;</P>
    <P>&mdash;channelling income maintenance expenditure to those in need instead of using generalised measures which help both rich and poor alike,</P>
    <P>&mdash;proper and rigorous enforcement of the social welfare code;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increasing the efficiency and costeffectiveness of the administration of our social welfare services and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the abandonment of structures and services which are no longer appropriate to current needs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the magnitude of social welfare expenditure.  Any policy statement in the social welfare area must, if it is to be realistic, take account of two facts of life.  The first is the enormous size of the existing social welfare budget.  The second is that the demographic and economic pressures which have driven that budget up dramatically over the past five years will remain with us for the forseeable future.  The total number of people and their dependents receiving social welfare payments of various kinds each week, including children's allowances, is now about 1.4 million or 35 per cent of the total population of the country.  This year, taking account of the new rates of benefits set out in this Bill, total expenditure on social welfare will amount to over £2¼ billion of which the Exchequer will provide over £1.3 billion.  The overall annual spending is equivalent to over £6 million for each day of the year.  Expenditure on social welfare is the largest single bloc of all Government expenditures and <Col N="2110" /> is now running at some 25 per cent of total gross current expenditure.  Social welfare expenditure is also taking an increasing share of the country's output &mdash; ten years ago about 10 per cent of GNP was devoted to social welfare but in 1985 it will approach 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with constraints on social welfare progress.  Even without any expansion of the range of social welfare services or any real improvement in levels of benefit the social welfare budget will continue to grow in real terms in the coming years.  About 41 per cent of our total population is in the dependent age groups, that is either under 15 years or over 65 years.  We have had also a very high rate of population increase &mdash; between 1961 and 1983 the total population increased by about 25 per cent.  To the effects of a growing population we must add the high level of unemployment. Taking demographic and other factors together, between 1974 and 1984 the total number of beneficiaries increased by roughly 30 per cent.  The overall number is expected to grow by a further 4 per cent over the next three years.</P>
    <P>So the scope of the social welfare system has been and will continue to widen and the factors which have led to that widening have also led to a severe reduction in the rate at which additional resources can be made available to the system.  Unemployment reduces the number who through the PRSI system help finance the social insurance scheme. Low growth generally in the economy and the need to increase both direct and indirect taxes in order to get the budget deficit under control have all be eliminated the increment of resources from which increased social welfare expenditure could be financed without cutting into living standards.  This two-fold impact of the recession has in turn reduced the willingness of taxpayers generally to accept further tax increases in order to fund the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>For those reasons Governments must nowadays seek a difficult balance in allocating additional resources to the social welfare system.  They must maintain and, where possible, improve the living standards of those hundreds of thousands of <Col N="2111" /> households in real and pressing need while ensuring that misuse of the system is tackled effectively and unremittingly to the extent that manpower, technical and law enforcement resources permit. As I said at the beginning, those two elements of a balanced approach to social welfare provision are the main features of the Bill now before this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases of 6½ per cent in the weekly rates of long term and 6 per cent in the weekly rate of short term payments with effect from the second week of July next.  The real value of pensions, benefits and allowances will be maintained until well into 1986 and overall expenditure on social welfare will rise by 9 per cent in 1985 compared to 1984.  Since the Government came into office and including the increases in the Bill, short term payments have been increased by 25 per cent compound, long term payments by 28 per cent and the long term unemployed received the highest increase of all, 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the period mid-1983 to mid-1986 the consumer Price Index is expected to increase by some 20 per cent compound while the increase in net take-home pay is expected to average about 23 per cent. This real improvement in the purchasing power of social welfare recipients has been achieved by the Government in the fact of the most severe budgetary constraints facing any Government during the life-time of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to selective help for particular groups.  The rise in the numbers of the long term unemployed is a cause of major concern.  There are now 94,600, including 17,000 smallholders, drawing unemployment assistance and who have been out of work for over 15 months.  In response to this, special permanent increases for the long term unemployed were provided in October 1983, an extra 5 per cent, and in July 1984, an extra 1 per cent.  Again from July next the long term unemployed will receive a 6.5 per cent increase in their weekly payments compared to 6 per cent for persons who have become unemployed <Col N="2112" /> more recently and who may also be entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>I should mention here that unemployment related expenditure now accounts for 27 per cent of the total budget of the Department of Social Welfare and is the biggest element of overall social welfare expenditure.  In 1985 provision has been made for expenditure of £579 million, an increase of 11.5 per cent over 1984 and this takes account of the increased rates of payment, the anticipated increase in numbers of claimants and also the likely impact of the social employment scheme and the alternance scheme.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second main element of the Bill.  The Government are determined to ensure that social welfare funds are not misused by a minority at the expense of the vast majority who are in genuine need and of the working population who provide the benefits through PRSI contributions and general taxation. The social welfare system is all about redistribution to the less well off from the better off.  If that redistribution is to be effective, leakage from the system to those who are not genuinely entitled to benefit from it must be minimised.  There has been quite an amount of recent speculation about the extent of social welfare fraud and in order to inform and reassure the general public I would like to give the House some details of the problem and outline measures which have already been taken to combat abuse and my Department's plans to further tighten up the system.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the extent of fraud.  In 1983 the amount attributed to known fraud was £2.3 million &mdash; just over one-eighth of 1 per cent of total expenditure. The figure for 1984 is not yet available but the indications are that it will show an increase.  The biggest components of the 1983 figure were&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> A large amount of potential misuse of the system was directly prevented by the control measures operated by my Department.  For example, in 1984 it was estimated that some £6.4 million in unemployment payments was saved as a result of people &ldquo;signing-off&rdquo; the unemployed register following special interviewing of claimants by officers of my Department.  However, in many cases there was no hard evidence of fraud at the time of the interview, so it is difficult to assess the precise amount which was being drawn unlawfully.</P>
    <P>Misuse of the social welfare code is not confined to the recipients of benefits. Abuse also occurs where employers fail to pay or delay in paying social insurance contributions in respect of their employees.  The practice of some employers of avoiding or holding off remittances of PRSI for as long as possible is simply not acceptable &mdash; arrears outstanding at the 31 May 1984 amounted to some £58 million which represented only actual underpayments established and does not include demands made on the basis of amounts estimated to be due.</P>
    <P>Now I deal with types of fraud.  On the unemployment side the greatest incidence of cases related to concurrent working and drawing benefit and there was also large numbers detected claiming while they were either unavailable for or incapable of work.  Although the scale of fraud on disability benefit is lower, there is disturbing evidence of the involvement of organised criminals.  For instance, in Dublin a number of persons using PRSI numbers which were known to them but without the knowledge of the insured person to whom the numbers belonged, submitted false information and medical certificates and disability benefit cheques amounting in total to a large five figure sum were issued to convenience addresses.  Due to the combined efforts of staff of my Department and the Garda the fraud was uncovered.  So far the Garda have charged nine individuals and their investigations are continuing.  There is also evidence of fraudulent claiming in other schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> With regard to employers defaulting on PRSI contributions, cases have arisen where considerable arrears of PAYE-PRSI are revealed when a company goes into liquidation with perhaps large debts and very few assets.  Fundamental trading difficulties and cash flow problems in the business cannot be solved by abuse of the social security system.</P>
    <P>I now come to measures taken to combat abuse.  Measures to curb misuse have been taken on two broad fronts. First, changes in the structure of the benefits payable to persons during sickness and unemployment were made in 1983 and last year which have achieved a more realistic relationship between the level of overall benefit and the person's normal take-home pay.  A critical examination of the levels of benefit payable had indicated that the previous levels constituted a disincentive to work in a number of cases and in certain circumstances provided opportunities to exploit the social welfare system.  The introduction of the family income supplement as a top-up to take-home pay further increased the incentive to work for low-paid workers with families.  I am now satisfied that the levels of the short term benefits are not out of line with wages generally and there is little or no scope for further action on this front.</P>
    <P>An extensive range of administrative measures have also been brought into force or improved over recent years. These include control measures at local offices to ensure that recipients of unemployment benefit and assistance continue to satisfy the statutory requirement of the schemes have been tightened up.  The general cadre of the social welfare officers has been strengthened so as to increase their role in the anti-fraud campaign &mdash; there are now 248 officers based at 94 different locations throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The size of my Department's special investigation unit has been doubled and there are now 30 officers at 18 centres engaged full-time in the investigation of abuses and irregularities.  The main role of the unit is in relation to the abuse of working and &ldquo;signing-on&rdquo; and they carry <Col N="2115" /> out special investigations in areas where fraud is suspected.</P>
    <P>There is the development of much closer liaison between the National Manpower Service and the local offices of my Department.  The National Manpower Service are giving priority to the registered employed in filling vacancies.  The closer liaison makes it possible to identify persons who are not interested in finding work or who may, in fact, already have a job.</P>
    <P>Increased numbers of disability benefit claimants are being referred to my Department's panel of medical referees for a second opinion, to ensure that only those who are genuinely ill are, in fact, paid disability benefit.  The recent experience is that in the region of 35 per cent of those called for medical examination do not attend and about 26 per cent of all claimants examined are found to be capable of work.  The panel of Medical Referees has been increased by four to 18.</P>
    <P>Improved selection procedures have been introduced in the type of cases referred for examination to ensure that the appropriate cases are submitted promptly for examination.  Claimants for disability benefit are also visited in their own homes by the Department's sickness visitors who express a lay person's opinion on the claimants inability to work. Doubtful cases are referred to the panel of medical referees.  A large number of claimants are absent from home when the sickness visitor calls and these are also normally referred for medical referee examination.</P>
    <P>Regulations which require a claimant for disability benefit to notify the Department within seven days of the commencement of incapacity are strictly enforced. This curbs false claims for past periods which would otherwise not be amenable to checking by visits by sickness visitors or second opinions by medical referees.</P>
    <P>Securing prosecutions against persons who fraudently claim social welfare payments is a very important feature in my Department's drive against abuses of the schemes.  All fraudulent cases coming to light are considered for prosecution <Col N="2116" /> where sufficient evidence is available. The Department's powers to prosecute for offences were strengthened and clarified in 1983 following the advice of the Attorney General in relation to certain defects in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>These measures should leave nobody in doubt that effective and reasonable action is being taken by my Department to eliminate unwarranted resourse to social welfare benefits.  As regards enforcement of the collection of PRSI contributions, which is now undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners with the PAYE collection, Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Finance has set up a working group to make recommendations to Government for substantial improvements in the enforcement process.</P>
    <P>Regarding the role of the public, my Department's work in the control of abuse is, of course, greatly helped by reports of abuse received from members of the public and from various other sources, including employers, the Garda and officials in other Government agencies and in local authorities and health boards.  Indeed, I would like to pay a special tribute to the Garda and the other agencies for their co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The most effective approach to unemployment is, of course, to provide jobs and the Government's policies and resources are being mobilised to that end. With regard to absenteeism, there is a widespread view, which I share, that the key to tackling absenteeism is through effective management action at the level of the individual firm.  In this connection, I would also like to commend the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Productivity Centre for their initiative in producing booklets for employers on absenteeism control.  The Irish Management Institute run a number of courses for managers on the subject of absenteeism and have launched a comprehensive absenteeism control programme for member companies.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to increased efficiency through computerisation.  I mentioned earlier on that it is necessary to <Col N="2117" /> balance the need for adequate controls with the objective of meeting genuine needs efficiently and effectively.  The scale of the activities of the Department of Social Welfare makes that an enormous task.  Each week it makes some 1.4 million payments and processes some 25,000 new claims.  There has been a huge growth in the workload, due to the effects of the recession at a time when the Government's policy on civil service manning levels has been and continues to be extremely restrictive.  However, I am glad to say that the Department's computerisation programme is resulting in significant administrative savings and substantially higher productivity.  This was acknowledged in the 1983 Report of the Department of the Public Service which acknowledged that:</P>
    <P>Due to computerisation, staff numbers engaged on social welfare system at the time of the report had been contained in the previous decade despite a 40 per cent increase in claim load and additional complexities in the system due to pay-related benefit; overtime was also reduced.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of payments systems provides a very powerful capacity to monitor and check expenditure and to provide better and quicker management information.  My Department are pressing ahead with further computerisation to the extent that manpower and financial resources permit. This will gradually make more staff available to improve the overall level of service to the public, which has tended to suffer in some respects due to the sheer volume of claims to be dealt with, and to maintain full and effective control procedures. It is also part of our strategy that the social welfare system in the coming years be made as simple as possible &mdash; the complexities in the present system do not facilitate efficient administration and often create problems of understanding for our clients.  The new child benefit scheme will, I hope, be the first major step along the road to simplification.</P>
    <P>The increased productivity which has been achieved in recent years in my <Col N="2118" /> Department is a tribute to the staff and management.  The cost of administering the social welfare system has been falling in relative terms and this year it is £89 million or 4.07 per cent of total expenditure. Of this the cost of the Department's own staff is less than £37 million or 1.7 per cent of the total expenditure.  This compares more than favourably with any private sector organisation doing similar high volume work and I might add that the administration costs of the UK Department of Health and Social Security are around 4.5 per cent of expenditure. By any standards the Department of Social Welfare are providing excellent value for money.</P>
    <P>I have described the policy which has shaped the main objectives of this Bill and I will now deal briefly with the detailed provisions.  I trust that Deputies will have found the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill helpful in their consideration of this piece of legislation.  Deputies will be aware, of course, that there is a Bill currently before the House to provide for equality of treatment as between men and women in matters of social security arising from the EC Directive on this matter.  That Bill will be amended to incorporate the new rates of payments being provided in the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the social insurance and social assistance rate increases being provided in this Bill is £56.9 million.  This will come to about £118.4 million in a full year.  The extra social insurance expenditure, £33.5 million, falls to be met out of the Social Insurance Fund which will benefit from the yield from the PRSI ceiling increases &mdash; about £2 million &mdash; and from the £2 million savings arising from the increase in the pay-related benefit floor.</P>
    <P>The increases in social insurance and occupational injuries benefits are provided in section 2 of the Bill.  A contributory old age pensioner under 80 years of age will receive an additional £3.15 a week, bringing his rate of payment to £51.40 a week.  If he is married with a wife under age 66 he will get a total increase of £5.15, bringing the pension to <Col N="2119" /> £84.20 a week.  A married couple both over pensionable age will get £89.75 compared to £84.25 at present.  Higher increases are paid for pensioners over 80 years.  Additional payments are also made for persons living alone.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of widow's contributory pension is being increased by £2.80 a week to £46-25.  Widows over 66 years receive higher payments.  A widow with, for example, three dependent children will receive £85.95 a week which is an increase of £5.25.  The personal rate of invalidity pension goes up from £42.55 to £45.30 for a person under pensionable age and a married couple with two children will receive £96.65, and increase of £5.90.  A person in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit will have a new personal rate of £39.50 a week, an increase of £2.25.  Where the recipient is married the increase will be £3.70 a week. Maternity allowance is also being increased to £39.50.</P>
    <P>The new rates of social assistance payments are provided in section 3 of the Bill.  The maximum personal rate of non-contributory old age pension for a pensioner under 80 years of age goes from £41.30 a week at present to £44.00 a week.  It will go up to £47.20 for persons aged 80 or over.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner under 80 with a dependent spouse under 66 will increase by £4.05 to £66.10.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £24.60.  Widows receiving non-contributory widow's pensions at the present rate of £40.50 will get an increase of £2.65 a week.  A widow with two dependent children will get £66.75, an increase of £4.10 a week.  Similar increases will apply to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Those receiving short-duration unemployment assistance in urban areas will get an increase of £1.85 a week in their maximum personal rate.  In rural areas the increase will be £1.80 a week.  There are also increases in respect of dependents. An applicant in an urban area who has a wife and two dependent children <Col N="2120" /> will get an increase of £4.20 a week in the present rate of £69.65.  The special rates of unemployment assistance payable to smallholders in certain areas with land under £20 valuation whose means are still assessed by reference to land valuation are being maintained at their existing levels.  Deputies will be aware that the system of assessment of means on the basis of land valuation is being phased out.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for long-duration recipients of unemployment assistance are higher.  For example, a man and wife with two children in an urban area will get £78.75 which is £4.90 more than the corresponding short-duration rate.  The maximum rate of supplementary welfare allowance for a married couple goes from £51.70 to £54.80 with additional payments for children.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for adjustment in the income limits up to which family income supplement is payable and for increases in the maximum amounts payable under the scheme.  These changes follow from improvements in personal income taxation announced in the Budget Statement and from the increases in the rates of short-term social insurance benefits provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The levels of weekly income up to which a supplement is payable will be increased from £95 to £100 for a family with one child and by a further £18 per week for each additional child, up to and including the fifth child.  The income levels at which the maximum supplement is payable are also being adjusted, for example, from £63 to £68 per week for a one-child family.</P>
    <P>These changes will take effect from 11 July 1985 and will apply to claims made on or after that date.  Claims in payment prior to July will receive the benefit of the revised income limits when they reapply in the normal way at the end of 12 months.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase from £43 to £49 in the earnings disregard, or &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for pay-related benefit purposes. This change will affect new claims only from the beginning of April next where <Col N="2121" /> entitlement to pay-related benefit is involved.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme in April 1974, a proportion of reckonable earnings has always been disregarded in calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable in addition to disability, unemployment, maternity and injury benefit.  In 1974, this disregard or floor was £14, over twice the prevailing rate of flat-rate benefit.  The floor was not increased until 1981, even though the level of flat-rate benefit rose significantly in that time.</P>
    <P>The latest increase in the floor continues the policy that has applied over the last three years of progressively raising its level.  However, if the floor had been maintained at the same level in relation to the flat-rate benefit as it had in April 1974, it would now stand at £79 instead of £49 as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the earnings ceiling for PRSI contribution purposes be raised from £13,000 to £13,800 with effect from 6 April 1985.  For the third successive year there is no increase in the actual rates of social insurance contributions. However, there will be a small extra contribution of 0.1 per cent levied on employers, following the establishment of the Redundancy and Employers Insolvency Fund in place of the previous Redundancy Fund.  This fund is operated by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extension of social insurance coverage to certain members of the Labour Court and the Defence Forces sections 7, 8 and 9 make provision for social insurance cover to be extended to members of the Labour Court.  Members of the court, including the chairman and deputy chairman, are appointed by the Minister for Labour for a fixed duration of up to five years which may be renewed.  Their employment, up to this has been held to be not insurable because it is not employment under a contract of service.  Section 7 provides that the employment in question will be added to the existing list of insurable employments.</P>
    <P>In general, employment which is not subject to a contract of service is not insurable for the full range of social insurance <Col N="2122" /> benefits.  The effect of section 8 is to enable the provisions of the Act to be modified by regulations in respect of employment in the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is a consequential amendment excluding members of the Labour Court from occupational injuries insurance because they are not employed under a contract of service.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the extension of social insurance coverage to commissioned officers employed as doctors and dentists in the Defence Forces.  They will be insured on the same basis as their fellow non-medical commissioned officers at the modified Class C contribution rate which provides cover for widows and orphans pensions and deserted wife's benefit.  They will not be covered for occupational injuries benefits because members of the Defence Forces in general are specifically excluded from such cover.</P>
    <P>I consider that the continued general exclusion of doctors and dentists from social insurance can no longer be justified and this is a matter which I will be putting before the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 13 provide for changes in the unemployment assistance scheme. Section 11 of the Bill enables long term unemployed persons who have participated in either the social employment scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme, the alternance scheme or AnCO approved courses for up to one year to resume their entitlement to unemployment assistance at the long term rate of payment and without serving a three day waiting period.  At present long term unemployment assistance claimants who resume signing-on after attending AnCO courses of over 20 weeks duration are obliged to serve a three day waiting period as if their claim was a new one.  In addition such persons have to revert to the lower rate of assistance because the link with the previous &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; claim is technically broken where attendance at a training course lasted for 20 weeks. The effect of the proposed amendment is <Col N="2123" /> that periods of up to one year's participation in approved training schemes or social employment schemes will be disregarded in determining whether periods of unemployment can be linked for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill provides for the clarification and strengthening of the powers and duties of social welfare officers in relation to the unemployment assistance scheme in particular in the area of combatting abuse.  It includes a specific provision governing the investigation of unemployment assistance claims by social welfare officers on similar lines to that which exists at present for social insurance purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for increased penalties for social welfare offences in line with commitment in paragraph 5.68 of the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.  At present a maximum fine of £500 or 12 months imprisonment, or both, can be imposed on summary conviction of a person found guilty of a prescribed offence in respect of the various social insurance and assistance schemes.  In exceptionally serious cases where conviction on indictment is obtained the maximum fine is £2,000 or two years imprisonment, or both.  This section will increase the maximum fines to £1,000 and £3,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that volunteer workers employed in a developing country will not have their occupational injuries benefit entitlement reduced by reference to their earnings from employment abroad.  Under existing legislation the amount of occupational injuries benefits are limited by reference to the pre-accident earnings of the insured person.  It is proposed that this limitation should not apply in the case of volunteer development workers, who might receive nominal amounts of benefit because of their low earnings from employment abroad.</P>
    <P>It is part of Government policy in regard to development co-operation to encourage and facilitate as far as possible the participation of Irish individuals and organisations in the Third World.  In this <Col N="2124" /> context the various issues involved in protecting the interests of development workers are kept under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The lack of social insurance cover for returned workers has been identified as a source of concern to many such workers and the Government have therefore decided that continuity of social insurance cover will be provided for those development workers who are paid pocket money rather than a wage so that they can avail of the relevant social insurance benefits on their return.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the volunteer workers fall into two categories: those who have no history of employment before their departure and consequently no social insurance entitlements; those who have an employment history and social insurance entitlements prior to going abroad, but who at present lose those entitlements because they are not entitled to credited contributions while abroad.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be made to safeguard the position of each of those two groups, and consultations are taking place currently with the different bodies who have an interest in the problem.  I will shortly be making regulations to deal with this particular issue.</P>
    <P>This move has been welcomed as a practical demonstration of the Government's desire to encourage and facilitate as far as possible the participation of Irish individuals in volunteer development work in the Third World.</P>
    <P>While on this topic I would also like to mention that a draft EC Recommendation on the Provision of Social Security for Volunteer Development Workers who operate in Third World Countries and are paid wages at a rate similar to local conditions is being urgently discussed. This recommendation proposed that various member states should recognise the achievement of social security cover for volunteer development workers as one of the objectives of their social policy.  It sets down the broad principles which member states should aspire to and lays down various ways in which these principles might be implemented.  The <Col N="2125" /> regulations which I will be making shortly will reflect the principles enshrined in the recommendation.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to a number of social welfare improvements which do not require legislation, as such.  This year's budget saw a number of innovative measures designed to improve the level of service being given on extending existing services to priority groups to the extent that the very limited resources permit.  One of these is an important extension of the existing treatment benefit scheme from July next.  This scheme at present provides optical, dental and medical and surgical benefits to qualified insured workers.  These benefits will be extended from July next to the expectant wives of such workers. In practical terms this means for example, that all basic dental treatment such as examination, fillings, scaling and polishing, extractions and root treatment and, on the optical side, sight tests will be available free of charge.</P>
    <P>This extension, will increase the potential catchment of the scheme by up to 30,000 married women per annum.  It is a response, albeit a modest one, to the repeated demands which have been made over the years to have the benefits available under the scheme extended to all spouses of qualified insured workers. However, as I said on a number of occasions the cost of such an extension would be prohibitive being of the order of £6¾ million per annum and the Government have, therefore, decided that as pregnant wives can be regarded a priority group to extend the scheme to them initially.  I was conscious of the review of the State funded dental services which is in progress at the moment and I was anxious that this review could proceed without major structural changes in the existing schemes.</P>
    <P>I have already met the relevant professional bodies with a view to seeking the co-operation of their members in the implementation of the extended scheme. The details of the extension are being worked out at present and will shortly be brought into law by means of amending regulations.  As soon as these have been <Col N="2126" /> made, appropriate publicity will be arranged.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a second EC poverty programme have now been approved by the Council of Ministers and will come into effect in 1985.  The programme will run for four years and under the programme Community financial assistance will be provided for action research projects in the poverty field.</P>
    <P>Projects selected for the programme would receive financial assistance from Community Funds up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the overall costs (55 per cent in exceptional cases).</P>
    <P>To qualify for funding under the programme projects will have to comply with certain criteria set down by the EC Commission relating mainly to evaluation, co-ordination between projects on similar themes and the dissemination of project results.  The overall amount of Community funding available for this programme is 25 million ECU of which some 20 million ECU &mdash; £14 million approximately &mdash; would be available for action-research projects.</P>
    <P>Interested organisations and groups have been invited through newspaper advertisements to suggest projects for inclusion in the programme.  Applications were to be submitted to the Department before 28 February.  Applications will be examined by the interim board of the combat poverty organisation which will advise on the projects to be forwarded to the Commission for inclusion in the programme.</P>
    <P>Legislation to establish the new Combat Poverty Agency has now been circulated and will shortly be debated in the Oireachtas.  The new agency will be set up as soon as possible after the legislation is passed.  A sum of £1 million is provided in 1985 for the anti-poverty programme.</P>
    <P>In 1983 and last year £0.5 million was provided for various voluntary organisations who do invaluable work in the social services area.  The grants are mainly for once off projects and are payable in addition to any grants made by health boards.  This year an increased sum of £650,000 is being made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2127" /> An advertisement has been placed in the national press inviting interested organisations to complete an application form and submit it to the Department before 29 March 1985.  The health boards will then be consulted and the grants will be paid to the approved bodies as soon as possible afterwards.  Some 103 organisations benefited from grants under this heading in 1984.  The following is a cross-section of the type of work which these agencies carry out: day care centres for the old; meals on wheels; services for the physically handicapped; youth club facilities; day care centres for the homeless; help for unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>The value of the fuel vouchers under the national and urban fuel schemes are being increased from next October from £4 to £5 a week.  This will benefit some 168,000 people at a cost of £5.9 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came into office, three important Social Welfare Bills were brought before this House. Today there are three more separate Social Welfare Bills going through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposed child benefit scheme is due to come into operation next year and a framework for a national pension scheme will be published later this year.  The improvements and policy developments contained in these Bills and the further measures to come are an indication of the Government's commitment to the progressive improvement of our social security system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister with great interest, anticipation and hope.  We are all aware of the miserable increase granted during the current year to social welfare recipients, although the increased payments do not come into effect until July, which is a long way off. In the interim increased costs on essential goods are biting deeply into the miserable income of those whose sole source of income is social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The die is cast for 1985, but I had hoped that a little humanity, Christian charity <Col N="2128" /> and goodness would find their way into the heart of this unscrupulous, mean, inhuman and miserly Government.  However, I hoped in vain.  I also hoped that when the Minister introduced this inglorious Bill he would tell us we had reached the end of the bad old days of the policies of miserly economic scroogery, particularly as far as social welfare recipients are concerned.</P>
    <P>For two years in succession the Government have treated the most vulnerable and least well off section of our community with disdain and inhumanity. I thought that after this year the worst off sections of the community would not be asked to pay the penalty in future for failed Government economic policies, as they are doing at present.  Unfortunately, I was wrong in hoping and believing that things would change.  My hopes, and those of hundreds of thousands of citizens, were dashed.  The old, sick, unemployed and the poor are being treated almost as social outcasts; and all the indications are that they will continue to be so treated by the Government during whatever period of time remains before they get the out, out, out decision from the electorate.  The public, especially those receiving social welfare payments, are just waiting for the opportunity to change the Government.  I do not think anybody is under any illusions as to what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance had the audacity to attempt to make a big play of the Government's performance in respect of social welfare increases from 1983 to 1985.  He implied that, taking into account the increases granted in the years 1983 and 1984, long-term increases in social welfare payments of approximately 19 per cent have been achieved and that this increase had more than met the Government's commitment to keep pace with inflation in this regard.</P>
    <P>But the Minister and the Government omitted conveniently to inform the people that the increases in each of those years related to nine months in each instance.  In these circumstances it was dishonest, deceitful and a form of fiddling politics at its lowest for the Minister to <Col N="2129" /> have endeavoured to mislead the people in that way.  Again this year the Minister for Finance and the Government continue to engage in this policy of public deception.  The meagre increases in social welfare payments will not become effective this year until 11 July.  Is it not strange that the date on which the increases come into operation is being extended each year?  Last year the effective date was during the first week in July but this year it is later.  In the interim the poor, the old, the sick, the unemployed and the widows will not be able to enjoy any of the increases which the Government are claiming are of the order of 6 to 6½ per cent and which according to them are in keeping with the rate of inflation.  The increases are being granted for eight and a half months of the year.  This gives a real increase of only 4 per cent.  That will be far less than the inflation rate for the year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime all those who must rely on social welfare benefits, people who are deserving of the greatest support possible from the State, must pay increased VAT on clothes, on fuel and on footwear, increases respectively of from 8 to 10 per cent, 5 to 10 per cent and 0 to 10 per cent.  The Government have made no attempt to cushion social welfare beneficiaries against the effects of these increases.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister or anyone else say that any of these people will be better off because of the budgetary changes?  We might ask, too, how much less in terms of disposable income these people will have after 11 July this year.  Do the Government recognise that the various items to which the VAT increases apply are essential items in order to allow families enjoy a normal decent standard of living?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has had the rather dubious privilege of presenting this Bill to the House.  He has endeavoured to put the best face possible on it but as a member of the Labour Party he must be very embarrassed to have to try to sell the Bill to the House and it will be even more difficult for him to sell it to the public.  To some extent I <Col N="2130" /> sympathise with the Minister but if one makes one's bed one must be prepared to lie on it.</P>
    <P>Neither this Minister nor the Labour Party in general can in any way disassociate themselves from the Bill.  Unfortunately, the Bill is another factor in the price of power, another factor which the `mercs' and perks party, otherwise known as Labour, have had to pay for joining the unholy alliance with Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>In the past the Minister for Social Welfare has enunciated views that would be totally at variance with the miserly increases being offered to social welfare beneficiaries at this difficult time.  The Minister has stressed some figures in terms of increases in certain areas of social welfare and he does so as if these increases were really worthwhile pennies from heaven.  This is not the case, as the Minister is well aware.  The increases are a total insult to those most in need.  In the past social welfare increases applied from April but that is no longer the case as I have outlined.  If the trend in that respect continues, and if the Government continue in office for much longer, the effective operative date for the increases will be somewhere near Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we consider honestly and constructively the increases being offered.  A widow with two children and on a contributory pension is to receive an increase of £4.40 per week, bringing her total income to £72.30.  A couple in receipt of contributory old age pension and both of whom are between 60 and 80 will receive an increase of £5.50 bringing their total income to £89.75.  In the case of the long-term unemployed the increase is to be 6½ per cent.  This means that a man in this category and with two children will receive an increase from £73.90 to £79.75.  The increase in respect of short term payments will be 6.3 per cent.  This will relate to unemployment, disability, maternity, and invalidity benefits.  A man with a dependent wife and two children will receive £88.50 if he is in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit. Surely then the increases are an insult in terms of increased costs.  It is obvious that the unfortunate families depending on <Col N="2131" /> social welfare will have far less money available to them in real terms after 11 July this year.</P>
    <P>Thee meagre increases being granted by the Coalition compare very poorly with the real increases given by successive Fianna Fáil Governments, Governments who recognised the needs of those people and who cared for them.  The record of this Government is appalling in respect of caring for those families who must have recourse to social welfare payments. In the three years they have been in office they gave a 12 per cent increase in long term payments in 1983 and a 10 per cent increase in short term payments, all increases operative from the end of June. In 1984 they gave an 8 per cent increase to those on long term unemployment assistance and all other benefits were increased by 7 per cent.  These increases were paid in the first week of July.  This year the increase is reduced to 6½ per cent in respect of long term payments and 6 per cent for short term payments, payable from 11 July 1985.</P>
    <P>This should be contrasted with the Fianna Fáil record.  In 1980 and 1981 Fianna Fáil granted an increase of 25 per cent in respect of long term payments and 20 per cent for short term payments, payable in April of those years.  In 1982 we granted an across-the-board increase of 25 per cent to all social welfare recipients payable in April, a total 75 per cent increase in three successive years. Clearly, the performance of the Coalition pales sadly in comparison with our achievements of which we are justly proud and which we hope to repeat at the earliest possible opportunity and thus give the poor unfortunate people a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>Once again this Government decided this year not to grant any increases in children's allowances.  I regard that decision as cruel and insensitive, as a specific anti-family measure which is part and parcel of the kind of policies that are pursued relentlessly by this Government. I do not have to remind the House of the history of the children's allowance scheme which was introduced in 1944 as <Col N="2132" /> a support particularly for larger families. Initially it applied only where there were three or more children in a family but since 1963 the scheme was extended to cover all children and it now applies to all children up to 16 years or 18 years where the child is in full time education or is incapacitated.  The children's allowance scheme has become a traditional family income supplement and in most cases it has been used assiduously and conscientiously by the mothers of families to supplement basic family needs from time to time and for special occasions. It gave a mother a small hidden reservoir of cash from which she could draw at crucial times.</P>
    <P>Almost 500,000 families benefit from the scheme but they were not granted any increase this year.  Last year children's allowances were increased by a miserable 7 per cent from 7 August and in 1983 the Government did not give any increase in respect of the scheme.  It is an appalling and disgusting anti-family policy that in three years there has been just one increase of 7 per cent that operated from 7 August and that meant an increase in real terms of only 4 per cent in that year. Since this Government took office in December 1982 they have increased children's allowance by just 4 per cent over a three year period.  Surely there could not be a more miserable policy in relation to children's allowances.  The policies of this Government in this area cry out for vengeance.  There is no doubt that the families who receive children's allowance payments know that this Government have failed them badly.</P>
    <P>The Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Kevin McNamara, who was formerly Bishop of Kerry put the matter of children's allowances clearly and succinctly in perspective in his Lenten Pastoral in 1984.  I quote from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> dated 29 March 1984 as follows:</P>
    <P>In a Lenten Pastoral entitled &ldquo;The Christian Family&rdquo; the Bishop of Kerry, Dr. Kevin McNamara, criticised meagre children's allowances paid out by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>For a country that rightly prides <Col N="2133" /> itself on its strong family traditions it is puzzling, he said, how we should accept payments that compare very unfavourably with European rates.  In the last few years, the bishop states, families have become increasingly beset by economic difficulties arising from unemployment and increased living costs.  Many families were under pressure to keep a home, to dress and educate children on low wages or social welfare benefits.  There was pressure on wives to leave home against their will to supplement the family income. The remedy here must surely be greater financial support for families from the State and voluntary bodies, he suggests.</P>
    <P>Dr. McNamara states that if children's allowances cannot be raised for all social categories, then they should at least be increased for families on social welfare payments or who are otherwise hard-pressed.</P>
    <P>I agree that the then Bishop of Kerry put the whole matter of children's allowances as they related to poorer families in full and proper perspective.  In this House during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill on 9 March 1983, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I regret very much that in present financial circumstances it was not possible to provide a significant real improvement in the level of social welfare payments.  I fully appreciate that many persons dependent on social welfare payments &mdash; the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and the retired &mdash; are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet in this severe and prolonged recession.  It is unfortunate that at a time like this when the need for income maintenance services, particularly unemployment benefits, is greatest, that the State's ability to make an adequate response is limited because of the critical position of the public finances.  However, I can assure Members of the House that as soon as circumstances permit, hopefully by next year's budget, it is my firm intention to secure further real improvements in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> How little has been achieved since then. From this one can see very clearly that the present Minister was unhappy at that time with the percentage increases being offered to social welfare recipients.  If he was unhappy then he must be much more unhappy now.</P>
    <P>With a blare of trumpets this Government introduced their document, <i>Building on Reality</i> towards the end of 1984. In retrospect it might have been more correct if they had called it &ldquo;Building on Unreality&rdquo;.  This document went in some depth into attempting to explain the gravity of the unemployment problem.  They attempted to quantify it and explained how this problem could be dealt with and what it would cost during the reign of this Government.  The Government said that about 220,000 persons would be unemployed by the end of 1984, but now they must shamefully admit that that figure was fudged because the real figure was 234,000, and this is increasing all the time.  Unless policies change, this figure will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>The Government, like everybody else, know that unemployment benefit and assistance payments are the fastest growing elements in terms of costing in the Social Welfare Estimates and that unemployment payments have increased from £345 million in 1982 to £526 million at the end of 1984, or by a rate of approximately £10 million a week during that period. We all know that until the unemployment problem is solved ever-increasing charges will be placed on the Exchequer.  For example, for every 1,000 people who become registered as unemployed the cost to the Exchequer will be £2½ million in State benefits.  Surely the Government cannot allow the unemployment figures to rise any higher?  Surely the responsibility is on them to at least try to arrest the huge rise in the numbers joining the queues at unemployment exchanges all over the country.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the biggest problem facing this country and this Government must come to grips with it.  They must create an economic climate which is attractive to industrial development and employment in general and they must <Col N="2135" /> improve incentives for workers and employers.  This can only be done by real changes in our taxation system which is crippling the community.  At present there is little or no incentive to either expand a business, if one is an employer, or to work harder, if one is an employee, because of the cruel crippling effects of our taxation.</P>
    <P>At page 23 of <i>Building on Reality</i> it says:</P>
    <P>A key element in the Government's strategy for income maintenance will be to provide adequately for the welfare of children in needy families.  In recent times, resources being devoted to child support were not at all well targeted to the groups most in need.  A particular weakness was in respect of families where the head of household was an employee at work, but at low pay.  The State tax and social welfare system gave much less to such people to help with the cost of feeding and clothing extra children than it gave, not only to social welfare beneficiaries, but also to well-off families.</P>
    <P>This was the basis on which the family income supplement scheme was introduced. It was supposed to be this Government's solution to the problems of the lower paid workers.  I can state clearly without fear of contradiction by anyone on the other side of the House that this scheme has been a complete and abject failure.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme was introduced at a very sensitive time in the history of this Government when Labour and Fine Gael were struggling and fighting among themselves.  When the scheme was announced it was stated that up to 35,000 families would qualify for payments under this scheme.  A great deal of play was made out of the fact that the scheme would be backdated to 1 September.  This move appeared to be an essential ingredient to accommodate some of the more reluctant elements in the Labour Party who were finding the 50 per cent reduction in food subsidies to be almost totally unpalatable for them <Col N="2136" /> politically.  I refer particularly to Deputy Bell.</P>
    <P>In retrospect I can see that it was very easy to appease these reluctant elements in the Labour Party because we all know that this scheme has been a failure.  Up to 7 February 1985, out of the supposed 35,000 families who would benefit, there were only 9,300 applications received by the Department, and of them, approximately 4,400 families had been granted the family income supplement.  We should ask ourselves why this scheme has failed and why the Government are still making much ado about nothing since it is obvious that they have not satisfied the demands of the people.  In the abridged 1985 estimates column one can see that £30 million has been allocated for the family income supplement scheme, but from the most recent information available to the Department one can see that a saving of £2.5 million will result from the non-take up of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the audacity to present the family income supplement scheme &mdash; which was to be introduced on 1 November but was backdated to 1 September &mdash; with a blaze of triumphalism. I will quote from <i>The Irish Times</i>, 12 September 1984, under the heading &ldquo;Backdating of Family Supplement Welcomed&rdquo;. It says:</P>
    <P>The low income families eligible for the family income supplement scheme who are caught in what the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Desmond, has described as the wage poverty trap will get between £10 and £120 of an unexpected bonus in back money because of the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>The article also said that a reduction in food subsidies in the previous month had further eroded the rapidly declining value of family income, adding up to £5 to the weekly food bill in some cases, and that the week before many families had difficulty in meeting the cost of books and clothes when their children returned to school after the summer holidays.  In the same paper there was a statement attributed to Deputy Liam Skelly.  The article <Col N="2137" /> said that Deputy Skelly represented the sprawling constituency of Dublin West with a population of 120,000 people, ranging from the very rich to the very poor, and that he regularly met at his clinics the families who would benefit from this scheme.  Deputy Skelly is reported as saying that many of the people he knows are not eating properly and that he knew of one family who did not send their children back to school because they could not meet the £150 bill for clothes.  The article said:</P>
    <P>A strong critic of some Government policies said last night that the earlier introduction of a supplement will help alleviate the distress caused by the reductions in food subsidies ... But a lot of unnecessary pain could have been avoided for those families if both decisions were made at the same time.</P>
    <P>The article also says that the scheme would benefit 35,000 families and would cost about £13 million.  It said that the scheme had been promised by the Government 18 months previously and that when the back money was paid families would benefit by up to £15 per week depending on their income and the number of children.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been ignored by the public and has not fulfilled what the Government said it would.  This is a classic example of the Government braying their wares in a shameful fashion.  They have been pretending to have been doing what they are not doing and they were pretending to provide what they were not providing.  The Government have been making much ado about nothing, since so few people have availed of the scheme. When one compares the numbers deemed ineligible with those who applied for benefit under the scheme one wonders if they were deemed ineligible because of the failure of the administration to process the scheme properly.  I know of one family who sent in two applications to the Department of Social Welfare and who inquired by telephone when nothing happened to be told that neither application form had been received in the <Col N="2138" /> Department.  Is this another ploy to deprive people of their rights?</P>
    <P>When we got the details of the budget most of us were concerned by changes in non-capital expenditure.  The revised table and the published estimates showed that in relation to social welfare under subhead E the Social Insurance Fund, there would be a saving of £1,618 million on a published estimate of approximately £316.422 million, under subhead G non-contributory old age pensions, there would be a saving of £1,250 million on a published estimate of £9,430 million; under subhead N, Family Income Supplement, there would be a saving of £2½ million on a published estimate of £13 million.  We hoped that these reductions were not being made because of a concerted effort by the Government to achieve savings at any cost.  I hope there is a logical explanation for this, particularly in relation to the estimated savings of approximately £2 million on non-contributory old age pensions.  In answer to a question we were told that the savings were included in the overall reduction of £7.368 million on the public Social Welfare Estimates and that they arose because the latest information showed that a slightly lower number of pensions were in payment and that a slightly lower average rate of payments than were assumed in the published estimated would be paid.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister in his reply would explain why there is a reduced number of pensions being granted and why is there a slightly lower average rate of payments than was assumed in the published estimates?  Has the Minister and the Government indulged in a policy of making savings at the cost of old age pensioners?  If this is so it is a national disgrace.  I would remind the Government of another Government who reduced the old age pension by a shilling many years ago.  I do not believe the Minister not any member of the Government would like to be remembered in that fashion.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the increasing burden of PRSI payments on the meagre wages <Col N="2139" /> of workers.  I wonder if the PRSI system is fair or equitable.  Is it just another form of taxation?  If it is unfair we have an obligation to do something about it. Unfortunately the ceiling for contributions was raised by this Government.  The present Minister, under section 4 of the 1983 Social Welfare Act, raised the contribution ceiling from £9,000 to £13,000. Effectively, workers have been paying much more in social welfare contributions. The same applies to the 1 per cent levy introduced two years ago.  This now takes 1½ per cent out of workers' pockets. Once again the Government have maintained their set pattern of increasing the ceiling.  This year it has been raised from £13,000 to £13,800.  The ceiling for the health contribution levy has been raised from £12,000 to £13,000, and this, together with the higher ceiling for health services, cuts a further £445 from workers. In other words, it will cost workers another £1 per week.  The additional yield to the insurance fund will be £13 million this year, affecting 130,000 workers.  The time has come to call a halt to these consistent increases in the demands on workers.  The Government must decide that workers cannot pay any more or their families will be left hungry and only semi-clothed.  The Government must realise that the basic essentials of life have to be paid for and if that is to be possible the Government must stop taking such an alarming slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>How many people listening to the Minister for Finance delivering his budget speech realised they were being misled by the budgetary strategy?  Once again the Government played their characteristic three-card trick, taking from the workers with one hand and giving with the other.  Any increases the workers appear to have gained have been more than taken back by increased costs.</P>
    <P>In 1984 people on pay-related benefits were reduced to £43 in the amount of weekly earnings to be disregarded in calculating the rates of benefits.  We opposed that because we decided it would reduce the amounts payable to those on unemployment benefits and maternity awards. <Col N="2140" /> This year the Minister went further and he increased the amount of weekly earnings to be calculated from £42 per week. The maximum will be £44.25 this year compared with £42.75.  This represents a saving of £2 million, a trick the Government are very successful at.</P>
    <P>Though it does not come under this Bill, it is only fair to say that we should be aware that we will soon be faced with a Bill to implement an EC equality directive, and there is no doubt that when that will be implemented many families will lose up to £30 or £40 per week in social welfare payments.  Members on this side are not opposed to equal rights for women or for the need for a change in their status but we do not think this should be achieved at the expense of the entire family unit.  I implore the Minister, when he is introducing the new Bill, to ensure that no families on social welfare payments will lose income as a result.  In many cases where the head of the house is ill or unemployed and the wife works part time on a small wage the family will lose enormously unless the Minister builds in safeguards to the EC Bill to ensure that no family will lose.  One begins to wonder if the intention to introduce the equality of status Bill is an excuse for the Government savagely to cut the incomes of working class families. The kernel of the problem is that in an attempt to solve the matter of equality and status no cognisance is taken of the fact that women's earnings are only two-thirds of those of men and therefore to achieve equality of earnings will cause severe hardship to many families.</P>
    <P>Many people question whether the administration of the Department of Social Welfare is as good as it should be.  I am being extremely kind in my verbiage, but many people are beginning to wonder whether the operations of the Department of Social Welfare have broken down almost completely.  Apparently, for some reason we do not understand, it takes unbelievably long periods to process applications, particularly in regard to claims for unemployment benefits or assistance, disability benefits and non-contributory old age pensions. <Col N="2141" /> Unfortunate applicants have to wait for weeks without incomes of any kind. Those of us who have a better opportunity to ascertain the facts are aware that supplementary welfare benefits may be paid while people are awaiting the processing of their applications.  Many unfortunate applicants for social welfare payments are not aware that while awaiting a decision by a deciding officer they can avail of the supplementary welfare scheme.  Consequently, they do not claim and live in dire financial straits during those weeks.  The bills mount up, food supplies diminish and they have a poor standard of living.</P>
    <P>There must be a better way to process such claims expeditiously to determine eligibility, or is it that staff numbers have been so reduced that the Department cannot function efficiently and properly? The appeals system has almost totally broken down especially in regard to appeals against decisions of medical referees who may decide that applicants on disability benefit are fit for work.  If the recipient's doctor decides otherwise the matter is sent for appeal and, for some reason or other, it now takes an unbelievable amount of time before that appeal is heard.  That denies workers a fundamental right, the right of access to a proper appeal system where appeals are dealt with expeditiously.  It has been suggested &mdash; I do not wish to indulge in hearsay but since the matter has been raised it is only fair that I should invite the Minister to reply to it &mdash; that one of the reasons why appeals are delayed is as a consequence of an unprecedented number of appeals officers being ill.  It appears that a hard line is being adopted in assessing the backlog of cases.  In adopting that attitude people are being discouraged from proceeding with appeals.</P>
    <P>I accept that evaluating the appeals can be difficult and that they must be dealt with in the light of conflicting written medical evidence, the report of the medical referee and the report of the applicant's doctor.  However, extra staff should be recruited to clear the backlog <Col N="2142" /> of appeals that are causing concern to so many people.  There is much concern about the means testing of recipients of social welfare payments.  It is felt that this has led to many old people, especially along the western seaboard, hoarding money rather than investing it in banking institutions.  People are hiding their money in their beds, in their matresses, under the carpet or under the thatch because they feel that if they invest it in the banks they will be considered ineligible for old age pensions or benefits they may apply for.  We are all aware of the traditions of our people and the independence that many old people have.  We are all aware that many old people consider it important to put money aside to ensure that they get a proper and respectable funeral when they depart this life.  I do not think there is anything ignoble about that.  Many people save because they do not wish to be an encumbrance on their family.</P>
    <P>Many old people will not invest their money because of a fear that they may lose social welfare benefits. Instead they keep their money at home thereby creating an incentive for criminals to attack and rob them or, as happened last weekend, burn down their house.  If criminals were aware that it was unlikely that money would be available in rural homes they would not bother old people. The Minister, and the Government, must take steps to deal with this.  If old people are under a misapprehension about the means test that should be cleared up.  Old people should be told if they can invest money in the banking institutions happy in the knowledge that they will not be depriving themselves of their social welfare benefits and that it is not necessary for them to keep their money at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out the conditions clearly.  I hope he clarifies the matter when replying.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy O'Sullivan is here because he is quoted according to <i>The Cork Examiner</i> dated 21 January 1985, under the heading &ldquo;Means test is immoral, said TD&rdquo; as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> Cork Labour T.D., Toddy O'Sullivan said yesterday that the means testing of recipients of redundancy payments was unjust and it must end.</P>
    <P>He said that he considered the matter to be &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; and he would be raising it with the Health and Social Welfare Minister, Mr. Barry Desmond, in Dublin this week.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Examiner reported that dole payments to redundant Dunlop workers were held up by red tape.</P>
    <P>It was also stated in the article &ldquo;that many redundant workers in Cork had found themselves in the same `trap' as the Dunlop workers.  But the Dunlop situation had brought matters to a head&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is further quoted as stating that it was &ldquo;a harsh measure to penalise people who already paid their PAYE in full and their PRSI&rdquo;.  The article continues:</P>
    <P>He said that redundant workers in Lunhams and the Eagle Printing Company had already come up against this problem.  At the moment it was the Dunlop workers; next it would be Ford and Verolme workers.</P>
    <P>It is time to call a halt.  I will be telling this to the Minister when I meet him and will be raising the matter at the parliamentary party meeting.</P>
    <P>If a respected member of the Labour Party sees fit to speak so vociferously on this subject there must be something seriously wrong.  I hope that the Minister listened carefully and attentively to his colleague when he brought the matter to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>Another item which concerns us is that we must sympathise with the problems of single people who because they are unemployed are forced to live with their parents.  Because they live with their parents they are considered to be receiving the equivalent of £28.85 per week because they are housed and fed by the family.  Yet, that family cannot claim any allowance on behalf of the single person. Since the single unemployed man is now <Col N="2144" /> entitled to £29.40 per week in unemployment assistance, he receives just 55p from the State per week.  That is hardly enough to buy himself half a pint of beer, if he feels himself entitled to such a luxury. Surely a case must be made here for examining assessment of means in these cases.</P>
    <P>Increasing emphasis is now being placed on two elements which are becoming matters of grave concern in our society.  These are the unemployment and the poverty traps.  The term &ldquo;unemployment trap&rdquo; is used to describe the position of an unemployed person who will be no better off by becoming employed because the level of unemployed payments is close to net income from working.  Some people &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;some&rdquo;&mdash; assess the unemployment trap here as being largely due to the fact that, unlike income from work, unemployment payments are linked to the number of children a claimant has. As a consequence, the earnings from unemployment payments may be on a par with earnings of a low paid ordinary worker.  The family income supplement was designed to boost the income of such low paid workers, to remedy this anomaly. It has failed miserably to achieve this.  Despite some people's assessment of how the unemployment trap is created, I have no doubt that its real basis in our society is the cruel, insensitive and savage system of taxation being imposed on PAYE workers.  Until this is remedied, the so-called unemployment trap will continue and the position will even deteriorate.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo; was developed in the early seventies in Britain to describe the situation where persons at work could find themselves unable to increase their final income after tax even if their gross earnings before tax increased.  This was primarily due to the imposition of taxes and the withdrawal of benefits as the income increased. Families could lose many benefits even though the wage earner obtains an apparent increase in wages because of increased taxation and the withdrawal of certain entitlements under their previous <Col N="2145" /> earnings, such as category 1 general medical card eligibility.  Local authority rents are based on the differential rent system and when their earnings increased, their rents rose accordingly. Also, their effective PRSI payments increased as a result of their increased earnings.  This family have now got themselves into the so-called poverty trap.</P>
    <P>This anomaly exists because, for example, the issuing of medical cards and taxation are dealt with by different administrations within Government Departments.  It appears that very little attention has been paid to the subject of the poverty trap.  This is mainly because the means testing schemes are spread through many different Government Departments.  I hope the Minister and the Government will bear in mind some of the comments I have made on the evergrowing problems which are arising as a result of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping Deputy McCarthy would end on a high note. He quoted from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in relation to my criticism of a section of the social welfare code.  I was critical.  The day I cease to be critical and concerned about the people we are now speaking about &mdash; namely, those in receipt of social welfare benefits &mdash; will be the day I will have outlived my usefulness as a Deputy in this House.  It is the task of a Labour representative to continue to press on behalf of the under-privileged.</P>
      <P>I have other criticisms to offer which I will make in a constructive way and I hope they will be of help to the Minister and his officials in providing a more humane system.  That was absent from Deputy McCarthy's contribution.  The predictable clichés were trotted out again and again.  We had a reference to the shilling which was taken off the pension many years ago.  At the rate he was going I thought he would question why Brian Boru's wife did not get a widow's and orphan's pension after the Battle of Clontarf. His whole approach was negative. This is a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy reserved some of his harshest comments for the Labour Party. <Col N="2146" /> The Labour Party are acceptable in this House provided that they sit on the back-benches, but woe betide them if a few of them occupy a seat in Government or have a Mercedes to which he referred in his &ldquo;mercs and perks&rdquo; remark.  I was disappointed at his subservient approach in relying on the Thatcherite quotation, out, out, out.  It is not becoming for somebody who calls himself a republican to resort to that type of cheap gimmickry.</P>
    <P>He also expressed his concern for the status of women.  That concern did not manifest itself some weeks ago when the same Minister was trying to introduce the Health (Family Planning) Bill which affected women more than men.  There was a notable absence of concern on that occasion.  I regret that Deputy McCarthy has left the Chamber because I feel a little guilty about attacking him in his absence.  Nevertheless I am compelled to say that his whole grasp of the social welfare code is akin to the understanding he demonstrated recently when he spoke about wet time payments and completely misread them.</P>
    <P>I should like to offer some comments on the Minister's speech.  I want to help him to make the system more acceptable. There are many anomalies in it.  Because of lack of activity down through the years, people are now suffering.  I am not suggesting this was done on purpose.  In the lifetime of this Government and within the framework of the national plan, I hope we will eliminate some of the anomalies which now exist.  I appreciate that in this Bill the Minister is trying to hold the level of payments in line with inflation.  That is praiseworthy.  On 22 February we had 223,909 people unemployed. They have 200,000 dependent children.  Our dwindling workforce have to provide support for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill provides for increases in the various rates of social welfare payments.  He said the second objective of the Bill is to give practical effect to the Government's equally firm resolve to stamp out abuses of the social welfare code which was clearly stated in the economic plan published a few months ago.  I welcome that because in <Col N="2147" /> no way will I condone abuses which take their full entitlement from those who are really deserving.  The Minister said unemployment reduced the number who through the PRSI system help to finance the social insurance scheme.  The numbers employed are dwindling.  This is unfortunate.  I hope the national plan will help to resolve this major problem which now confronts the nation.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the problem which confronted the Minister.  He had to fight extremely hard to hold these payments in line with inflation.  Most other Departments suffered cutbacks; but the Minister, Deputy Desmond, fought hard to ensure that those levels of payment were maintained.  I am critical of the recent budget.  If we are to tackle those who abuse the social welfare system, we must also attack with the same vigour those who are evading tax.  This could be achieved by lifting the embargo on employment in the public sector.  There is widespread evasion because there are not sufficient tax inspectors in the field. The Minister referred to the leakage in the system.  I hope that with more people in the field he will be able to stamp out this leakage, which is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about those who are referred to as sickness visitors.  I am not suggesting that the people who are engaged in this activity would abuse the system on purpose.  To give people power to say to a doctor: &ldquo;In my opinion such a person is fit for work&rdquo; could be embarrassing in many cases and extremely damaging.  I ask the Minister to have a further look at that.  I am a little puzzled at the Minister's reference to absenteeism. I would have thought this would be in the area of the Department of Labour. However, any contribution which can improve this situation is welcome.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated by Deputy McCarthy's criticism of the backlog in the system. The Minister referred to computerisation within the Department of Social Welfare. The Deputy contended that there was a massive delay in effecting payments.  It is no worse than it was when Deputy Woods <Col N="2148" /> was Minister for Health and Social Welfare when it was commonly acknowledged that if one was a Dublin Deputy one received preferential treatment. Indeed, they even went so far then as to stop the computer, stacking it by hand, to investigate complaints made by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  That is not happening now and we are all being treated equally.  I hope that the streamlining of this service will eliminate such delays about which all Members have had to complain in the past.  Problems arise from time to time about which we must make representations but they are not nearly so prevalent as they were under the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister dealt with voluntary workers in developing countries.  The regulations he proposes introducing are indeed to be welcomed and are long overdue.  There have been many young girls and boys who gave of their time and skills helping those in developing countries to return home only to discover they had no social insurance entitlements.  The fact that the Minister has recognised that problem and that discussions are continuing is to be welcomed and is something on which he should be complimented.</P>
    <P>There is reference also to the Combat Poverty Agency, the pilot scheme in respect of which was established by the then Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Frank Cluskey, between the years 1973 and 1977.  Their report was published in 1978-79.  I regard this agency as a natural follow-through of that pilot scheme.  Some of the then projects created problems, drawing reaction on the part of the authorities which indicated to me that the people assigned to investigation of these problems had discovered some of the things which were not right and which embarrassed some people.  The purpose of that scheme was to investigate and, where necessary, remedy any faults found within the various State agencies.  They taught people how to come to grips with the bureaucracy.  I am happy to note that the relevant Bill has now been circulated for discussion in the Seanad and I hope it <Col N="2149" /> will be before this House before very long.</P>
    <P>I note an increased sum of £650,000 is being made available in respect of grants to voluntary organisations this year.  Of all the budgetary expenditure this is where there will be greatest value had for money.  The amount of work achieved and the projects aided by the small amounts of money allocated to date have to be witnessed to be believed.  Before the expiry of the lifetime of this Government I would hope we would see greater expenditure in this area.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about some sections of this Bill and about the social welfare code generally.  I shall refer to these reservations and to redundancy payments &mdash; also referred to by Deputy McCarthy &mdash; which constitute a major problem in my constituency.  As the House will be aware there have been many redundancies in the Cork region in recent years with major labour intensive industries having gone to the wall.  I might refer in particular to Fords, Dunlops, Verolme (Cork) Dockyard, the Eagle Printing Works employing over 200 people, likewise Lunhams bacon factory. Problems now arise as a result of redundancy payments received.  If Deputy McCarthy thought he was embarrassing me in this respect he would be mistaken because the very nature of the Labour Party is that we allow open discussion in a civilised manner.  Therefore, it is quite legitimate for me to question the Minister in regard to this problem.  I have already discussed the matter with him.  Although we have not reached full agreement, I hope he will accept the point of view I put to him.  I accept that it is difficult to differentiate between capital earned on redundancy payments and that earned from other sources.  But in this case there are not 100 or 200 but in excess of 2,000 people now affected by these redundancy payments, people who probably will never again work in the course of their lifetime.</P>
    <P>That is a measure of the problem. These are people who in many cases for up to 40 years contributed to the social welfare system who never once made a <Col N="2150" /> claim against the State for unemployment or similar benefits.  They now find themselves for the first time having to come to grips with the intricacies of the situation. The Minister may make the point that the method employed by his Department in assessing income from capital at less than 10 per cent &mdash; the system now obtaining &mdash; is more favourable to an applicant than that financial institutions currently pay on sizeable deposits, that is, 15 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that there is no comparison whatsoever between the financial institutions and people now finding themselves unemployed as a result of having been made redundant.  Such people are now whittling away their capital &mdash; acquired for the first time in their lives in many cases &mdash; and will continue to do so until they are penniless when they will then benefit.  If ever there was a recipe for unrest it is this.  Rather would I prefer to tackle the problem now saying: we will create a situation in which your statutory redundancy entitlement will be completely ignored and in respect of anything above those entitlements a case can be made so that there would be a threshold figure introducing the 10 per cent.  I would suggest that the statutory entitlement be doubled, that the 10 per cent then be hived off or, if you like, penalise at that rate.  But to treat such people in the same way as financial institutions is not at all acceptable.  These people daily encounter tremendous problems and the method of assessment creates much embarrassment. For example, people are being asked for receipts in respect of items they have purchased.  In many cases they do not possess such receipts, rendering them unable to claim unemployment benefit because there cannot be a proper assessment of their income undertaken.  In a communication from the Minister he says that it would be better to use the additional funds available for the benefit of those people with no means and particularly for the benefit of the long term unemployed.  That may be a sensible approach but I would contend that there <Col N="2151" /> are other sources from which the money could be got.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to tax evasion and I do so again because such yields would constitute a means of providing the necessary finance for benefits.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials would reexamine the position, coming up with an effective package in this respect because it constitutes a grave injustice.  Despite Deputy McCarthy's attempted exploitation of my statement I adhere to the same view and shall not change.  I very much regret that I must be at variance with the Minister in this respect.  The Government have a duty and it would be remiss of me if I did not bring that to their attention. I would be failing in my duty as a Deputy, representing what is by far the part of the country most ravaged by unemployment, if I did not do so.</P>
    <P>There are many areas of the present system warranting some adjustment because the system as it obtains does not favour many applicants.  In many cases anomalies could be eliminated without extra cost while, in others it could be done at little cost.</P>
    <P>I wish to express concern about young married couples and single people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance. Single people in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit who now get £37.25 per week will receive an increase to £39.50 per week.  They will barely survive on that money.  If you do not have any insurance entitlement and are in receipt of unemployment assistance, the picture is not very bright.  The rate for a single person goes from £30.90 per week to £32.75 per week.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCarthy's remarks about single people living with their parents.  A single person who applies for unemployment assistance is means tested on the income coming into the house.  This is an unjust system; adults are entitled to stand on their own two feet and to a dignified way of living whether they live with their family or on their own and I ask the Minister to investigate this.</P>
    <P>Single people under the age of 66, <Col N="2152" /> living alone, seem to be the forgotten people.  Those in receipt of unemployment assistance will now receive £32.75 per week which is not sufficient to live on in a dignified manner.  Unlike Deputy McCarthy, I will try to offer a solution which the Minister might accept.  The minimum entitlement should be brought up to the level of the non-contributory old age pension, the new rate of £44 per week.  There is justification for this because we should not penalise people who live alone, bearing in mind that they do not qualify for some other benefits.  I know there is a problem financially in keeping the system ticking over but the sum of £44 should be given to these people.  Young persons living alone should also qualify for this amount.</P>
    <P>The widows' and orphans' non-contributory pension scheme should be rounded up to the non-contributory old age pension rate of £44 as I fail to see why we should differentiate between the two rates.  There is also an anomaly with regard to widows under the age of 66 years.  In the case of a married couple, when the husband over the age of 66 years dies, if his widow is under that age her free television licence and electricity allowance will be withdrawn.  This is indefensible and to claw back this benefit from bereaved persons is very harsh. Death deals a savage blow to any family and withdrawing these facilities denotes a lack of compassion.  In many cases the difference in age between married persons is not great and I do not think it would cost a great deal to continue the benefits to the widow or widower.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to consider the plight of married couples living on unemployment allowances; they should also be brought up to the rate of the non-contributory old age pension, £44 per week, with a proportionate increase for dependent children.  We should not discriminate against any section of the community.  I should also like to draw attention to the duration of unemployment assistance.  There is a long term and a short term duration and I do not know the reason for the differentiation between the two.  However, it will be a <Col N="2153" /> disincentive to work on a short term basis if this system is continued.  If a person in receipt of long term duration unemployment assistance secures employment for a period of six months, he or she would, on cessation of employment, revert to unemployment assistance of short term duration rate which penalises those at work.  After 156 days, a person who goes off long term benefit reverts to special rate unemployment benefit which is less than the maximum rate of unemployment assistance.  We have already spoken about disincentives to work but this is by far the greatest.  The amounts involved are not great, perhaps £1 or £2, but, as a colleague aptly described it, the sum of £1 or £2 could be the difference between eating on Wednesday or waiting until the following day when the assistance is due. This matter could easily be remedied and the cost would not be outlandish.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Bill in regard to free travel but I wish to make a few comments on that matter.  The list of eligible persons for free travel mentions persons receiving invalidity pensions, disabled person's maintenance allowance, blind persons aged 18 years and over and all persons aged 66 years and over residing within the State.  In the case of a married couple, spouses ineligible for free travel in their own right can accompany their partner.  However, there are those who do not have a husband or wife but, nevertheless require a travelling companion.  This applies particularly to mentally and physically handicapped children.  They cannot travel alone and a parent or guardian must accompany them.</P>
    <P>People who are unmarried and who are in receipt of disabled person's benefit should be afforded the same treatment as people who are in receipt of old age pension.  That is a fair request and I am asking the Minister to consider it seriously.  Likewise, blind persons of 18 and over are entitled to free travel but they are not always in a position to travel on their own.  They are able to travel on their own in surroundings that are familiar but train or bus journeys to places not familiar to them would present <Col N="2154" /> problems because blind people would become disorientated in strange surroundings. They would not be able to gauge the distance travelled.</P>
    <P>The same applies to disabled persons. They may be well able to go from one place to another in their wheelchairs but have difficulty in entering or leaving buses.  Bus conductors and, in the case of a one-man bus, drivers, are not allowed time to cope with the problems of the disabled in regard to transport and consequently it is necessary that the disabled person be accompanied while travelling. These difficulties should have been resolved long ago.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly in the area of free travel relates to the position of former employees of the State who must retire early on health grounds and who, within the terms of their employment, were not required to make insurance contributions. They do not qualify for free travel or for the many other entitlements that would apply in the case of those who were contributing to the insurance scheme.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is responsible for this in any way but something should be done about it because it is discriminatory.  The number of people involved would not be very big and the cost to the State would be negligible.</P>
    <P>There have been many suggestions regarding ways of solving our unemployment problem.  Greater mobility of the work force has been advocated by many speakers but that is merely a euphemism for emigration.  Those of us who grew up in the fifties are well aware of the unhappiness caused in those times by emigration, when most of the traffic was in the one direction.  Many of our friends had to go away with the consequent upheaval this caused in many homes. That is not the type of mobility I would welcome.  However, in recent years there has been a demand abroad for the skills that some of our workforce can provide on a short term contract basis.  Usually these contracts include regular, perhaps bi-monthly, trips home.  The contracts can prove lucrative for the individual, for his family and for the State.  However, my cause for concern in this area relates <Col N="2155" /> to the difficulties experienced by these people after their contracts have expired and they return home.  Recently I was made aware of the case of a man who worked for three years in Germany but who has not received any unemployment benefit since his return home in October last.  The reason for this is that in order to be eligible for benefit he needs one stamp or, in other words, to be employed for a week.  As there is no demand here for his skill, it is difficult for him to fulfil that requirement.  I appreciate that the problem in this regard arises from EC Directive 148 of 1971 relating to the payment of unemployment benefit to migrant workers.  The regulation came into force on 1 April 1973 and is within the terms of Article 67 of the Treaty.  In order to rectify the matter, I realise that we would have to go beyond this House but we should consider taking steps in that direction because the regulation is creating serious problems for those who have had to go away to seek work but who have now returned.  It is not right that they should be penalised on their return.</P>
    <P>On the question of appeals, I accept the figures given by the Minister regarding the number of people who were examined medically recently and found to be fit for work.  There is a serious hold up in this whole system and the delays are related to the method of appeal.  If a person is examined by a medical referee and deemed fit for work, many problems can arise if he challenges that decision. In many cases there is conflict between the evidence offered by the applicant's GP and the Department's doctor.  The appeal is made to non-medical persons. I trust that some effort will be made to speed up the process.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs investigating is the area of transfer to invalidity pension. A person who had been in receipt of disability benefit for 12 months can apply for invalidity pension but unlike the case of other pensions, it is not possible for an applicant to obtain the appropriate application form at a post office. Usually the applicant approaches his <Col N="2156" /> local TD or councillor asking the public representative to make representations on his behalf.  I do not think anyone here would be reluctant to make such representation but there should be no difficulty in having the application forms available readily for those who require them.</P>
    <P>In the event of an applicant being refused transfer from disability to invalidity pension, the waiting period is about six months before he can reapply.  I have known people to be in receipt of invalidity pension for seven years and to have been told on three separate occasions to reapply within a period of six months.  I do not think any doctor worthy of calling himself a doctor would allow a person continue on disability benefit for seven years if he considered that person to be fit for work.  This is an area needing urgent investigation because it is giving rise to many problems.  I trust that my criticism has been constructive and that it will help to bring about a system that is a little more efficient and humane.  That is the purpose of my criticism.</P>
    <P>I was a little amused, if one could be amused in such a serious debate, by some of the statistics trotted out by Deputy McCarthy in his speech.  In respect of the introductory dates for some of the benefits &mdash; 1 July and 4 July in some cases &mdash; he adopted the attitude that even yesterday was too late for some of the payments.  He picked out the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 when he told us Fianna Fáil introduced benefits in April.  I should like somebody to do some research and find out who first deferred the date of introduction of benefits.  It certainly was not a Labour Party Minister.  It was most unjust and it was a deliberate effort by the Deputy to distort what the Minister was trying to do against a background of scarce finances.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised, particularly those concerning the reckoning of redundancy payments as they affect unemployment assistance.  This matter is creating hardship and it will cause major problems not only in Cork but throughout the country. I do not think the Government should have to depend on the money they <Col N="2157" /> will save by reducing the entitlement of people.  This matter needs compassionate consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to attempt to set the record straight regarding the extraordinary nature and content of a number of statements of members of the Cabinet in recent days regarding the provisions in the budget as set out in this Bill which were presumed to cater adequately for the least privileged. I listened intently to Deputy O'Sullivan and I must compliment him for his frankness and his honesty in facing up to a number of anomalies.  I am not saying that all of the anomalies have crept into the social welfare code in recent days but they are there and they need to be addressed by the Minister of the day. There is little point in talking about what happened five or six years ago in relation to anomalies and inequities.  If a system is wrong it is wrong and it should be tackled by the person at whose desk the buck stops.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach spoke in the budget debate on 7 February referring to social welfare provisions he said:</P>
      <P>The budget itself represents a watershed. It marks the end of a period of rising taxation and falling living standards.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach be serious?  Does he really believe what he said on that occasion?  Does he think that the provisions of this Bill will halt the falling living standards of the hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability pension or old age pension?  If that is so, he is living in cloud cuckoo land and it is time somebody brought him down to earth.  It is time somebody pointed out to him the reality of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am more inclined to the view that the Government are fully aware of the situation, are fully aware of the plight of the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the aged but they choose cynically to disregard it.  Either way, the <Col N="2158" /> statement by the Taoiseach is extraordinary in that it proposes to represent the reality when it does not do that.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare have said in the past few months, with tongue in check, that they were catering adequately for social welfare recipients this year.  Yet, the rates are among the lowest on record and payments are again deferred for more than half a year.  The processing work of the Department in respect of new claims and appeals for means-related benefit is taking an inordinate amount of time.  The supplementary benefit scheme was dismantled to a considerable degree last year and the previous year by the Minister and it appears that the scheme is getting a further bashing this year, if my interpretation of the provisions of this Bill is correct.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not take adequate account of the wholesale diminution of services in the past two years by the Minister and the Government.  Their record is one of disaster and is an absolute disgrace when I take account of all my contacts with my constituents.  I contend that my experience is reasonably typical of what obtains in the Dublin area.  The Minister's bland statement today in this House will do nothing to save him or his party from what I believe is the deep-rooted wrath of the public which they will express when they get the opportunity to do so in an election.</P>
    <P>Now that the dust is beginning to settle on the diversionary tactics that were operated recently by the Government, there is a growing realisation among the public that the brunt of this year's budget is being carried by social welfare recipients. The Minister's party in Government are prepared to abandon their own people as the price for holding on to power.  I can see no other reason for their taking decisions that were extremely unpopular and that created enormous hostility among the public.  There can be no other logical or reasonable explanation for what they are doing or for the measures they have agreed to so readily. Even at this late stage we ask them to tell <Col N="2159" /> their Minister that this Bill is an insult to those whom he and his party pretend to represent.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an integral part of budgetary policy and strategy.  It is not possible to take the social welfare element and divorce it from the others.  All are part of the overall arithmetic of the budget.  The degree of realism in the budget is affected by the degree of realism of the arithmetic of each of its constituent parts.  Likewise, each of the parts is affected in some way by the rest.</P>
    <P>In the budgetary framework an average figure of 217,000 recipients of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance were assumed for the next 12 months.  That was stated quite clearly by the Taoiseach in this House on the day the budget was presented.  That assumption was made against a background of 223,000 then unemployed, a figure that has subsequently increased considerably to 234,000.  There was no evidence towards the end of 1984 that the rate of increase in unemployment had slowed down to such an extent as to suggest that there would be a substantial reduction in the total unemployment figure at the end of this year or early 1986.  If the figure of 217,000 has been taken as the average and this social welfare Bill is supposed to be catering for that, its relevance must be judged in terms of the accuracy with which it forecasts the extent of the services that will be required and the degree to which it commits itself to provide that service.  One must immediately ask if an assumed average of 217,000 on unemployment benefit and assistance for the period in question is realistic.  If one starts from the position of 234,000 unemployed with a net increase in unemployment of 8,000 to 9,000 per month, how does one arrive at an average of 217,000 over a 12 month period?  Surely it must assume a massive net monthly increase in employment for some part of that period.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to respect the independence of the RTE Authority in the exercise of its statutory obligation to appoint a Director-General of RTE.</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil reject the Minister's amendment which is totally inaccurate as the Minister and the Government have by their action over the past 11 days seriously undermined the impartiality and integrity of the RTE Authority and organisation.  I call on Deputies on all sides to support our motion which will restore the credibility and impartiality of RTE if passed by this House.  It is my view that the illegal directive of the Minister for Communications, of 1 March 1985, on the instructions of the Taoiseach, was blatant political interference with the RTE Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind this House of the events leading up to this major crisis in broadcasting since the formation of the RTE Authority in 1961 under the 1960 Act.  In autumn 1984, advertisements were placed in the national and international newspapers regarding the forthcoming vacancy for the position of Director-General of RTE on the retirement of Mr. George Waters, after distinguished service, at the end of March 1985.  According to Mr. Philp Molloy of <i>The Irish Press</i>, Friday, 8 March 1985, the Minister had a meeting with Mr. Fred O'Donovan, Chairman of RTE, on 7 January 1985 and told him to go ahead with the appointment of RTE's sixth Director-General. That was ten days before the first set of interviews began on 17 January <Col N="2161" /> 1985.  I understand final interviews took place with the assistance of outside management consultants, MSL, on 1 February 1985.  At 9.30 a.m. on that day, one hour before the final interviews, the Minister called in Mr. Fred O'Donovan to request the postponement of the interviews as he proposed to make a major statement in three weeks time.  This was clear, raw political interference into the running of RTE and a clear breach of the 1960 Broadcasting Act and was not in accordance with the Minister's interview given to Gerald Barry of <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> on 4 November 1984, which stated:</P>
    <P>Jim Mitchell insists it would be &ldquo;absolutely wrong to interfere with the authority's right to make the appointment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The article dealt with the forthcoming vacancy in RTE and the Minister was clearly asked to state his position in this regard.  He stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Maybe this will show that there is no political involvement in who gets the job&rdquo;, the Minister adds.</P>
    <P>Once the authority has decided on its choice it will forward it to the Minister who formally makes the appointment. Only one name is submitted and no Minister has ever exercised a veto.  Mr. Mitchell says he will not be the exception unless they put forward &ldquo;some outrageous name&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1985 the Authority were scheduled to finalise the selection of a person under section 11 of the 1960 Broadcasting Act as Director-General of RTE.  They were prevented from carrying out their statutory duty when the Minister delivered the following letter by courier, a directive to the Authority in illegal breach of the 1960 Act.  I want to place on record the letter of 1 March 1985 from the Office of the Minister for Communications, Dublin 2, because it has a major bearing on this very serious issue which is affecting our national broadcasting organisation.  It was <Col N="2162" /> addressed to Mr. Fred O'Donovan, Chairman, RTE Authority and read:</P>
    <P>Dear Chairman,</P>
    <P>I refer to my letter of the 1st February and our telephone conversation last night.</P>
    <P>I have decided to appoint consultants to undertake a fundamental review of RTE's organisation, structures, and finances.  I enclose a copy of the detailed terms of reference.  The consultants will be appointed in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>This review is timely because of several major developments in broadcasting arising at this time.  The considerations prompting the decision to carry out this review are set out in the attached note.</P>
    <P>I confirm that no further action, regarding the selection of any name for the post of Director-General should be taken by the Authority.  It will be necessary to await the outcome of the review to see how this affects the requirements of the post.</P>
    <P>As I told you on the telephone I propose to meet the Authority in the next few weeks to discuss this review and other related matters.  Perhaps you will let me know when the next monthly meeting of the Authority is due to be held as I will make every endeavour to be available on that day.</P>
    <P>The letter was signed: Jim Mitchell, T.D., Minister for Communications.</P>
    <P>This action was properly dismissed by the Authority when, on 4 March 1985, they formally met in Montrose and agreed to recommend Mr. John Sorohan as Director-General of RTE.  The Minister has rejected this recommendation without any grounds, only political interference with the affairs of RTE.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last in reply to a Private Notice Question the Minister stated, and I quote from column 1277, volume 356 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I want to categorically assure the House that in so far as there was any <Col N="2163" /> political consideration it was to diminish not to increase political interference in RTE.  Moreover, all my actions in relation to appointments to semi-State bodies under my area of responsibility since I first became Minister have been directed at acquiring the highest degree of competence.  Any neutral observer will see that political affiliation has not been a factor in the appointments I have made to boards of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister that in the appointments since he became Minister he has shown clear, blatant political involvement.  I do not wish to drag up issues relating to the affairs of Sheriff Street when Deputy Mitchell was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1983, but I am prepared to do so to demonstrate the Minister's direct involvement in matters for which he has no direct responsibility. On 28 February 1983 the Minister said in an internal memorandum in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs:</P>
    <P>The Minister has directed that the results of the interviews for Cleaners which are being conducted by your Branch at present should be submitted to him for approval before any appointments are made.  He has also directed that this procedure is to be adhered to in relation to future Cleaner competitions, until further notice.</P>
    <P>Please forward your proposals for the filling of the vacancies to An Rúnaí, E.B. Local Appointments Section at an early date.</P>
    <P>That clearly demonstrates that his concern not only applies to the position of Director-General of RTE but applied to the cleaning staff in Sheriff Street.  The Minister was proved to be directly involved in those appointments, and the old dog has not learned any new tricks since then.  He is now clearly involved in the appointment of the Director-General of RTE.  By your deeds we shall judge you, not by your statements which have no real meaning.  I am disappointed that <Col N="2164" /> the Minister is not here tonight to listen to the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister appointed Mr. Frank Flannery, one of the national handlers as a member of the RTE Authority.  Mr. Flannery is a permanent member of the Fine Gael party and one of the gurus who organised the last general election campaign.  I understand that he has already been promised the chairmanship of the new national handlers RTE Authority. We will see in time if this will come to fruition or if the controversy has prevented further politicisation of RTE by the Government.  The new Authority will be appointed in June and I have no doubt that Mr. Frank Flannery will be involved in the new Authority.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for Communications and with special responsibility for RTE was kept fully informed as regards the internal affairs of RTE.  The Minister was also aware that a prominent Fine Gael man, the former head of Government propaganda was not emerging as a successful candidate for appointment as Director-General of RTE and that action would have to be taken to prevent the appointment of a selected person by fair means or by foul.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach Deputy Garret FitzGerald intervened in this matter and directed the Minister for Communications to use section 13 of the Act to prevent the legal and impartial appointment of a successful candidate for position of Director-General.  An excuse had to be found by the Minister to justify this decision due to the fact that he had already given a public commitment on 4 November 1984 in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> when he stated &ldquo;Jim Mitchell insists it would be absolutely wrong to interfere with the Authority's right to make the appointment.  Maybe this will show that there is no political involvement in who gets the job,&rdquo; the Minister added.  The outcome of this affair clearly implicates the Minister and the Government in political activities of the lowest possible form into the management of RTE our national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> It is on the record that no previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs intervened in the selection process of the appointment of a Director-General of RTE.  The same cannot be said for previous Coalition Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister should come clean.  There should be a detailed public examination of this affair from the start.  The fact that a person legitimately selected and recommended by the Authority is now being rejected due to the fact that the Minister wishes to have a totally politicised Director-General of RTE is a public scandal.  No Fianna Fáil Minister for Posts and Telegraphs intervened in the selection process in the appointment of a Director-General of RTE.  The same cannot be said for previous Coalitions.</P>
    <P>On the RTE 1 TV programme &ldquo;Sunday Review,&rdquo; on 10 March 1985 the former chairman of the RTE Authority Mr. Donal Ó Moráin stated that Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs intervened in the appointment of a Director-General for RTE to prevent appointment of Oliver Maloney, the successful candidate.  I challenge Dr. O'Brien to confirm or refute this very serious allegation.</P>
    <P>On last Thursday, 7 March 1985, in the course of a debate regarding the appointment of a Director-General to RTE Deputy Garret FitzGerald made a most extraordinary statement.  I quote: &ldquo;That this Government seeks, has any intention, or would tolerate, a politicisation of RTE: I believe that it is of vital importance that RTE be free from political control, influence or bias, that it be as independent as we can make it.  It is not, and should never be, an arm of Government policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what this Government are prepared to do with RTE and the end result of this alleged study is to take over control of RTE by appointment of a Fine Gael Authority and a national handlers Director-General; under these circumstances a short contract would be recommended. The Government over the last 2¼ years has made political appointments to all State boards.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government <Col N="2166" /> have consistently appointed Fine Gael and Labour supporters to semi-State organisations.  Only recently Mr. Joey Murrin the unsuccessful Fine Gael candidate for Connacht-Ulster in the European elections was appointed paid chairman of BIM.  Mr. Vincent Ferguson, Fine Gael Financial adviser, was appointed as a director of the Central Bank and of the Arts Council.  Mr. Martin McCullough was appointed a director and chairman of the Arts Council.  Mr. Niall Fennelly, Senior Counsel, was appointed to head the Legal Aid Board.  Mr. Neil Holman was appointed head of the National Board of Science and Technology and Mr. Frank Flannery was appointed to both the RTE Authority and the National Rehabilitation Board and possibly as the head of the new lottery company which the Government propose.</P>
    <P>Of course, family members of this Government are not excluded from appointments to semi-State organisations. We have clear evidence of the appointment of Mrs. Eithne Fitzgerald, daughter-in-law of the Taoiseach, to the Commission on Social Welfare.  Mrs. Brid Dukes, sister-in-law of the Minister for Finance, was appointed to the Arts Council.  Dr. John G. Cooney, the brother of Mr. Patrick Cooney, Minister for Defence was appointed to the head of the Health Education Board.  There are other examples of political patronage of a very blatant and sinister type.  The Taoiseach cannot come into this House and project his image of the clean, cool hero of Irish politics.  The Taoiseach has by his actions shown that he is prepared to appoint only Fine Gael national handlers, and Labour Party supporters to the semi-State organisations.  Yet, the Taoiseach comes before the House and before the people and states that he will not appoint people because of their political affiliations. The truth is evident and I challenge the Government to refute the names I stated in the House and to come clean on all political appointments since he became Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Without the appointment of a Director-General for the next six months, or more than likely twelve months, RTE <Col N="2167" /> will be in a limbo state without leadership, a ship without a captain in very troubled waters.  With outside consultants roaming the complex examining the books and affairs of RTE the morale of the management and staff will be undermined. Who will make major decisions for the development of new programmes for the years ahead?</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister for Communications that in 1971 a broadcasting review committee was set up to review the progress of radio and television since 1960 and to make recommendations for future development.  I understand that RTE submitted 108 memoranda to this commission.  Again in 1981 the Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored bodies carried out an inquiry into RTE. The committee's report was generally supportive of RTE.  The present Oireachtas Committee have already appointed outside consultants to carry out a position audit and report findings to the joint committee.</P>

      <P>This appointment was approved by Government &mdash; an example of duplication &mdash; and exposes the fraud in the Minister's argument that he was making an appointment of outside consultants. In summary, the Minister for Communications has politically intervened in RTE.  He has undermined the impartiality and integrity of the RTE Authority and he has inflicted serious damage on the future of our national broadcasting organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Communications and to the Government to carry out their statutory duty and approve the appointment of a new Director-General of RTE in accordance with the 1960 Act. Anything less will be seen by the public as clear political involvement in RTE. The Government have involved themselves in very sinister operations in relation to this whole matter.  This will be seen in future as having a most serious and damaging effect on our national <Col N="2168" /> broadcasting organisation and on the independence, impartiality and integrity of RTE.  I appeal to the Government and the Minister to let RTE carry out their statutory responsibility in regard to the Director-General.  Our effort has been good in relation to RTE.  In my time associated with the Department I never interfered or intervened and I ask the Minister now present and Deputy Mitchell not to interfere further with the impartiality and integrity of the RTE Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has become a major blow to Irish broadcasting and to the integrity of this House. I act as vice-chairman of the all-party committee appointed by the House. During 1983 the committee placed an advertisement asking those interested in RTE to contact the committee.  The Government were notified of that and could not have been unaware of it.  The committee formally wrote to the Authority in July 1984 and asked them to meet us on 25 July.  They replied that their accounts were not ready and asked us, please, to wait until they had the accounts.  We waited until October 1984 when we reactivated our inquiry.  We agreed on terms of reference for consultants who at the time became available. Early in 1985 we sought the approval of the Department of the Public Service to that appointment.  Again, we contacted RTE and on 18 February we got a letter formally welcoming the reactivating of our consultants and promising them full co-operation.  The consultants were continuing their work when the Minister intervened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the reply the Minister gave when he said that the committee were only going to spend £5,000 on an audit for a desk job.  He said that his consultants were bigger and better and more experienced and that the committee's consultants should stand aside and let the experts at it.  Our terms of reference to our consultants were to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the station, the quality of profit, the capital structure, the cash flow position.  They were asked <Col N="2169" /> to give an assessment of the current and potential problems, to examine technological development, obsolescence, renewal, and to make comments on the way capital expenditure is agreed.  They were asked to look at borrowing and other liabilities, at details of major contracts and the way such contracts would be handled.  They were to look at the subsidiary operations of RTE and their ancillary companies.  The consultants were asked to examine the industrial relations structure.</P>
    <P>Those terms of reference were nearly as all-embracing as they could be but the Minister said that that was only a desk job.  That is the way the committee have always worked.  First, the consultants probe in a shallow way and if it was decided that a major probe became necessary we would send in the army of consultants to tear the place apart.  I refute the Minister's suggestion that our consultants were like mice crawling about the place.  He could have available to him the job that our consultants had done, sanctioned by a Department, and then he could have decided whether further probing was necessary.  He decided to ignore the committee as he did in regard to Irish Shipping.  We know the Minister's terms of reference for his consultants and I cannot understand how they differ from ours.</P>
    <P>This has made for unnecessary and wasteful duplication of effort.  I would remind the Minister that we are a body of full time professional politicians who examined these matters for months and in the process spent public money.  But we were ignored.  If the Government want committees to work they should not treat them as simple advisory bodies but as committees who have a place in the central parliamentary process.  I agree RTE need to be reviewed, particularly if we examine the annual report for 1983, from which I will read:</P>
    <P>The level of financing of the broadcasting services is not adequate, in the opinion of the Authority, to provide the level and quality of services required to compete more effectively <Col N="2170" /> with those receivable from overseas by over 50% of the potential television audience.  The Authority would wish to increase the proportion and variety of its home originated programming on television but this is not possible with current levels of financing.  In its previous report the Authority drew attention to the critical state of its finances. This situation has not altered appreciably and the Authority is seriously concerned that it is unable to finance its capital expenditure requirements from the existing level of resources available to it.  This is inhibiting the renewal of production equipment now urgently required to meet the Authority's programming needs and to provide the service expected by the public.  This problem can only be redressed by the generation of adequate surpluses each year and this requires a more regular increase of the television licence fee than has applied heretofore.</P>
    <P>That is the most recent comment from RTE.  In 1979 RTE lost £500,000, in 1980 they made a profit of £50,000, in 1981 they lost £2.5 million, in 1982 the loss was £6 million and the following year they made a profit of £89,584.  That was bad enough &mdash; not fatal but it is worrying and I share the views expressed in the RTE report.</P>
    <P>I want to criticise very strongly not just RTE to whom this debate applies, but all of the semi-State companies who had the cheek to produce 1983 annual accounts to this House on 2 January 1985.  You would not run a sweet shop like that. These accounts cover from October 1982 to September 1983 and we got them here in this House published in January 1985. If we are to make any real attempt to run this station then these accounts must be got out within two or three months of the year end and they must be brought out not every year but every six months.</P>
    <P>Why do we not start with the ordinary commercial requirement of getting our accounts out on time?  It is scandalous that we had to wait until January 1985 for accounts covering October 1982 to <Col N="2171" /> September 1983.  You cannot run a station without that kind of information and it is no wonder that they need consultants. If they had those accounts on time they would have had their consultants sooner and they would not have had this mess with the Director-General.  Two thousand people are employed out there in RTE and they deserve better than the shabby treatment meted out to them. Whoever is responsible for delaying those accounts should be interviewed very shortly, whether it is RTE, the Department, the Auditor General's office or whoever it is.  Whoever is responsible for that delay has a great deal to answer for because it is a major factor in the difficulties in which we find ourselves now.</P>
    <P>I know that RTE face threats from all sorts of sources.  Nearly 60 per cent of homes in the Republic will have multichannel viewing within the next couple of years.  They are under pressure from advertising sources to make decisions about satellite, cable and so on.  Why does the Minister feel that he must take account of these trends?  Why are we appointing boards to these companies and then asking Ministers to make decisions about the long term strategic future of the companies?  If we appoint a board of any semi-State company then that board should look at the long term developments of the company and take into account developments down the road. Why appoint a board and then have to bark?  Is that not the central question that we must address in this House about semi-State companies generally?  Here it has popped up again.  Perhaps in that regard the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 &mdash; 15 years ago &mdash; should now be amended or rewritten.  I would like to see the Joint Committee on Legislation or the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies look at that Act and see whether it can be updated.</P>
    <P>Enough has been said about political interference and I do not want to add greatly to it, but I must say that the Minister in dealing with this matter under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, as <Col N="2172" /> I read that Act should have waited to get the name of the appointee and he was then entitled under the Act to turn down that name if he wished.  Did the Minister do that?  He did not.  Instead he interfered in the process that was going on in the station and sought to prevent a name coming to him.  I have yet to be convinced that the Minister for Communications did not break the law in this regard.  I believe that the Minister's office has been in violation of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, by not waiting for the name to come to him and then, if he wished, exercising his legal duties.</P>
    <P>I read the Broadcasting Act, 1960, to say that the Minister can turn down a name, veto it, but I do not read it to say that he can prevent a name coming to him or seek to do so.  Anybody reading that Act objectively would have to come to the conclusion that the Minister's interference was a violation of the 1960 Act.  If it was not, I would like to know whether the Minister's office has any advice on record from the Attorney General. Did the Government consult the Attorney General's office on this matter? If they did, what advice did they get from the Attorney General?  Allowing the RTE Authority to advertise the position in December and intervening after that can only amount to the shabby, appalling mess in which we have ended up here today.  Unfortunately, it has turned a very fine broadcasting station into a plaything for politicians.</P>
    <P>Over 20 applications were received for this post and the final interviewing was taking place on 1 February.  Just as it was taking place a letter arrived from the Minister suggesting that they stop.  The other letter arrived saying: &ldquo;I confirm that no further action should be taken.&rdquo; That arrived the morning the Authority sat down to make their appointment.  I am afraid that the record is quite clear. Even if one did not wish to make any political capital out of it, one must conclude objectively that the Minister in sending these two letters sought to prevent a name coming to him and in so seeking violated the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>We must do two things.  We must clear <Col N="2173" /> the question as to whether the Minister was correct and, if that is so, I want to hear from the Attorney General's office. If the Act of 1960 is in some way deficient, let us amend it urgently.  In my view, under that Act the Minister was not entitled to take the step he took and he acted illegally in that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the six months provision is a smoke screen.  The matter will take much longer than that by the time the consultants get in, get through the work, the new Authority is appointed coming up to June and they go through this whole process again.  The last process took from early December to the end of February &mdash; three months.  If it takes three months from the end of next June we will be up to next September and before the new person gets into the saddle we will be talking about the end of the year.  If the new person happens to be an outsider and must give notice, and the indications are that that is probable, then we are talking about a span of at least 12 months from now until the new Director-General takes up office.  The question must be asked again and again, what is to happen in that 12 month period?  Is the station not going to drift?  If my sums are right the absence of serious decision making in RTE in the next 12 months will cost that station over £2 million.  That will be the cost to the taxpayer.  The station will have a kind of lame duck administration and anybody in the US dealing with out-going Governments will tell you that lame duck administrations get the type of treatment meted out to people who have announced that they are going and have no power after they make that announcement. Considering all that, the Minister's action is totally inexplicible.</P>
    <P>Finally, as I have asked, if the Minister is now concerned about cable, satellite and technological advance, how come he is concerned about those matters in February 1985 and was not concerned about them in December 1984, some two months earlier?  That question has not yet been answered.  Did the Minister wake up in February 1985 and decide that this cable and satellite stuff was serious and that he must act on it?  He did not.  In <Col N="2174" /> February 1985 he saw emerging some names which were not to his liking, and he should have had the honesty to obey the Act, wait for a name to come to him and then simply say, &ldquo;No&rdquo; if he wished. He had that authority.  He chose the low road rather than the high road.  The high road was to wait for the name and then in a dignified fashion turn it down. Instead he interfered with the station and violated the Act, thereby bringing about a lame duck administration such as is there now which over the next 12 months will cost the station many millions of pounds, not because they are incompetent or inept but because they will not be able to make decisions.  They will not want to make decisions.  Everything that comes in will be put in the 1986 waiting tray on the plea that that cannot be decided because they are only holding the fort.  We all know what happens in companies where people are holding the fort.  They go down the tubes very quickly.  The financial state of this station in 12 months will have deteriorated very rapidly as a result of the Minister's action. Perhaps we can learn something from this debate.  If we get a new Broadcasting Act laying out clearly where we are going, what we are doing and the Minister's powers this debate may have been worth while, but I have my doubts.</P>

      <P>At the outset of this <Col N="2175" /> debate tonight we had an extraordinary change of tactics from Deputy Leyden. When this issue was debated last week Deputies Reynolds and other Members of the Opposition including Deputy Leyden said how difficult it was for the Minister for Communications and how he had been forced into this by some hidden hand.  Their sympathy was with the Minister, but on this occasion there is a total change of tactics.  The beginning of Deputy Leyden's speech was devoted to a mean and petty attack on the Minister. I do not know the reason for the change: obviously they found that their tactics over the past week were not working so they decided to change focus again.</P>
      <P>We had a recitation from Deputy Leyden about the various Fine Gael people, as he said, who were appointed to a number of boards, as if there was not any talent within Fine Gael, as if the talent of the people he mentioned was not known nationally and as if they could not make a contribution to the various State boards.  One name mentioned by Deputy Leyden was also mentioned by Deputy Brennan who also spoke here this evening.  They were objecting to the appointment of Bríd Dukes as a member of the Arts Council which comes under my aegis.  But in any consideration for such an appointment Bríd Dukes would have to be considered because of what she has done in relation to the Belltable in Limerick.  At least Deputy Brennan had the good manners and intelligence to withdraw his accusation.  I do not expect Deputy Leyden to do the same.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy's contribution although the temptation was strong.  The Deputy's contribution was far removed from the truth.  The temptation was almost irresistable when I considered the audacity of a Member from that side of the House in pursuing such an argument after 32 years <Col N="2176" /> of practice of the most objectionable kind in that area.</P>
      <P>In proposing this amendment to the motion I can state categorically that the Government fully support the concept that our national broadcasting service should be an independent voice in its day to day operations and that it be as independent as we can make it.  That autonomy and independence are fully enshrined and safeguarded in the Broadcasting Authority Acts.  It has to be said however that its autonomy is not unequivocal &mdash; RTE does not exist in a vacuum, far from it &mdash; and just as the Broadcasting Authority Acts confer certain freedoms, duties and obligations on RTE, so too do they impose certain statutory obligations on the Government and Minister for Communications.  It is the Minister who is responsible to this House for the overall discharge by RTE of its obligations and duties.  He has an obligation to this House and to the public at large to ensure not just that RTE fulfils its responsibilities efficiently and effectively but that RTE is in a position to play its full role in relation to the many new developments in broadcasting services that can be anticipated in the coming years and which are imminent.</P>
      <P>The context in which the Minister decided that it would be desirable to postpone the appointment of a new Director-General needs to be fully understood.  In the first instance, it must be realised that RTE, particularly over the last number of years, has not been healthy financially. This was referred to by Deputy Brennan. He went so far as to say that RTE required a review and, as far as I could gather, a different one from that which he and his committee were involved in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE has a substantial accumulated deficit and has in recent years been running a very high overdraft level.  There is also a view abroad &mdash; and I am not making a judgment on it one way or another &mdash; that RTE is a somewhat over-staffed and not particularly efficient organisation.  Deputy Brennan agreed with that.  It is these factors, combined with our desire to ensure that RTE can face the new broadcasting era from a <Col N="2177" /> position of strength, that have prompted the Government to commission a major consultancy study of RTE's overall operations.</P>
    <P>This study will be the most comprehensive ever undertaken in the 25 year history of the organisation and will cover such aspects as the suitability of the existing organisation's structures, the efficiency and effectiveness with which it carries out its functions, costs and staffing levels and its general ability to face the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that the results of this review could have a profound effect on RTE's future direction and, in turn, could have a major impact on the requirements of the post of Director-General in the years ahead and the qualifications necessary for the post.  It is in this context that the Minister took the very wise decision of requesting the Authority to hold off the appointment of a new Director-General for the time being.  It is a matter of some disappointment that the Authority felt unable to meet this reasonable request particularly when the Minister had indicated that he would wish to meet the Authority to explain and elaborate on his reasons for taking this action, as he has done.  They have created a most unfortunate situation for some of the individuals involved.  As an aside, perhaps I might remark that it seems extraordinary to me that in what I presume was a confidential selection process the short list of candidates seems to have been common knowledge among the public generally and published in the newspapers. This does not seem to have been a particularly satisfactory way of going about this sensitive appointment.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the new broadcasting era which we face and in order to put the consultancy study which we have now proposed for RTE into context, it would be useful if I elaborated somewhat on the major developments which we see over the next several years.</P>
    <P>The first and most obvious of these would be the development of local and community broadcasting services.  This has been too long delayed.  We have already set in train the necessary action <Col N="2178" /> to get these services off the ground.  As the Minister announced in his statement of 1 March, the Government have decided to appoint an interim local radio commission in advance of the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The commission will be chaired by Professor Colm Ó hEocha, President of University College, Galway, and lately the distinguished chairman of the New Ireland Forum.  The commission's task will be to undertake the necessary preliminary planning and organisational work so as to enable quick progress to be made in the setting up of legal local and community radio stations.</P>
    <P>The fact that we will have the commission shortly will greatly expedite the arrival of legal local radio as distinct from the illegal radio stations operating at present.  The commission will be able to do an enormous amount of work of a general technical nature prior to the passing of the Bill.  The period following the passing of the Bill and the going on the air of the first of our legal radio services will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>The development and expansion of these services has been greatly facilitated by the many additional broadcasting frequencies made available here at the broadcasting conference which was held in Geneva last November-December. The shortage of broadcasting frequencies heretofore has been a major stumbling block in the development of broadcasting services here.  This was perhaps most evident in the RTE situation where, for a number of years now, the major national radio service, Radio 1, has been required to share a VHF network with the Radio na Gaeltachta service.  Apart, therefore, from the frequencies which will increasingly become available for local and community services over the next few years, we also have sufficient frequencies for five national networks, three of which are currently available to meet RTE's requirements.  This will transform our radio position.  The arrival of local and community radio is only the beginning as far as radio is concerned.  Down the line there will be equally significant developments as improved technology becomes available and the cost of equipment <Col N="2179" /> decreases.  I can see an ongoing process of development in the local community radio services.</P>
    <P>The other major development which the Minister referred to last week was that of the imminence of satellite broadcasting services.  Examination of the proposals received in response to the Government's invitation last year for the provision of an Irish satellite network and an Irish direct satellite broadcasting service is near the stage where it will be possible to make a decision in principle regarding the award of the franchise.</P>
    <P>That represents a major move.  I rate that as being on a par with the launch of the television service in the early sixties. It is introducing a totally new dimension and, as far as Irish television viewing is concerned, the arrival of satellite television will make available to viewers here, through the satellites of other countries and our own satellite, a choice of between 15 and 20 stations.  Our satellite will give perfect reception using a small dish.  Our stations will be seen throughout Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the north of France, Germany, the south of Sweden and Norway and, to the west, by people working on the oil rigs if that materialises.  That will be available from the limited power given to us from our orbital position.  The larger countries have been given greater power as far as their satellites are concerned.  We will get TV reception from Spain, Portugal and most of the continent.  That movement will change the concept of TV as we know it now.  Those developments are not a long way down the line, they are around the corner.  Many countries are ready to put their direct broadcasting satellites into orbiting positions.</P>
    <P>Broadcast satellites present a tremendous opportunity for this country, not simply in terms of the possible industrial and technological spin-off that may be derived from it or the revenues which potentially may be derived from it, but also because, for the first time ever, it enables this country to reverse the one-way flow of broadcasting traffic into this country.  Deputies will be aware that we <Col N="2180" /> have in general had a very enlightened approach towards facilitating the free flow of external broadcast transmissions into this country and this is something that is now being encouraged at EC level as anyone who has studied the EC Green Paper on television without frontiers will attest.  Indeed, that document, as much as anything else, gives a clear indication of the kind of competitive broadcasting era we face in the future. Ministers of Culture in consultation in Council have been concerned about and discussing the disappearance of national frontiers for broadcasting purposes with the arrival of satellite TV.  They have been debating the enormous opportunities present in the cultural and co-production areas.  One way or another as the major television programme producer here, RTE will have a significant role to play in this new movement.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of the current controversy about the RTE Director-Generalship is the fact that sight seems to have been lost of the very important Cable Television Systems Committee Report published ten days ago.  This too is an area which will greatly affect RTE because RTE, through its subsidiary company Dublin Cablesystems Ltd.  is the largest supplier of cable television service in the country with some 200,000 subscribers.  There is little doubt but that Dublin Cablesystems network is approaching the end of its useful life.  Indeed, it has been noticeable recently in this House that some concern is being expressed, in the form of parliamentary questions, about the quality of service being provided by the company. Dublin Cablesystems will undoubtedly have to embark on a major investment programme over the next few years if they are to be in a position to offer the quality and range of services which subscribers will be demanding and if they are to compete sucessfully with direct broadcast satellite services and indeed other leisure services.  The Downes Report, as it is known, sets the framework for the future development of cable services and it is vital that RTE under the <Col N="2181" /> stewardship of its Director-General be able to play its full role in this area.</P>
    <P>There will be another development with the improvement in the quality of the cable systems being made available to the various towns, the development of a limited local television service.  An experiment is taking place at present in Cork in connection with Cork 800.  That represents another opportunity and challenge as far as RTE is concerned.  It is another development that will transform the viewing patterns that exist here.  It is a challenge which RTE must face.</P>
    <P>This then is the context in which the consultancy study on RTE has been commissioned and in which the request was put to the RTE Authority to defer its appointment of a Director General. There was no legal requirement on the Authority despite the doubts expressed by Deputy Leyden to make an appointment now given that it has clearly been envisaged that the vacancy will last for a relatively short period of time.  I firmly believe that the interests of RTE would have been much better served had the Minister's request been met, and I regret that the Authority did not do so.</P>

      <P>It was a very substantial reference, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Unfortunately, you were not here then. I have no doubt that you would have <Col N="2183" /> asked Deputy Leyden to get down to the subject and not continue along those lines.</P>
      <P>The Opposition see some threat to democracy in the postponing of the appointment of Director-General.  The selection of a Director-General of RTE, or indeed of any other State body, could hardly be seen as central to our democratic institutions, unless and, in so far as, the selection process might be seen to be unfair, or unjust, or conducted in a manner contrary to the intentions of the Act of the Oireachtas involved.  In response to the request of the Minister for Communications to the Authority that they should suspend all action in relation to the selection of a candidate for approval of the Minister as Director-General, the Authority replied that their obligations under the Broadcasting Act should take precedence over the ministerial request.  Deputy Haughey followed the Authority statement, but stated additionally that it was &ldquo;obligatory on the Authority to appoint the Director-General and to that extent the Minister was <i>ultra vires</i> in advising the Authority not to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Act which requires the Authority automatically to proceed to the process of appointing a successor to an outgoing Director-General. This right of immediacy claimed by the Authority and subsequently invested with some kind of democratic virtue by the Leader of the Opposition is quite simply an over-statement of the position and a dangerous over-statement at that. The process of appointment and timing of such appointments should take into account the Government's overall plans, at any stage, for the role of RTE in the matter of future broadcasting policy.  It is, of course, the Authority's responsibility to make recommendations about the appointment of a Director-General, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act, when such an appointment is to be made.  The Government have decided that the process should not be now and for very good reasons which I have explained tonight and the Minister <Col N="2184" /> for Communications has explained at length and which the Taoiseach explained here.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that there are major developments on the way in relation to broadcasting such as community and local radio, and that we have to consider the development of a relationship between this new broadcasting network and the present national radio networks being operated by RTE.  This is something I have already mentioned.  Structurally, it is not possible to establish local radio without considering its relationship with the existing RTE radio service.  With such development, any Minister involved would have to consider, if only to reject it, whether any change is needed in the existing inter-relationips between RTE television and sound radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the future development of Radio na Gaeltachta and its relationship, in turn, with the new independent local radio service and the existing RTE radio service.  I am glad of this opportunity to pay tribute to it for the work that it has done, but is Radio na Gaeltachta a local service, a regional one, a linguistic one or a national service? The future development of the local radio authority, and the role of its executive staff, including that of its chief executive, and the necessary relationships between the new radio authority, the existing authority and their staff are all areas that require major study.  All of these considerations are central to the future development of Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is right to say that the winds of change are blowing across the fields of Donnybrook, as they are across other fields.  The Authority are rightly protective of the RTE staff and proud of the great service which RTE have rendered the country.  Change, however, must be planned for.  The great change in local radio is an opportunity to provide a choice for the Irish listener and acknowledge the tremendous local and regional identities which exist and which require access and new forms of radio services. These can be financed from within the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> I spoke earlier of satellite developments. The prospects of satellite developments, however, raise both the prospect of enormous change in television viewing patterns and an identification of new methods of financing television and television services on satellite by direct satellite broadcasting.  We may be faced, and are very likely to be faced, for the first time with the necessity to participate with foreign agencies and financiers in the funding and distribution of satellite services.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of fundamental questions that need to be raised.  I feel that were a new Director-General to be appointed without consideration, in advance of his appointment, of such fundamental questions, then we would not be doing our duty in the public interest.</P>
    <P>This is a point which Deputy Brennan raised.  If a Director-General had been appointed now, in advance of a new Authority whose very brief would be to participate in the contemplation of change, then the prospect of such change would be prejudiced.  An incumbent in the office of Director-General in the present circumstances would most probably feel it necessary to defend the <i>status quo</i>.  It is probable that the present Authority have not looked sufficiently at the prospect for radical change in broadcasting structures.  Perhaps they are too busy with the extraordinaily big task of the day to day running of RTE.  I think that the Authority's response to the Minister for Communications letter would seem to suggest this.</P>
    <P>The Government's position is a straightforward one and also a public one.  The Government had decided in the public interest that the time is appropriate to examine all structures involved in broadcasting, with an eye to an orderly development of the future.  For the reasons stated already, it is felt that the appointment of a Director-General and the whole process involved should await the process instituted by the Government, which will allow for an inquiry by consultants into the future structures appropriate to RTE in the context of all the other developments now in prospect. <Col N="2186" /> I had the privilege of working in RTE for a prolonged period.  I worked in what might be called the exposed area of political commentary and political reporting.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister of State recalling his performance on RTE.  I do not think he convinced us with that one and particularly with his performance in the 1973 general election campaign.  I will leave that to another day.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to respect the independence of the RTE Authority in the exercise of its statutory obligation to appoint a Director-General of RTE.</P>
      <P>The spirit of this motion has been totally rejected by the Minister and by the Government.  For almost 25 years it has been the practice to accept the recommendation of the RTE Authority on the nomination of a Director-General. Under section 11 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, it is provided that &ldquo;the Authority shall from time to time appoint a person to be the chief executive officer of the Authority, and such person shall be known, and is in this Act referred to, as the Director-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appeared that the Minister accepted section 11 of the 1960 Act because, in an interview in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 4 November 1984, he indicated that it would be absolutely wrong to interfere with the Authority's right to appoint a Director-General.  The Authority proceeded in the normal way, as was their right, to make the appointment and <Col N="2188" /> engaged consultants to ensure that the most suitable person was selected for the post of Director-General.  This showed their concern and their determination to ensure that the most suitable person was appointed.  The Minister, or the Taoiseach, or some members of the Cabinet had a change of heart and decided that the appointment could not be made.  It must be remembered that during this time a vacancy had arisen in the Authority and had been filled by a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party who was very actively involved with that party and still is.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Minister had a change of heart and sent a letter to the Authority at a crucial time indicating his wish that they should not proceed with the appointment. It is important to note that this was the day before the second round of interviews took place.  On the morning the Authority were to decide on the appointment, the Minister sent them a second letter.  The facts speak for themselves. I and the general public have no doubt that these moves were politically inspired.  All we need to do is to look back at the numerous appointments to other boards made by this Government since they took office in November 1982.</P>
    <P>The arguments being put forward by the Minister and by the Taoiseach to justify these actions are laughable.  The Minister argues that his decision is the result of critical developments in the past few months during which an agreement was reached with the International Telecommunications Union to expand the frequency spectrum available to us and also because proposals for the establishment of an Irish satellite network are now moving into their final phase.  The report of the cable systems committee was received recently.  The Minister now feels this is the appropriate time to carry out a full review of the operations of RTE. This is nothing more than a smokescreen created by the Minister to take away public attention from his real reasons for interfering, that is, to ensure his man gets the position of Director-General.  These developments have been well known to <Col N="2189" /> all concerned for some time.  It is interesting that the Minister feels it is necessary to appoint consultants to investigate these matters.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Minister has decided to appoint consultants to investigate the operations of RTE.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies decided to engage consultants.  I presume the Minister was aware of that.  Does he now intend to withdraw those consultants and treat this committee with the contempt with which he has treated them in the past? That was very obvious in his handling of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited. That is not a very fair response to the hard work and efforts of the Members of the Dáil and Seanad who sit on this committee.  We have been advocating giving more work to these committees for quite some time.  It amazes me that these committees are treated with such contempt. They are doing the job they were appointed to do.</P>
    <P>At the moment we have three teams of consultants &mdash; the consultants engaged by the Minister, the consultants engaged by the committee and the consultants employed to help to choose a new Director-General. Would the public thank us for engaging three teams of consultants to look into the affairs of RTE?  Is this the way public money should be spent? This is a real example of political interference and it must be the most blatant example of political interference in the history of RTE.</P>
    <P>This is a deliberate attempt to take control of RTE.  In the process the Government are causing grave damage to the independence of our broadcasting system.  They are interfering with an institution which was set up to protect our democracy.  In the Minister's remarks last week there was an implication that there is political influence in RTE at present. This is an outrageous implication since it appears to the public that the Minister wants his own man appointed to the position of Director-General and also wants complete control over the RTE Authority. The RTE Authority have been <Col N="2190" /> carrying out their clear statutory obligation in appointing the most suitable person as Director-General under section 11 of the 1960 Broadcasting Authority Act.</P>
    <P>In the Government's gospel <i>Building on Reality</i> there is no reference to proposed developments in RTE in relation to staff or financial targets.  RTE have reduced their staff from 2,367 in 1980 to 2,246 in 1983.  The overall turnover in RTE is now £62 million compared with £33 million in 1979.  RTE have been subjected to many investigations and reports over the years &mdash; for example, by the Broadcasting Review Group, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies in 1981 and recently we had the appointment of consultants.  It is very dangerous to leave RTE without a permanent Director-General for six months perhaps.  This will lead to dissatisfaction and will be a cause of unrest and a lack of direction within RTE.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the publication of the long awaited local radio Bill which has been promised in every Dáil session since 1983.  We are only too well aware of the disagreements which exist between Fine Gael and Labour in relation to this Bill. Recently that was very evident.  Does the appointment of this new team of consultants and the fact that the Director-General will not appointed for quite some time mean that the Bill will not be published for several months?  I should like an answer to that question.  Does it mean that local radio stations who hope to get a licence will be left hanging about indefinitely?</P>
    <P>In my own county there is a very popular local radio station known as Kilkenny Community Radio.  Over the years they have been giving an effective and an efficient service, but they are left hanging about having been promised on numerous occasions by their public representatives and Cabinet visitors to Kilkenny that they would get a licence within the next couple of months.  It is two years since they were first promised that, and they are still waiting for the Government to make up their minds.  This is further proof that it will be several, if not 12 <Col N="2191" /> months before the Local Radio Bill will even be published.</P>
    <P>This is a smokescreen created by the Minister for no other reason than the appointment of his man as Director-General of RTE.  RTE will be 25 years old next year.  Their achievements in that time are ones of which we can all be justly proud.  They have maintained a high standard in their presentation of news, information and features relating to matters of public controversy and debate.  I might compliment the Minister on his participation in the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team. Although on occasion he allowed his political bias to infiltrate generally he did a good job, as did many others of his colleagues in RTE.  It is unfortunate that this situation should have been allowed to develop particularly when we have a Minister of State who was a member of the RTE staff.</P>
    <P>RTE have been guided throughout the years by various chairmen and directors-general of great distinction, none of whom could ever honestly be accused of political bias.  Likewise successive Governments of the day did not interfere in the running of the station or with the Authority.  In my opinion the present Chairman maintained that fine tradition in resisting intervention on the part of the present Minister.  Therefore it is all the more regrettable and disappointing that this Minister and Government found it necessary to break with that fine tradition, using such devious methods to have their own man appointed.  I am sure the general public will see this for what it is, a hamfisted approach by this Government which will have serious repercussions for RTE, for the Members of this House and the Government for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for approximately 20 years.  In all that time I cannot recall any occasion when any Government in office interfered so blatantly in the affairs of a State body such as RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case we have the extraordinary spectacle of the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers saying one thing and doing <Col N="2192" /> the opposite.  They have been saying continuously that any appointments to State boards will be on a non-political basis, that such appointments will be made purely on candidates' ability.  The Taoiseach continues to say that, despite the abundance of evidence that there is direct and vindictive interference on the part of the Government to ensure that favoured sons only are appointed to positions of authority.  From what I have read and inquired into in this case the RTE Authority have very conscientiously carried out a series of interviews of those who offered themselves for the post.  I understand that all of those interviews were carried out meticulously in a non-political fashion, based purely on the ability of those who came before the Authority and on their suitability for the job.  But because the Government had a favoured son, Muiris MacConghail, whom they wanted appointed to this position, when they saw that their candidate, they interfered in order to prevent the appointment being made.  In the most hamfisted, amateurish, childish way they got their way.</P>
    <P>The Government have ruled because the Government wanted a political appointee of theirs to be in charge as Director General of RTE.  There was no other reason for it; there are no other grounds for such interference.  The story that the unfortunate Minister for Communications was asked to read out to us in this House last week constituted a pathetic performance on his part.  The man was made to look a fool.  He must have felt a fool because he knew his case would not withstand any examination. The child in the street could see that this was the Government wanting to get their way through subterfuge rather than be prepared to stand up and honestly admit that they did not want any of these people, that they wanted only Muiris MacConghail who has had very close associations with Coalition Governments past and present and who served as Head of the Government Information Service <Col N="2193" /> under a previous Government.  His politics are well known.  The man may have ability and suitability for this job.  But if he had the ability and suitability he would have shone at the interview and been appointed; there would have been no reason to block him.  Yet he was surpassed by some of the other candidates, when the whole appointment was called to a halt in a panic fashion by the Government. How anybody could be expected to accept the excuses of the Government to date is beyond me.  I have been a Member of this House a long time.  I have heard many accusations of political interference.  Very few of them have stood up to examination.  This warrants examination but does not stand up to it because the evidence is very clear.</P>
    <P>I understand from reading the press that a Mr. Sorahan was the person who was outstanding at the various interviews undertaken by a selection committee of the Authority and by an independent management selection company who were brought in as independent assessors. It would appear they also came to the same conclusion.  I had hardly ever heard of this Mr. Sorahan before.  Certainly he has no Fianna Fáil associations and we have no particular interest in him. In fact I understand his politics would be more towards the Labour Party than towards Fianna Fáil.  But he was not the man the Government wanted.  He was not going to get the job.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Those who were so quick to criticise Fianna Fáil in the media in the past have been very silent on this issue.  I have met press people who are now saying: why would the Government not interfere; are the Government not entitled to have their man in charge of RTE?  That is the philosophy we are getting from some media people, one to which they would never have subscribed when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Therefore, it makes one wonder.  The Taoiseach doth protest too much; nobody believes him any more. He talks about appointments being above board, that his Government make no appointments on a political basis.  How can we be expected to accept such ridiculous comment from the Taoiseach when <Col N="2194" /> we had a failed European elections candidate, Joey Murrin, who was compensated by being appointed Chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara?  Surely the Minister of State present must admit that Joey Murrin was a candidate for his party in the European elections in the Connacht/Ulster constituency and, because he did not succeed in winning that seat, equally he must admit that his appointment as Chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara constituted some kind of sop to the man, if you like, a consolation prize because of his failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not supposed to see with one eye, having the other closed. The history of this Government to date has demonstrated an absolute ruthlessness in removing anybody who does not think the same way as they do or who does not support their political parties. An Bord Pleanála were fired, the whole lot removed, although they had only recently been appointed, all of the board members, on the basis of a false allegation made continuously by the Minister for the Environment, an allegation that they had been dilatory in carrying out their duties, that they were responsible for long delays in deciding on planning appeals, none of which was true and has since been proved not to have been true. Yet that was the story fed to the press by the handlers, that was the line put out by the media.  They were too lazy to examine the situation, ascertaining whether such <Col N="2195" /> allegation was true or false.  Of course it has since been proved to have been utterly false, that they had no responsibility whatsoever for any delays that took place.  Rather had it to do with staff shortages down the line.</P>

    <P>The results of the 1984 labour force survey will become available within the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>A special age analysis of the live register is carried out quarterly, in January, April, July and October.  The results of this analysis show some 23,688 persons aged 16-20 on the live register in April 1983; the corresponding figure in October 1984 was 28,248.  Information from the analysis for January 1985 will be available shortly.  In order to receive unemployment benefit a claimant must satisfy the necessary contribution conditions; while in the case of unemployment assistance an applicant must satisfy a means test. Persons not satisfying the requirements of the regulations are effectively excluded from the live register.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the fact that persons who have been tenant-purchasers of local authority dwellings for not less than six months and who surrender possession of their dwellings to purchase a new private house may qualify for the mortgage subsidy but not the new house grant whereas in similar circumstances tenants of local <Col N="2025" /> authority dwellings may qualify for both the mortgage subsidy and the new house grant.  This has been the situation since the mortgage subsidy was introduced in April 1981.  I do not consider that the introduction of the £5,000 grant has given rise to any anomaly in the matter.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has arrears of health contributions amounting to £206.11.  This includes arrears dating back to 1977-78.  At present, farmers owe £10.5 million in health contributions. This is grossly unfair to the PRSI workers who have no option but to pay, and indefensible in the present tight budgetary situation when, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, health boards are having to effect significant reductions in expenditure to meet budgetary targets.</P>
      <P>The £100 hospital admission charge was introduced as an inducement to defaulters to pay the arrears of health contributions.  There was considerable publicity on the matter at the time in national and local newspapers and among the farmers' organisations and I would be slow to accept that the person about whom representations are now being made was not aware of the situation. There is no power in the regulations for the waiving of the charge in such a case. It is suggested that the person concerned might bring his situation to the attention of the health board and discuss appropriate payment arrangements with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension to the maternity unit at Galway Regional Hospital was completed in January 1984 at a cost of £4 million.  It was designed to alleviate overcrowding and poor treatment and out-patient facilities.  The extension consists of a new delivery suite (eight rooms), new ward accommodation for 31 beds, a neo-natal unit of 11 cots and new out-patients (OPD), admissions and administrative departments.</P>
      <P>Part of the delivery suite and part of the neo-natal unit were brought into use in mid 1983 by the Western Health Board by redeployment of staff.  However, the board sought a total of 75 additional staff at an estimated annual revenue cost of £874,000 for the unit.  I have no additional funds at my disposal to provide for the opening of this unit and the board were told that these new posts could be created only if the Board could redeploy existing posts and resources.  The board were asked to examine the possibility of opening the unit on a phased basis, having regard to their priorities.</P>
      <P>In November 1984 the Western Health Board brought the rest of the delivery suite (eight rooms in all) and the out-patients department into use by redeployment of 11.5 existing posts and resources from the fever unit and the special hospitals programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unopened portion of the unit now consists of the new ward accommodation of 31 beds and the remainder of the neo-natal cots.  The question of finding a basis <Col N="2044" /> for opening the remaining sections of the unit was raised in the course of discussions in recent weeks with the chief executive officer and his management team concerning budgetary arrangements for 1985.  It was indicated to the chief executive officer that the final move in this direction must be for the board to consider and put forward concrete proposals involving the redeployment of staff and resources to the unit to the extent that this is considered feasible.  The chief executive officer is to make a submission on this issue to the Department providing a detailed analysis of the position of current staff of all grades in the current unit and an update on data relating to births and other procedures.  The question of making a contribution from Departmental funds to enable the unit to be fully opened, will then be considered.</P>
    <P>I regret the protracted nature of these consultations with the Western Health Board on this issue.  I am confident that the matter can be resolved in the near future with the co-operation of all concerned.</P>

The Western Health Board decided that rather than build a new building for the CAT scanner they would provide a new accident and emergency department and <Col N="2045" /> accommodate the new CAT scanner in the existing Department.  The total cost of this work was £78,000.  The scanner was installed, commissioned and handed over to the Western Health Board on 1 April 1984.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board have requested seven staff at a cost of £72,100 for the scanner.  They have been told on a number of occasions that I am not in a position to make funds available to meet the cost of staffing this service.

      <P>It is a statutory condition that entitlement to pay-related benefit is determined by the amount of the claimant's reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax period governing the claim at the commencement of a period of interruption of employment.  Any two periods <Col N="2049" /> of interruption of employment not separated by a period of more than 13 weeks are treated under the legislation as one period of interruption of employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 13 November 1984 to 17 November 1984.  Although he was disqualified for receiving benefit under the trade dispute provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, the claim period nevertheless represented a period of interruption of employment within the terms of the legislation and credited contributions are awarded for the period.  He claimed unemployment benefit again on 28 January 1985 and as the date of his latter claim was within 13 weeks of the date of his initial claim, the relevant income tax period applicable to him at the commencement of his period of interruption of employment on 13 November 1984 continued to apply in accordance with statutory provisions.  Accordingly, on the basis of his reckonable earnings during the income tax period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983 the person concerned is entitled to pay-related benefit at £18.20 weekly in addition to flat rate unemployment benefit at £37.25 and combined payments are being made to him as these become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for award of widow's contributory pension under the Social Welfare Act is that, if four years or longer have elapsed since entry into insurance, there must be an average of 39 contributions (paid or credited) in either the last three or five contribution years before the husband died.  Alternatively this condition may be satisfied if there was an average of at least 24 contributions (paid or credited) since entry into insurance.  These conditions may be satisfied on the widow's or the late husband's insurance record.  These conditions were not met on either record in this case and the claim of the person concerned to widow's contributory pension has therefore been refused.  The entitlement of the person concerned to an Irish pro-rata contributory pension under EC regulations was also refused because the combined Irish and United Kingdom insurance records of the deceased also fail to meet the alternative minimum average conditions quoted above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, have, however, been requested to examine her possible entitlement to a British widow's pension under EC regulations and that Department will be in touch with her in this regard.

When these inquiries were completed the case was submitted to an appeals officer for determination.  However the appeals officer required further information about his stock and the case was returned to the social welfare officer for further investigation.  Following the <Col N="2061" /> completion of the additional inquiries the case was resubmitted to the appeals officer who also assessed him with means at £38.45 weekly.</P>
      <P>A notification of the decision in his case was issued to him on 1 February 1985.

      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £43.30 weekly the appropriate rate £79.50 less means £36.20.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed him with means of £36.20 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profit from his holding was calculated on the basis of a gross income of £5,203 per annum less £3,403 per annum by way of expenses incurred in earning that income.  Accordingly he was deemed to enjoy a profit of £1,800 per annum from his holding.  His capital amounted to <Col N="2064" /> £1,048 and was calculated in accordance with statutory provision at £84.80 per annum.  On the basis of a total income of £1,884.80 his weekly means were calculated at £36.20.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 14 August 1984.  All disability benefit payable from 17 August 1984, the fourth day of the claim, to 28 February 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate received, was issued.  She was not entitled to pay-related benefit initially as according to the records of the Department at the time, her earnings for the 1982-83 governing tax year under her married RSI number were £2,169, which were insufficient to qualify her for payment.</P>
      <P>It has now been established that she had additional earnings of £1,595 in the 1982-83 year under her single RSI number.  Her total earnings in 1982-83 of £3,764 qualify her for pay-related benefit. A cheque for £202.58, in respect of all pay-related benefit payable from 4 September 1984 to 28 February 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate received, was issued on 11 March 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a postal claimant to unemployment benefit from 1 February 1985 and flat rate unemployment benefit of £37.25 weekly was allowed from that date being the maximum rate applicable to a single man.  He has been paid all flat-rate unemployment benefit to which he is entitled to date. Following the recent completion of inquiries, it has been established that he is also entitled to pay-related benefit of £22.48 weekly from 22 February 1985.  Arrangements have been made to issue an order <Col N="2065" /> for encashment at his local post office paying all arrears of pay-related benefit due this week.

He had a total of 1,267 contributions from 1953 to 1977 and this will give him a yearly average over the relevant periods of 38 for for retirement pension at age 65 and also for old age contributory pension at age 66.  He will, therefore, have an entitlement to either pension at the rate of payment appropriate to that yearly average.  There are no contributions recorded in respect of him since 1977.

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person has sufficient earnings in the relevant income tax year.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 26 November 1984 and the relevant income tax period for pay-related benefit was from 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983.  However, as he only entered insurable employment on 19 October 1983 it was necessary to ascertain his earnings for the first 26 weeks of his employment.  He was issued with a form for this purpose to be certified by his former employer but it was incorrectly completed.

The officer hopes to call on her at her present address within a week or so and on receipt of his report a decision will be given on her claim without delay.  Meanwhile she is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>All officers of my Department are required as part of their normal duties to be on the alert for possible abuses of the social welfare system and to refer for investigation any case in which suspected irregularities come to their notice.

      <P>The person concerned is not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance as the means assessed against him £36 weekly derived from the value of board and lodgings on his uncle's holding, exceed the maximum rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to him.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed him with means at £36 weekly.  He was notified of the decision of the appeals officer on 13 February 1985.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and the case could only be reopened if the appellant furnished new facts or evidence which were not made available to the appeals officer on the date on which he made his decision.</P>

      <P>Statistics in relation to the length of time taken to arrange and process appeals on decisions of deciding officers are not maintained in the Department. Because of the increasing number of claims and appeals in practically all the Department's schemes and services there has been some disimprovement in the times taken to process applications.  The delay can vary with the case in question and appeals which are decided summarily are normally disposed of within shorter timescales than those involving oral hearings. A further factor which can be a source of delay is that before an appeals officer decides a case, he may ask for a further examination of the claim by a social welfare officer or a medical referee of the Department.</P>
      <P>During 1984 a total of 4,116 appeals, in respect of unemployment assistance, non-contributory old age pension and disability benefit were decided as follows:</P>

It may however be taken that, especially because of the high amount of manual work involved in the use of turf in the conditions obtaining in Mountjoy, the savings involved in the change to natural gas will be substantial. Staff engaged in work in connection with the boilers will be redeployed and as there is substantial overtime work in the prisons this will not, even indirectly, have led to any job loss.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if a person who is unemployed for more than 12 months and who is not in receipt of unemployment assistance will qualify for the social employment scheme; and, if not, the reason for such exclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, the social employment scheme is aimed at the large number of productive and energetic persons who have been unemployed for an extended period.</P>
      <P>In order to give effect to this objective, it was decided that applicants should be unemployed for a period of 12 months or more and be in receipt of unemployment assistance at the time of entry.  In addition, applicants have generally to be over 25 years of age.  Since about 56,500 persons meet these conditions, there is no shortage of potential participants.</P>
      <P>In deciding the conditions for eligibility, the Government were also influenced by the consideration that almost two-thirds of the gross cost of the scheme will come back to the Exchequer through savings in unemployment payments and additional tax revenue.  This consideration is referred to in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that the 12 months qualification period may consist of one continuous period where applicants were in receipt of unemployment assistance, or of a combination of periods where applicants were in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance or disability benefit, or attended training courses organised by AnCO, CERT or IMI.  Applicants at the time of entry to <Col N="2107" /> the scheme must, however, be in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
